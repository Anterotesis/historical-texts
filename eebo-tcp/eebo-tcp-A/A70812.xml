         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which alſo the 4. <hi>ver.</hi> confirmes, <hi>The Kings ſtrength alſo Loves
Judgement, Thou doſt establiſh equity; Thou executeſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Righteouſneſſe in Jacob.</hi> He hath all Authoritie in His
hand as King, and ſtrength ſufficient to doe what He pleaſes, yet He
Delights to doe Right; and to ſettle it both by His Word and His
Works; and doth continually exerciſe Himſelfe in doing Juſtice
and Right among His People particularly. Whereupon, it is againe
required that Honour be given to Him above all Others, <hi>ver. 5. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
ye the LORD our GOD, and Worſhip at His Footſtoole, for
He is Holy.</hi> Which with a Word or two altered is againe repeated
in the laſt Verſe of the Pſalme, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and made as the burden of the
Song: <hi>Exalt the LORD our God, and Worſhip at His Holy Hill, for
the LORD our GOD is Holy.</hi> Where is given us to Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that then onely we Exalt, or Praiſe, or Feare GOD aright,
When we Worſhip according to His Will, and in His owne Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
ſet out by the Phraſes of Worſhipping at His Footſtoole
(that is the Arke) and at His Holy Hill, that is, Zion, both according
to His appointment, and expreſſe charge and command. And His
Holineſſe ſtands upon this, that Men ſhould to Worſhip Him, if they
Worſhip Him at all. And of all this We have <hi>Moſes, Aaron,</hi> and
<hi>Samuel</hi> for Examples, <hi>ver. 7, 8. Moſes and Aaron were among
His Prieſts, and Samuel among them that called upon His Name.</hi>
Theſe were Great Favourites of His, and eminent in their Fidelitie,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50459:5"/>
               <hi>They called upon the LORD, and He anſwered them. He ſpake
unto them in the cloudy Pillar, they kept His Teſtimonies, and the
Law that He gave them.</hi> But yet not ſo, but they failed ſometimes
and needed forgiveneſſe, provoking Him to bring Judgements upon
them. And accordingly He did ſhew Himſelfe variouſly to them;
ſometimes in Diſpleaſure, but alwayes with Mercy. And that is it
which Our Text holds forth apparently to all our Eyes, Eares, and
Hearts. Tending, with all the reſt of the Pſalmes, to perſwade us to
Feare, and Praiſe, and Exalt, and Worſhip our Gracious and Holy
GOD aright according to His Divine Pleaſure. As we ſhall ſee by
the more diſtinct handling of it, unto which now I come.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Diviſion.</note>The Words of this Verſe have in them three remarkable parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.
1. The Behaviour of the Men it ſpeakes of, which is partly
Good, and partly evill. The former verſe ſaith, <hi>They kept GODS
Teſtimonies, and the Law that He gave them,</hi> This inſinuates (what
was alſo expreſt <hi>ver.</hi> 6.) that they uſed to <hi>Call upon GOD,</hi> All this
was very good, But withall, they did ſometimes ſome things amiſſe,
ſome inventions, by-paths, or ſteps awry they had, which as they
needed pardon, ſo they incenſed Him againſt them, ſo much now
and then, as He would not let them eſcape altogether, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>ſome vengeance</hi> for ſuch untowardneſſe. 2. GODS Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
in a double reſpect: 1. in <hi>Anſwering them,</hi> granting their
ſutes and ſupplications ordinarily. 2. in <hi>Forgiving them,</hi> pardoning
their failings and faults evermore; never dealing with them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
according to their ſinnes, but in the midſt of any offence
of theirs, or Judgement of His, remembring Mercy. 3. His Holy
Juſtice, notwithſtanding, <hi>Taking Vengeance on their inventions:</hi>
Chaſtening them for ſome faults ſometimes; and not letting them
alwayes goe unpuniſhed, how faithfull ſoever they were generally,
Or how Gracious ſoever He was eternally.<note place="margin">Explication.</note> Theſe are the maine
parts of the Text, which will afford us ſo many Doctrines clearely
and plainly after we have but a little explained the latter Clauſe of
<hi>Taking Vengeance on their inventions.</hi> Which is the only Difficulty
in the Language of the Text, and it indeed ſounds ſo ſtrangely at the
firſt hearing,<note place="margin">What is meant by taking Vengeance.</note> as I may well put this Expreſſion among the Riddles
of the Scripture. It is ſeldome found elſe-where, (if at all) when
applyed to the faithfull Servants of GOD, as it is here; and
therefore it is an Amazing Notion; and worthy to be conſidered,
for the ſenſe of it, and the reaſon why it is uſed. The Senſe of it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50459:5"/>
is not to be taken in the ordinary rigour of the phraſe,<note place="margin">Negatively.</note> as we uſe it
among men, for an act done, either according to the extremity of
the deſert of a fault, or with a mind poſſeſt with malice or hatred
againſt the oftender, or both together. For neither of theſe will
ſtand with GODS affections or actions towards His faithfull ones;
nor with the very words of the Text foregoing theſe. He who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives,
never deales according to extremity of deſert of a fault,
which deſerves deſtruction (as all our ſins doe in extremity of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,)
much leſſe doth he doe any thing with malice or hatred.
Forgiveneſſe and malice are no leſſe contradictory then light and
darkneſſe, life and death. Whatſoever therefore be meant by
<hi>taking of vengeance</hi> here, it muſt be underſtood, with miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and mixture of favour; and this favour eminent, even
notwithſtanding the vengeance taken, For ſo ſpeakes the Text
undeniably, <hi>Thou anſwereſt and forgaveſt, though thou too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
vengeance,</hi> As forgiveneſſe did not altogether hinder the
vengeance, ſo the vengeance did not diſparage the forgiveneſſe.
The meaning then may be conceived to lye in two things.<note place="margin">Affirmatively, in two things.</note> Firſt,
That whatſoever they did feele from His hand it was but according
to their deſerts, not beyond; They had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> firſt provoked Him, before
He ſtrooke them, they had offered Him ſome indignity before He
afflicted them; and when they did abuſe Him, then he did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
take ſome vengeance upon their Inventions, or their Workes
or Deeds as the word properly ſignifies. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. This Correction, was
ſomewhat ſmart and ſevere, both in their own apprehenſions that
ſuffered it, and in the eye and obſervation of any that had notice of
it: in ſo much as if one had not knowne and had aſſurance of His
Mercy to them from other grounds, His manner of dealing with
them in this particular caſe would ſeeme to them to ſavour altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of vengeance, and extremity of rigour and diſpleaſure. Now
the reaſon, why this is thus expreſt, We may conceive to be, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
to inſinuate more effectually, <hi>That GOD lookes upon ſinne
with an other eye then men doe;</hi> and that even in His Owne deareſt
ſervants, He ſees matter enough of deepe diſpleaſure which He will
let men know, and themſelves feele now and then in a quickning
and awakening manner. Terrible words are not without their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie,
ſpecially when deeds anſwer them; The proper Reaſons
and Uſes of both, We ſhall ſee anon. But this language is uſed to help
to make GODS deeds more affecting.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50459:6"/>
Withall this may well be added to cleare this phraſe from all
exception, that if we obſerve the words narrowly, a manifeſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
ſeemes to be even here, in this harſh expreſſion, from that
which is elſwhere ſpoken of GODS dealings with His Enemies,
with the wicked. It is not ſaid GOD tooke vengeance on them,
on the perſons of His faithfull ſervants, but on their inventions. He
ſhewed mercy to their perſons, (which the Text it ſelfe expreſſes)
but yet He ſhewed diſpleaſure againſt their ſins, He would not ſpare
the offence, and yet it is certaine He ſpared the offenders. But when
the ungodly are ſpoken of, there vengeance is expreſſely ſaid to be
taken on them, <hi>Deut. 32. 41. I will render vengeance to mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and</hi> verſ. 43. <hi>will render vengeance to His adverſaries,</hi> and
will be mercifull to His land, and to His people. So <hi>Ezek. 25. 14.
I will lay my vengeance on Edom.</hi> And in divers other places of
the Prophets: So in the N. T. 2 <hi>Theſ. 1. 7. Taking vengeance on
them that know not GOD, &amp;c:</hi> In all theſe the vengeance ſo falls
upon the ſinne that the ſinners themſelves are deſtroyed with the
waight of it; which never is, when GOD hath to doe with His
Owne, how ſevere ſoever He ſeeme to be in the vengeance He doth
take: As will further appeare in the proſecution of the Doctrines
afforded to us in the whole verſe,<note place="margin">3. Doctrines</note> which are plainely three.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. That even the faithfull ſervants of GOD may ſo provoke
Him, as to need His pardon, and even to give Him occaſion to take
vengeance on their practiſes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Though they doe provoke Him, and He doe thereupon take
vengeance, Yet is He ever a GOD of Grace to them, anſwering
their prayers, and affording them pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Though GOD doth anſwer the prayers and forgive the ſins of
His faithfull ones, Yet they may ſo provoke Him, as He ſometimes
takes vengeance on their miſdoings.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. In the ſame Chapter, we find him to have neglected the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
of his ſonne, the reaſon is not expreſt, (perhaps it was
becauſe he was loath to diſpleaſe his wife <hi>Zipporah;</hi> who was a

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. In the fifth Chapter, he doth in a manner expoſtulate with
GOD in a kind of diſcontent and diſtruſt, as though GOD had not
done well in ſending him to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who tooke occaſion by that to
oppreſſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> the more; and no deliverance likely to come:

of the people, who murmured againſt him at every turne; he would
be out of his life, and prayes to GOD even to take his life away, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

then any that hath been yet named: his great failing, and for
which GOD was moſt highly diſpleaſed with him above all other
times, is recorded, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. The people murmured for water, and
GOD bids <hi>Moſes</hi> take the <hi>rod and ſpeake to the rock</hi> and it ſhould
give forth water. <hi>Moſes</hi> goes with <hi>the rodde,</hi> but inſtead of <hi>ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

to the rock, he <hi>ſtrikes</hi> the rock, and that twice, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. And this
GOD takes ſo hainouſly, that He charges him with not ſanctifying
Him before the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and not beleeving Him, and that
therefore he ſhould not goe into the promiſed Land. So that here
is a three-fold fault noted in <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the ſtory (written by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe)
and in the <hi>Pſalme.</hi> 1. Some <hi>unbeliefe,</hi> and diſtruſting that
ſpeaking to the rock would not ſuffice to fetch water thence, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
GODS Word. 2. Some <hi>impatience</hi> of ſpirit, againſt
the peoples untoward murmurings, <hi>His ſpirit was provoked by
them,</hi> more and otherwiſe then it ſhould have been. 3. This expreſt,
by unfitting and <hi>unadviſed speech,</hi> the ſtory ſaith, he call'd them
<hi>Rebels,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Muſt we fetch you water, &amp;c.</hi> which language
though they well enough deſerved (and worſe) yet it appeared GOD
was not pleaſed with it in <hi>Moſes.</hi> And ſo you have the account of
his faults, as the Scripture regiſters them.</p>
            <p>Then for <hi>Aaron,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Aarons</hi> fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings three.</note> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. This we find in him throughout, that what
is noted of him, is being a ſecond in evill, an <hi>acceſſary,</hi> conſenter and
actor with others, but never alone in any remarkeable fault. But
particularly three ſpeciall failings are recorded of him, 1. <hi>Exod.</hi>
32 1, 4. there is a very great fault, that at the peoples ſollicitation
and importunity, he made them an <hi>Idol, a Golden Calfe,</hi> and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with them in the honouring of it: for which GOD was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<hi>angry with him to have deſtroyed him; but that</hi> Moſes <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded
for him, Deut.</hi> 9. 20. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A ſecond is, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. Where he
joynes with his ſiſter <hi>Miriam,</hi> (who is firſt named and noted, <hi>ver.</hi>

ſpeake againſt his own brother ſo, whom he ſaw GOD had ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured

been a meanes to ſave him from GODS wrath by his prayers. And
yet by his ſiſter is he drawne away and become a partner with her
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50459:7"/>
in this unnaturall Mutiny. And for this GOD is againe angry with
him, though he layed then no puniſhment upon his Perſon, yet <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
confeſſes himſelfe ſtricken in the leproſie ſuddenly inflicted for
this upon <hi>Miriam,</hi> ver. 10. and 11. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> His third fault was in conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Diſtruſt (and Paſſion) in that 20. of <hi>Numb.</hi> The
Charge was given to both together;<note place="margin">GODS diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure for their offences.</note> and GOD blames and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
them both; and accordingly ſoone after took Vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Aarons</hi> offence, and he dies before the end of that Chapter, as
He did after upon <hi>Moſes</hi> his, Of which we have divers <hi>Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dums</hi>
afterwards, ſhewing the more GODS diſpleaſure againſt him
for this Tranſgreſsion; and of this ſpecially, the Text we have in
hand ſpeakes. This GOD remembers <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. 12, 13, 14. And
<hi>Moſes</hi> afterward ſpeakes of it with ſorrow, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 37. and againe,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 3. 23, &amp;c. where he tels the people how he made a ſolemne
ſute of it, and prayed earneſtly to GOD that He would ſpare him,
and ſhew him that favour, that he might goe into the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;
and that GOD would not grant his ſute, and forbids him to
mention it any more to Him, <hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27. and once more <hi>Moſes</hi>
ſpeakes to Iſrael of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 21, 22. as ſhewing how neere it was
to him, and how great a Judgement he tooke it to be. And ſo we ſee
GODS taking Vengeance upon his inventions alſo, as well as upon
<hi>Aarons,</hi> and the Text verified of two of thoſe it ſpeakes of.</p>
            <p>We have a third to looke after, whom we muſt not forget, and
that is <hi>Samuel,</hi>

was growne old, he was partiall towards his children, he made his
Sons Judges over Iſrael, and they walked not in his wayes, but tooke
bribes and perverted Juſtice; and it appeares by the ſequele that
<hi>Samuel</hi> was too indulgent and favourable to them; and therefore
the people tooke ſuch a diſcontent, that they would not have his
Sons nor himſelfe neither, rule any more over them, but would needs
have a King to rule over them; and, though this was ill done of the

all that they have done againſt Him, and ſo againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or that He hath done againſt them. This is the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between GOD and Men, that men oft times, when others
ſue to them, find things in ſo ill a condition, partly through the
fault of thoſe that now ſue for their favour, and partly through their
own raſhneſſe or ſeverity, that they know not how to help them,
nor which way to make them any amends for any thing they have
made them to ſuffer. As the <hi>Iſraelites, Judg.</hi> 21. would willingly
have done more for <hi>Benjamin,</hi> againſt whom they had been ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly
cruell; But they knew not how to doe it, they had no
power to recompence their own exceſſive ſeverity, upon the <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jimites</hi>

never powers out ſo much wrath upon any of His ſervants (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
He doe upon His enemies in concluſion.) But He hath ſtill in
His hand to make them amends. Even though He take away their
lives: He hath ſo much good to beſtow upon them, as He may ſtill
be ſaid to forgive them, He hath a better life for them; an Eternall
life, of perfect Happineſſe. And in the meane time, witneſſe <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
and <hi>Job,</hi> and many others of His Saints, They are never ſo
low nor ſo afflicted in this world, but He hath power enough
to raiſe them up againe to comfort and honour. And therefore
He doth certainly afford them anſwer of Grace to all their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
prayers.</p>
            <p>3. He doth alſo forgive them without faile; <hi>becauſe He hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

His Juſtice. For Chriſt hath made that ſatisfaction, <hi>He is ous

GOD corrects any of thoſe that are in Chriſt, yet He pardons
them. <hi>The Lord hath chaſtened me ſore,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi>

GODS graciouſneſſe, and forgiving the iniquities of His ſervants;
that, when otherwiſe they would be hardned in their ſins which
would turne to their deſtruction, if not remedied, that He <hi>corrects</hi>

ſurely we have all cauſe to be humbled in each one of theſe reſpects
ſeverally, and much more of all of them together, and this will be
a neceſſary and profitable foundation for the other two Uſes which
are to follow. We call this day a day of Humiliation, GOD
grant it may prove ſo in His eye and eſteeme: But the truth is, I
feare our dayes of Humiliation, are not reckoned by GOD to be
ſuch; and that He may put that queſtion to many of us, and poſe us
with it; with which He checkes the <hi>Jewes,</hi> Zach. 7. 5. <hi>When you
faſted and mourned</hi> (ſo long and ſo often as you have done) <hi>did
you at all fast unto me! even unto me!</hi> We come indeed and give
attendance upon GOD outwardly; and <hi>we ſit</hi> (and ſtand, and kneele)
<hi>before Him, as His people,</hi> (as the Prophets phraſe is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.)
But GOD that ſearches the hearts,<note place="margin">Of which there is but little ſigne uſually before or after the publike Servic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s</note>
               <hi>and will be worſhipped in ſpirſt
and in truth,</hi> can tell how untowardly men come, and ſees much
untowardneſſe (I am afraid) in very many of us, even in our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemneſt
Humiliations, and ſaddeſt expreſſions of it. And if we our
ſelves may judge by the conſideration how men carry themſelves
immediately <hi>before,</hi> and immediately <hi>after,</hi> we have little ground
to beleeve, there is any great <hi>Humiliation</hi> in mens hearts when
they ſeeme to be <hi>moſt abaſed</hi> before GOD. The day before, <hi>or even
the morning before,</hi> who makes ſo much as any ſhew by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
that his thoughts are ſetling toward the humbling of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?
when women dare come hither with their <hi>bare breaſts,</hi> and
<hi>spotted faces,</hi> and <hi>gariſh apparell,</hi> is not this as it were to outface
GOD? and tell Him they meane nothing leſſe then to be humbled
in heart before Him? while people ſitting here, before the publike
Services begin, and in the ſpaces between, ſhew pleaſantneſſe in
their looks, and their words ſavour of nothing but worldly matters;
and as ſoone as they are gone hence, what ever they have heard or
made ſhew of <hi>in publike,</hi> their language <hi>at home,</hi> and all their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,
even <hi>the ſame night,</hi> and much more <hi>next morning,</hi> have no
tincture of any ſuch thing as affliction of ſpirit; what can we
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50459:15"/>
beleeve, but that they doe not ſo much as (that which the Prophet
mentions and rejects, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.) <hi>Afflict themſelves for a day, and
bow downe their heads like bull-ruſhes.</hi> For with them it is but a
few houres, and not a whole day, and when they are over, then they
are as jolly againe, and hold their heads as high as they did before,
and all their pretended Humiliation is gone and forgotten, and not
a ſhaddow of it remaining. Beloved if we doe thus, we may pleaſe
our ſelves with calling this <hi>a day of Faſt and Humiliation,</hi> but I
am ſure there is little Humiliation in that ſoule that behaveth it ſelfe
after this manner.</p>
            <p>There was a happy and <hi>pious Exhortation to Humiliation</hi> ſet
forth ſome Moneths agoe by the Authority of the Parliament; I
could heartily wiſh it might be enjoyned to be read every where
<hi>every Faſt-day,</hi> in the beginning of the day; and that to this were
added a Charge, <hi>that one of the Sermons at leaſt in every Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n,
might be expreſly made to move to Humiliation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi>
for I muſt needs profeſſe, that I much feare that the
greateſt part, even in the greateſt and beſt Congregations, can ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſtruct themſelves ſufficiently in the buſineſſe of ſuch a day,
Therefore,<note place="margin">To remedy which a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in one of the Sermons would be greatly profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> if when we come to humble our ſelves, there were not
only <hi>ſolemne Confeſſion of ſinnes</hi> by the Miniſters, but ſome earneſt
and <hi>vehement Exhortation to mourne for the ſinnes</hi> confeſſed and
to be confeſt, this might perhaps faſten ſome better thoughts in the
minds of moſt men, then now, I doubt, doe ever ſo much as come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſſe
their minds. For, though we call the buſineſſe of ſuch a day,
<hi>Prayer and Faſting,</hi> yet I verily believe, the moſt of men doe
much more mind the <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Exhortations,</hi> then they doe
<hi>the Prayers;</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. B.</note> and mens very countenances declare it, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
to any one that doth but caſt his eye upon them: Some
are plainly gazing up and downe; and others put themſelves into
ſuch a <hi>posture,</hi> as if they be not <hi>extraordinarily zealous,</hi> muſt needs
diſpoſe them much <hi>to fall aſleep,</hi> they could not doe otherwiſe;
But if they be attentive at all, they make ſome ſhew of it during the
Sermon: and therefore, if ſome ſerious thoughts of Humiliation
were offered to them in the Sermon each day, it might put every
ones ſpirit into a much better frame then now uſually they are in.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore endeavour this a little: And, though <hi>our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
have not been <hi>ſo miraculous,</hi> as thoſe the Text ſpeakes of in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50459:16"/>
anſwering, yet I am ſure <hi>our pardons</hi> are to be acknowledged <hi>very
admirable:</hi> conſidering that the ſins of every one of us may be
found upon a carefull inquiry, <hi>to be worſe then theirs</hi> who are poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at in the Text; <hi>our</hi> evill hearts have found out <hi>worſe inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and the <hi>vengeance</hi> that GOD hath taken <hi>upon thoſe inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
hath, at leaſt in our conceit, been terrible enough; all which
require us to be greatly humbled for our offences this day.<note place="margin">Three ſorts of ſins to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for.</note> To which
purpoſe, let me chiefly touch upon three things. 1. Some <hi>Perſonall</hi>
ſins, that we may be remembred of. 2. Some <hi>Nationall</hi> ſins.
3. How farre <hi>any of us</hi> may be charged with being <hi>guilty</hi> of theſe

            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1 Perſonall, namely againſt our Covenant in generall.</note> For our <hi>Perſonall</hi> ſins, I would wiſh all but to remember,
generally, our <hi>Covenant,</hi> and enquire about breaches of that; and
particularly, to ſee whether we are not guilty of ſuch kind of ſins as
we have noted before in any of the perſons whom the Text ſpeakes
of. When we entred into our ſolemne Nationall Covenant, we
even in it publikely profeſſed that we had a ſerious apprehenſion of
our own ſins and the ſins of the Nation calling for GODS wrath
againſt us; and there is mention made of ſome ſpeciall ſins, <hi>as that
we have not as we ought, valued the ineſtimable jewell of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
that we have not laboured for the purity and power thereof;
that we have not endeavoured to receive Chriſt in our hearts, nor
to walke worthy of Him in our lives:</hi> and we there alſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
many things, which I am afraid we have much forgotten: and
I am perſwaded <hi>that there are many,</hi>
               <note place="margin">N. B.</note> 
               <hi>that never ſo much as read
it over once ſince they tooke it,</hi> ſo little regard have they of it; and
that they cannot name ſo much as <hi>any one ſinne</hi> that they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,
or <hi>one duty</hi> that they have performed the more for their
<hi>Covenants</hi> ſake: And if this be true, have not ſuch great cauſe to
be humbled, and to be afraid leaſt GOD take vengeance upon their
breach of Covenant? And indeed how few of us, if we view our
faces but in that glaſſe of our Covenant, can chuſe but be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and afraid of our not having been true to it and ſtedfaſt in it as
we ſhould have been?</p>
            <p>But let me inſtance rather in thoſe kinds of ſins,<note place="margin">Specially for like ſinnes to theſe pointed at in the Text.</note> that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies

I know not why he did ſo, unleſſe it were to pleaſe his wife; (for

GOD for His receiving them as His ſo long agoe in that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
is it not unhappily puniſht in more then a few,<note place="margin">neglected.</note> with their
calling in queſtion, whether children ſhould be ſo dedicated to
GOD, and partake of that Seale of His Covenant? and ſo becauſe
they have themſelves abuſed GODS goodneſſe to themſelves, they
come to deny their own and others children to have any right to
that pledge of His goodneſſe; and ſo make amends for one ſin with

Yet are they not very many times overcome with the <hi>Importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

much more, if thoſe that are our neere and deare friends, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
being themſelves godly, prove to be Tempters to us any way,
and give us ill example; how ſeldome doe we ſtand out againſt ſuch

goes thus, and they will have it ſo and ſo? or that ſuch and
ſuch thinke or ſpeake ſo as well as we, and gave us the example be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ventured upon it? But GOD by His dealings with <hi>Aaron</hi>
for theſe failings, would humble us for ours in like kind, and make
us know, that this will not ſtand for an excuſe with Him; and
that if we follow others Sollicitations or practiſes in evill, GOD
at His pleaſure may make us lead the way to them in Correction,

of their Miſcarriages:</hi> So are we not much and often too blame in
this kind? how partiall are we to thoſe that are our own? How doth
our affection oft commend them to places of Imployment and
Truſt, beyond their abilities or merit? And afterward, how ill
can we endure to have any complaint againſt them, when yet there
is all the reaſon in the world to complaine? Even when we our

<hi>if it prove to be a child or a kinſman, a friend or even but a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant?</hi>
Doe we not often take it very hainouſly, that men ſhould
find any fault with ſuch? and if we be Innocent our ſelves (as
<hi>Samuel</hi> was in his perſonall Iudicature altogether) doe we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
(as he ſeemes to ſpeake ſomewhat that way, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 2.)
That <hi>our vertue</hi> ſhould beare out <hi>their vice.</hi> But this GOD will
have us know to be <hi>a miſerable deluſion;</hi> and that He will take it
<hi>the more hainouſly</hi> at their hands that are ſo <hi>badd,</hi> when we give
them <hi>better example;</hi> and at <hi>ours too,</hi> in fine, <hi>if we let them alone;</hi>
and doe not improve our vertue to correct their vice: For then
<hi>their</hi> vice in the <hi>practiſe</hi> will prove <hi>ours</hi> in the <hi>connivence;</hi> and
they and we together may be made to ſmart for it; as it was in
<hi>Samuels</hi> caſe; but ſpecially in <hi>Elies</hi> in the firſt chapter of that

conſider our wayes and humble our ſelves before GOD for
any of theſe evils that may be found in us perſonally, or for any

other, for which our conſciences uſe to flye in our faces in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect:

of this alſo, both in reference to the publike judgements and

ſupplications <hi>for the Nation.</hi> Otherwiſe in both, we take GODS

be not <hi>humbled for the ſinnes</hi> of the Nation, generally in thoſe
manifeſt particulars which we our ſelves are not <hi>ignorant</hi> of; or of
which at leaſt, <hi>there is a cry,</hi> by ſuch as are concerned in them, or
obſervant of them.<note place="margin">Of three ſorts.</note> Theſe let me ſet before you <hi>in a three-fold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</hi>
1. Relating to <hi>the better party</hi> among us. 2. To the
<hi>generality of people</hi> in City and Country, every where. 3. To our
<hi>Armies,</hi> which maintaine our Cauſe, and the cauſe of Religion, and
our Lawes and Liberties, and all that is deare to us.</p>
            <p>Of the firſt ſort,<note place="margin">1. The ſins of thoſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be faithfull.</note> I am the more occaſioned to ſpeake, becauſe our
Text points at the ſinnes <hi>even of faithfull men,</hi> as we have often
ſaid: and therefore we may well think upon the ſins, of ſuch <hi>as would
ſeeme to be faithfull.</hi> And there is yet a further conſideration that
may move us to lay them ſadly to heart, namely, That 1. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſome now adayes preach and proclaime, <hi>that it is only for the
ſinnes of thoſe that are notoriouſly prophane, drunkards, ſwearers,
&amp;c. and not for ſinnes of beleevers and juſtified perſons, that
GODS judgements are upon the Land:</hi> Yet the word of GOD
makes it evident, that it is otherwiſe,<note place="margin">Neceſſitie of this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> 
               <hi>and that the ſinnes of thoſe
that are GODS people by more ſpeciall profeſſion,</hi> (and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
even of His moſt faithfull ſervants, As <hi>Davids</hi> numbring
the people, and <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> pride and vaine-glory undeniably) <hi>have
eſpeciall influence to bring Nationall judgements.</hi> 2. And we have
very great cauſe to judge ſo at this time; and to be humbled in a
ſpeciall manner in that regard. For if we conſider that the ſtroke of
GODS diſpleaſure lights <hi>not only upon our enemies,</hi> the enemies of

We muſt needs acknowledge (unleſſe we will diſparage at once,
both GODS Mercy and His Juſtice too) that not only the enemies
and the prophane ſort have provoked Him <hi>with their inventions:</hi>
But even thoſe that have given up their Names to Him in a peculiar
manner have given Him juſt occaſion <hi>to take vengeance on their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
too,</hi> and to puniſh all ſorts, one with another, and one by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
It could not elſe be, that GOD ſhould <hi>ſo long and ſo much</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<hi>to be angry with His people that prayes;</hi> to overlook <hi>ſo much</hi>
ſo many ſolemne <hi>Faſts</hi> and ſeekings of Him; to regard <hi>no more</hi> ſuch

are moſt hopefull to take this to heart, and to helpe (conſequently)

a great deale of griefe of heart, that to my eye and obſervation,

extreme <hi>cenſoriouſneſſe,</hi> and a ſpirit of <hi>bitterneſſe,</hi> in very many
ſeeming good, againſt all thoſe that agree not with them in every

how much ſoever they evidence of vertue and piety in other
reſpects? <hi>Certainly this is not according to the word of Chriſt:</hi>
Nor are theſe behaviours becomming a people that deſire to Honour
<hi>that Royall Name by which they are called.</hi> And therefore theſe
call for <hi>speciall Humiliation</hi> at our hands. In concluſion this I
am forced to ſay, with the great griefe of my ſoule, that ſo farre as
I am able to judge by all that I ſee and heare where ever I come,
<hi>The Religion and devotion of a great many even of thoſe who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
gave better hopes of their being ſincere, doth now empty it
ſelfe, into formalities, ſolemne Faſts and ſpeaking for the publike
Cauſe, and withall being violent for their own opinions and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50459:20"/>
intereſts and thoſe that maintaine them with them.</hi> But withall
this I muſt needs adde, <hi>that the more any of us is convinced,</hi> that
this is true, the <hi>more cauſe</hi> have we, and all that truly feare GOD
to be <hi>humbled</hi> before Him for theſe generall evils, of the Religious
part of our Nation; and <hi>the more cauſe to be afraid,</hi> that we are
not ſo neare a deliverance, as we ſometimes would gladly thinke:
But rather to be perſwaded that before GOD will deliver us, He
will put us into another frame and temper of ſpirit, then we are now
in, that He will marre our <hi>pride,</hi> and tame our <hi>wildneſſe,</hi> and curbe
us in our purſutes of <hi>ſelfe-respects,</hi> quell our <hi>ſcandalous</hi> behaviours,
and (as He promiſes more then once by His Prophets) <hi>give us
one heart and one way;</hi> All which as yet, after all warnings and
ſhewes of humiliations, and blowes, and favours, we ſeeme very farre
from; and therefore ſtill it is fit to call us to ſad humiliation for
theſe provocations, in the firſt place.</p>
            <p>The ſecond conſideration of <hi>Nationall</hi> ſins,<note place="margin">2 The ſins of the generality.</note> referres to the <hi>body
of the Nation.</hi> Of whoſe ſins I will not now take upon me to give
you a large catalogue. But they generally empty themſelves into

               <hi>Covetouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſſe.</hi>
Of the firſt, I confeſſe I can never thinke ſeriouſly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
trembling and ſcarce with any patience, <hi>that no more is done
any where to diſpell that horrid mist of darkneſſe</hi> that covers the
faces and hearts of very many thouſands in theſe dayes of light:
while in the meane time, <hi>they themſelves, ſcorne and hate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
ſpecially becauſe <hi>they ſee they may be let alone in it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Covetouſneſſe.</note> For the
ſecond, It is apparantly the ſinne of the Country; and of the City
too, and the generall ſin, that at leaſt all men well nigh are accuſed
of <hi>and cried out upon for.</hi> And apparantly in the moſt there is too
much reaſon <hi>for ſuch a cry.</hi> Goe but into any place, and what is
the great buſineſſe that you find every one almoſt ſet upon? ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to be a <hi>gainer</hi> even by <hi>others loſſes,</hi> at leaſt to <hi>eaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</hi>

               <note place="margin">3. Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> 3. And this falls into the conſideration
alſo of <hi>their Prophaneneſſe,</hi> which is moſt notorious every where.
Formerly, even in the ill times, a conſcionable Miniſter in ſome
places could doe ſomewhat toward the bringing his people to
knowledge, who now <hi>wholly cast off the yoake,</hi> (becauſe there is
no Government neither Eccleſiaſticall nor Civill, that they think
will at all meddle with them how refractory ſoever they be,) and
grow more brutiſh and barbarous, every day then other. And now
above all former times, <hi>whoredome</hi> and <hi>adultery,</hi> doe fearfully
abound and grow impudent; even <hi>Incest</hi> is to be found in divers
places, and no puniſhment to be found for it. What ſhould I ſpeake
of <hi>Oathes,</hi> Curſings and <hi>Blasphemies?</hi> which are notoriouſly
known to be moſt riſe among all ſorts, old and young, <hi>even children
not excepted,</hi> that with their firſt language, have learned this <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of Hell,</hi> and never forget it all their lives long. In a word,
what outrage of wickedneſſe is there that we have not juſt cauſe to
beleeve to be too ordinary among our people? In this common
lawleſſeneſſe and licentiouſneſſe of the times, how few are
there, that are not altogether unbridled in their luſts, and audacious
in their profaneneſſe?<note place="margin">N. B.</note> They that were wont to make great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes
againſt <hi>thoſe hungry ſoules,</hi> that went abroad to other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to ſeek their ſpirituall food, when they had not <hi>ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion</hi>
at home; are now themſelves become runners away from their
own Pariſhes if there be a faithfull conſcionable Miniſter there, that
they may goe to one that is Malignant, ſuperſtitious or ſcandalous,
(or all this) or under pretence of going abroad, <hi>and taking their
liberty,</hi> (as others doe) they altogether ſtay at home, as ſpecially
they doe upon the <hi>Faſt-dayes,</hi> and are not aſhamed or afraid to be
known to be at work; Or elſe goe and ſpend their time in <hi>Tavernes</hi>
or <hi>Alehouſes,</hi> or <hi>other places of lewdneſſe;</hi> as it were in contempt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50459:21"/>
of GOD, and of all His Judgements, as well as His Ordinances.
And this is <hi>the wofull account</hi> that a generall ſurvey of the general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of our people can bring in to a conſcientious inquirer after their
ſpirituall condition.<note place="margin">

<hi>waite for GOD in the way of His Judgements,</hi> and are better'd by
His chaſtiſements that now lye upon us: But yet the corruption
of all ſorts is a thing, that we all uſe to complaine of by fitts, and
is ſo notoriouſly apparant that we cannot deny with any conſcience,
but that the evils upon the Nation are <hi>moſt righteouſly inflicted by
GOD,</hi> as a juſt <hi>vengeance taken on</hi> the manifold evill <hi>inventions</hi>
that provoke Him throughout the Nation. And this ſtill addes
to the neceſſity of our <hi>humiliation</hi> before Him, and <hi>under His migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p>3.<note place="margin">3 The ſins of our Armies.</note> Thirdly, We have yet the conſideration of our Armies to be

in <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Faſting,</hi> (and ſo in <hi>humiliation,</hi> at leaſt in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence)
is ſpecially to obtaine a Bleſſing upon that Army which is
Commanded by his <hi>Excellency</hi> our Noble <hi>Lord Generall.</hi> This is
well. But if we meane to get good by it; to prevaile with GOD
for them, and in them for our ſelves, we muſt lament and be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for <hi>their ſins</hi> as well as <hi>our own;</hi> and ſo for the ſins of out
other Armies. Obſerve the Records of GODS Providence in His
Sacred Word, the <hi>Epitomie</hi> of all His Providence throughout all
ages,<note place="margin">N. B.</note> and you ever ſhall find, <hi>That where there was no ſpeciall ſin in

either before hand, or ſhortly after the mention of the defeate, the
ſinne that ſo provoked GOD to take vengeance.</hi> Therefore as we
<hi>feare</hi> any overthrow, and <hi>pray</hi> againſt it, we muſt acknowledge
both our own ſins, and theirs who are engaged to fight for us. And
if we conſider the matter rightly, It is a fearfull thing, that among
thoſe, who profeſſe to maintaine the common Cauſe of the Nation,
there ſhould be <hi>ſuch quarrels</hi> and diſſentions, ſuch emulations and
heart-burnings, <hi>as if men ſought nothing but themſelves,</hi> their own
Honours and advantages; that they that fight for the Liberties of

though with variety of inſtance, and enlargement of the application.
The people there flatter'd themſelves with a conceit that GOD

them with an appeale to their own conſciences firſt, and then
with a peremptory threatning of the contrary, <hi>ver. 25, 26, 27. You
eate with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your Idols and

<hi>our owne Kingdome</hi> and Nation? And if we ſadly conſider
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50459:23"/>
how GOD did not ſpare thoſe faithfull men, the Text points at,
did not let faithfull <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron the Saints of the LORD,
live to ſee the happineſſe of His people</hi> inheriting the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,

<hi>we live to ſee</hi> (and helpe to procure) <hi>our own hearts,</hi> and <hi>lives,</hi>

Oh that we could <hi>lament</hi> for theſe things this day, and be poſſeſt

<hi>Weepe for your ſelves and for your children, for if theſe things be

though we have ſome faithfulneſſe; and if GOD, be <hi>ſo Gracious;</hi>
and yet <hi>ſo ſevere</hi> toward His faithfull ones; of all which our own
and our Nations experience at this day, hath forced us to this dayes
outward humiliation, and calls us to be deeply humbled in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſpirits both this day and hereafter: Then certainely <hi>we are
all to be moſt earneſtly exhorted, to be more watchfull and reſolute

faithfull with Him.</hi> Some <hi>vigilancy</hi> and ſome <hi>reſolution</hi> all the
faithfull ſervants of GOD have, to keep themſelves from thoſe
wayes and practiſes which diſpleaſe GOD and would provoke Him

ſhould be; and ſometimes when we are not ignorant or forgetfull
altogether, yet we are tranſported with ſinfull diſtempers, whereby
we offend GOD and draw downe His Judgements. As therefore
we are <hi>apprehenſive of our own ſinfull corruptions</hi> inclining us to

and anſwered, and even pardoned us many a time, forgiven many
a ſinfull invention of ours; and as <hi>we dread</hi> His ſevere correction,
the vengeance that may light upon our untowardneſſe: As we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

GOD hath deſerved it at our hands, and He will doe againe: And
if we will not regard it, we ſhall be made weary of the contrary.
Let me therefore purſue this Exhortation unto ſome ſpeciall Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
In which I may be (I hope) a little bolder then might
perhaps ſeeme fit in the former Uſe. If we be wanting but in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
Exhortation is not only neceſſary, but the leaſt that can be, in
the totall ſilence whereof, (beſides the ſinne of it,) there is no
ground of hopes of amendment. And if we be already forward,
we ſhall yet be the better, if the wiſe man have any skill in reaſon

we ought all to remember this day, namely, Our Solemne
Covenant, <hi>our Nationall Covenant,</hi> wherein ſpecially we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
both to GOD and to His people, even to three Nations, to
expreſſe our faithfulneſſe both in generall and in maine particulars;
which doubtleſſe it well remembred and effectually applied to our

to us, and of <hi>prejudice</hi> and miſchiefe <hi>otherwiſe.</hi> You had many
excellent remembrances in the morning, Give me leave to adde a

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50459:24"/>
might be conſtantly read (and commented upon, I meane
the matter of it) every Faſt day; So let me now make an other

every ſuch day.</hi>

been little pondered by the moſt of us ſince we have taken it. And
undoubtedly <hi>the great buſineſſe aimed at in every rightly obſerved
Faſt, is the renewing of a Solemne Covenant with GOD,</hi> It is a
duty altogether indiſpenſible. And unto this Covenant we have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great bonds lying upon us to tye us moſt ſtrictly. <hi>We lifted up
our hands to GOD in it,</hi> in the day of our calamity, in the time of
our feare and trouble, when we were <hi>very low.</hi> And ſince that
time GOD hath raiſed us up <hi>very high;</hi> in compariſon of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
then, and afforded us a great deale of helpe, from men, and
from Himſelfe; and it containes both the generall of all our duties
to GOD and man, and very maine and moſt neceſſary particulars,
juſtly and wiſely limited. We may then aſſure our ſelves, <hi>that
GOD will require it,</hi> (in whole and in part) <hi>at all our hands.</hi>
And we cannot think leſſe in reaſon and Religion, then that <hi>this is
one of the cauſes why the warre continues,</hi> to fulfill the threatning,
Lev. 26. 21, <hi>I will ſend a ſward among you, to avenge the quarrell
of my Covenant?</hi> I doe not forget that the ſword was unſheathed
and raging among us, before <hi>this Covenant</hi> was entred into. But
I muſt needs beleeve, that the cauſe why the Covenant hath not
overcome the ſword, is becauſe we have not kept it ſo faithfully as
we ſhould, <hi>and that upon this not keeping it me are to charge all the
vengeance that we have ſmarted with, ever ſince we tooke it,</hi> and
ſo it will be fit for us to doe, ever hereafter. Let me beſeech every

but in a word. I thinke there was <hi>never much Religion in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
in this Kingdome, (though perhaps not more in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,)
But I am verily perſwaded that of many yeares <hi>there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leſſe then now.</hi> In that little obſervation that I have been able
to make, of late; I cannot ſee that which I expected in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but <hi>leſſe care</hi> even of Family-Devotions, <hi>and ſcarce any care
at all</hi> of particular inſtruction or inſpection. Doe not divers, who
ſeeme <hi>very forward themſelves</hi> for the Cauſe of GOD among
us, harbour thoſe in their houſes, whom they know <hi>to beare no
good will at all to it,</hi> but to favour and even pleade for our enemies;
and yet they uſe no endeavour to put them into a better mind? But
ſpecially how many are there that know their very children and
much more their ſervants, <hi>have no ſavour at all of Religion:</hi> and
yet they cannot find in their hearts to attempt in the leaſt to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
or perſwade them better? <hi>Is this the fruit of our Covenant?</hi>
Was this the meaning of any in this particular, <hi>to promiſe enough,</hi>
but intend <hi>to performe nothing?</hi> or at leaſt now are they <hi>at liberty
to doe nothing</hi> of what they have ſo ſolemnely and ſacredly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and ſworne? I confeſſe, I ſee <hi>no very great fruits</hi> of our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
in any reſpect among the moſt, But of all other things, <hi>as
little in this matter of Family-Reformation</hi> as any thing; not to

or how did <hi>GOD take it at Samuels</hi> hands, that he was ſo partiall
to his ſons, as hath been noted? But ſpecially <hi>how did GOD take it</hi>
at <hi>Elies</hi> hand, though a good man? You know the ſtory in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the firſt book of <hi>Samuel,</hi> what terrible vengeance GOD
threatned and took <hi>upon the inventions,</hi> the wicked practiſes of
<hi>Elies</hi> ſons and his indulgence to them, and yet he gave them a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
and grave</hi> admonition, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. which is much more then a
great many doe, who know (or heare) enough of the ills of their
families, which yet they overlooke and ſilence, <hi>as if it did not at all
concerne them,</hi> as if their good or ill were nothing at all to them.
But ſo thought not <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of all <hi>Covenanters</hi> with
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50459:26"/>
GOD, he not only at GODS command <hi>brought all his family</hi>
(though ſo numerous as it exceeded 300. who were able to beare
Armes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.) <hi>into Covenant with GOD,</hi> Gen. 17. But GOD
<hi>takes notice</hi> of his care and conſcience to charge and <hi>command
them all</hi> to keep GODS wayes, and promiſes him and them ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
favour for it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 17, 18. And <hi>Joſhuah</hi> the Governour of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> undertakes for <hi>all his houſe,</hi> and family, (what ever <hi>Iſrael</hi>
did or would doe) <hi>that they ſhould ſerve the LORD,</hi> Joſh. 24. 15.
So we have <hi>Davids</hi> Vow for himſelfe, and <hi>family</hi> (and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
alſo) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. and the ſtory of all the <hi>Saints and Converts</hi>

houſholds with them. Zacheus, Lidia,</hi> the Jaylour (<hi>the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
family of all others</hi>) and divers more. This was the very
reaſon why GOD commanded, that <hi>all, (even the ſervant's
bought with money) ſhould be Circumciſed,</hi> as well as the Maſter
of the family himſelfe, <hi>to ſhew that he would have none neglected

tells <hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2 Chron. 25. <hi>that He was not with</hi> Iſrael, <hi>nor with
all the houſe of Ephraim,</hi> that was becauſe they were wilfull Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
and obſtinate in other wickedneſſes. And certainely if GOD
be not with our Armies, <hi>any where,</hi> they were better ſtay <hi>at home.</hi>
And <hi>if their ſins fight againſt Him,</hi> (as all allowed ſins doe) there is
no <hi>reaſon to thinke He will fight for them.</hi> He hath given them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
blowes at ſundry times, and in ſeverall places, <hi>Scarce any one
of our Armies hath eſcaped a blow alwayes:</hi> Doubtleſſe then it
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50459:26"/>
was their ſins that had a ſhare in provoking that vengeance. If we
pray to GOD to bleſſe them (as we doe ſpecially this day) and
faſt and humble our ſelves before GOD for <hi>their ſins</hi> alſo as well
as <hi>our own,</hi> and yet doe not labour to reforme them, (<hi>though we
know that prayer is vaine that is not ſeconded with endeavours</hi>)
what doe we leſſe then even tell GOD, <hi>that we deſire His bleſſing
upon them, though they continue still in their wickedneſſes:</hi> And
then if <hi>they prove</hi> cowards or treacherous, or that <hi>GOD give</hi> their
enemies the upper hand of them, we can thanke or blame none
more then our ſelves. And truly this (<hi>to me</hi>) is one of the great
cauſes, why the <hi>people of GOD</hi> that maintaine His cauſe here and in
other Nations, <hi>have fewer victories,</hi> and more frequent over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
<hi>now adayes</hi> then they had under the Old Teſtament, <hi>that
we ſuffer thoſe notorious wickedneſſes in our Armies, that were
not ſuffered then,</hi> and <hi>that we even make up our Armies much of

to ſpeake in this manner, I am ſure it is <hi>ungodly</hi> to let manifeſt
wickedneſſe altogether alone upon any pretence whatſoever; and
much more to imploy ſuch to be <hi>GODS Champions,</hi> as we know

to which they have been ſo long enured by the length
of the warres (<hi>which certainely they will the rather lengthen out,
if they still find they may doe what they liſt without controll</hi>) that
it is next to impoſſible for them to be reclaimed of it. Finally
if God looke upon <hi>their</hi> faults, as <hi>ours</hi> in part, (while we doe not

an evill a kinne to the former, namely the Diſorders and <hi>Oppreſſions</hi>
that are ſaid to be <hi>acted by thoſe that you imploy</hi> in divers places.
There is <hi>a great cry</hi> of this, how truly and juſtly I am not able to
ſay. But certainly, it were a moſt worthy act, <hi>that ſome choiſe men
of unquestionable integritie were appointed to make inquiry and
take knowledge of it.</hi> There is One that doth without all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
<hi>He that is higher then the Higheſt regards, and there be
higher then they,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe and Kingly Preacher, when he
ſpeakes of <hi>Oppreſſion and violent perverting of judgement and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice

<hi>that He doth and will heare the Cry of oppreſſion.</hi> Now if He doe
lo, there is <hi>but one of two to anſwer the Cry,</hi> and ſtop the Mouth
of it. Either <hi>mans</hi> Juſtice or <hi>GODS.</hi> Mans Juſtice, that is in your
Hands mainly. And that is the <hi>eaſiest</hi> and the <hi>ſafeſt</hi> way, for <hi>you,</hi>

You may poſſibly not only <hi>right thoſe that have ſuffered wrong,</hi>
but perhaps alſo <hi>Work ſo upon thoſe that have done the wrong,</hi> as to
bring them to Repentance, and ſo (as I may ſay) you ſave GOD a
labour, and with-hold His Hand from <hi>taking Vengeance, Into
whoſe Hands it is a fearefull thing to fall,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. But we
doe as it were force GOD <hi>to take Vengeance</hi> Himſelfe, <hi>if we will
not;</hi> and then <hi>we our ſelves</hi> are like to feele the ſmart of it too, <hi>as
abettors and acceſſaries.</hi> You know the Accent put upon the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of <hi>Eli</hi> in this kind 1 <hi>Sam. 3. 13. His ſons made themſelves vile
and he reſtrained them not:</hi> and how fearefull the Vengeance was
that GOD tooke both of the Sons and the Fathers faults together.
And ſo <hi>Samuel</hi> payed (as hath been noted) for his favour to his
<hi>bribe-taking</hi> and <hi>Juſtice-perverting</hi> ſons, by him put into Office.
In all theſe things, <hi>our own Intereſt is concerned,</hi> as well as GODS

One is that we may ever remember that Clauſe in the firſt

of England and Ireland in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline
and Government, according to the Word of God,</hi> You heard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of this in the morning, but I crave your patience that I may
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50459:28"/>
adde a little to it. Doubtleſſe the Word of GOD <hi>is the only Rule</hi>
unto which we <hi>are all tyed. He only is the Soveraigne Law-give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
to appoint how He will have His Church governed. And ſo He
hath left a <hi>ſufficient Ride</hi> in His Word <hi>for all Matters of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
and of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> (though all men doe not ſee it, and though
<hi>Circumstantials</hi> are left to be varied by a Humane, <hi>though not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi>
Prudence) ſufficient, I ſay, to <hi>preſerve Truth,</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> and
<hi>Peace</hi> in His Church, <hi>and to expell the contrary,</hi> by His Bleſſing.
And no Authority of man may preſume to reject or over-rule in
thoſe things. <hi>Where GODS Word gives out His Will, Mans buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is only to acknowledge,</hi> and <hi>ſubmit,</hi> and <hi>call others to doe ſo
too.</hi> All mans Authoritie is to be employed only to promote GODS
according to His Word. And therefore, I beſeech you, Let me
branch my Exhortation from this into three particulars. <note place="margin">1. Let none ſay There is no Government of the Church in the Word.</note>1. Doe
not in any wiſe hearken to the ſuggeſtions of any that would ſay,
<hi>That there is no Diſcipline or Government of the Church to be
found in the Word.</hi> If any did thinke ſo, and yet have Covenanted,
as is before expreſt, I doubt they will hardly excuſe themſelves
from <hi>having taken GODS Name in vaine</hi> in it. And I conceive
not how, if they urge others to covenant in that manner, they doe
leſſe then <hi>cauſe them to ſin,</hi> by urging to <hi>make GODS Name in

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> But however, ſurely <hi>there was a time when the Church of
GOD,</hi> the Church of the <hi>N. T.</hi> had a Government; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it ſelfe, an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Government, and not meerly <hi>Civill,</hi>
from the Civill Magiſtrate, for there was none ſuch that profeſſed
Chriſtianity, till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oo, yeares after Chriſt. <hi>To ſay, that there was no
Government in the Church</hi> (after the Apoſtles were gone to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and the Power of Miracles was alſo ceaſed) <hi>for ſo long a time,
is to ſuppoſe them to be left to an horrible Confuſion,</hi> which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
diſhonourable to Chriſt the LORD and King of His
Church, ſo much as to imagine. And if there were a <hi>Government
appointed by Chriſt,</hi> then certainly <hi>the Apoſtles</hi> and Evangeliſts <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
it in the Word</hi> in the <hi>N. T.</hi> For to imagine it left only to
<hi>Tradition</hi> is as contradictory to Chriſts Care of His People, as the
ſuppoſall of a meere <hi>Anarchy.</hi> (And the very Papiſts themſelves
ofter to pretend <hi>Scripture</hi> for the Popes claime, and dare not ſticke
wholly to <hi>Tradition.</hi>) And if it were <hi>once</hi> in the Word, then it is
there <hi>ſtill</hi> doubtleſſe, for we have <hi>the ſelfe ſome Word</hi> that the firſt
Chriſtians had, and then doubtleſſe <hi>it binds us ſtill,</hi> as well <hi>as it
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50459:29"/>
bound the Christians</hi> in thoſe firſt times. Unleſſe any can ſhew,
that it was to continue but ſo long, but till there ſhould be Chriſtian
Magiſtrates, and then to give place, and be no longer in force. And
this generall Rule give me leave to aſſert and commend to your
moſt ſerious conſiderations and conſciences.<note place="margin">N. B. Generall Rule about Lawes in the Word.</note> 
               <hi>That whatſoever

in either of the Volumnes of GODS Statute, the <hi>N. T.</hi> or the

as <hi>ſtill in force,</hi> unleſſe any one can anſwer me with a juſt proofe
that it is <hi>now out of date,</hi> or <hi>Repealed by a latter Law.</hi> And ſo men
<hi>(I forewarne them)</hi> ſhall find one day urged upon them, for all
thoſe Lawes that ſtand upon Record in GODS ſacred Volumnes,
however now many take Liberty to reject what they pleaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any juſt ground, that GOD hath diſcharged them: And the
<hi>Deniall</hi> or Neglect of this (<hi>in matter of Church-Government</hi>) is
<hi>the Rock</hi> that we have <hi>daſhed upon</hi> formerly; and therefore we had
need to take the more heed of it for time to come.</p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">2. Owne what is in the Word as from GOD.</note> But withall this muſt be added, that it concernes us <hi>as well to
own what we find in the Word of GOD, to be from GOD, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it and ſet it up.</hi> It is neceſſary to hold it out and eſtabliſh it,
<hi>as commanded of God,</hi> if it appeare clearely to us <hi>to be ſo.</hi> Elſe we
doe not give GOD and His Word that due honour which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
us to give. It is indeed moſt dangerous to aſſert <hi>Mans</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> or neceſſary. But it is alſo dangerous
and ſinfull to make GODS Appointments to be <hi>bus humane</hi> and
arbitrary. If in any thing <hi>We ſee not that.</hi> GOD doth certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it, <hi>We are to forbeare</hi> aſſerting it to be Divine. But we muſt
<hi>acknowledge</hi> it, when <hi>we doe ſee</hi> it. If it have the ſtamp of GODS.
Authoritie upon it, no man may ſay, <hi>We will not owne this as</hi> Jure
Divino. GOD will not be ſatisfied (nor men neither) that the things
be done, or eſtabliſhed, if His Authority be overlooked, and mans
only be pretended for it. <hi>Nothing is pleaſing to GOD, which is not
done in obedience to Him ſome way.</hi> If therefore He require <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
obedience,</hi> in this or that particular matter held forth in His
Word, it will not content Him, that we only <hi>be taught it,</hi> and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
it <hi>by the precepts of men.</hi> Neither will this awe <hi>any froward
ſpirit,</hi> as GODS Authority will; and doth where men are not deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50459:29"/>
prophane. And the <hi>Conſciences of the moſt conſcientious</hi>
will find no ſatisfaction in it upon thoſe Termes. Let therefore no
man ſay, <hi>that if we once acknowledge it as from GOD, then it is
unalterable; and we would not have it ſo.</hi> I beſeech you, <hi>if GOD
will have it to be unalterable,</hi> (as He will if His Word tell us ſo
much) <hi>ſhall we dare to ſay, We will not have it ſo?</hi> If GOD ſaith,
<hi>It ſhall continue,</hi> it ſhall continue, that is the <hi>Obligatory</hi> to us, and
all poſterities. And GOD forbid any of us ſhould ever ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary!
And our very Covenant alſo <hi>in the 6. Article,</hi> and <hi>in the

Prov. 29. 25. The feare of man brings a ſnare, but who ſo puts his

find, <hi>that whatſoever we have neglected, or doe yet neglect, in the

unworthy feare of men, and want of Faith, and Trust in GOD.</hi>
How often hath it been ſaid, and by how many, that <hi>if we ſhould be

looſe a conſiderable party,</hi> and <hi>not be able to carry on the worke

put you in mind of that of the Prophet, which you were happily
remembred of in the Morning, <hi>Jer. 9. 12, 13, 14. Who is the wiſe
man that may underſtand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of
the LORD hath ſpoken, that he may declare it? for what the land
periſheth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the LORD ſaith, Becauſe they have forſaken
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50459:34"/>
my Law which I ſet before them, and have not obeyed my Voice,
nor walked therein:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Speciall Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to know Why Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on a Land.</note> 
               <hi>But have walked after the imagination of
their own heart,</hi> &amp;c. Sure the <hi>Meaning</hi> of this is not, <hi>that every
man ſhould be let alone in doing what they lift under pretence of
Liberty of Conſcience:</hi> For that is neither more nor leſſe in plaine
words then to leave every man <hi>to walk after the Imagination of
their own heart:</hi> Much leſſe is it, that men ſhould be ſuffered to
<hi>cry downe the Law of GOD,</hi> (the Law delivered by <hi>GODS owne
Voice</hi> to all His People,) <hi>as no Rule for Chriſtians to Walk by.</hi> If
for <hi>forſaking</hi> it the Land periſheth, and for <hi>not walking therein:</hi>
The <hi>open and bold-faced oppoſition againſt</hi> it, muſt needs <hi>aggravare
the Tranſgreſſion,</hi> and <hi>increaſe the miſchiefe.</hi> But the Prophet
meaning is, that GOD would have an <hi>Obſervation</hi> made. 1. <hi>That
all the Miſery of the Land</hi> (though there were very few ſo wiſe as to
conſider it) <hi>is for ſin, for the tranſgreſſion of GODS Law,</hi> and <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one doing too much what they list.</hi> And then that in the ſecond
place, <hi>Enquiry</hi> ſhould be made for what <hi>Speciall Provocations</hi> it is
that there are ſuch <hi>heavy Judgements on the Land? They have
walked</hi> (ſaith GOD) <hi>after Baalim, which their fathers taught
them.</hi> Whether any <hi>old ſuperſtitions,</hi> or any <hi>Prophane Cuſtomes</hi>
and <hi>Practiſes,</hi> received by <hi>Tradition from our Fathers;</hi> Or any
other <hi>new invented Idoll</hi> or <hi>Fancy,</hi> any <hi>Imagination of our own
hearts,</hi> be the Grand <hi>Evill that provokes GOD ſo against us;</hi> as
that after all our ſeekings of Him and ſuings to Him, <hi>His anger is
not turned away, but His hand is ſtretched out ſtill.</hi> To <hi>find out</hi>
this, (or theſe, for they may be many,) were certainly the <hi>greatest
piece of Wiſdome</hi> one of them in the World, and to be <hi>taught</hi> it, one
of the <hi>Greateſt Honours</hi> from GOD that could be, and then to
<hi>Declare it</hi> one of the <hi>Greateſt Pieces of Faithfulneſſe</hi> to GOD
and His People. Oh that <hi>you,</hi> who are Our <hi>Wiſe Men,</hi> the <hi>Great
Councell of the Kingdome,</hi> would ſpecially ſet your <hi>Wits</hi> a work,

And thereupon doth little better then <hi>runne away from GOD,</hi> for
he runnes out of the <hi>Land of Iſrael</hi> from among the <hi>people</hi> of
GOD, whither GOD <hi>once</hi> ſent him when he was abroad, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
12. 5.) and flyes into the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> Countrey, the profeſſed and

is, as it were <hi>Out of GODS Bleſſing into the warme Sun.</hi>
And while he is among them he does not very well, for he is faine
to keep up his <hi>Credit</hi> with <hi>Achiſh,</hi> with much <hi>Diſſimulation,</hi> and
many <hi>fained Expreſſions.</hi> Hereupon, at laſt GOD meets with him,
with no ſmall <hi>Severity;</hi> You may well call it, as the Language of
the Text is, <hi>a Taking Vengeance on his Inventions.</hi> He is hunted
by the <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>jealouſie</hi> of the <hi>Philiſtine-Lords,</hi> from the <hi>Court</hi>
and <hi>Camp</hi> of <hi>Achiſh,</hi> and when he returnes to his home in that

captive, and all his <hi>Followers</hi> likewiſe undone and robbed of
all, and none knew <hi>by whom:</hi> and unto all this is added the <hi>Mutiny</hi>
of all his Souldiers, the people ſpake of <hi>ſtoning him, 1 Sam.</hi> 30. 6.
But then he <hi>recovers</hi> himſelfe; and in that moſt extreme danger
ſhewes a greater <hi>Faith</hi> then ever before, <hi>But David,</hi> ſay the next
words, <hi>encouraged himſelfe in the LORD his GOD.</hi> And then
immediately you find upon his <hi>enquiring</hi> of GOD about purſuing

<hi>Hull</hi> beſieged; and with us very <hi>little ſtrength</hi> and very <hi>few ſpirits.</hi>
But GOD gave us Grace to <hi>bethinke our ſelves,</hi> and <hi>humble</hi> our

            <p>How ſhould we then improve all this, to <hi>Strengthen Our Faith

               <note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> I will conclude all, with that moſt
