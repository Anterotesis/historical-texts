            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is at Your Request, that I Publish this
<hi>Sermon,</hi> which You were Pleased to
think might be Usefull to others, as well as
to those who heard it. And I could not deny
the First Request that was made to me by the
Gentlemen of this Country, in which I have
found so much Civility and Kindness. I
thank God, I came hither with no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
but to do as much Good as I could;
and I hope I shall always pursue that Design
with a sincere and vigorous Mind, as far
as I have Health and Opportunity. I thought
I could not do my Duty at this time, without
Representing the Evil and Mischief of some
very unseasonable Heats and Animosities,
<pb facs="tcp:58085:3"/>
among those who pretend to the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Interest, as to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi>
which are the most certain Standard of our
<hi>Publick Good;</hi> and none, but such as
are Enemies to it, can understand it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>May God Almighty Bless this Country
and the Whole Nation, with a hearty Zeal
and Concernment for it.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>2 TIM. I. 7.</bibl>
               <q>For God hath not given us the Spirit of Fear, but
of Power, and of Love and of a Sound Mind.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IF we look into the Scope and Design
of this Epistle, we shall find S. <hi>Paul</hi> at
the time of writing it, under more than
ordinary Apprehensions of the sad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Christian Church.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Himself,</hi> he had great Satisfaction
in the particular Care of Divine Providence
towards Him:<note place="margin">2 Tim. iij. 11.</note> For, <hi>God</hi> had not onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
delivered him out of many Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58085:4"/>
but had lately Rescued him <hi>out of the
Mouth of the Lion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. iv. 17.</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> from a great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Danger. And though he foresaw, that
<hi>the time of his Departure was at hand;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. iv. 6.</note> yet that was
so far from giving him any Trouble, that he
had the Comfort of a Good Conscience in
looking back; <hi>I have fought a good fight, I
have finished my course,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 7.</note> 
               <hi>I have kept the faith;</hi>
and in looking forward,<note place="margin">Vers. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Henceforth there is
laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which
the Lord the righteous Iudge shall give me at
that Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all his Dissatisfaction did arise from
looking about him; <hi>For without were Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and within were Fears.</hi> The Persecutions
abroad were indeed so sharp and severe, that
none could keep a Good Conscience without
a share in them; which makes him say, <hi>Yea,
and all that will live godly in Christ Iesus shall
suffer Persecutions.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 12.</note> But this was not that which
troubled him most; for there were two things
which seem to have made a deep and sad Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon his Mind.</p>
            <p>(1.) He observed a great Coldness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
among some who pretended a
mighty Zeal for the common Interest of
their Religion before. Of this he gives a
strange Instance in his own Case. <hi>At my first
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58085:4"/>
Answer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. iv. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> saith he, <hi>no man stood with me, but all
men forsook me; I pray God it be not laid to
their Charge.</hi> They might think it Prudence
and Caution at such a dangerous time, but
the Apostle certainly thought it a fault, or
else he would never have pray'd <hi>that it might
not be laid to their Charge.</hi> Something might
be said in Excuse of those who were so near
danger; but what can be said for the general
Coldness of those at a Distance?<note place="margin">Ch. i. 15.</note> 
               <hi>This thou
knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned
away from me.</hi> A sad Consideration to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
who was entrusted by him with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Care of those in <hi>Asia!</hi> For, what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
could he hope for among them, who
were turned away from S. <hi>Paul?</hi> Such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
as this must needs bring great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to Religion, as well as dissatisfaction to
him.</p>
            <p>(2.) He observed a busie sort of Seducers,
who were crept in among them; who were
crafty, restless and designing Men; such as
could not compass their own ends without
taking upon them a pretence of Zeal for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
They were Men of as ill Tempers
as we can well imagine Men to be;<note place="margin">Ch. iij. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>They
were lovers of themselves, covetous, boasters,
proud,</hi> &amp;c. But he concludes their Character
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58085:5"/>
with what one would have least expected from
such a sort of Men,<note place="margin">Vers. 5.</note> 
               <hi>that they had a Form of
Godliness.</hi> They were such <hi>painted Sepulchres</hi>
that made a more than ordinary Shew and
Appearance, but within there was nothing but
Rottenness and Corruption. Men who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to Religion without Vertue; and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to be accounted <hi>Godly</hi> without any real
Goodness. They made a great Shew of Zeal
about some things, and were industrious in
gaining Proselytes; for which end <hi>they crept
into Houses,</hi> &amp;c. but whatever they pretended,
their own Interest lay at bottom; <hi>Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that gain is Godliness;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. vj. 5.</note> and they were so
far from any hopes of Amendment, that
S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives that dreadfull character of them,
<hi>that they waxed worse and worse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. iij. 13.</note> 
               <hi>deceiving and
being deceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what now should <hi>Timothy</hi> do under
such a Complication of ill Circumstances?
Should he onely stand still and see which way
things would go? Or should he give way
to Despondency and sink under the Burthen
of his Fears? No, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> although at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and a <hi>Prisoner,</hi> yet thinks fit to Rouse,
to Animate, to Incourage him; and not
onely <hi>to put him in Mind of the Gift of God
which was in him;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. i. 6.</note> but of that Spirit and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58085:5"/>
Temper, which true <hi>Christianity</hi> possesses mens
minds with.</p>
            <p>For God hath not given us the Spirit of Fear,
but of Power, of Love and of a Sound Mind.</p>
            <p>Which words may be considered Two
ways:</p>
            <p>I. With Respect to <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Troubles</hi>
in the World; and so it is not <hi>a Spirit of
Fear, but of Power.</hi> Some render it <hi>Spiritum
Timiditatis,</hi> a timerous, pusillanimous Spirit;
which is apt to be dejected with Fears, so as
not to have Courage and Resolution enough
to do ones Duty for fear of Danger; and <hi>a
Spirit of Power</hi> is that which supports and
bears up the Mind under a Prospect of Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
so as not to be hinder'd thereby from
that Duty which lies upon us.</p>
            <p>II. With Respect to the <hi>Humours</hi> and
<hi>Passions</hi> of Men; and so it is <hi>a Spirit of Love
and of a Sound Mind:</hi> Not a peevish, froward,
exasperating, provoking Spirit, but <hi>a Spirit
of Love;</hi> Not a turbulent, seditious, unruly
Spirit, but <hi>of a Sound Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. With Respect to <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi>
Which may be understood Two ways:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58085:6"/>
1. As it may relate to such as S. <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Timothy; We have not received, i. e.</hi> we that
have an <hi>Apostolical Spirit</hi> given to us.</p>
            <p>2. As it may relate to all Christians; We
that own Christ sincerely and truely <hi>have not
received,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>(1.) I shall consider the Words with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the <hi>Apostolical Spirit;</hi> because this
day we commemorate one of them, (S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those who had the <hi>Apostolical Office</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them, (whether <hi>Primarily</hi> by <hi>Christ</hi>
himself, or <hi>Secondarily</hi> by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> as <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus</hi> and others) had great need
of this <hi>Apostolical Spirit.</hi> For, really, the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
were so great, which they were to go
through, that no ordinary Measures of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Resolution would serve them. When
men fight with Enemies in the open Field,
there is a Multitude combined together; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom there is abundance of Noise and
Heat and Examples; and the Hopes of Present
Victory, and the Shame and Danger of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away; which animate Persons in a
Day of Battel: but it is another kind of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
which is required to make men bear up
against the Malice and Subtilty of the Devil
and of Wicked Men; for here the Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58085:6"/>
is to all appearance much stronger on the
Worse side; and if we are to Judge of Success
by Numbers, those who promote Vertue and
Goodness could never bear up against their
Adversaries; who were sure to carry it by the
<hi>Poll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were among the <hi>Heathens</hi> some few
Great Men, who endeavour'd to Reform the
Vices of Mankind: but, alas! what poor Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
had they in their Attempts this way? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they wanted neither Wit, nor Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor Address to carry on this Noble De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
such as <hi>Socrates</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Epictetus</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and some others, who lived agreeably
to their Doctrine; yet how little Effect had
both their Precepts and Example on the rest
of the People either at <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Rome? So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
declared a mighty Resolution <hi>rather to
die than to say or do any thing unbecoming the
Station God placed him in;</hi> and upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of two malicious Men, the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Party were resolved to try the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and took him at his Word. After
which, his Disciples durst not deal so plainly
and openly as he had done; and the Artifice
they were put to, lost the force of the best
Part of their <hi>Philosophy;</hi> which they so mixed
with Numbers and Figures and Abstracted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58085:7"/>
Speculations, that it became a <hi>Mystery,</hi> instead
of a plain Design to Reform the Manners of
Men. The best and wisest of them seem to
have taken more pains to Satisfie themselves,
than to have Instructed others; or if they
did, they were some few chosen Disciples,
whom they initiated with as much Care, as
they were wont to do in their Solemn Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>But the Apostles undertook to Reform the
World, as to two things, which Mankind are
the hardest brought off from, and those are
<hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Vice.</hi> And they went plainly and
roundly to Work, which men can the least
bear; as we see by the Persecutions they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent
almost in every Place assoon as their
Design was understood. There was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Clamour against them as the Disturbers of
Mankind,<note place="margin">Act. xvij. 6.</note> as <hi>those who turned the World upside
down;</hi> which in some Sense was true, but not
as they meant it with Respect to Order and
Government. But when Men have no mind
to be Reformed, they must have some Terms
of Reproach to fasten upon those who go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to do it. It being Natural for them to
put <hi>Pictures</hi> of <hi>Devils</hi> on those, whom they
have a Mind to Execute. And when they
undeavour'd to Convince them of their Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58085:7"/>
they were very Impatient; of which
we have a clear Instance in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching
to <hi>Felix concerning Righteousness and Temperance
and Iudgment to come:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. xxiv. 25.</note> which were excellent
Subjects, but they went too near him; he
was too much concerned, to be willing to
hear any more of them. The Discourse of
S. <hi>Paul</hi> had too much Force in it for him to
bear it any longer; for it caused such a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
in his Mind as affected his Body, for,
<hi>Felix trembled:</hi> And then he thought it best
to dismiss him to <hi>a more convenient Season,</hi>
which never came, that we reade of. Which
shews, how much more willing men are to
continue in their Faults, than to hear them
reproved in order to Amendment.<note place="margin">Gal. iv. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>Am I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
become your Enemy,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, because I
tell you the Truth?</hi> No doubt of it: For, no
Truths can be so uneasie and provoking as
those which gaul the Consciences of men.</p>
            <p>The false Teachers whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> complains
so much of, were sensible of the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
which follow'd Plain Truth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to avoid Persecution, they so mixed and
adulterated the Doctrine of the true Apostles,
that it lost its main Force and Efficacy. And
although by their shifts and compliances with
<hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they escaped the hard Usage
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58085:8"/>
which others underwent; yet the Effect of it
was, that their Doctrine took no deep rooting
in the World: For, in <hi>Origen</hi>'s time, a very
inconsiderable Number of their Disciples were
left. But though the plain Simplicity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
met with Persecutions on all hands; yet by
the undaunted Courage of the Preachers of it,
the more it was opposed, the more it prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and at last triumphed over its greatest
Persecutors.</p>
            <p>(2.) These Words may be understood with
Respect to all Christians; and so they shew
what the Temper and Spirit of Christianity is,
where it hath its due and proper Effect upon
mens Minds.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Moralists</hi> speak much of an excellent
Vertue, which they call <hi>Magnanimity:</hi> which
implies such a Greatness of Mind, that it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
a man on in doing what becomes him,
without being discouraged by the Fears of
what may befall him in it.</p>
            <p>And this our Saviour doth suppose to be so
attainable by all his Disciples, that he requires
it from them.<note place="margin">Matth. x. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Fear not them which can kill the
Body, but are not able to kill the Soul;</hi> or <hi>Be
not afraid of them that kill the Body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke xij. 5.</note> 
               <hi>and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

your Fears by the Consideration of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58085:8"/>
World and not of this. But is this possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to be rid of our Fears as to this World?
It may be some <hi>Heroical</hi> minds may attain to
this; or those on whom God bestows the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Gifts of his Spirit: but can any
by the common Measures and Assistances of
Grace reach to it? Fear is a Natural and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Passion; which is not easily dissembled,
much less cured; and the weaker any are, as
to mind or body, the more they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Power of it. There are some
Constitutions by Reason of their dark and
confused and melancholy Apprehensions of
things, can never get out of the Labyrinth of
their own Fears. And where Suspicions and
Jealousies find an easie entertainment, it is not
possible to cure such Persons Fears; for they
are afraid of all possible things. Such I must
exclude as labouring under a Disease of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;
as we do those who are under a
Feaver; And for whose <hi>Vnreasonable Fears</hi> I
know no better Cure than there is of Madness,
which is to bring the Persons to the Use of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
as well as we can; and if Reason doth not
cure them, nothing else will.</p>
            <p>But let us suppose the Fears Reasonable, <hi>i. e.</hi>
such as considering the State of the World a
Prudent man may justly apprehend; is it not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58085:9"/>
possible to master these Fears? Not to Cure
our Apprehension when it is Reasonable, but
to take Care, that it do not torment and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
our Minds; but especially that it do not
hinder us from doing our Duty.</p>
            <p>And this is that Spirit of <hi>Christian Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
which I design to speak of; and to make
the matter as clear as I can; I shall,</p>
            <p>(1.) Enquire into those things which the
<hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Magnanimity</hi> requires in general.</p>
            <p>(2.) Shew the particular <hi>Measures</hi> of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

            </p>

and the Means in order to it.</p>
            <p>(1.) As to <hi>Magnanimity</hi> in general; It is
not so much any one Vertue, as a Result from
several put together; and especially these,</p>
            <p>(1.) Integrity of Mind: Which implies these
things.</p>
            <p>1. A Freedom from any mean and sinister

to Tricks.</hi> It is the Sense of its own Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which disposes any Living Creature to Craft
and Cunning: The Lion knows his own strength
and despises it; the Fox is sensible he hath
not strength enough for his own Security, and
therefore tries all other ways to compass his
End. A Spirit of Magnanimity is above all
little Arts and Shifts, which tend onely to
some mean and pitifull end, not worthy to
be regarded. Men of Artifice and Design may
think it Weakness and Folly; but it is really
a Greatness of Mind which makes a Good and
Wise Man despise such things as unbecoming
that true Greatness which lies in a Generous
Integrity: which cunning men can no more
reach to, even when they affect it, than an
Actor upon a Stage can the true Greatness of
a Prince.</p>
            <p>2. Sincere and unaffected Goodness.
Which is that,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nicom.</hi> l. 4. c. 3.</note> which <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and makes absolutely necessary to <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity.</hi>
The first thing in the Character
of a Good Man among the <hi>Moralists</hi> is,
that he be inwardly so; not taking upon him
the Appearance and Shew of Vertue for the
sake of others; but forming his Mind and
Temper according to the Principles and Rules
of it. And when he hath done this, the whole
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58085:10"/>
Course of his Actions will be agreeable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
he will not onely be just and temperate,
but kind and obliging, ready to do Good to
all, according to his Circumstances; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having
himself under all, as becomes a Good
Man.</p>
            <p>(2.) There must not onely be <hi>Integrity,</hi> but
<hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Resolution;</hi> without which, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
times, it is impossible to maintain Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.
I do not by this mean any sudden and
violent Heats, which rather shew the Greatness
of the Passions than of the Mind; but a calm
and sedate Courage, which exceeds the other,
as a man of true Valour doth one that is rash
and fool-hardy. The latter may do bolder
things than the other; but none of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists</hi>
allow it to be <hi>true Fortitude;</hi> for that
must be guided by Reason and Discretion.
The bold and daring man never considers what
he doth; but he is carried on by a sudden
and violent <hi>Impetus,</hi> or such an agitation of
Spirits, that suffer him not to Think; but on
he goes, and if he meets with Success, it is more
owing to his Passion and Heat, than to his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
or Courage. Violent and furious Heats
(although under a pretence of Zeal for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion)
are like the furious Onsets of undisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined
Souldiers, which do more Mischief by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58085:10"/>
their want of Order, than they do Good by
unseasonable Courage. True Courage must
be a Regular thing; it must have not onely
a Good End, but a wise choice of Means;
and then the Courage lies in the vigorous
Pursuit of it: not being disheartned by diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
nor giving over through despondency
or disappointments.</p>
            <p>(3.) There must be an Indifferency of Mind,
as to the Event of doing our Duty. Not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Indifferency, which human Nature is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
capable of; but such as keeps a mans mind
firm and constant so as not to be moved from
the Dictates of a well-satisfied Conscience by
the Motives of this World. It was a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
saying of <hi>Socrates,</hi> which <hi>Antoninus</hi> takes
notice of,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antonin.</hi> l. 7. §. 44.</note> 
               <hi>That man,</hi> saith he, <hi>is of no value,
who regards any thing so much as doing his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
It is not whether a man lives or dies, but
whether what he doth be just or unjust, whether it
becomes a Good man to do it, or not, which he is
to look after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thou canst not find any thing in Life,<note place="margin">l. 3. §. 3.</note> 
               <hi>saith
that excellent Emperor himself,</hi> better than Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Truth, a sound Mind (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the word
here used)</hi> and a discreet Courage; then make this
thy great business and apply thy self to it with all
thy heart. Let neither popular Applause, nor Power,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58085:11"/>
nor Riches, nor Sensual Pleasure draw thee off front
it. Choose that which is best and pursue it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
with simplicity of mind and the free
Inclination of thy will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Roman Orator goes beyond them,
when he saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Off.</hi> l. 1.</note> that Nothing argues so mean and
narrow a mind, as the Love of Riches; nothing
savours more of a great Mind, than to contemn
them; and if Men enjoy them to bestow them in
Beneficence and Liberality. <hi>And again,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To value Iustice and Honesty and Kindness and
Liberality above Pleasure and Riches and Life it
self, and the Common Good above ones private
Interest, argues a truely Great Mind, and is most
agreeable to human Nature.</p>
            <p>These things I have mention'd, not onely
to clear the Nature of <hi>Magnanimity;</hi> but to
shew what generous Notions these Heathens
had concerning the Practise of Vertue and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
even when it was accompanied with
Losses and Hardships for the sake of it; and
what a mean Esteem they had in Comparison
of that <hi>great Idol,</hi> which the World still wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
<hi>i. e.</hi> Riches.</p>
            <p>(2.) I now come to shew the true Measures
of <hi>Magnanimity</hi> according to the Christian
Doctrine. And that consists in two things:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58085:11"/>
1. In studying to Please God above all
things.</p>
            <p>2. In choosing rather to Suffer than to
Displease him.</p>
            <p>1. In studying to Please God above all
things.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mor.</hi> l. 4. c. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath observed that <hi>Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity
hath a particular Respect to Honour:</hi> the
Question then is, whether it relates to what
gets Esteem and Honour among Men; or, to
that Honour which comes from God. It's
true, the Heathen Moralists knew very little
of this;<note place="margin">l. 10.</note> although <hi>Aristotle</hi> once mentions <hi>the
Kindness which God hath for Persons of the most
excellent and vertuous Minds, as being nearest of
Kindred to the Gods.</hi> But this was not settled
as a Principle among them; but it is the
Foundation of all true Religion with us, that
our main Care ought to be to Please God, and
to value other things as they are most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to him. The most Refined Atheists of
this Age confess, that the Doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Apostles is very Pious and Vertuous;
although they look on them as deceived in
their Imaginations. We take what they grant,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Morals</hi> of Christianity are very
Good; but we say, that it is a heightning and
improving of Moral Vertues to make them
Divine Graces; and not to practise them meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58085:12"/>
as agreeable to Reason, but as Pleasing to
God. Those who allow a God, who is wise
and Powerfull, do confess, that no Sacrifices
are so pleasing to him, as a Pious, devout and
vertuous Mind: but then they were to seek, as
to the Measures of Piety and Vertue. But that
is the Infinite Advantage by the Scriptures,
which we enjoy, that by them we know what
is most pleasing to God. <hi>He hath shewed thee,
O Man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mic. vj. 8.</note> 
               <hi>what is Good, and what hath the Lord
required of thee; but to do justly, and to love Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> When
God sheweth us our Duty, we have no longer
any ground to dispute it; especially, when it
is so agreeable to the Divine Nature, and our
own. What can we do better with Respect
to Mankind, than <hi>to do justly and to love Mercy?</hi>
What can become us more with Respect to
God, than <hi>to walk humbly with our God? To
walk with God,</hi> is to have a constant Regard to
him in the Course of our Lives; thus <hi>Enoch
walked with God,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham:</hi> and
<hi>to walk humbly with him,</hi> is to maintain a due
Sense of our Distance from him and our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
upon him. And this <hi>Humility of
Mind</hi> doth not take off from true <hi>Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;</hi>
for, it is the <hi>Magnanimity</hi> of Christians
that I am speaking of. The <hi>Magnanimity</hi> of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58085:12"/>
               <hi>Philosophers</hi> carried them beyond the due
bounds of their Dependence upon God; for
they presumed upon their own Sufficiency, both
as to the support of their Minds under Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and the making themselves happy. In
both which they were lamentably mistaken.
But the Humility of Christians in depending
upon God for Assistance and Happiness is so
far from being inconsistent with <hi>Magnanimity,</hi>
that it is not to be had without it.<note place="margin">Phil. iv. 13.</note> 
               <hi>For,</hi> saith
S. <hi>Paul, I can do all things.</hi> Can any thing be
said greater than that? But how? <hi>Through
Christ which strengtheneth me.</hi> And this Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon God for his Grace is no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with Magnanimity, than a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
Greatness is with his Duty and Service to
his Prince. The Christians Magnanimity lies
in having but one to please; but such a one,
as is the Greatest, the Wisest, the Happiest Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the World.</p>
            <p>2. But if he cannot Please God and the
World together, then this Magnanimity car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
him rather to choose suffering under the
World's Displeasure, than to displease God.
This seems a hard choice; but there would be
no <hi>Magnanimity</hi> without Difficulty. It may
please God, that our Duty and Interest may
lye together, and then it is Folly and Humour
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58085:13"/>
to choose to suffer when we need not. Where
there is true <hi>Magnanimity</hi> in Suffering, there
is an impartial and prudent weighing and bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing
all Circumstances together, before there
can be a just Resolution of Suffering. And a
mans Courage in suffering depends very much
upon the Motives induced him to it; which
every Mans Conscience must judge of.</p>
            <p>But there are two sorts of Sufferings <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity</hi>
may shew it self in:</p>
            <p>(1.) The Necessary and unavoidable Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and Calamities of Life.</p>
            <p>(2.) The Voluntary preferring a suffering
Condition rather than sinning against God.</p>
            <p>(1.) As to the Common Accidents of Life.
It is observed by the <hi>Moralists,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aristot.</hi> Mor. l. 3. c. 12. <hi>Aug.</hi> 83. q. 36.</note> 
               <hi>that it is a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thing to bear things that are troublesome, than
to abstain from things that are pleasant:</hi> the
Sense of Pain and Suffering being much more
uneasie, than the forbearing what is delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
which is onely crossing a Natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
And though many Persons choose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to yield to their vicious Inclinations than
to avoid the Pains and Diseases which follow
them; yet that is because they look on them
as uncertain and at a Distance, and hope they
may escape them.</p>
            <p>But when it is certain and present, human
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58085:13"/>
Nature is very tender and sensible of Pain and
shrinks from it; and requires inward Courage
to support it self under it. It is observed by
the Roman Orator, that a peculiar kind of
Courage is necessary for suffering Pains and
Diseases; for many that have been brave men
in the Field, yet could not <hi>virilitèr aegrotare,</hi>
behave themselves like Men when they came
to be sick. The Truth is, all Mankind abhor
suffering so much, that one of the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements
to the study of <hi>Morality</hi> of old, was
to find out some <hi>Antidotes</hi> against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Accidents of Life.</p>
            <p>For they soon found there were some Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
incident to human Nature, which all
the Art and Skill of the Wisest Men could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prevent. Our Bodies are continually sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Pains, to Diseases, to Corruption and
Dissolution. Our Estates to Violence, Fraud
and Misfortune. Our Houses and Cities to
Flames, to Earthquakes, to Inundations. Our
Friends and Relations are all liable to the same
Calamities with our Selves, and that makes
our Trouble the greater.</p>
            <p>What now should Wise Men do? Can they
hope to stem the Tide, and to turn back the
Stream? No, that is too violent for them. Can
they raise any Banks or Sea-Walls against them
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58085:14"/>
to keep them out? All such are vain and
fruitless. What then? Shall they strip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of all the Comforts of Life, that they
may leave nothing to Misfortune? So some
did, to no great purpose, unless they could
shake off their Passions too. But this doth not
look like <hi>Magnanimity,</hi> but Cowardize; not
overcoming an Enemy, but running away from
him. By the same Method, they must go na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to avoid Robbery; and live on the Tops
of Mountains to escape a Deluge.</p>
            <p>But some thought these things look'd most
terrible at a Distance; whereas if they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
how common they were, they would
learn to bear them better. But <hi>Carneades</hi> said
well, <hi>Malevoli animi Solatium est turba misero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi>
it is a kind of ill-natur'd Comfort which
one draws from the commoness of Calamities.
And after all, it is no real Satisfaction to a
mans mind, to think that so many suffer as he
doth; it is like the unnatural Pleasure of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
which one man takes in anothers Pain.</p>
            <p>There is one thing it serves well for, and
that is to shew the Folly of great Impatience
under such things which the rest of Mankind
bear. Thus <hi>Iulian</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Amerius</hi>
relates a Story of <hi>Democritus</hi> his dealing with
<hi>Darius</hi> upon the loss of his beloved Wife.<note place="margin">Epist. 37.</note> After
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58085:14"/>
several ineffectual Ways of comforting him;
at last he asked him, whether bringing her to
Life would not put an End to his Grief? No
doubt of it. But how should this be done?
Let me alone for that, said the Philosopher,
if you will provide me all the things I shall
desire in order to it. After great Care taken
in providing many things for him, <hi>Darius</hi>
asked him if he had all he wanted? No, said
he; there is one thing more I must have, and
you are the most likely Person to furnish me
with it. In short, you must get me three
Names to be put upon her Monument of
such Persons who have gone to their Graves
without Sorrow or Trouble; and You, said he,
have very large and populous Dominions, and
no doubt if such a thing be to be had, you
can procure it. <hi>Darius</hi> was struck with this,
and after some consideration said, <hi>he doubted
he could not. Why then,</hi> said the Philosopher
smiling, <hi>Are not You ashamed to be guilty of so
much Folly as to be so exceedingly cast down under
such a Calamity, as though you were the onely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the World that underwent it?</hi> This was
agreeable enough to his Humour in Exposing
the <hi>Folly</hi> of <hi>Mankind;</hi> which was a Subject
large enough for his whole Life; but he was
too pleasant upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:58085:15"/>
I do not deny but the <hi>Moralists</hi> did find out
some very Usefull Considerations to bear men
up under the Common Accidents of Life; but
those of greatest Moment, were such as are
much improved by <hi>Christianity; viz.</hi> the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Providence, the Usefulness of Trials,
the Benefit of Patience, and the Expectation
of a better State.</p>
            <p>(2.) As to Voluntary and chosen Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
We have in Scripture several extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Instances of this kind of <hi>Magnanimity;</hi>
such was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s leaving his Kindred and
Country and going he knew not whither on
God's Command, and his readiness to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
his Son; which argued an entire Sacrifice
of himself to the Will of God. Such was <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
his <hi>Choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the
People of God than to enjoy the Pleasures</hi> of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>'s
Court. Such was the Son of God's
choosing to suffer for our sakes, with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Resignation to the Divine Will; and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for his Persecutors under the greatest Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
on the Cross. Such was the Apostles Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
and Courage, when <hi>they rejoyced to be
accounted worthy to suffer for the sake of Christ;</hi>
when they were <hi>more than Conquerors</hi> in the
midst of Persecutions. And truely the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity</hi>
of Suffering rather than Sinning, was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58085:15"/>
never so much shewn to the World as in the
Case of the <hi>Primitive Christians.</hi> There were
some few <hi>Heroick</hi> Instances of Suffering for
Truth among the Heathens; but they were
no more to be compared with the Numerous
Examples of the Primitive Church than the
Miracles of the <hi>Vestal Virgins</hi> were with those
of the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It could not but amaze the common sort
of Spectators of <hi>Rome,</hi> who were wont to see
the <hi>Gladiators,</hi> (who were either hired or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to that Cruel Entertainment of others
with their blood) to behold a sort of Grave
and Serious Persons expose themselves to so
much Torment and Cruelty, when so small a
matter as burning a little Incense would set
them free. This was a New Spectacle to the
World, and it could not but put them upon
thinking what strange sort of <hi>Philosophy</hi> this
was, which inspired ordinary Persons with such
a <hi>Magnanimity</hi> in suffering. They had never
found those who pretended to <hi>Philosophy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them very fond of Suffering for the
Doctrine they taught. They rather liked the
Example of <hi>Aristotle</hi> than <hi>Socrates;</hi> who when
the People of <hi>Athens</hi> were enraged against him,
withdrew to <hi>Chalcis;</hi> and when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
with it, made a witty Excuse, <hi>that he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58085:16"/>
had no mind the City of</hi> Athens <hi>should sin twice
against Philosophy.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Christians</hi> were
so forward to suffer for their Doctrine, that it
was imputed as a Fault to them; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by <hi>Tertullian</hi> that some out-went the
bounds of <hi>Christianity</hi> in offering themselves
too freely to it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tertull.</hi> ad Scap.</note> This made such as <hi>Antoninus</hi>
and others impute all their Sufferings to <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Obstinacy and a sort of Madness which
possessed them:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antonin.</hi> l. 11. §. 3.</note> which had been easily confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Arrian.</hi> l. 4. c. 7.</note>
if they would have had the Patience to
have examin'd the Reasons and Grounds of
their Religion, as they did the peculiar Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines
of the several Sects of <hi>Philosophers.</hi> But
this is not all which <hi>Christian Magnanimity</hi>
doth imply; for it is not onely <hi>a Spirit of
Power, but of Love and of a Sound Mind.</hi> And
so it hath</p>
            <p>II. A Respect to the <hi>Humours</hi> and <hi>Passions</hi>
of Men. And truely, there is such a Variety
and Uncertainty in them; so much Folly and
Mistake; so much Prejudice and Peevishness
in some; so much Wilfulness and Stiffness in
others; so little Regard to the true Interests
of Religion and Vertue, under all the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to it; that those who sincerely desire to
promote them had need of <hi>Magnanimity</hi> to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58085:16"/>
bear them up against such Humours and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
of Mens Minds. <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath well
observed that <hi>Magnanimity</hi> doth go beyond
the Consideration of Dangers.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mor.</hi> l. 4. c. 3.</note> 
               <hi>It makes a man
more ready to do Kindnesses than to receive them;
and to forget Injuries.</hi> I add, <hi>and to forgive
them;</hi> for else, it is rather want of Memory,
than Magnanimity. It is well he adds one
thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that he that hath Magnanimity is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Contented within himself;</hi> so he had
need to be; for he will find very little Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
abroad, especially in an Age when <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi>
is almost lost: when men have used
themselves to so much Hypocrisie and Dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
with God and Man, that they can
zealously pretend to Love what they would be
glad to Ruine, and cry up Peace and Unity
onely to get an Opportunity to destroy them.
But still true Magnanimity keeps a Mans own
mind at Ease, and <hi>makes him to govern himself,</hi>
as the same Philosopher observes, <hi>with due Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and Moderation in all things.</hi> Such a one is
not onely Easie to himself, but to all others, as
far as is consistent with his Duty. For a Mind
truely Great, hath nothing of Bitterness, or
Sowreness; Peevishness, or Ill Will to the
rest of Mankind. All Malice and Cruelty ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
a Mean and Base Spirit. The more noble
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58085:17"/>
and generous any Tempers are, the more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and compassionate they are, the more
ready to oblige, the more easie to forgive, the
more willing to be Reconciled.</p>
            <p>But to be more particular, there are two
things implied in <hi>this Spirit of Love and of a
Sound Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1.) The making all Reasonable Allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for the Infirmities of others. It makes
men to consider the Prejudices of Education;
the Variety and Weakness of most mens Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
the Power of Perswasion; the Bias of
Parties; and the Shame and Reproach which
Persons undergo that break off from them,
after they have been once ensnared by them.
On these Accounts it makes them rather Pity
than Triumph over the Follies of Mankind.
There are two things which a Great Mind
doth most abhor in Religion, and are most
directly contrary to <hi>a Spirit of Love and a
Sound Mind;</hi> and these are <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty;</hi>
which make men false to God, and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Mankind. These two often go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
and although they are masked under
a pretence of Religion, yet there are no two
things more opposite to the true Spirit and
Design of it. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> concludes that man to
have no true Love to God who doth not love
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58085:17"/>
his Brother.<note place="margin">1 Joh. iv 20.</note> 
               <hi>He that loveth not his Brother whom
he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath
not seen?</hi> And we may argue the other way;
If a man doth not Love God, how can he
love his Brother? When the Love of God is
the best Foundation for Charity and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to our Brethren; who were at first made
after the Image of God, and have it again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
in them by the Power of Divine Grace
<hi>in Righteousness and true Holiness.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. iv. 24.</note> And even
where that doth not appear, yet there is a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
and Compassion due to Mankind, as
far as is consistent with the Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World.</p>
            <p>(2.) The Spirit <hi>of Love and of a Sound Mind,</hi>
consists in laying aside private Animosities and
Heats for a Publick and General Good. That
is a thing too great and too sacred, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and ridiculed, as though it were onely
a Popular pretence for Faction and Sedition.
Whereas Nothing is more directly opposite
to it; for therefore it is called Faction and
Sedition, because it is against it. If it hath
been abused by men of ill Minds, so have the
best things in the World; but they do not
lose their Nature and Excellency by it. If
there be not such a thing as a Common Good,
whence comes any Mans Obligation to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58085:18"/>
Order and Government, and to seek the
Safety and Welfare of his Country, although it
may be to the hazard of his own Life? If there
be such a thing, it deserves our Regard in the
first Place, and we ought to lay aside all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices,
and mutual Animosities and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of particular Parties, and heartily to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
that which is our true Common Interest,
as we are English Men and Protestants of the
Church of <hi>England;</hi> which is a great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Part of the Christian Church, and
the Chief of the Reformation. It is hard for
any not to see that the whole Protestant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
lies at Stake; and that the Preservation
of it depends very much on our Conduct and
Union at this time.</p>
            <p>But if we find any to be humoursome and
peevish, any to struggle more for the Interest
of a Party to make it uppermost, than for our
Common Good, although it be a very sad
Consideration and bodes very ill to us all;
yet we have that poor Comfort left us, that
men were as ill disposed even in the Apostles
times.<note place="margin">Phil. ij. 21.</note> 
               <hi>For,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> (at a time when
one would have thought they should have
been much better inclined) <hi>All men seek their
own, not the things which are Iesus Christs.</hi> I
hope it cannot be said of <hi>all</hi> now; but I fear
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58085:18"/>
it is so true of too many, that it is one of the
worst <hi>Symptoms</hi> of the present State of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.
And that which makes it more deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
is, that some Men have entertained such
Suspicion and Jealousie of each other, that he
that goes about to Reconcile them, instead of
making them Friends, is look'd on as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemy. I am afraid there is not Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Integrity enough left to be a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for uniting several Parties among us;
at least there wants an Opinion of it. And
as long as there are such Mistrusts and Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
the greatest Integrity is so far useless.</p>
            <p>Some learned and good Men have been of
late apt to perswade themselves and others,
that the Glorious and Happy times of the
Church are coming on; I could be glad to
be of their opinion; for it is a comfortable
thing to a man who travels in an ill Road
and with bad Company, whom he is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
afraid of, to see at a distance a pleasant
and safe Country, where he shall be rid of his
Fears and Dangers. But I confess, I cannot
much please my self with such thoughts, till
I see the Tempers of Mens minds begin to
change towards one another. If I could once
see the <hi>Spirit of Love and a sound time</hi> prevail
among us; If men would be contented to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:58085:19"/>
Sacrifice their Humours and Piques to the
Publick Interest; in short, if there were any
hopes Men would be Wise and Good, there
were then a great Foundation for hope, that
all things would be settled among us, so as
to continue for succeeding Generations.</p>
            <p>But if Men will persist in their own Wilfull
Humours; If they had rather all should perish,
than they not compass their own Ends; we
need no foreign Enemies to come in upon us,
we shall soon come to that height of Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,<note place="margin">Gal. v. 15.</note>
               <hi>as to bite and devour one another;</hi> and then
it is an easie Inference, <hi>that we shall be consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
one of another.</hi> I am far from thinking
our Case desperate; for I hope Men have not
lost all their Sense and Zeal for our Common
Interest; but if Mens Heats and Passions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
and grow fiercer, a Man needs not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to Prophecy to foretell what the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Consequence will be.</p>
            <p>The true Spirit of Religion seems to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in Mens warm Contentions about it; and
some have pretended to a sort of Zeal without
Conscience, to Religion without Faith, and to
Scruples without common Honesty.</p>
            <p>If ever God designs to doe us Good, there
must be a great Alteration in Mens Tempers
and Manners. We must have more Sincerity
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58085:19"/>
and Integrity among us; the want of which
hath caused such a general Mistrust of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
that if <hi>Faith</hi> were to save the Nation,
I am afraid there is hardly enough left in it.
And it looks like one of the Symptoms of the
Day of Judgment upon us: For, <hi>If the Son of
Man should come, he would hardly find Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But instead of discoursing of <hi>Magnanimity,</hi>
I am sensible I have run into the Object and
Reason of our Fears. But therefore to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all, I shall speak briefly to the last Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
which was,</p>
            <p>(3.) To consider what Arguments and
Means there are to support us against our
Fears; or to attain to that <hi>Christian Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
I have been discoursing of. And there
are two great Arguments which Christianity
doth particularly recommend to us.</p>
            <p>1. Let things go as ill as we can fear in
this World; if we are sincere Christians, there
is a far better State to come; to which we
shall be admitted when we are once out of
this troublesome and sinfull World. There
will be no Hurries and Confusions, no Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
and Suspicions, no Piques and Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
The highest Regions of the Air are the
most calm and serene; all the Clouds and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58085:20"/>
Storms and blustering Winds are below and
arise from the <hi>Atmosphere.</hi> If our Minds were
more loose from the World we should be
more at quiet: For, at the bottom, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
of this World make Men so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
in it. It is Honour or Power or Riches
which make them so unquiet, and endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to supplant and undermine one another.
If Men could learn to be content with that
which they pretend was all they so long and
so impatiently desired, there might be some
hopes of seeing something like Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
among us: but if Liberty be thought to
signifie nothing without Power, it is Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to suppose that Power will signifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
unless it be all in their own Hands. And
what can they imagine the rest of the Nation
will do? Will they suffer an established Church,
and such a one as ours is (which I think an
<hi>Apostolical Church,</hi> as to Doctrine, Worship and
Government, if there be any now in the World)
to be run down with the violent Heats of some
men, and look on as wholly unconcerned?
They are extremely mistaken in the Temper
of the Nation who think so. But if men will
not be quiet, when they have all they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to desire, what can we expect but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Animosities will Discourage our Friends,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58085:20"/>
Animate our common Enemies, and Expose
us all to Confusion, if not to Ruine. If Men
loved this World less and another better,
they would be more quiet here, and be more
carefull to prepare for that better State. <hi>If our
Conversation were in Heaven,</hi> as it ought to be,
with what Contempt should we look down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the busie Designs, the restless Cares, the
vain Hopes and the perplexing Fears of the
greatest part of Mankind? Then we should
have more Peace and Tranquillity in our
minds while we live, and greater Satisfaction
when we come to die. For Integrity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
will keep us most from giving distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
to others, and from finding any in our
own Breasts.<note place="margin">Pro. i. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Whoso hearkeneth unto Wisdom, shall
dwell safely and shall be quiet from the Fear of
Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We are assured that we are under the
Constant Care of Divine Providence. The
Tranquillity of our minds in this World de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
very much upon the Esteem we have of
Providence and the Trust we repose in God.
What makes Children pass their time without
solicitous thoughts about themselves, but the
Confidence they have in the Wisdom and Care
of their Parents? What makes Passengers lie
down at rest in a Ship at Sea, but because they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58085:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
trust to the Conduct of their Pilot? We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
alter the Methods of Providence by all our
Solicitude; God will govern the World by his
own Measures and not by ours. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the duty of Submission is ours. Let
us not then be peevish and quarrelsome at what
he doth; but make the best Use of any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Instance of his Providence which
seems to be intended for our Good, unless we
turn it another Way.</p>
            <p>But it is not enough to be meerly Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Providence; but we ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and usefull in our own Places to promote
the common Interest; and not to Repine and
Murmure at what is Necessary for the Support
of it. Let us not torment our Selves with fears
of what may and what may not happen; but
let us commit our Selves to God in well-doing
as to our Creator and Preserver.</p>
