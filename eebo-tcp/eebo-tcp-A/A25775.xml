            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I <hi>Here present your Lordships with a short Account of the Proceedings of an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Protestant Reformed Church and State, against a Noted</hi> Tritheist, <hi>for asserting</hi> Three Eternal Spirits in the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity; <hi>induced thereto by the late fatal Growth of</hi> Tritheism <hi>in our Church; first vented and asserted in the same and yet higher Terms by Dr.</hi> Sherlock, <hi>in his pretended</hi> Vindication of the Doctrine of the Ever Blessed Trinity, <hi>in the Year</hi> 1690. <hi>And since that by one</hi> J.

               <hi>and his</hi> Tritheistick <hi>Notions upon the same Article, in the Year</hi> 1695. <hi>and since that also openly preached in the very Face of the whole University of</hi> Oxon, <hi>by one Mr.</hi> Joseph Bingham, <hi>then a Fellow of</hi> University-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>there, on the 28th of</hi> October, <hi>in</hi> 1695. <hi>And lastly, maintained, and with great and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven foaming Vehemence, preached up in one of the most Eminent</hi> Cathedrals <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>by one of the Prebendaries of the same, first on the 30th,</hi> Nov. 95. <hi>and since that on the 12th of</hi> January 9. <hi>Whose Name, together with the Heterodoxyes then and there delivered by him, are ready to be produc'd, as there shall be occasion.

               <note place="margin">☞</note> 
               <hi>left to the Bishops of this</hi> Reformed Church <hi>to judge: For some indeed have shewn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves very zealous to quit a great part of our Ecclesiastical Constitution, in order to our U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with those Churches beyond Sea; (Tho I confess I could never yet hear, That those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches alledged the Rites and Ceremonies of our Church as any Bar to their Communion with</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55921:4"/>
               <hi>it.) But howsoever they do, or may stand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to us, I dare undertake, that our quitting all the Ceremonies hitherto enjoyned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived amongst us (as</hi> Ancient, Decent, <hi>and</hi> Inoffensive, <hi>as they certainly are) will not be half so powerful to draw them to us, as the</hi> Asserting Three Distinct Infinite, Eternal Minds or Spirits in the Blessed Trinity <hi>(or countenancing those who assert them) will be effectual to make them abhor, loath, and fly from our Communion. And when they are once gotten to such a distance from us, I fear we shall hardly get them back again, but by quitting our Church-Livings and Preferments to them, and then we shall be</hi> throughly Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> Tritheism <hi>therefore is in a thriving condition amongst us, cannot be denied, nor so much as questioned. And the Causes of it are manifestly these two: First, The great and advantagious Station held by that Person in the Church, who first broached it here: And Secondly, The connivence which has ever since attended him in the Assertion of it. The first of which has created him several Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies amongst some poor empty Retainers, acted. by Hope and Hunger (as</hi> Hunger <hi>and</hi> Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness <hi>generally go together;) who to serve their Interest by his</hi> Favour, <hi>easily turn Proselytes to his</hi> Opinions; <hi>it being not Imaginable</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55921:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>that they should open their Mouths so wide</hi> for him, <hi>but to have them fill'd</hi> by him. <hi>But such mischiefs must always be expected from</hi> Heterodoxy <hi>in</hi> High Place; <hi>which is never so formidable for what it</hi> holds, <hi>as for what it has to</hi> give. <hi>For this still made the Pope an Over-match for a Council, and may at any time give an overgrown Heretick the vantage ground of Truth. Tho miserable, no doubt, must the state of that Church needs be, where men shall wear her</hi> Favours, <hi>so much to the prejudice of her</hi> Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the other Reason of the Fatal spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Poyson,</hi> viz. <hi>The</hi> Connivence <hi>and Encouragement attending the Person who first vented it; I shall not stick to affirm, That he who asserts any thing contrary to the Received Doctrine of the Church, (how much soever he may be favoured or abetted,</hi> dignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>or</hi> distinguished) <hi>is a</hi> scandal <hi>to the</hi> Gown <hi>he wears, and an Insufferable Reproach to the</hi> Church <hi>he wears it in. I very well know, That the judicial Proceedings of the Church and Senate of</hi> Bern <hi>against that wretehed Thitheist</hi> Gentilis, <hi>are no rule for us to proceed by, who have Laws of our own, which allow of no such severity (as I am far from desiring that they should.) Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, tho they are not a rule for us</hi> to proceed by, <hi>they may very well be a Rule for us</hi> to judg
<pb facs="tcp:55921:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by, <hi>so far at least, as to Conclude, That what upon the Maturest deliberation, was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Capital <hi>in one</hi> Reformed Church <hi>(and that a very great one too) cannot without scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal continue</hi> Uncensured <hi>and</hi> Unrebuked <hi>in Another; which yet this Detestable Tritheism has done for several years; and not only so, but the Publisher and Assertor of it, has been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto so far from any thing like Censure, or Rebuke, that he has been Advanced, Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced and Abetted to the utmost: And some talk of no less matters than his being mounted shortly to the Episcopal Chair and Dignity; tho some again think that it would be a very odd sight, in a Christian Church, to see a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist in a Bishoprick, and holding his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism with it in</hi> Commendam; <hi>for let this happen when it will, I dare undertake that the Promotion of the</hi> man <hi>will be the Degradation of the</hi> Office.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>However, this is certain, That the wounds which this man has given this poor Church, are deep and dangerous, and have been kept Bleeding so long, that now they begin to Fester and threaten some further mischief; and it is too late to dally any longer with the Cure. For, my Lords, your Lordships cannot but know that</hi> Tritheism <hi>is worse, and more Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Christianity, not only than</hi> Sabellia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, <hi>but even than</hi> Socinianism <hi>it self, as</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55921:6"/>
               <hi>being contrary to all Natural, as well as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, by destroying the grand, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fundamental Article of Both,</hi> viz. <hi>The</hi> Unity of the Godhead; <hi>which So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianism (how much soever it impugns and denies the Revealed Article of three distinct Persons in the Godhead) does not encroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And yet in a further degree is it worse than</hi> Arianism; <hi>for tho Arianism denies the Essential Deity of the Son, making him only a Glorious Deified Creature, or the</hi> First-born of the Creation, <hi>yet it still preserves the Unity of the Divine Essence entire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multiplied; which the Assertion of</hi> Three distinct Infinite, Eternal Minds or Spirits <hi>unavoidably multiplies, and by consequence destroys. Whereas the Unity of the Godhead is the very Foundation and Corner Stone of all True Religion, and as Essential an Article of the Christian Faith, as that of a Trinity of Persons it self; Both of them together mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up that great</hi> Depositum, <hi>which God has committed to us to keep inviolably, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend resolutely (and in a word) to</hi> save, <hi>as well as to</hi> be saved by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore. my Lords I shall recommend this important matter to your Lordships, much in those words of</hi> Mordecai <hi>to</hi> Esther. Who knows but that you are come to such high Place, Power and Dignity in our
<pb facs="tcp:55921:6"/>
Church for such a Time as This? <hi>And that God is now Trying whether you will make good the Zeal you have so often professed for our Religion heretofore, by doing something signal, great, and worthy of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions now. In a word, I look upon your Lordships as Persons of that Sincerity and Clearness of Principle, that if you believed this Doctrine</hi> of Three Distinct, Infinite, Eternal Minds, Spirits and Substances in the ever Blessed Trinity, <hi>to be True, you would boldly and openly Profess it, which since you do not, why should not so Scandalous a Corruption of our Faith, receive a Check by some mark of your Lordships Disapprobation? Hitherto I am sure there has been a Profound Silence in this matter; and I heartily wish, the Enemies of our Religion may not pass that nicking Reflexion upon it,</hi> Tacent, Satis Laudant. <hi>For in good earnest it is very hard that</hi> Heresy <hi>should over-run a Church, only because we must not call it</hi> Heresie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this is not the worst of our Case neither. For a certain Socinian Writer (by a Spirit of Prophecy coming upon him from</hi> some above) <note n="*" place="bottom">When the Nominal Trinitarians have call'd till they are <hi>hoarse, weary</hi> and <hi>asham'd,</hi> to Universities and Bishops to espouse their Cause, and Censure the real Trinitarians, <hi>&amp;c. All their Appeals</hi> notwithstanding, it will <hi>not be long e're they are told by their-Superiors in the Church,</hi> That it is expedient for them to be quiet, lest themselves be Censured as <hi>Sabellians</hi> Answer to Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> p. 68. col. 1.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:55921:7"/>
               <hi>positively tells the</hi> Nominal Trinitarians <hi>(as he calls those who assert a Trinity of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons, in opposition to that of</hi> Three distinct, Infinite Minds, Spirits, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances) that it will not be long before they be told by their Superiors in the Church, That it will concern them to be Quiet <hi>(that is, I suppose, to Write against Dr.</hi> Sherlock <hi>and his Tribe no more)</hi> lest they themselves be censured as Sabellians. <hi>Now this, upon my word, is very home, and sounds dreadfully indeed; and having been written about the middle of</hi> August <hi>last, lets us into a farther Understanding of the late Letter sent to the Vice-chancellor of</hi> Oxon, <hi>and shews, That there were</hi> Reprimands <hi>preparing for us long before that scandalous Sermon was Preached there, and consequently before the</hi> Oxford Censure <hi>could be thought of. And now if this be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so, is not our Church, think we, in a blessed Condition?</hi> viz. <hi>That first, the Assertors of its received Doctrine are to be censured; next, That They are to be Censured by their</hi> Superiors <hi>in and of the</hi> same Church. <hi>And thirdly, That they are to be Censured as</hi> Sabellian Hereticks. <hi>And lastly, That the Socinians must be made privy to this Design, while our Clergy knows nothing of it. What a dismal Aspect, I say, must all this needs have upon our Church and Clergy? But as for the Charge of</hi> Sabellia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism, <hi>which we are here threatned with, I hope</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55921:7"/>
               <hi>it will be</hi> proved against us, <hi>before we</hi> are Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured for it; <hi>and then we desire no greater security against such a Censure. For does not</hi> Sabellius <hi>hold only one single Subsistence in the Godhead, and no more? And can those then be</hi> Sabellians <hi>who hold three distinct Subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in the Same? And does not</hi> Sabellius <hi>allow only a Trinity of Names, as of</hi> Father, Son <hi>and</hi> Holy Ghost, <hi>and that Founded in a Trinity of Offices, as that the</hi> Father <hi>is the Creator of all things; the</hi> Son <hi>the Redeemer of Mankind; and the</hi> Holy Ghost, <hi>the Sanctifier of the Church? The Assumption of which</hi> Names <hi>and</hi> Offices <hi>having been a free effect of God's will, might by Consequence (had God so pleased) never have been at all; since nothing in the Divine Nature could make it necessary. But what is this to us, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain three such Subsistences in the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as are</hi> Eternal, Necessary <hi>and</hi> Inseparable <hi>(even by the Divine Power it self) both from the</hi> said Nature, <hi>and from</hi> one another. <hi>I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test I cannot tell whether there be more</hi> Malice <hi>or</hi> Ignorance <hi>in such a Charge (as often as some have the face to make it.) But such is the Nature of</hi> Malice, <hi>that while it opens mens</hi> Mouths, <hi>it commonly shuts their</hi> Eyes. <hi>In the mean time I would have this pert, medling Socinian know, That the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertors of a Trinity of Persons against Three Distinct, Infinite Minds or Spirits</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55921:8"/>
               <hi>are neither grown so</hi> hoarse <hi>with</hi> Appealing <hi>to Universities and Bishops, nor yet so</hi> weary <hi>and</hi> ashamed <hi>of so doing, but that in case such a censure should pass upon them from those</hi> Superiors <hi>he speaks of, they would have the Courage to appeal still; not indeed</hi> to them, <hi>but</hi> from them, <hi>and that to the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to all the Protestant Churches and Universities in</hi> Christendom. <hi>But, if what this Socinian has so boldly and positively said and Printed of them, be false (as for their own sakes I trust it is) I hope these</hi> Superiors <hi>will consider what may be the consequence of sitting down tamely under such a Slander. However, let matters go as they will,</hi> The Assertion of Three Divine Persons, in contradiction to Three Distinct, Infinite, Eternal Minds, Spirits or Substances in the ever blessed Trinity, <hi>is certainly the Cause of God, and he will not desert it, though others should.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The University of</hi> Oxford <hi>has appear'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry considerably in this matter already, and would have appeared yet further, and done much more had she not been hindred from doing what she was ready and desirous to do; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which that Great and Learned Body so ardently wished, and pressed for, as a Liberty</hi>

               <hi>But if, in the mean time, there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Failure or Defect (as some contend there is) in the late Censure so worthily passed upon the forementioned Propositions, by that Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meeting of the</hi> Vice-Chancellor, <hi>the</hi> Bp. of the Diocess, <hi>and</hi> other Heads of Colleges <hi>and</hi> Halls <hi>there, it is to be hoped, that your Lordships, to whom the Care of our Religion more immediately and peculiarly belongs, will vouchsafe to supply the said Defect by the greater Authority of your Episcopal Censure: For if so gross a Piece of Paganism as that which holds</hi> [Three Distinct Infinite Eternal Minds or Spirits in the Godhead], <hi>having been first vented by one in so considerable a Place and Dignity in our Church, and to this very Day persisted in, and moreover defended (to his poor Utmost) by one calling himself a</hi> Presbyter of the Church of <hi>England; and after that preached publickly before one of our</hi> Universities; <hi>and lastly, maintained from the Pulpit in one of our greatest</hi> Cathedrals <hi>Twice, shall continue Uncensured and Uncontrouled by the Governours of our Church; a<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>I Have here presented the Reader with this History, just as I find it publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by</hi> Aretius, <hi>though I am not ignorant, that several Parts and Passages of it will seem foreign to the purpose, I produee it for.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am not here concerned to make an exact Parallel between the Heresie of</hi> Valentinus Gentilis, <hi>and the Opinion of Dr.</hi> Sherlock, <hi>as to all the Particularities and Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of each; it being enough for my purpose, that they agree, and are the same, as to the</hi>

               <hi>main of both;</hi> (viz.) <hi>The Assertion of</hi> Three Eternal Spirits in the Blessed Trinity: <hi>But my chief Design is to shew the Noble Concern of a</hi> Protestant <hi>City and Senate in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so High an Article as that of the</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <hi>against this Heretical Tritheistical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation upon it.</hi>

               <hi>And accordingly I have given the Reader not the entire History only, but also the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle prefixed to it, and Dedicatory of it to the Lords of the Senate, that so it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all, That it was not written and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed at the sole Will and Pleasure of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man, but by the Order and Authority of the Governors of the Place, thereby Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Avowing their Proceedings against this Heretick, to the whole World: And I cannot but, in Honour to them, wish that all Christian Governours and Governments would shew the same Magnanimous Zeal and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in the</hi> Defence of their Faith; <hi>though I confess, I wish not, that they should do the</hi> same way.</p>

can comprehend his infinite Power, no Eye approach so glorious a Light, no Tongue can declare it: And for this reason the more sound Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have been very sparing in their Discourses upon this Subject. <hi>Plato</hi> is commended for his Modesty in this case; who, tho' he is not afraid to stile God, The Creator of the World, a Lover of Mankind, and the provident Curator of all things, (Forasmuch as he is a most Wise Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and doth not slight and despise the Work of his own Wisdom;) yet notwithstanding all this confesseth, That the Eyes of Men are too weak, to see through Matters of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> was satisfied with placing some one first Mover in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. But he dares not say one word about the Nature of God. Others thought fit wholly to omit this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. The Judgment of <hi>Simonides</hi> on the Case is commonly known;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55921:13"/>
who being ask't by <hi>Hiero</hi> about the Nature of God, prolong'd the time <hi>a good while,</hi> by requesting more Days for Deliberation, and at last return'd this Answer, <hi>The more I think on't, the less I understand of it.</hi> After such a manner did the Excellency of this Divine Nature exercise and tire the liveliest Wits without the Church, that they were at last forc'd to acknowledge the inscrutability of the Majesty thereof: And on the other side they perceiv'd such a blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and decay of strength in Human Nature, as rendred it utterly incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of raising it self to such a degree of purity without a peculiar dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation from above.</p>
            <p>And tho' within the Church this Doctrine of God has always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd more uncorrupted and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous; yet nevertheless the most Religious have thought it a great piece of Wisdom, to confess their own weakness in this Affair; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55921:14"/>
have therefore been contented with those Discoveries, God has been pleas'd to make of himself, and have desisted from any farther search into this Sublime Mystery. Hence in the Invocation of him this Phrase is made use of; <hi>God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>God of</hi> Isaac, <hi>God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>God of our Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. And when <hi>Iacob</hi> made too curious an Enquiry after the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel's Name, he was repell'd by the Rays of the Divine Majesty, and reprimanded by a Voice; <hi>Wherefore is it, that thou askest after my Name? Moses</hi> also upon his asking after the Name of God, who sent him to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> received only this answer, <hi>I am that I am;</hi> and say, <hi>I am hath sent me unto you.</hi> We ought therefore in this business also to take notice of the Apostle's Advice, <hi>Not to think, above what we ought to think, but to think soberly.</hi> For it's most certain, when we cast our thoughts on things relating to God,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55921:14"/>
our Understanding sees as little, if not less, than the Owl at Noon-day. But since there is a necessity still of Man's being instructed concerning God, and this instruction is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the Church alone, 'tis the best way to keep strictly <hi>to one form of speaking,</hi> drawn from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical and Evangelical Writings; because the Church has taken these from God's own Mouth; whence the Apostle calls the Scripture <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or inspired. And this the Church kept pure and undefiled, till a parcel of Ambitious Men rose up, who laying no restraint on their wild Fancies, made a very ill use of the simplicity of the Scripture, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to affix <hi>New Interpretations</hi> to Texts. To keep these Fellows within their Bounds, and to shew that their Opinions were contrary to Scripture, 'twas necessary, that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Men should limit the sense of things in other words.

since. Words were to be interpreted by Words, and Phrases by other forms of Speech, they referr'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Writings to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Forasmuch as no one can speak better of God, than God doth of himself. And therefore, when we are to speak of him, it's our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to consult him first speaking of himself. Moreover as it's impious to deny the use of Scripture-Forms of speaking; so it's <hi>downright Malice to condemn those that are commonly receiv'd,</hi> so long as reason proves not, that they maintain any thing against Scripture. In Ecclesiastical Histories and Acts of Synods there are abundance of Examples (were they pertinent to be mention'd here) of this Nature.

               <p>
                  <hi>VAlentinus Gentilis,</hi> a <hi>Campanian,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lest his Native Countrey <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentia,</hi> Travell'd through <hi>Naples, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and at last arriv'd at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva.</hi> There were at that time in the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Church [of that City] several Persons out of all parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> who came thither upon very different accounts; but were mostly such, as being Banish'd out of their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55921:19"/>
own Country for the sake of Religion, had made this their place of Refuge. Amongst them were several <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <note place="margin">So that Dr. <hi>Sherl.</hi> may find sevaral <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, much Antienter than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> Inventers of New Doctrines. Such was <hi>G. Blandrata</hi> a Physician, who had newly began to attack the Doctrine of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but as yet all he did was in private on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by way of Letters to some familiar Acquaintance. The Dispute was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the commonly received Terms, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. At the <note place="margin">☞</note> same time <hi>M. Gribaldus</hi> an eminent Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, and <hi>Paulus Alciatus</hi> a <hi>Milanese</hi> were engag'd in carrying on the same design. <hi>Gentilis</hi> was no sooner come to Town, and heard of the Controversie, but he wholly applied himself to the Study of it. And in a short time he and his Friends became so great Proficients in it, as boldly to assert, That the Reform'd Churches were still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with the <hi>Papists</hi> in that abominable and grievous Error, of subscribing to the Article of the Trinity: For by that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of theirs, they as well as the <hi>Papists,</hi> did not defend a Trinity, but rather a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. That a <hi>true Trinity ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">So says <hi>Philopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Joa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> with the rest of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistick Tribe.</note> 
                  <hi>of Three Eternal distinct Spirits, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from each other essentially rather than personally.</hi> This was what these Innovators did then unanimously profess; but falling afterwards into different Factions, they ran
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55921:19"/>
into several contradictory and extravagant Opinions: And being call'd to account for their Doctrines at <hi>Geneva,</hi> they all made a shift some way or other to get off; by what particular means, I shall not now concern my self; my chief design being to give a brief account of <hi>Gentilis</hi> only.</p>
               <p>Who though he had undertaken to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the same Opinions with <hi>Blandrata, Gribaldus,</hi> and <hi>Alciatus,</hi> yet shortly after made his Recantation, and by an exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pennance, publickly abjur'd his Novel Doctrines. This happen'd in the Year 1558; to testifie the truth of which there is extant a Narrative of the whole Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>But having thus solemnly renounc'd his own Opinions more for fear of Death, than out of any real sense of their Impiety, and still retaining a strong desire, of defending them, it was not long, e're despising the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Calvin</hi> says that he had most perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for sworn himself <hi>Thrice.</hi> But <hi>Tritheists</hi> must be allowed to have more skill in dealing with an Oath, than other Men. See <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Narrative of <hi>Gentilis,</hi> in his <hi>Opuscula,</hi> p. 764.</note> sacred Obligations of his Oath, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the most horrid Perjury, he fled from <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Near which place was the Town of <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae,</hi> where <hi>M. Gribaldus</hi> lived, with whom
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55921:20"/>
he associated himself: And in the same place was <hi>Alciatus,</hi> and with him a certain School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, and Tutor to <hi>Gribaldus</hi>'s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; amongst whom (after the coming of <hi>Gentilis)</hi> there were frequent Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Disputes about the same Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies; by all which <hi>Gentilis</hi> was mightily confirm'd in his Notions: And so leaving them, he went to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where he was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with plenty of Books by one <hi>Baptista Lucensis,</hi> and there made Collections out of the Fathers in order to confirm and establish his new Opinions. And seeing both the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers were universally quoted by the Orthodox, he made it his business to consult the most ancient of them.</p>
               <p>But the Collections he made, were only some miserable, imperfect, broken Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epistles, <hi>Iustin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian;</hi> nay, so impudent was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>St.</hi> Hilary.</note> he, as to ransack the <hi>Alcoran</hi> for Authorities, and quote even <hi>Mahomet</hi> himself. And then he very roundly condemn'd and exploded all the rest of the Fathers, such as St. <hi>Austin,</hi> St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> St. <hi>Basil, Chrysostome, Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene,</hi> and whoever else had plainly express'd their Thoughts concerning the Trinity in a different way from him. Nay, he wholly rejected some Books in <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and question'd the Authority of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55921:20"/>
others. And because so grand an Affair could not be successfully manag'd without Writing, he set himself upon that also; and in a short time wrote a Book, entituled his <hi>Antidotes,</hi> wherein he endeavour'd to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himself against his Adversaries of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and to answer the Objections, which the Ministers of the <hi>Italian</hi> Congregation there, had produc'd against his Opinions. The Book, which he made was not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd, but was found lying by him in <hi>MSS.</hi> Being now furnish'd with new Arguments and Reasons, he went to <hi>Grenoble,</hi> where his dear Friend <hi>Gribaldus</hi> was then publick Professor. And besides all this he was now fall'n into a Distemper, which forc'd the needy Gentleman to seek out for a place, where he might be kindly receiv'd, and find a comfortable retirement and subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence during his Sickness.</p>
               <p>Whilst he was under Cure, his Principles began to be known abroad, upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he was commanded by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates to exhibit a Confession of his Faith, which he so cunningly contrived, by abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Reform'd Churches, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> that it was admitted for Orthodox by the <note n="*" place="margin">Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by <hi>Genebrar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Papists.</hi> But he said nothing at all to the purpose as to the main point and business of the Controversie. From thence he went to <hi>Chambrey</hi> a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55921:21"/>
Town, but being disturb'd in this place also, he return'd to <hi>Fargiae.</hi> By this time his Doctrines began to make a noise in the World. For <hi>Geneva,</hi> being not far off, was able to give an <hi>ample Testimony</hi> of the <note place="margin">See the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of him by <hi>Calvin</hi> in his <hi>Opus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula.</hi>
                  </note> whole Proceedings. And he himself was well enough known by his rambling about at <hi>Lyons, Chambrey, Grenoble,</hi> and in <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Town of <hi>Fargiae</hi> is in the Presecture of <hi>Gaium,</hi> and belongs to the Illustrious Lords of <hi>Bern.</hi> The Governour of which place being advertis'd of the arrival of this Pestilent Fellow, order'd his Officers to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him, and bring him to <hi>Gaium;</hi> where he was put into Custody, but after some time, was releas'd out of Prison, tho' still bound to his good Behaviour. But notwithstanding all this, he still continued industriously to propagate his Errors, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that his Opinions did in any wise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the publick Peace.</p>
               <p>And here he play'd a fresh Prank. For when the Governour had demanded of him a Confession, with design to send it to <hi>Bern,</hi> there to be examin'd by the Clergy; what did <hi>Gentilis</hi> do, but sent it to the Press, pretending the Governour's Command for so doing: To this Confession he added some Propositions with many seurrilous Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions upon St. <hi>Athanasius.</hi> Nor was this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55921:21"/>
enough, but he must likewise abuse the Name and Authority of the Governour, by Dedicating his Book to him, which so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incens'd the Governour, that could he have laid hold of the Offender, he would immediately have thrown him into Gaol again.</p>
               <p>Hence he went back to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where the Provost of the City put him into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for the very same Doctrine, and kept him there almost two Months, but at last he gain'd his Liberty by much such another Trick as before. For he so soften'd his Book of <hi>Antidotes</hi> and <hi>Confession,</hi> that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seem'd Libels against Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> than Treatises against the Trinity; and so he got free.</p>
               <p>The next Summer he went into <hi>Poland,</hi> being invited thither by <hi>Blandrata</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatus,</hi> who look'd upon him as a fit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to raise Innovations in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Poland.</hi> Here he stay'd for above two Years, to the great Mischief both of Church and State. And had not Divine Providence confounded the Designs of these Men, by setting them at variance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, 'tis probable the Wounds they had given Religion might have proved more dangerous to the Church. For <hi>Blandrata</hi> and <hi>Gentilis</hi> turn'd <hi>Arians,</hi> and <hi>Alciatus</hi> a Mahometan; and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55921:22"/>
others (as their wild Fancies led them) embrac'd more monstrous and extravagant Opinions. And thus having disturb'd the Peace of the Church, they now began to quarrel amongst themselves: And that this is true, the present unhappy state of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> does sufficiently testifie. The Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Blandrata</hi> were arriv'd to such a pitch as to avow and openly defend the Doctrine of <hi>Arius.</hi> They condemn'd the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the Creed made by it; ridicul'd and exploded the Terms <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <note place="margin">As Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> and his Trithei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers now do in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Some denied the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Son of God, and others im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn'd the Immortality of the Soul; a third sort asserted, that our Saviour had his Beginning and Existence from the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> a fourth allow'd of <hi>Polygamy;</hi> and a fifth sort became Patrons of the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> These are the sad Effects of those Spirits of Error, which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan (by the just Judgment of God) sends to delude the old, decaying World. How great the Distractions and Confusions were that follow'd the Publication of these erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Doctrines, we may easily gather from the King's Proclamation, strictly commanding all such Strangers as were Setters up of New Doctrines, immediately to depart the Kingdom; by which Edict, <hi>Gentilis,</hi> amongst the rest, was driven out
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55921:22"/>
of <hi>Poland.</hi> Being expell'd <hi>Poland,</hi> his next Journey was into <hi>Moravia,</hi> where he join'd with the Anabaptists. From thence he went to <hi>Vienna;</hi> every where, as he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd, dispersing his new invented No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>But still continuing unsettled, indeed being able to stay no where, he began to think of returning into <hi>Savoy,</hi> believing, as he said, the Churches there to be the most moderate, and less infected of any whatever; and, besides this, he was in hopes to find <hi>Gribaldus,</hi> and the rest of his Accomplices alive, from whom he might receive assistance; Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> (whom he always found a most zealous Adversary to all his Novelties) being now dead. All these Considerations put together, made him look upon <hi>Savoy,</hi> at this time, as the most secure place of Retirement, after so many dangerous Adventures. But as the wise Providence of God had ordain'd he should by his own Folly blindly run on upon ruin, he came to <hi>Gaium,</hi> where the very same Governour, he had formerly affronted, was then by an extraordinary Commission, continued Governor of that Province. To him <hi>Gentilis</hi> made his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and begg'd of him the Favour of a Publick Disputation: The Governour's Answer was, He should be sure to have
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55921:23"/>
Justice done him: And thereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to Prison. Thus was this subtle, cunning Heretick, who had been so insufferably troublesome to so many Churches, brought into such straits, that He was never afterward able to extricate himself.</p>
               <p>This I thought necessary to be at large premised, that the Reader might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be inform'd, how he came to fall into these strange Absurdities; and in what Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he dispers'd them; what a Disturber he had been of the Peace of the Church; how oft he had brought himself by these Practices into very dangerous Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and yet still by some crafty Evasion or other, made a shift to escape, till at last Divine Justice brought him to condign Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>

               <p>THE Senate of <hi>Bern</hi> were soon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Confinement at <hi>Gaium,</hi> which happen'd on the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1566. And understanding, (1.) That he maintain'd and taught the same Errors he once had abjur'd; and, (2.) That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he had involv'd himself in a grievous Perjury; (3.) That he had condemned our Church as still subject to Papal Slavery; when at the same time he himself, tho' in a Popish Country, could publish such a Confession, as easily procur'd him Liberty. (4.) That he had actually endeavour'd to undermine the Doctrine of the Trinity. (5.) That <hi>Poland</hi> had been mightily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed by him and his Accomplices. (6.) That the Ring-Leaders of the Faction (who formerly did all profess the same Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) were now altogether by the Ears; one an <hi>Arian,</hi> and another a <hi>Mahometan, &amp;c.</hi> (7.) That their Doctrines were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly condemn'd throughout <hi>Germany,</hi>

                  <p>Concerning his Writings and the Heads of his Accusation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AT <hi>Bern</hi> he continued under Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for some time, without having any thing else done to him. At last, by command of the Senate, the Papers, which were found about him, were examined.</p>
               <p>The first was a Book wrote with his own hand, and dedicated to <hi>Sigismund</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> consisting of 29 Sheets and 175 Leaves. In this Book was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the whole System of his Doctrine, and Principles; tho he affirmed he had one much more compleat, transcribed by <hi>Blandrata.</hi> In the Epistle Dedicatory, which is very long, he courts the Favour, and begs the Protection of his Majesty, both for Himself and his Cause. Then repeats the Confessions he made at <hi>Geneva,</hi> before his Recantation; the last of which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions having been confuted by them of <hi>Geneva,</hi> he subjoins to it, by way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, his Book of <hi>Antidotes,</hi> which he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55921:25"/>
formerly composed at <hi>Lyons.</hi> Then he falls upon refuting the <hi>13th.</hi> Chapter of the first Book of <hi>Calvin's</hi> Institutions; and, in the same place, utterly condemns the Doctrine of the Trinity, as it had hitherto been delivered and taught in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches whatever. Next to that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces several Propositions out of St. <hi>Austin;</hi> especially out of his fifteen Books of the Trinity, which together with their incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Author, he rejects and exposes with all <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Much like Dr.</hi> Sherlock's Modest Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>imaginable Scurrility.</hi> After that he produces several nice Passages out of the Scripture, the Fathers, and the Alcoran, in defence of his Doctrine. And last of all annexes his Annotations upon <hi>Athanasius</hi> to the end of the Book.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There were found some Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses wrote with his own hand, being nothing else but a bitter Scurrilous Libel against the Blessed Trinity, and its Worshippers.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A Book in <hi>Italian,</hi> with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Latine</hi> of the same strain, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Incarnation of Christ.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A printed Book under a false Name, dedicated to the Governour of <hi>Gaium,</hi> with a preliminary Discourse to the Clergy; which though it carries <hi>Antwerp</hi> in the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Page, yet was indeed Printed at <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55921:25"/>
Out of all these Papers were collected se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Articles, with the Heads of an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be preferr'd against him, which are all reducible to these four particulars.</p>
               <p>First, That he dissented from Us, and <note place="margin">So does Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.</hi>
                  </note> all the Orthodox in the Doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That he had thrown many Scandalous and unheard of Imputations upon our Church, and charg'd her with Heresie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That his Writings contain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny impious Blasphemies, frequently us'd by him in his Disputes concerning the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that in his Behaviour he could not abstain from the like impudent Scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, All the Cheats and Impostures were notoriously evident, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly us'd in disguising his Opinions, in working out his own Deliverance, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing others, to the danger of their Lives: But of this in its proper place.</p>
               <p>When these things were urg'd against him, namely, That</p>
               <p>First, He had entertain'd intolerable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Notions about the Trinity. That</p>
               <p>Secondly, He had falsly charg'd us with several Errours, which none of us did ever
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55921:26"/>
defend, nay, more would never permit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Body else that did harbour or maintain such Notions. That</p>
               <p>Thirdly, His Writings were fill'd with many horrid Blasphemies, reflecting not so much on the Persons of his Adversaries, as on the Sacred Subject in dispute, And</p>
               <p>Lastly, That by his shuffling and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Digressions, he so mightily perplex'd and obscur'd the Cause, as gave too just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to suspect he did industriously seek for Evasions. We therefore desir'd him fairly and honestly to give in his Answer to each particular that should be asked him.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Gentilis</hi> made a long Speech about the Infirmity of his Body, the craziness of his Head, and the weakness of his Memory (which was now so mightily decay'd, that he could scarce remember the Actions of one whole Day, and therefore being in such a condition, might not perhaps be able to give a reasonable Answer to all their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories) with many more of the like idle Excuses, to avoid being brought to the Bar as a Malefactor, and gain the priviledge of being heard as Plaintiff, which unless they granted him, he protested he could not have Justice done him in so weighty a Cause.</p>

            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:55921:26"/>
               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Whether he ought to have been heard as Plaintiff.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THIS Exception of his must first be answer'd: But let any Honest Man judge, what grounds he could have for such a Declinatory Plea, besides the crafty design of prescribing such a Form of Tryal, so advantageous to himself, that he was sure to have none, or at most but very few Prosecutors, and withal to gain the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of arraigning whom he pleas'd.</p>
               <p>To make this case more plain and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, I shall here take the trouble of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating those Arguments, he propos'd in his own defence upon this occasion.</p>
               <p>First, He pleaded that his coming to Town was Voluntary, and on purpose to treat with the Honourable Senate concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same Business he was now indicted for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:55921:27"/>
Secondly, He urg'd his being an Assertor of the Sovereignty of God the Father, and a zealous Defender of the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel against false and Heterodox Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He pretended that he was not yet convicted of any such erroneous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, [as were laid to his charge:]</p>
               <p>And Lastly, Thought it was very hard he should be bound to give in his Answer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew who were to be his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers.</p>
               <p>In answer to which he was desir'd first to consider his present Circumstances; That he was under Confinement, and Prisoner to a Christian Magistrate; which was no proper Qualification for a Plaintiff, but rather the Sign of an Offender.</p>
               <p>In the next place he was told, it was but just and equitable for him in the quality of a <hi>Prisoner,</hi> to hear first the Charge that lay against him, or the causes of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and then fairly to give in his Answers, and clear himself, if he desir'd to be released; but that nothing could be more repugnant to the Practise of all Courts, than for a Person in Chains to turn Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:55921:27"/>
First, As for his pretence of coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther voluntarily, that was thought to be an excuse not at all material, since Malefactors do by the just Judgment of God frequently of their own accord thrust themselves into places most dangerous and fatal to them. And though it be true, that he came vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to <hi>Gaium,</hi> yet being there appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and for certain Reasons committed to Prison, he still continued a Prisoner, and under that Quality it was, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to <hi>Bern.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Equally impertinent were his vain Pretensions of vindicating the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of God the Father, and of asserting the Truth of the Gospel against false Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; since we were not yet satisfied of the legality of his Call. Nor could we give any credit to those extraordinary Horrours and unusual Convulsions he pretended to have twice felt, when at Prayers in <hi>Geneva;</hi> as if he had been instigated by the secret Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Holy Ghost to pronounce the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of that Church, <hi>Defenders of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, As to his Errors and false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, we were of Opinion that he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no farther Conviction, than his own abjuration of them at <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent publick Penance, when Sentence
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55921:28"/>
was given against him in the following words, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis the Iudgment of the Court, that you</hi> Valentinus Gentilis, <hi>undergo the following Punishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, <hi>That you shall be stript close to your Shirt, then barefoot and bareheaded shall carry in your hand a lighted Torch, and beg God's Pardon and ours on your Knees, by confessing your self maliciously and wickedly to have spread abroad a false and Heretical Doctrine; but that you do now from your heart detest and abhor those abominable, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Blasphemous Books, you compos'd in its defence; in Testimony whereof you shall cast them with your own Hands into the Flames, there to be burnt to Ashes; and for more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple satisfaction we do enjoyn you to be led through all the Streets of this City, at the sound of the Trumpet, and habited as before; and do strictly command you not to depart this City without permission,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Therefore seeing he had so publickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd the same Doctrines which he now endeavoured to revive, and after so singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar a manner done Pennance for them; which yet he now endeavoured to revive, it would be absurd to admit of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by such a faithless shuffling Advocate.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55921:28"/>
Besides, he could not be ignorant what a grievous Perjury he had committed by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Geneva</hi> without permission, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>the Oath</hi> he had once took; this last Charge was so notorious, that he could give no other Answer, but that he was sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To the last Exception, of his not knowing who were to be his Accusers, our Answer was, We would 1. Produce the same Persons who had formerly impleaded him, when he made his Recantation at <hi>Geneva.</hi> And 2. Those who had banish'd him with the rest of his Heretical Accomplices out of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and if these were not enough, we had in store the Churches of <hi>Germany,</hi> by whom his Opinions were condemned, as savouring of <hi>Arianism.</hi> And</p>
               <p>Lastly, We had the <note n="*" place="margin">And those I suppose passed in their respective <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Decreta</hi> of several Universities, whereby his Doctrine was exploded, and himself by Name condemn'd for an Heretick; particularly <hi>Alexander A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepius,</hi> of the University of <hi>Lipswick,</hi> was present, ready to testifie against him; so that it seems one of the strangest things in the World for him to pretend ignorance of his Accusers, when he had in all places found, so many and so considerable Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55921:29"/>
Now all this being so notorious, that the most frontless Impudence could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Syllable of it, I think nothing can be more plain, than that he ought not to be admitted as Plaintiff, and that upon these Accounts.</p>
               <p>First, As having once already renounc'd the Doctrine he now went about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because he was guilty of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury</hi> in the same case.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As being indicted by so many known Accusers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Because he had endeavour'd to undermine one of the <hi>prime Articles of our Faith,</hi> an Article so essential to the very <note place="margin">☞</note> being of Christianity, that in the worst and darkest times of Popery, it still continued pure and uncorrupted.</p>
               <p>And Lastly, Because the leading Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of this new Doctrine had not yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon their Principles: For according to his own Confession, <hi>Blandrata</hi> turn'd <hi>Arian, Alciat</hi> a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and <hi>Gribaldus</hi> were still of different O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. For when our Confession was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd him, to which <hi>Gribaldus</hi> had formerly subscrib'd, he disapprov'd and condemn'd it, withall affirming <hi>Gribalaus</hi> to have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55921:29"/>
committed a grievous. Sin by subscribing it.</p>
               <p>Upon these Accounts he was debarr'd from being a Plaintiff (whether justly or not, let the World judge) and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give in a particular Answer to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles preferr'd against him.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AND now we desire the whole Church of God, and the Piety of all succeeding Ages to judge of the following Positions, wherein he does either by an impudent prevarication scandalize and bespatter us, or, which is far worse, impiously blaspheme God.</p>
               <p>And first, He calls the <hi>Trinity</hi> a mere human Invention, not so much as known to any Catholick Creed, and directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly he affirms, That the Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is <hi>that One only God,</hi> set forth to us in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That the Son is not of himself, but of the Father, to whom He is Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as to his <hi>Maker,</hi> [or <hi>Essentiator.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:55921:30"/>
Fourthly, The Father, Son and Holy Ghost are not only three distinct Persons, but have also <hi>Three distinct Essences or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Son was begotten by the Father, according to his Substance, and differs from the Father as a <hi>Subordinate Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>There are in the Trinity Three</hi>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE adorable Mystery of the Trinity is the constant Subject that runs thrô all his Writings: A Subject which he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles after such a rate, as that he seems nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have thought nor wrote of any thing else, for the space at least of 8 Years last past.</p>
               <p>In all which his principal design is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance such a distinction in the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as might make the three Persons <hi>three distinct Spirits of different order and degree.</hi> As when we say, <hi>The Father of our Lord Iesus Christ</hi> is a Person in the Individual Trinity, <hi>Gentilis</hi> will have this to be false, and that we ought to say, <hi>The Father of our Lord Iesus Christ is that one God</hi> [is God alone.] Again, when we say Father, Son and Holy Ghost are one God Eternal, he here accuses us of Heresie, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, The Father alone is God of himself, [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Whereas we on the contrary do admit of no degrees in the Godhead, and do positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly assert, That the Essence of God is but one single Essence, not Subordinate (or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Superiority and Inferiority.)

                  </gap>, or God of himself; and scornfully upbraids us with wresting the Term, <hi>Unus,</hi> proper only to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to signifie the Unity of Essence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the three Persons, contending that we ought to say, The Father, Son and Holy Ghost are <hi>Unum,</hi> but they are by no means <hi>Unus,</hi> or one God. Therefore when we say, <hi>[And yet not Three Eternals, but one Eternal;] Gentilis</hi> will have this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55921:33"/>
to be a grand mistake; for that they <hi>are Three Eternal Spirits,</hi> which cannot be One or <hi>Unus.</hi> Thus I have briefly, and with what plainness I could, collected his Tenets out of his own Writings, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he has frequently own'd and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to defend in common Discourse and Conversation.</p>
               <p>In short, the Sum of what he asserted, is briefly this; That the Father is one God, the Son another God, and the Holy Ghost a third God; That they are all One, <hi>(Unum)</hi> yet not <hi>unus Deus</hi> [one God] but three Subordinate Spirits; that the Father only is properly to be call'd, <hi>The One God,</hi> who alone is of himself, and strictly <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Here it is to be observ'd, That when we say <hi>One God,</hi> that Expression may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood two ways.</p>
               <p>First, One <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Unity of the Godhead.</hi> But the Universal Consent of the Catholick Church teaches us quite otherwise; namely, That God is <hi>One in Essence,</hi> which one Essence subsists in three Persons. In this sence hath the Church hitherto expounded the Apostles Creed. <hi>I Believe in God.</hi> But what God do you believe in? Why, <hi>in the Father Son and Holy Ghost.</hi> Thus the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed added the Term <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>[of the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance]</hi> to express the Identity of Substance in opposition to the Blasphemies of <hi>Arius.</hi> And the Creed of <hi>Athanasius</hi> in express terms tells us, We must confess the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost not to be Three Gods, but One God, neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance.

For there is not an Arranter Piece of Sophistry, than to use Words in a different sence from that, wherein they have usually been received and taken? 'Tis true indeed, we ought not to be over Nice in our Expressions; and wrangle about Words, when we are agreed as to the thing; but what madness is it to <hi>Coin new Terms,</hi> and cry down the old without <hi>any reason</hi> or necessity? It is <note place="margin">Let Dr. <hi>Sherl</hi> and his Party give a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Answer to this, if they can.</note> in my Opinion equally adviseable to retain the <hi>Language,</hi> as well as to imitate the <hi>Manners</hi> of our wise Forefathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:55921:34"/>
But to come to the business: The Word Trinity in this Question does not signifie an Abstracted Number, as when we say in Latin <hi>ternio, quaternio,</hi> [in English three or four Units] but it denotes an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, something really existing; thence it is that the Trinity was call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Conformably to which the Greek Fathers, <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> St. <hi>Basil, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascen,</hi> and also the Latins, do generally speak of the Trinity. And therefore <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis</hi> is much in the wrong, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, because the Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, and the Trinity likewise God, therefore there are four Persons of the Godhead; and whoever asserts this, must likewise assert a Quater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, not a Trinity. We do absolutely deny the consequence. For no body says that the Trinity as <hi>distinct from,</hi> and <hi>without</hi> the Persons of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is God <note n="*" place="margin">Or that the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists by it self, out of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but actually and wholly in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</note> For the very being of the Trinity [and of the Godhead too] is in these three Persons, and without them there can be neither Godhead, nor Essence of the Godhead. But the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence had been this, the Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, and these three are One, therefore there is in the Godhead a Trinity of Persons; nor by asserting of this do we in any wise set
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55921:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
up a new God or Idol. But to proceed, the Word <hi>[Trinity]</hi> was not without very good reason brought into the Church. For the Bishops assembled with <hi>Athanasius</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> [as we are told by <hi>Sozomen, l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>Hist. trip.]</hi> to defend and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the Decree of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the consubstantiality of the Father, Son, and H. Ghost, in opposition to the turbulent <hi>Arians,</hi> sixt upon the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Trinity, thereby intending to signifie the three Persons of the same Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, not <hi>dividing</hi> the <hi>Substance,</hi> nor <hi>confounding</hi> the <hi>Persons.</hi> And ever since the Word has been made use of by all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Councils, as well as by the Greek and Latin Fathers. Nay, the Scripture it self speaks to the very same purpose, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>There are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and these Three are One.</hi> And so likewise in the Baptism of Christ, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. and in the Institution of Baptism, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. there is plain mention made of three Persons. 'Tis therefore an impudent and a frontless rash Censure, to call the Trinity a meer Human Invention, utterly unknown to the Orthodox Creeds. The <hi>Nicene, Alexandrian,</hi> and <hi>Ephesine</hi> Creeds, are all confessedly Orthodox, and yet all make use of the Word Trinity.

But here he replies, they never <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd the Trinity to be a God.</hi> I must <note place="margin">☜</note> profess, I can't tell what he would be at with his <hi>Deus Trinitas:</hi> If by it he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands a fourth Person, it is one of his own making; and we may justly explode both him and his fancy; and he well deserves the Name of Impious Libertine, that in a matter of so great importance dares fly to these wicked Cavils; but if by <hi>Deus Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas</hi> he understands <hi>Deus Trinus,</hi> or a Trinity in the Godhead <note n="*" place="margin">Or a Trinity which is God.</note> 'tis plain he has asserted a notorious falshood, since we have already prov'd both Councils and Fathers to have us'd the Word Trinity in this Sence, and that a Trinity in the Godhead was no Novelty to them.</p>
               <p>Thus our Crafty Adversary would sain father upon us the Notion of a <hi>Deus Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas,</hi> distinct from, or without the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghost. But 'tis all perfect Calumny; and God forbid the Church of Christ should be ever guilty of such a Blasphemous Position. I think it needless to dwell any longer upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Word <hi>Trinitas,</hi> since we have evidently demonstrated [whatever <hi>Valentinus</hi> vainly pretends to the contrary] that by a Trinity we understand <gap reason="foreign">

For whatever we can say of God is too mean, and falls much below the dignity of his immense and glorious Majesty.

               <argument>
                  <p>What was the Opinion of <hi>Arius,</hi> and wherein <hi>Gentilis</hi> and he do agree.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUT since it is yet disputed by many, what was the Heresie of <hi>Arius;</hi> it will therefore be worth our while briefly to enquire into his Opinions. Especially since matters are now come to such a pass, that Men dare openly avouch, That he was not Condemn'd for allowing the <hi>Father on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be God,</hi> but rather for asserting the Son of God to be a mere Creature. Here are then two Propositions, <hi>(Viz.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, That <hi>the Son of God was a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Arius</hi> asserted this, but <hi>Gentilis</hi> doth not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That <hi>the Father alone is the One Most High God, who dwells in Light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible.</hi> This <hi>Gentilis</hi> does affirm, but <hi>Arius</hi> seems not to have Asserted it. <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis</hi> takes a great deal of pains in stating the difference between these two Positions, to avoid (if possible) falling in with <hi>Arius.</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:55921:39"/>
However if his Assertion be true, and it belongs only to the Father to be styl'd <hi>the One only God,</hi> I cannot for my part see any reason why he and <hi>Arius</hi> should keep at such a distance. For according to <hi>Gentilis</hi> he would have said nothing but truth, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was never call'd in question by the Fathers, for calling Christ <hi>the Son of God;</hi> since that Assertion of his was true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly Orthodox.</p>
               <p>But if the difference be only in Words, and the sense of both Propositions be the same, there needs no proof, that they agree in their Notions. To make this appear, let us enquire in what manner <hi>Arius</hi> his Opinion has been deliver'd down to us. We find in <hi>Theodor. l.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> making complaint, that <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> denied the Divinity of Christ. His Words are these, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> Denying the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our Saviour, and making him of the same Nature with all other Men; and presently after, <hi>They attribute to him</hi> (says he) <hi>a Temporal Beginning.</hi> For thus speaks <hi>Arius</hi> himself. <gap reason="foreign">

i. e. <hi>There was a time when the Son of God was not,</hi> &amp;c. His Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is related after the same manner, <hi>Hist. Trip.</hi> lib. 1. cap. 13. <hi>Deus,</hi> say they, <hi>non semper Pater fuit, non semper fuit Dei ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum, sed fuit, quando Deus non Pater fuit, Dei autem verbum ex non existentibus factum fuit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> God was not always a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor did the Word always exist, but there was a time, when God was not a Father, and the Word was made out of nothing. To the same purpose <hi>Nicephorus, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>Deus non semper Pater erat, sed erat cùm Deus Pater non erat. Non sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per igitur Dei verbum erat, sed ex non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istentibus factum est. Qui enim erat Deus, illum, qui non erat, ex non existente fecit,</hi> &amp;c. You may see more to this purpose in the same Book, <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 18. From all which it does appear, that <hi>Arius</hi> did in the first place divide the Essence of God, making one Essence of the Father, and another of the Son, and after that assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only a temporal Original to the Son; and therefore he so earnestly condemn'd the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that he might carry his Point for the <hi>Separation of Essence.</hi> And deny'd the co-eternity of the Son, that he might thereby establish the Notion of his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Original. From hence follow'd more
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55921:40"/>
monstrous Absurdities, <hi>viz. That the Son of God was a mere Creature; and that he was made out of nothing.</hi> For they were very well satisfied, that the Essence of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most simple, and withal the most perfect of any, could admit of no gradual division, and therefore they assign'd the Son a <hi>separate Essence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now 'tis easie to discover, wherein he and <hi>Gentilis</hi> agree. <hi>Arius</hi> said, That there was One Essence or Substance of the Father, and another of the Son: <hi>Gentilis</hi> distinguisheth the Father from the Son not only in Person or Hypostasis, but in <hi>Essence or Substance</hi> also. Nor doth it at all alter the case, in that he saith, <hi>The Word was begotten of the Substance of the Father; and is consubstantial with him:</hi> In which, 'tis confess'd, he differs from <hi>Arius,</hi> but nevertheless introduces a <hi>separation of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Arius</hi> then says, <hi>The Son was made out of nothing:</hi> This Man tells us he was not made out of nothing, but out of the <hi>Substance of the Father.</hi> But in this they both agree, That <hi>[quoad essentiam]</hi> as to his <hi>Substance</hi> the Son is <hi>Numerically</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the Father. We are told by <hi>Niceph. lib.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 47, 48. that <hi>Philoponus</hi> a famous Philosopher drove on the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. <hi>For by dividing the Indivisible Nature of God, into more Persons, he ascrib'd</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:55921:41"/>
                  <hi>it to them severally, as to Individuals, and distributed it to those three Subsistences of a Supersubstantial Nature.</hi> He was likewise a great Champion of the <hi>Monophysites,</hi> who, by reason there was but one Hypostasis or Person in Christ, asserted that he had but one <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Nature also, which was made of both the Divine and Humane, as on the contrary <hi>Nestorius</hi> from the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Christ concluded, that he likewise must necessarily have two Hypostases or Persons.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Arius</hi> asserted, That <hi>the Father only was Eternal, but that the Word had a beginning;</hi> which likewise was the Opinion of the Philosophers <hi>Philoponus</hi> and <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius;</hi> see <hi>Niceph. lib.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 50.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentilis</hi> tells us, <hi>The Son of God was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by a precedent act of Generation;</hi> which if true, then must his being begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten have succeeded in order of time. To prove this he doth with his usual confidence quote that passage of <hi>Tertullin. Non ideo Pater &amp; judex semper, quia Deus semper. Nam nec Pater potuit esse ante filium, nec judex ante delictum. Fuit autem tempus cum ei delictum, &amp; filius non fuit,</hi> i. e. God is not therefore always a Father and a Judge, because he always was God. For he could not be a Father before he had a Son, neither could he be a Judge, before
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55921:41"/>
there was a Criminal. But there was a time, when neither Criminal nor Son did exist. In this Opinion he agrees with <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> and by consequence is a Partizan of <hi>Arius.</hi> For it signifies not a farthing, from whom this Sentence is quoted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Tertullian</hi> or any body else, since it's plain it gives us the true Sentiments of <hi>Arius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what has been said, it appears, That <hi>Arius</hi> and he are of the same Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in these two particulars, <hi>(Viz.)</hi>

               <p>IN the next place <hi>Gentilis</hi> appeals to those Texts of Scripture, wherein the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Son of God is reveal'd to us, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>We saw his Glory, the Glory as of the only Begotten of God;</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee;</hi> which place is cited by St. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13. and the Apostle 1 <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. Then <hi>Gentilis</hi> farther concludes, That Begotten is therefore distinguish'd from Unbegotten, because the one hath always a beginning, the other hath none. Again, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is therefore call'd <hi>ingenitus</hi> [Unbegot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten] because he derives his Original from none; but all things had their Beings from him.

This is his way of Arguing; and, I think, any one, that has but half an Eye, may plainly see how <hi>Arius</hi> his Argument lies couch'd under it. For whosoever hath read <hi>Nicephorus, Theodoret,</hi> and the other Ecclesiastical Writers, cannot be ignorant, that this was the very Argument <hi>Arius</hi> and his Followers made use of. In Answer to which, we freely allow and acknowledge the Generation of the Son of God, and readily grant that the Father is unbegotten, the Son begotten; but moreover we assert that this Generation was without beginning of Time, and is of such a Nature, as transcends the Capacities and Apprehensions of all Mortal Men. For the Word was in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and all things were made by him; which Word is afterwards call'd the Only begotten Son of God. Of the same Word the Prophet speaks, when he says, <hi>The dew of thy birth is of the womb of the Moru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> which passage the Jews themselves confess to have been spoken with respect to the Eternal Generation of the <hi>Messias.</hi> Therefore <hi>Gentilis</hi> his Argument is by no means conclusive; This way of Generation being wholly inexplicable, and without any beginning of Time; by consequence there is no <hi>prius</hi> nor <hi>posterius,</hi> no succession in it, but the whole coeternal together.</p>

How audacious then is the Mind of Man, that dares pry into and endeavour to explain these hidden things of God? If neither Ear hath heard, nor Eye seen, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it enter'd into the Heart of Man to conceive those things, which God hath prepared for them that love him, How much more ought that Mystery of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son of God, and that of his Eternal Generation, rather to be ador'd than fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom'd? But let us see, how the Ancients express'd their thoughts about this matter. <hi>Theodoret,</hi> in Book 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. tells us, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. That God did not beget his Son in time, nor after a certain season or period: and in the same place he calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an Immutable Filiation. Again he confesses, the Son of God was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, but it was, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in an unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, inexpressible, inconceiveable, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable manner, by which words it plainly appears, that the Ancients look'd upon this as a very great unfathomable Mystery. They did likewise call it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thereby to shew that his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was without beginning, as may be seen in <hi>Damascene</hi> and in <hi>Theodoret,</hi> in the place above cited. And <hi>Socrates</hi> in his 1. <hi>l. c.</hi> 8. has a passage importing the very same

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, says he, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> By a mode of Generation inexpressible and unconceiveable by any created Nature. From all which I think we may well conclude, the Manner of the Generation of the Son of God to be truly ineffable, incomprehensible, and undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable. Whereby it follows, that the Word was begotten out of all time, and before all time; That the Son was always with the Father; That God always was a Father; and that there never was any time, wherein the Son was not. As for any other ways of explaining this Generation, the Catholick Church, and all Christian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Iustin Martyr, Irenoeus,</hi> and others, have constantly rejected and exploded them. A few of which I shall just glance upon.</p>

               <p>Now, as it doth not follow, that because he that begets, is one, and he that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, is another, therefore the <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> of the Father is one, and the <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> of the Son is another; so neither doth it follow, that because he that begets is one, and he that is begotten, is another; therefore the Word, which

this be not the highest Indignity and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy against the Glory of our Blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> so to appropriate the Title of God to the <hi>Father only,</hi> as at the same time Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiously to rob and despoil Christ of his <hi>Divinity.</hi> He tells us, that whenever the Scripture speaks of the <hi>One God,</hi> it is to be understood of the <hi>Father only;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (says he) Christ cannot be truly or properly God; for whatever agrees proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to any thing <hi>Uni &amp; Soli,</hi> cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated [or Communicated] to any thing else; which if true, then, according to <hi>Gentilis,</hi> Christ will not only differ <gap reason="foreign">

St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> saith to <hi>Ananias, Thou hast not lied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Men, but unto God,</hi> i. e. to the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At other times the Scriptures speak of God absolutely, <hi>&amp; secundùm essentiam,</hi> whereby we are to understand the whole Godhead, from which none of the Persons
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55921:47"/>
is excluded, <hi>[or as it comprehends all three Persons]</hi> as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. <hi>God is a Spirit.</hi> We are God's Labourers, We are God's Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, We are God's Building. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>The wisdom of the World is foolishness with God.</hi> With what God? With the Father only exclusive of the Son? <hi>No, No.</hi> The Word <hi>[God]</hi> is here, as in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, taken essentially, as it belongs to all three Persons.</p>
               <p>But all this signifies nothing with <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> who will have the Scripture every where to speak of God distinctly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must of necessity exclude Christ from the Unity of the Divine Essence, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the Godhead; and lastly, make him of later Existence than the Father. But this is not all; his Presumption and Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance carries him farther, to make two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct sorts of Martyrdom. He thinks it a common ordinary piece of Service to dye for the Glory of the <hi>Son;</hi> and has therefore found out a new and more exalted one; namely, to suffer for the Glory and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of the Father. 'Tis certainly a grievous Errour, to think of Worshipping or Honouring the Father, and to neglect the Son; yet a greater to exclude the Son from this Honour: but the most grievous of all, to pretend to Honour the Father by degrading and dishonouring the Son. For
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55921:48"/>
God is to be Worshipp'd in the manner, as he has manifested himself; but he has plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. <hi>That he who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father:</hi> And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. <hi>The Father bears witness from heaven, that He is glorified in the Son.</hi> Wherefore let us keep to this certain perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual form of honouring the Father, I mean, by honouring of him in the Son, through whom alone he is well pleas'd with us; for, without the Son, no honour can be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto God the Father. Such subtile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions doth the Devil make use of, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Glory of Christ, under the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretext of vindicating the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Father; a Service, which God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver requir'd, either from the Prophets, Apostles, or any other Holy Men of Old. But 'tis plain, this method of honouring the Father tends to the disgrace and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Christ; and, that with a very little more trouble, <hi>Gentilis</hi> may reconcile himself with both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Turks.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THese false Doctrines of <hi>Gentilis</hi> have ever been condemn'd by the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal consent both of Scripture and the true Church; which consent is plainly and in short, as follows, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Essence</hi> of God is but <hi>One,</hi> in which one Essence the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sets forth to us three <hi>Hypostases</hi> or <hi>Subsistences,</hi> to wit, of the <hi>Father,</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> so that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge neither three Gods, nor any division <note n="*" place="margin">Nor Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> of the Essence [of God.] The Son and the Holy Ghost are so Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial with the Father, that they with him are One, true, eternal, infinite God. Nor is the appellation or title of the <hi>One most high God</hi> proper only to the Father exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of the Son and Holy Ghost. This, I say, is the Judgment and Consent of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55921:49"/>
Scripture and the true Church. For God is to be Worshipp'd in the same manner, that he hath reveal'd himself, and so the Church hath always Worshipp'd him; but he hath declar'd himself to be One, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Being in <hi>Substance</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>One,</hi> subsisting by himself, Eternal, Wise, Good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested himself in three Persons or Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postases.</p>
               <p>That his Essence is but One, will appear from many plain Testimonies, as 1 <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one God.</hi> 1 Cor. 8. <hi>We know that there is but one God.</hi> Eph. 4. <hi>There is one God.</hi> Deut. 4. <hi>The Lord</hi> [Jehovah] <hi>he is God, and there is none else besides him.</hi> Therefore he hath declar'd himself to be but One. But that He hath likewise reveal'd himself as subsisting in three Persons, is plain from <hi>Mark</hi> 1. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. where, in the Baptism of Christ, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are expresly mention'd: And so likewise in the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Baptism, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. Nor can we be put off by that evasion of <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> whereby he refers all this only to the Agreement and Consent of the Persons. We do not deny that there is such a Consent of Will; <note n="*" place="margin">And of <hi>Mutual Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> too.</note> but we say, that besides this, there is an Unity of Essence. Wherefore this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doth remain more firm and unshaken, than a Rock of Marble; namely, That God
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55921:49"/>
has declar'd himself to be One in Essence, subsisting in three Persons; so that a Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Unity, and Unity in Trinity, is to be Worshipped. And this is the only true way of Worshipping God.</p>
               <p>And in this sence the Church hath still Interpreted the Scripture and the Apostles Creed. <hi>I Believe in God, who is One;</hi> that is to say, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Essence;</hi> where presently after is added, by way of Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an enumeration of all the Persons, that it might appear, who that One God Almighty was; namely, the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consequently <hi>Gentilis</hi> his Exposition must be false, who makes this distinction; <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God the Father,</hi> and restrains the Word <hi>God</hi> to the <hi>Father</hi> only. I say this is a Sophistical Exposition arising from a mistaken distinction.</p>
               <p>Neither have the <hi>Nicene,</hi> nor <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creeds, or any of the Orthodox, ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood it in this sence. Wherefore the Son and H. Ghost are the true and one God with God the Father, and are so set forth to us in Scripture, as often as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of the One true God, <hi>Iehovah,</hi> or Lord of <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mark</hi> 10. Christ saith to the Rich Young Man, <hi>None is Good save God only;</hi> where if we admit <hi>Gentilis</hi> his Opinion to be true,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55921:50"/>
the Argument must run thus; <hi>None is good, but one that is God;</hi> but the Father only is the only God, therefore the <hi>Father</hi> only is <hi>Good.</hi> For Christ speaks exclusively, <hi>Why callest thou me good?</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. One God, is the proper appellation only of the Father; Therefore the Father only is <hi>Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor will he be ever able to extricate himself out of this Labyrinth, unless he doth affirm, that Christ may be said to be good also by Communication, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only to be properly and originally <hi>Good;</hi> which is intolerable Blasphemy, for it distinguisheth Christ from his <hi>Goodness,</hi> as well as from his <hi>Divinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the true way of Arguing would have been thus: He that is properly and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, good, must necessarily be the one true, and only God; (which we gather from Christ's own Words, <hi>None is good but the One God.)</hi> But the Son and H. Ghost are properly and <hi>per se</hi> Good, therefore they with the Father are that one Only true God; from whom all things in the World, which we call Good, do derive their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and hold it at his Pleasure. All the Cavils about the <hi>Father alone's being the one Only God</hi> do wholly vanish, and are dispell'd by this one Argument. Besides this, there are several other Testimonies to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55921:50"/>
be found in the Scripture; as in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 44. The <hi>One God</hi> is said to be the <hi>first</hi> and the <hi>last;</hi> which Noble Character <hi>Gentilis</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands to have been given only to the Father, but he is confuted by St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 22, 23. gives the very same Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to Christ; from whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That Christ is also comprehended under this Character of the <hi>One God.</hi> Nor shall we ever be convinc'd of the contrary, from his saying, That Christ was call'd the <hi>first</hi> and the <hi>last</hi> only in respect of the Creatures. Again, the <hi>Word</hi> in the New Testament is call'd not a <hi>fictitious,</hi> but a <hi>true God,</hi> Joh. 1. But there is but One <hi>true God,</hi> the Author both of the Old and New Covenant, therefore the <hi>Word</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the Character of the <hi>One God,</hi> who is the Author of the Covenant. Again, this One and Only God is call'd the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Only Saviour,</hi> Is. 43. 11. But if we believe <hi>Gentilis,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> in the New Testament is not the <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Only God,</hi> by consequence, neither will the <hi>Word</hi> be our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which is not only false, but blasphemous also. For <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>Andrew</hi> says, <hi>We have found the Messias</hi> [speaking of Christ or the Word.] Therefore the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, which was of <hi>Gentilis</hi>'s making, is false.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:55921:51"/>
Again, There is no other God <hi>[Elohim]</hi> besides the Lord <hi>[Iehovah]</hi> but the Word (according to <hi>Gentilis)</hi> is not that One On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Isaiah 44.</note> Lord <hi>[Iehovah]</hi> therefore he is not the true <hi>Elohim</hi> or God: which conclusion is abominably absurd, and by consequence so is that Proposition also of <hi>Gentilis,</hi> from whence it follows.</p>
               <p>Lastly, The Word is in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment call'd a <hi>Creator, Colos.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. but that is a Propriety of the only One God, therefore the Name of the one Only God belongs to the Son also.</p>
               <p>From these and the like places of Holy Scripture, it's easie to demonstrate how absurd and how impious a Doctrine it is to assert, That, the Father only [exclusive of the Son] is call'd the One Only God: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on the contrary, it has been the constant Faith of the Church, That the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are that One, True, and Only God reveal'd to us in the Scriptures; I say, One God <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or in Essence subsisting in three Persons. Nor need we trouble our selves with that Soveraignty of Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, since in the Trinity there is a perfect equality, none is greater or less than [none is afore or after] another. <hi>Unus &amp; idem Deus Pater &amp;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>ejus semper assistens humane generi;</hi> as says <hi>Irenoeus, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 47.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:55921:51"/>
But that Soveraignty, which we oppose and deny, introduceth an inequality of <hi>prius &amp; posterius,</hi> of <hi>majus &amp; minus,</hi> or of Order and Majesty in the Divine Essence, and therefore is justly exploded. In the mean time we are not ignorant, how Christ in respect of his Human Nature, and his Office of Mediator, is inferior to the Father, and is also so styl'd in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But this is nothing to the purpose, since the inequality, we expose, is not in the Persons, but the Essence of the Deity.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> an Excellent Writer, and who liv'd near the Times of the Apostles, is very Orthodox, as to the Article of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> unless it be when his Words are maliciously wrested to the new way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Scripture. For the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing therefore of this Father, we must observe that his Writings were compos'd upon different occasions. In his Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with <hi>Trypho</hi> the Jew, he was to prove against the Jews, that besides God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (whom the Jews acknowledge to have been the Creator of all things) there is another Person, namely, the Son of God, who is also the true God. Nor in this doth he at all divide the <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Essence,</hi> but distinguishes betwixt the Persons or Subsistences [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>]. These passages are abus'd by <hi>Gentilis,</hi> to establish his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55921:53"/>
of a <hi>distinct Essence.</hi> But that this was never the Mind of <hi>Iustin,</hi> will appear from his other Writings against the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> where he resolutely maintains, that there are not many, but One God. Which any, that have carefully read this Author, must necessarily know to be true.</p>
               <p>It appears then, that <hi>Iustin</hi> took upon him to prove these two Propositions:</p>
               <p>First, Against the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that there was but <hi>One God,</hi> and <hi>not many,</hi> as the Heathens did vainly imagine: And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this God, who was but <hi>One</hi> in <hi>Essence,</hi> did yet Subsist in three Persons.</p>
               <p>That the True, Eternal God is but One, he proves from their own Poets and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, [the <hi>Gentiles</hi> being ignorant of the Scriptures] and particularly cites that Verse out of <hi>Orpheus:</hi>
                  <q>

                  </q>
And farther, to shew that the Son was comprehended within the <hi>Unity of the Godhead,</hi> he brings another Verse out of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the same Poet, <hi>viz.</hi>

And however <hi>Gentilis</hi> may wrest the Author's words, contrary to his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is plain, that this Epithet, namely, the <hi>One Only God,</hi> belongs to the Son.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Nothing can be more plainly said of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the Son of God. For [says he] he was not barely call'd <hi>Angel</hi> and <hi>Lord.</hi> But he himself only is said to be the <hi>Angel</hi> and to be <hi>God.</hi> What is become then of that Propriety of the Father, whereby he is call'd the One Only God, seeing you are here told that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Only God?</p>
               <p>Again, when God says, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I am that I am; Iustin</hi> gives us the reason of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55921:54"/>
this expression, namely, That he did not say this with respect to the Son, as if he would so distinguish him from himself, but in contradiction to those who are not Gods; from whence it follows, that the Son is not excluded from the <hi>Self-existent Deity:</hi> But this was said, that Men might know that they did formerly serve not those which were, but those which were not Gods.</p>
               <p>As to the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Iustin</hi> tells us the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is to be understood of the true God. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For, says he, the Pronoun, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, denotes or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>very God.</hi> Therefore this makes nothing for the separation of the Father and the Son. For he presently after calls the Son <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable Word of God. How then dare we be so bold as to make him distinct in <hi>Essence</hi> from the Father? Nay, make them <hi>two distinct Numerical Essences,</hi> and so too as that the one should be <hi>propagated by the other?</hi> It is certainly a very impudent piece of presumption, amidst such an Universal Consent; for us nicely to pry into these Divine Mysteries, which so vastly transcend our weak Capacities: Wherefore <hi>Iustin</hi> very admirably closes this Subject with that Wise Saying of <hi>Mercurius,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Let us next consider his Dialogue against <hi>Tryphon</hi> the Jew, that so we may see how pertinently <hi>Gentilis</hi> does from thence prove his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or second Essence; of which, 'tis certain, <hi>Iustin</hi> never so much as dream'd. We must know then, that <hi>Trypho</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd One God, <hi>the Creator of Heaven and Earth,</hi> but did not allow the Son and Holy Ghost to be God. Wherefore it lay upon <hi>Iustin</hi> to prove, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was <hi>true God,</hi> who assum'd unto himself Human Nature, made after the Image of God. Upon this Account it is, that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten says, That <hi>the Word was true God,</hi> which assum'd unto himself Human Nature; and therefore that the Name of God did belong to another <hi>[viz.</hi> to the Son] besides the Father; that so both might be One God, seeing <hi>Trypho</hi> himself affirm'd, that there could not be more Gods. Wherefore <hi>Iustin</hi> does directly oppose the Opinion of <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> but not so as to make two <hi>Numerical Divine Essences,</hi> and to change the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> into an <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; <hi>i. e.</hi> There is another besides the <hi>Creator of the Universe,</hi> who both is, and is call'd <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Lord.</hi> Again, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Thus he makes two Numerically diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Hypostases in one Essence.

                  </gap> another God. <hi>Iustin</hi> himself explains his meaning in several other places; where speaking of the Son, he says, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> He is call'd <hi>God,</hi> and both is, and will be <hi>God.</hi> Nay, farther he plainly calls him <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>God of himself.</hi> For Expounding that place in <hi>Exodus</hi> 3. concerning the Angel of the Lord that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the <hi>Burning Bush,</hi> he says, That this Angel was the Divine <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For in the first place it calls him <hi>the Angel of the Lord and Minister of God,</hi> but immediately after styles the very same <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Let us next see, what way <hi>Iustin</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the Son to have been Begotten. God, says he, did from all Eternity beget of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a certain rational energy or operation [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] which is call'd the <hi>Glory of the Lord,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, God, Lord,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, says he, is not such an one as we see propagated by us. For we <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, by uttering of a word do make it; which yet is not of our own Substance, but <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> [of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature]; but the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> begotten of God is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> [of the same Substance]. And to the same purpose he says afterwards, that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> begotten of the Father <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> by his Energy and Will is true God; but he is not the true God, if he is begotten <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> by dividing or parting of his Substance or Essence, since things that are so divided re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main not the same they were before divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. From whence 'tis as clear as the Sun, that <hi>Iustin</hi>'s Opinion was that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the very same Substance with the Father that begat him. Again, we may gather that the Son always was with the Father from these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> The Begotten was always with the Father before [the Creation of] all things, and with him did the Father converse [from all Eternity]. Therefore there was always a Father, and always a Son, and they always were, are, and will be One God. Or else 'twould be improper to say, the Word was inseparable from the Father <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Light is inseparable from the Sun in the Firmament. Therefore when <hi>Iustin</hi> says the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> The <hi>Word,</hi> or that which was <hi>Begotten,</hi> is Numerically distinct from him that did beget him, he must be understood with respect to the number of <hi>Persons,</hi> not of <hi>Essences,</hi> for they are indeed two Persons. And if we do not understand <hi>Iustin</hi> with respect to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, we shall make him contradict himself, who so often urges the [Essential] Unity of the Father and the Son. Nay, he would say the same with <hi>Arius,</hi> who made use of this Argument to prove the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> between the Father and the Son, because he that did beget was <hi>One,</hi> and he that was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten was <hi>another.</hi> Therefore he that was <hi>begotten</hi> differs from him that did <hi>beget,</hi> and that in Number too; but yet in number
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55921:57"/>
                  <hi>Personal</hi> not <hi>Substantial;</hi> that is to say, they differ in <hi>Subsistence,</hi> not in <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Essence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same Father in his Apology to the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, has these words, <gap reason="foreign">

All these passages <hi>Gentilis</hi> wrests to another sence, and utterly rejects all the rest of his Writings; but especially his <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

For citing the place of St. <hi>Paul, Ephes.</hi> 2. <hi>In whom you also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit, Iustin</hi> adds, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> There is one Name deliver'd down unto us, which jointly agrees to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And again, he expresly mentions and proves <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Now these and the like passages being so very plain, that it was impossible to elude their force, <hi>Gentilis</hi> has chosen rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this whole Treatise, <hi>viz.</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>In the same Epistle he says of the Son, that he declar'd the One and Only true God to be his Father; and speaking of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of our Lord, that he reveal'd to the World the true God his Father. But what's all this to a distinction of <hi>Essence?</hi>

               <p>In his Epistle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> he cites this place out of the 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 8. <hi>There is but one God [Father] of all things;</hi> and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55921:59"/>
after, There is <hi>but one God and Father;</hi> not two or three, one who is [and there is no other besides him] the <hi>only true God.</hi> But afterwards he adds, by way of Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>therefore there are not three Fathers, nor three Sons, nor three Holy Ghosts, but one Father, and one Son, and one Holy Ghost;</hi> and proves this <hi>Trinity</hi> from the Institution of Baptism, in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; not into any one that had three Names, nor yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three that were made Men, but into three of the same Majesty; for there is one only who was made Man, neither the Father, nor the Holy Ghost, but only the Son; who was not so by estimation, or in appearance only, but in truth and reality; for the Word was made Flesh and dwelt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: So that here St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> does plainly oppose the <hi>Patripassians,</hi> and such like He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, but does not in the least favour [or patronize] <hi>Gentilis</hi> his Notion. In the very same Epistle disputing against the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tripassians,</hi> he writes thus: And again, <hi>How doth it appear unto you, that Christ was not Born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>but that it was he [the Father] who is God above all, and Almighty? Who then was it that sent him? Tell me who was he that rul'd over him? Whom did he obey, or whose Law did he fulfill? You, who would have him yield</hi>

                  <hi>to no one's Command or Power, do separate Christ from him that begat him; you make the Unbegotten to have been Begotten, and him that was without Beginning to have been nailed to the Cross.</hi> Which is all said by him in direct opposition to the <hi>Patripassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> or <hi>Sabellians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the same Epistle, he brings in Christ disputing against the Devil: <hi>I know,</hi> says he, <hi>and have known One only God, whom I do not refuse to Obey, but thou hast prov'd an Apostate and Rebel to him; for I am not</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

But these are the Words of Christ Incarnate, who owns himself in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his Humanity, to be inferior to the Father. For if these Words were to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood with respect to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> how could Christ be said to live <hi>propter Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem,</hi> or rather <hi>[Per.]</hi> seeing he [as God] is <hi>Self-existent, or hath life in himself,</hi> and <hi>power to lay it down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his Epistle to the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> he Exhorts them to Union, and draws his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from the Unity of the Flesh and Blood of Christ, from the Mystical Union of the Bread and Wine; and likewise from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55921:60"/>
the Unity of the Father and the Son. His words are these: <hi>Because there is one Father Unbegotten, and one only Begotten Son, God the Word and Man, and one Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Truth; also one Gospel, one Faith, one Baptism, and one Church.</hi> By which words he only urges them to Unity and Concord in the Church. Hence he makes this conclusion, Therefore it behoov'd them as a chosen People, a Royal Priesthood, and an Holy Nation, to be perfected in Love and Concord. To the same purpose is what he says in this Epistle against <hi>Ebion,</hi> who made Christ a meer Man, and therefore he shews, That Christ was God begotten of the Father; which contains no absurdity in it, unless violently wrested [by a faithless Exposition.]</p>
               <p>In his Epistle to <hi>Polycarp:</hi> Here, says he, is the Race, here the Crown, wait for Christ the Son of God, who is <gap reason="foreign">

And what can <hi>Gentilis</hi> say against this? Will he say, that Christ, as God, did suffer? And that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as such, had properly Flesh and Blood? St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> is of another mind,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55921:60"/>
and doth plainly and Orthodoxely distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the two Natures under [or in] the one Person of Christ. The one of which, namely, the <hi>Divine,</hi> is properly and <hi>per se</hi> Impassible; but the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Human,</hi> is properly Passible. <hi>Gentilis</hi> confounds these Proprieties of the two Natures, and affirms that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> had himself all these Affections. Christ, indeed, has properly Flesh and Bones, and Blood, being truly and properly Incarnate. But the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in Christ, has no such properly in it self.</p>
               <p>In his Epistle to the <hi>Antiochians</hi> he says, That we ought not to deny Christ under pretence of asserting <hi>One God,</hi> and brings several Testimonies out of Scripture, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>Isai.</hi> 44. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. &amp; 17. which do all speak of One God, and at the same time express different Persons; as when <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>The Lord rain'd [fire and brimstone] from the Lord;</hi> and yet in other places saith, <hi>There is but One God,</hi> which Unity doth not exclude the Son and Holy Ghost; whom he, on the contrary, includes with the Father in the Unity of the Godhead. So that a Trinity of Persons doth not at all interfere with the Unity of Essence.</p>
               <p>And at the end of that Epistle, he truly distinguishes the Properties of the Persons. May he protect and defend you (says he)
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55921:61"/>
who is the Only unbegotten God, [speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Father] through him who was begotten before all Ages, <hi>i. e.</hi> Through the Son, whose property it is to be begotten. But here <hi>Gentilis</hi> objects the last clause of this Epistle, <hi>viz. Valete Deo &amp; Christo,</hi> as if these were different, and the Father alone was call'd <hi>God,</hi> but Christ <hi>Dominus</hi> or Lord, so as to be excluded from the communion or fellowship of the only God.</p>
               <p>In his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends them for being one Body, and adds this Argument for their Union: for, says he, there is one Lord, one Faith, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, one God and Father of us all. But it is not <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Opinion, that the Father was the Only one God; no more doth it appear from the following sentence of his, <hi>Medicus noster est Solus verus Deus, Deus ingenitus.</hi> For if these Epithets were to be understood of the Father only, the Son would not then be our Physician: But St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> distinguishes the Persons here only by their Proprieties; for a little after he calls Christ our Physician, impassible in a passible Body.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>TErtullian,</hi> without doubt, is to be read with a great deal of caution, as <hi>Gentilis</hi> himself confesses; and therefore it is the easier for him either to pass by and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his Authority, as he pleases, or else to extol and commend it, as occasion serves.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as in many other places, so particularly in his Book against <hi>Praxeas</hi> is very Orthodox, where he expresly says [of the Persons in the <hi>Trinity]</hi> that <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum sine divisione patiuntur;</hi> They allow of number without division: And afterwards, <hi>Ubi<expan>
                        <am>

                     </expan> teneo unam substantiam in tribus cohoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentibus;</hi> I do always acknowledge one Substance in the Three thus united. <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis</hi> says, that in these and the like places <hi>Tertullian</hi> spoke waveringly, and will have them refer to <hi>Montanus</hi> his Paraclete; which, notwithstanding all this, are very Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox. But on the contrary, we say that <hi>Tertullian</hi> against <hi>Hermogenes</hi> did not only
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55921:62"/>
speak doubtfully, but did actually make use of the Phrases and Expressions of <hi>Arius;</hi> when he says, <hi>There was a time when the Son of God was not;</hi> which saying must of necessity be extreamly well lik'd by <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> as that which doth make the Son <hi>poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> to the Father in the order of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. But it is plainly an <hi>Arian</hi> expression, the same with the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we have already mention'd out of <hi>Nicephorus, lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth often recollect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and not only makes use of proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, but seems likewise to be Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox enough in his Notions, as in the same Treatise against <hi>Hermogenes</hi> he says, <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas gradum non habet utpote unica;</hi> The Divinity or Godhead can admit of no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as being but one.</p>
               <p>These and the like passages do sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonstrate, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd no separation, no division in the Godhead; but yet, in respect of the different Persons, he did allow of a Numerical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.</p>
               <p>And thus much we thought fit to take out of <hi>Iustin Martyr, Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian;</hi> these being the Fathers to whom <hi>Gentilis</hi> lays so great a claim, as if they were wholly Patrons of his Opinion. I shall not concern my self much with any
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55921:62"/>
of the others, since the Opinions of <hi>Hilary</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> are too well known, to give any one just occasion to suspect, that they were favourers of this Pestilential Error; and those passages <hi>Gentilis</hi> quotes out of them are answer'd by the Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

                  <hi>GEntilis</hi> then, without any distinction, rejects all other both Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Writers, and who cannot but wonder at the daring confidence of such a Fellow?

                  </gap>, as newly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by himself. But I will not oppose him with fallible Human Authority, seeing we may easily consute this Blasphemous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror out of the Scripture it self. And <hi>Arius,</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:55921:63"/>
whose wicked Spirit seems now to revive in, or to rest upon this Monster of Iniquity, was condemn'd of Old, and confuted not by Human Authority, but from the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Consent of the Church.</hi> My design being Historically to make it appear, that this wicked Man has set up a new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Holy Scripture, and to gain his Point the easier, has, without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty or civility, taken liberty to rail at and calumniate, not only the Fathers, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise all the Orthodox Councils.</p>
               <p>However, he ought either to have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to such approv'd Authors, and to the Consent of the Church, or else to have confuted them out of the Word of God. This he does not, but cites some few places of Scripture, upon which he puts a new Interpretation; and when we deny this to be the true meaning of them, and assert, That the Church of God did never understand those places in such a manner, and for proof of it appeal to all the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Writers both amongst the Greeks and Latins, he cries out, That we are a parcel of Dogmatical Pedants and Hereticks, and presently flies over to <hi>Arius,</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, which follow'd him, as if there were a better Interpretation of Scripture amongst them, than there is in <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and those who approv'd of his Confession of

Faith. He treats St. <hi>Austin</hi> in a very scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous manner, no ways deserv'd by so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a Writer.

               </argument>
               <p>THE Scripture speaking of the Son of God, doth attribute that to one of his Natures, which doth properly belong to the other, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>No one hath ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up into heaven, but the Son of man, who is in heaven.</hi> Christ, indeed, as he was the Son of Man, could not then be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when he spoke these words, nor did he take his Flesh from Heaven. But all this is proper to the Divine Nature only, and may be truly affirm'd of whole <hi>Christ,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Personal Union of the <hi>Word</hi> with <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By a like form of Speech we say, that <hi>God suffer'd and died for us,</hi> which are very improper expressions, [if strictly taken] since God cannot properly be said to <hi>suffer</hi> or to <hi>dye;</hi> and therefore we use to add, by way of Explication, that it was <hi>in Carne assumptâ,</hi> in the Flesh that he assum'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:55921:65"/>
This way of speaking the Ancients call'd <hi>Communicatio Idiomatum,</hi> or the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Properties; others call'd it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Damascene</hi> styles it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; as if we should say, by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or Mutual distribution, whereby we attribute that to the Human Nature, which is proper to the Divine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to be in Heaven before the Incarnation; or when, contrariwise, that is attributed to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, which is proper only to the Human, as to Dye and to Suffer; or else we affirm that of the whole Person, which is truly and properly said, because Christ in his <hi>Human Nature</hi> did dye, thô not in his <hi>Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is this way of speaking in any wise improper or absurd: For don't we, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of us Mortals, upon the very same account say, That such a Man is dead, thô this cannot be properly said of the <hi>whole Man;</hi> for Man is Mortal only in respect of his <hi>Body,</hi> his <hi>Soul</hi> is Immortal, and survives after Death. Yet because the Union of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> is that which makes the Man one, hence it is that we affirm that of the whole Man, which only agrees to one part of him. So we say of Christ, that he <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd</hi> and is <hi>Dead;</hi> which properly do not at all belong to the Divinity, but agree to Christ as he is Man, who is withal the same God, and one and the same Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:55921:65"/>
Here <hi>Gentilis</hi> cries out, That we divide Christ, and make a separation in him, and yet allows that there are some properties, which agree to the <hi>Word</hi> only, before he took our Nature upon him. Such is that, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. <hi>No one hath ascended up into heaven, but he that came down from heaven, the Son of man which is in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. <hi>Before Abraham was, I am.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>By whom also he made the Worlds.</hi> Now if, as <hi>Gentilis</hi> grants, these expressions can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree to the <hi>Word</hi> before he was made <hi>Flesh,</hi> I think it is plain, that they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly attributed to the Human Nature; and by consequence, we rightly explain them by a Communication of Properties [or Idioms].</p>
               <p>And that we do not divide Christ, nor make or maintain here any Separation, is clear from the Doctrine of our Church, wherein we do plainly acknowledge two Natures in Christ, and yet without any confusion of the Natures, the Personal Union making one and the same Christ, the Son of God and the Blessed Virgin. We likewise distinguish the Natures by their Properties, but do not divide or separate them, and by this means preserve whole and entire all the Offices of the Person of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:55921:66"/>
We say it is proper to the Human Nature to Weep, to be Hungry, to Sleep, to Suffer to Dye, to be circumscribed in a Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On the other hand it is proper to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, to be impassible, to make the Worlds, to be with the Father from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We say that the Offices of Christ are to redeem Mankind, to intercede for them, to govern his Church, and whatever else may be said to belong to Christ, either as <hi>Prophet, Priest,</hi> or <hi>King.</hi>

               <p>Now <hi>Gentilis</hi> being able to deny nothing of all this, 'tis clear, that he quarrels with the plainest expressions meerly out of heat and desire of Contention; and doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unjustly Style this Orthodox Doctrine, such <hi>impertinent Trifles</hi> as deserve to be hiss'd out of the Church; which he hath not only done in his Epistle Dedicatory to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> but hath also, without any just or sufficient reason, maliciously ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated the same in the 12th Book of his <hi>Antidotes.</hi> But there is yet at the bottom of all this, something still more monstrously Heretical; for he often affirms, that the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> had <hi>truly and properly Flesh</hi> and Blood, that the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>ANother remarkable Instance of this Man's Impiety, may be taken from that scurrilous, impudent, blasphemous Language he hath so freely bestow'd upon this most Sacred Mystery; a Mystery, that we ought rather in humility to adore, than nicely to pry into. It must be consess'd, that even good Men do sometimes disagree in their Explication of Things, and are not always of the same mind in their Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Scripture; but yet they do it without railing, without opprobrious Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and much more do they abstain from the blacker Crimes of Irreligion and Blasphemy. 'Tis no good sign of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious disposition, to scandalize and bespat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Subject in dispute; and yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Gentilis</hi> has been so liberal of his Railery, that had he rak'd even Hell it self, he could not have met with more dirty

               </p>
               <p>In his Printed Book, <hi>Fol.</hi> 6. he calls the <hi>Trinity</hi> a <hi>meer human Invention,</hi> diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally opposite to the Truth of the Gospel; The belief of a <hi>Trinity</hi> is perfect <hi>Sophistry.</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:55921:68"/>
And again, the <hi>Trinity</hi> is <hi>Deus Trinomius,</hi> a God only under three Names; which last he seems to have borrow'd from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Fol.</hi> 8. The <hi>Trinity</hi> is call'd a <hi>New God, indefinite, Tripersonate,</hi> a God, which none of the Prophets or Patriarchs ever knew of; which Christ never revealed, nor the Apostles ever preach'd.</p>
               <p>He styles our Blessed Saviour <hi>Christus tergeminus,</hi> p. 14. of his Printed Book; and in his Epistle to the Sons of the Church tells them, Christ was transform'd into One, which was not the <hi>Son of God.</hi> Pag. 15. he calls him the <hi>Son of the Father;</hi> that is, says he, of a meer <hi>empty Relation</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Did the Father beget a Mode and call it his Son? says Dr. <hi>Sh. Vin.

It is true, indeed, that <hi>Gentilis</hi> does gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally endeavour to throw his Scandals upon us, and bespatter our Doctrine with these abusive terms; yet it can't be deny'd, but that he is so profane, as in a vast many places plainly to condemn the Word <hi>Trinity,</hi> although he makes use of it himself, as is clearly prov'd by his Epistle to the King of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55921:68"/>
                  <hi>Poland;</hi> where, in the sixth Page, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, that there were several Monstrous and <note n="*" place="margin">Dr <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agrees with him in this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.</note> Profane terms brought into the Church, such as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Person, Essence, Unity, Trinity, whereby all the Holy Mysteries of Religion were overturn'd,</hi> and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Eternal God, with his Son, and Holy Ghost, was quite lost. In this charge he was led on by <hi>Gregorius Paulus,</hi> who calls these two Phrases, <hi>viz.</hi> The One <hi>Essence</hi> of God, and One God in three <hi>Persons</hi> the Inventions and cunning Contrivance of the Devil. But however, since the Phrases these Men endeavour to explode, have been the constant Language of the Church, I think it needs no other demonstration, to prove that <hi>Gentilis</hi> is not only Profane in his Expressions, but makes use also of Diabolical Stratagems [to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Establish'd Doctrine] of the Church.</p>
               <p>But the last and most plausible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which they use, is this: <hi>Gentilis</hi> complains to King <hi>Sigismund,</hi> that <hi>Luther, Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> were wholly taken up in demolishing the Outworks of <hi>Antichrist;</hi> and that, amongst so many thousand Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, only <hi>Philip</hi> had attempted any thing in this Glorious Undertaking; and that too so indirectly, that he seem'd rather
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:55921:69"/>
to threaten its ruin, than to have given it any deadly wound. To the same purpose <hi>Gregorius Paulus</hi> says, That God began by <hi>Luther</hi> to demolish the church of <hi>Antichrist</hi> at the Roof, not at the Foundation, left the noisome stench of the Ruins should have stifled them. And all this is, because they left the Doctrine <hi>of the Trinity</hi> unattacked; therefore they are said by them to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun at the Outworks, and the Roof, not at the principal Fort and Foundation of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.</hi> Thus these Witty Gentlemen are pleas'd to sport amongst themselves. Yet, after all, it is certain, that their quarrelling with these Words is only to find some means to escape; and therefore it is, that they fall so foul upon the Blessed Labours of those Good Men. Then they interpret every thing as they please, and take the liberty of condemning whatever makes against them; and hence it is, that they endeavour to refine and new model the Language and Expressions of the Church, which being a task far above their weak abilities, [rather than seem to be Nonplust] they despitefully scatter such horrid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions and bitter Calumnies, as no good Christian can hear without horrour and astonishment. His Book to the King of <hi>Poland</hi> is fraught with such Elegancies and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55921:69"/>
Ornaments as these, and his common Discourse was wont to be set off with the like Embellishments; so that he seems to please himself, and hopes to raise his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by this means.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the vile Scandals he hath falsly thrown upon the Doctrine of our Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>GEntilis</hi> is very dextrous in Forging of false Accusations, for he unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Charges our Church with several Crimes he will never be able to prove against her; as</p>
               <p>First, That we do Impudently deny <hi>Christ</hi> to have been the Son of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That we have unadvisedly brought a new <hi>God</hi> into the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That we affirm that God did not beget his Son of his own Substance.</p>
               <p>If Cardinal <hi>Cusanus</hi> said any such thing, let him look to it, the Reform'd, or Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick Churches, are not bound to Answer for his Errors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:55921:70"/>
Fourthly, That we made a Triple God contrary to the Authority of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Abundance more of such sort of Stuff is contain'd in his <hi>Antidotes;</hi> all which I here industriously avoid. For what good Man can hear with patience such a Rascally Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thus sawcily abusing and undermining the <hi>Christian Religion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is, that he gives us the Titles of <hi>Opposers of God; Iudaïzing Hereticks;</hi> and as bad as <hi>Turks;</hi> and passes the same Complements upon the Churches of <hi>Savoy</hi> also, which yet he acknowledges to be the most Uncorrupted, and best Reform'd, of any he knew.</p>
               <p>He compares us with the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Iews</hi> for denying (as he says) with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that <hi>God did beget his Son.</hi> But who can say that he ever heard amongst us, That we devis'd another God Superior to the Father of Christ? Who amongst us ever taught or affirm'd any such thing? Hence he took that specious pretence of a <hi>Quaternity,</hi> a thing that was never seen or heard of, much less Worshipp'd in our Church. He accounts our Faith to be meer Sophistry, and our selves Novices and Sophisters; yet gives no reason for it. Thus this Crafty Fellow comically sports with us; but the true reason is, because we deny <hi>his Three Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:55921:71"/>
                  <hi>Spirits,</hi> and do say, with <hi>Athanasius, There is One Eternal, One Almighty;</hi> but that the Three Persons are three <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. Only three <hi>Subsistences.</hi> And when we say, <hi>Deus est Trinus,</hi> or there is a <hi>Trinity</hi> in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> he starts up as. if he were Mad, and cries out, That we make the <hi>Trinity</hi> a <hi>Fourth God;</hi> as if we asserted any <hi>Deus Trinitas</hi> besides, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. But this is certainly too gross and palpable a Calumny, for we own the <hi>Trinity</hi> only to relate to these Three Persons; and besides, or without them, there is neither <hi>God,</hi> nor <hi>Trinity.</hi> Of the same strain is his Calumny of our defending an <hi>unknown God,</hi> Superior to the Father of Christ; and making three Christs out of one.</p>
               <p>We acknowledge and defend the God, that was known and reveal'd to our Fathers, but do set up no unknown God. We know there is but one Christ, in whom two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do conspire to make one Person; and therefore we judge it to be Impious and Heretical, to say there are three Christs [or that Christ is <hi>Tergeminus.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that Scandal is of a blacker Dye, of our dividing Christ, and transforming him into another, which is not the Son of the Living God. Let this Blasphemer shew us any other Christ besides that Son of God,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55921:71"/>
and let him make it out, where, and how, we do divide Christ. Of the same Nature are those Impostures he charges us with, of Conjuring up a new Christ the Son of a new Relation, and then deceitfully belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him to be the Son of God.</p>
               <p>We believe in the Son of God as reveal'd in the Scriptures, but acknowledge none of <hi>Gentilis</hi>'s Impostures. We constantly assert, without any deceit, [or fraud] three Persons in the Godhead; nor do we divide the Substance, but do distinguish between the Persons. He hits us in the teeth with <note n="*" place="margin">

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Cheats and Impostures, whereby he endeavour'd to impose upon good (well-meaning) People.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>INOW come to the last Chapter (or last Head of his Accusation) wherein I shall make it appear, by what sly Artifices <hi>Gentilis</hi> endeavour'd to impose upon [or cheat] every one he had to do with. For, indeed, he has shewn himself to be exactly such an one as the Poet has Comically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd <hi>Mercury,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; one that had got an excellent knack of changing his Name.</p>
               <p>First then, he prefix'd to the Confession he Publish'd, a forg'd Preface, under the Name of <hi>Theophilus</hi> the Printer to the Sons of the Church. This he compos'd himself, and wrote it with his own hand, wherein he extravagantly commends to the Reader the vast treasure contain'd in that little
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:55921:72"/>
Book; a Book, says he, so Excellent, that it were to be wish'd all Churches might have the happiness to enjoy the use of it And, the better to set off his unmerchanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ware, he makes as if the Printer were vastly desirous of having the rest of <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> his Writings made publick; and despises the bulky Volumes, and vast, tedious, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxical Books of other Authors, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with <hi>Gentilis</hi> his Works.</p>
               <p>But this (methinks) is a Trick no Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous or Honest Man would have been guilty of in a matter of such moment. Christ, the Prophets, and Apostles, never made use of these little Artifices to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Writings to Posterity. It was wisely said of King <hi>Solomon, Let another praise thee, and not thine own mouth.</hi> And we have a Proverbamong our selves, which says, <hi>That they must needs have bad Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who are forc'd to commend themselves.</hi> But the truth is, he was afraid, that had he not under a feign'd Name commended it himself, the Book would certainly have met with no body else that would have been so kind, as to give it a good Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He was asraid to discover the place where it was printed. For thô the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55921:73"/>
Book had been published at <hi>Lyons,</hi> yet he craftily pretends it was done at <hi>Antwerp.</hi> But these were but civil Lies he made use of the better to disperse his pernicious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He begins his Confession with the same probity; <hi>It was by your Command, Honoured Sir,</hi> &amp;c. For the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of which Cheat, I desire all good Men to take notice, that the truth of the whole business is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentilis</hi> being under custody, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in that quality to exhibit a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his Faith to the Governour of <hi>Gaium,</hi> which he design'd should be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by the Clergy of that Province: But in the mean time, <hi>Gentilis,</hi> whose Character was not yet fully known, nor his Confession examin'd, was, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of some Friends, dismiss'd out of Prison upon his good Behaviour, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour all the while, not in the least sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting he had kept a Copy of his <hi>Confession</hi> to himself.</p>
               <p>But as soon as he was dismiss'd, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately dispers'd his <hi>Confession,</hi> as if he had been commanded by the Governour so to do. The Governour did, indeed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55921:73"/>
him, as being a suspected Heretick, to exhibit a <hi>Confession,</hi> but never gave him Orders to publish such a Blasphemous Libel under the protection of his Name. All that <hi>Gentilis</hi> could ever say in defence of this notorious Forgery, was only this; That as the Governour never did command him, so neither did he ever forbid him to publish it. But what reason, I pray you, had he to prohibit him, when as he never suspected, that he would have had the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to publish it.</p>
               <p>But Fourthly, We have already told you, and that from his own Mouth, how he publish'd such Confessions of the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> both at <hi>Grenoble</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> as were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for Orthodox by the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Viz.</hi> Such as <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brard</hi> a <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctor, who, to his Eternal Infamy, both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended <hi>Gentilis,</hi> and assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Three distinct Eternal Spirits in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> See his Answer to <hi>Skegkius de Trinitate,</hi> fol. 53. p. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Papists them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> And yet he has the Impudence to accuse us for joyning with them in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of a <hi>Quaternity,</hi> and for submitting to the grievous Errors of the Greek and Latin Fathers in this Doctrine. Certainly there cannot be a more malicious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful representation of this Doctrine, than this wicked Man has given out. So that I may more truly call his false Accusations Impostures, Sophistry, Magick, and much worse Names.</p>
               <p>

Fifthly, At his return out of <hi>Poland,</hi> he presented to the Governour of <hi>Gaium</hi> a Draught or Form, for having a Publick Disputation, which I shall here present the Reader with, as it is transcrib'd <hi>verbatim</hi> from his own Original; that so all honest Men may see, what sort of Spirit it was that govern'd him through the whole Transaction. The Instrument, which he caus'd to be Publish'd under the Governor's Name, ran in the following form.</p>
               <p>To all and singular the Pastors, Teachers, Deacons and Elders, of the Reform'd and Evangelick Churches, dispers'd through <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to whom these Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters shall come, or to whom they shall be read, Health and Peace in the Lord.</p>
               <p>FOrasmuch <hi>as We have read and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the above-written Propositions, that are opposite to each other; and having heard the Iust and Reasonable Petition of</hi> Valentinus Gentilis <hi>an</hi> Italian, <hi>humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questing, That this weighty Controversie</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:55921:74"/>
                  <hi>might be decided barely from the Word of God; The Illustrious Governor of</hi> Gaium <hi>has, upon these considerations, thought fit to transmit Copies of the Doctrine asserted by both Parties, into several places of</hi> France, <hi>and</hi> Savoy, <hi>more particularly to</hi> Lyons <hi>and</hi> Geneva, <hi>to the intent, that if there be any of Mr.</hi> Calvin<hi>'s Disciples, who will take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to defend the assertions of his Master, he may come to</hi> Gaium <hi>within the space of one Week, there to dispute with</hi> Gentilis, <hi>upon this condition, That whosoever shall not be able to demonstrate the Propositions, he undertook to maintain, to be true, out of the plain Word of God, shall be look'd upon as a notorious Impostor, and Assertor of a false Religion, and shall</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">So that <hi>Gentilis</hi> suffered just ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own. Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> suffer Death for <hi>the same. But if there be none that shall appear within the time here prescribed, the Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Governor, with the whole Senate of</hi> Gaium, <hi>are resolv'd, as is most fitting, publickly to declare, That the abovenam a</hi> Gentilis <hi>is truly Orthodox in his Opinions concerning the most High God, and his Son Iesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I desire all good Men to observe, what an advantagious way of Disputing (for himself I mean) our Adversary has here prescribed. For <hi>Gentilis</hi>'s Propositions are first presumed to be pious and sound; then
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55921:75"/>
there is only eight days time allow'd for the Disputants to come together; whereas 'twas almost impossible for the Challenge to be sent to them in so short a time. But that is particularly to be taken notice of, that no body was to Dispute but under <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of losing his Life,</hi> if conquer'd. Is not this, I pray you, an evident sign of a Seducing and Diabolical Spirit? And when he was charg'd with this base contrivance, his Answer was, That he did it only that he might have the fewer Opposers. But this <hi>bloody Spirit</hi> sufficiently betrays it self, that would involve Religion in Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and false Opinions; but that (thanks be to the good Providence of God) the ruin he design'd against others, fell upon his own Pate.</p>
               <p>And last of all, when he was to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Tryal, and to have desended his Doctrine, he did, by a remarkable piece of Knavery, endeavour to obtain the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of a Plaintif, and to be heard as such, thereby to avoid being Try'd as a Criminal; and when that could not be granted him, he propos'd his Doctrine so ambiguously, and rais'd scruples about matters, altogether impertinent to the Controversie, as <hi>Whether there was one most high God;</hi> and whether <hi>Christ was the Son of God,</hi> and the like; which no body did ever deny. But he was
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:55921:75"/>
still oppos'd in this, That <hi>Christ was to be excluded from the Unity of the Eternal God;</hi> and that <hi>Three Eternal Spirits, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>by Numerical Essence, ought to be allow'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now let all good Men judge, what we ought to think of this Blasphemy; and how justly he was punish'd with Death, who durst challenge others to Dispute with him for their Lives.</p>
               <p>But it is now high time to rid my hands of this business. In short then, after that we had us'd all manner of means with him, even from the 5th of <hi>August</hi> to the 9th of <hi>September,</hi> (but all to no purpose, he still persevering obstinate in his Opinions) he was at last condemn'd to Dye by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Senate. And because it may be acceptable to the Reader, I shall here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse the Sentence of Condemnation, which was pronounced against him in the following Words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereas</hi> Valentinus Gentilis, <hi>a Native of</hi> Cosentia, <hi>in the Kingdom of</hi> Naples, <hi>after</hi>

And lastly, since his being made Prisoner to this Honorable Senate, hath, notwithstanding that full and sufficient Instruction which hath been given him, still continued obstinate in his perverse and Heretical Opinions: This Honourable Senate, to prevent distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, and to root out such pestilent</hi>

               <p>As he was led out to Execution, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate Wretch did not cease to Glory in his unruly and pertinacious Stubbornness, and expecting praise from it (as the Devil's Martyrs use to do) never lest off crying out, That he died a Martyr for the Glory of the most high God; but that we * <hi>were all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellians,</hi> and held one God under three <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>'s Language all along.</note> Names; but that he did acknowledge no God <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>false and slanderous;</hi> that all the noise he made about this most high God was only mere Sophistry, and <hi>that his asserting more Gods than One</hi> was downright Impiety, yet we could work no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon him. For he still continued to repeat his old Blasphemies, until he saw there was no help for him, but that he must be forc'd to lay down his Neck to the Block; then he began to faulter, and said, He should be very willing to agree with us, if so be we would but own Christ to be the Son of God; when we told him, This was what we never deny'd (for what otherwise would have become of our
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55921:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Faith?) Then again did he discover his falshood and treachery, as having still been us'd to appropriate <hi>the appellation of God to the Person of the Father only;</hi> and in this horrid Blasphemy he still persever'd, the whole Assembly (that stood by) praying to God that he would change his mind, and we continually exhorting him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he <hi>had</hi>

               <p>And thus I have given thee (Good Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) a brief and faithful Account of this shatter'd History. And must now beg thee to joyn with us in our Prayers to God, that he would, in his Mercy, turn away such scandalous Offences from his Church; that he would give his People vigilant and able Ministers, who may sincerely love sound Doctrine, successfully rebuke Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers, and know how to divide the Word of Truth rightly, to the Glory of his Name, and the good of his Church, through Jesus Christ his Only and Coeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son.</p>

THE Reader, by comparing the preceding History with what here follows, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the principal Proposition of <hi>Valentinus Gentilis,</hi> is in Sence perfectly the same with those Condemned by the late <hi>Oxon</hi> Censure; as also assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Dr. <hi>Sherlock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>At a Meeting of the Vice-Chancellor and the Heads of Colleges and Halls of the University of</hi> Oxford, <hi>on the 25th Day of</hi> November, <hi>in the Year of Our Lord</hi> 1695.</p>
            <p>WHEREAS in a Sermon lately preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>Peter in the East,</hi> on the Feast of S. <hi>Simon and Iude</hi> last past, these Words, amongst others, were deliver'd and asserted, <hi>viz. [There are Three Infinite distinct Minds and Substances in the Trinity.]</hi> Item <hi>[That the Three Persons in the Trinity are Three distinct Infinite Minds or Spirits, and Three Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Substances.]</hi> Which gave just cause of Offence and Scandal to many Persons:</p>
            <p>The Vice-Chancellor and Heads of Colleges and Halls, at their general Meeting this Day assembled, do judge and declare the said Words to be False, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, and Heretical; Contrary to the Doctrine of the Catholick Church, and particularly to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55921:78"/>
And do therefore strictly forbid all manner of Persons, under their Care and Charge, to Preach or Publish any such Doctrine for the future.</p>
            <p>By Order of Mr. Vice-Chancellor.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This Sentence, it is confessed, may, and, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably, will be confirmed, and sarther enforced, by the more Authentick Sentence of the whole Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity in Convocation: In the mean time, it has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had this good effect, That it has Unkennelled the <hi>Wolf,</hi> who quickly shew himself after it. So that being hereby bereaved of all his <hi>Shifts, Meanings,</hi> and <hi>Subterfuges,</hi> and <hi>Sheeps Cloathing</hi> besides, the University has him now in full Chase, and, 'tis hoped, will not give the Chase over, till it has run him down.</p>
