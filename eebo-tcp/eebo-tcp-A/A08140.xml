            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

beginning to leaue the Land of <hi>Hessen</hi> altogether, we gaue you a very large Discourse in our last booke printed <hi>Iuly</hi> 18. After which, thus they write of him from diuers place, <hi>Iuly</hi> 5, and 6. <hi>Monseur Tilly</hi> is now at last quite remoued out of the Bishopricke of <hi>Hierschvels</hi> in the Land of <hi>Hessen,</hi> and hee will doe his best endeuour (as it is thought) to cut off Duke <hi>Christian</hi> of <hi>Brunswickes</hi> passage, from going vpwards, vpon which occasion drawing neerer one to another, they may happen to encounter.</p>
            <p>Hee had sometimes before, quartered part of his Forces in the Duke of <hi>Saxonies</hi> dominions of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringen,</hi> about <hi>Isenach,</hi> which hee hath now also quit, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And of their returne through the Bishopricke of <hi>Bambarg,</hi> wee haue by other Letters heard how that they would not out from thence, vntill they had gotten money of the Country people, which was the last that wee heard of them.</p>
            <p>Another Friend which <hi>Monseur Tilly</hi> expected to come with all speede vnto him was the Baron of <hi>Anholt,</hi> of whose march and neernesse to him, wee told you in our last, since when, wee heare for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20502:6"/>
that the Landtgraue Maurice of <hi>Hessen,</hi> hath with 14000 men way laid him, and stopt vp all the passages in his owne Countrey, to keepe him from ioyning with <hi>Tilly.</hi> So that <hi>Anholt</hi> bringing but 6000 with him, how likely they are to force their passage that way, through 14000 men laid with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, is easie to iudge.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>Monseur Tilly,</hi> partly for that hee was extreamly pressed with hunger, and partly for suspition of <hi>Brunswicke</hi> neernesse and strength, and his iealousie of his intention to make vpwards, hee quite remoued with his whole Army into the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke of <hi>Eischvelt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that as on the one side hee freed the <hi>Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue</hi> of <hi>Hessen</hi> of his present feare of him, and gaue him liberty withall, to imploy those Forces (which hee was before enforced to keepe for the guard of his owne person and palace, about the Towne of <hi>Cassel</hi>) in blocking vp the passages against <hi>Anholt.</hi> So on the other side hath hee both before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him, done his best endeauour to stoppe vp all the passages by which <hi>Brunswicke</hi> might come at him.</p>
            <p>Leauing therefore the Land of <hi>Hessen</hi> with some few Forces onely in it, in Garison, to assure certaine places vnto him, as at <hi>Witzenhowsen</hi> by name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee left 500 Musketiers: At <hi>Allendorss</hi> 400 Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and at <hi>Eishwege</hi> as many, hee afterwards mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in a good order, and in fayre Battaglia out of the Land.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This order of their march, with their number, strengths, prouisions, and resolutions, was (as the Letters doe report) by priuate intelligence of some Camp-Traytors, particularly described vnto <hi>Mons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Discouery being thus happily made, the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was by his owne hand writing found out, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and sent prisoner vnto Duke <hi>Christians</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Duke of <hi>Brunswicke,</hi> residing at his towne <hi>Wolfenbuttle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the whole state of the Campe being made knowne vnto the Enemy, caused the Duke to double
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20502:8"/>
his guards, and looke to his watches more narrowly, and to entrench and to fortifie himselfe the more strongly; whereupon followed the building of this Fort at <hi>Duderstads,</hi> (where the Army now rested) and to lay his men at more security, the towne of <hi>Heigerstad</hi> which belongeth vnto the Bishop Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> was for the time taken in, and souldiers quartered in it. And thus write the seuerall Letters from the neighbour places: <hi>Brunswicke</hi> lying here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and Monseur <hi>Tilly</hi> hauing drawne his Forces as neere that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Armies lay at this distance and posture some few dayes, awaiting some occasion of aduantage; which thus at last presented it selfe, after some weeke or 9. daies expectation.</p>

            <p>But leauing these in a wood, and to their hard for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the rest of <hi>Brunswicks</hi> men returning from the Chase, found, that besides those wounded men that escapt, and those that were kild in the way, &amp; those in the wood, (which they held as good as dead) that they had left 700<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men dead vpon the place; which number is the generall report of all those Letters, that wee can heare of to haue since his coming into England, about this businesse.

            <p>And for the truth of it, our Letters subioyne this conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; how that besides other reports &amp; Letters, that one <hi>Faber,</hi> a very honest and substantiall man, being at that time Burgomaster or Maior of <hi>Budens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> whom the former Regiments of Saxon, Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enburg, and Holsteyn had taken and carried away prisoner along with them, in chaynes, and with the white staffe of his office in his hand, vntill he should pay 600.

This <hi>Faber,</hi> I say, breaking loose after this Battell, and being restored to his libertie, came here to this towne of <hi>Cassel;</hi> where vpon his owne word he confirmed all this; affirming moreouer, that the duke of Saxon <hi>Sawenburg</hi> himselfe, was likewise left dead vpon the place; which addes much also to the Victory.</p>
            <p>Our Letters conclude with this. Thus hath <hi>Bruns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> giuen Monsieur <hi>Tilly</hi> the first blow, and found two tun of Gold amongst the spoyles.
