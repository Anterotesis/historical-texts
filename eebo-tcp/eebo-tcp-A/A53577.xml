            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ACCOUNT
OF
The Examination, Confession, &amp;c.
of John Perry, and his Mother
and Brother, for the supposed
Murder of W. Harrison, Gent.</head>
            <p>UPON <hi>Thursday</hi> the 16th Day of
<hi>August, 1660, William Harrison,</hi>
Steward to the Lady Viscountess
<hi>Campden,</hi> at <hi>Campden</hi> in <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestershire,</hi>
being about seventy Years of Age,
walked from <hi>Campden</hi> aforesaid to <hi>Charring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
about two Miles from thence, to
receive his Lady's Rent; and, not returning
so early as formerly, his Wife, Mrs. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,</hi>
between eight and nine o'Clock that
Evening, sent her Servant, <hi>John Perry,</hi> to
meet his Master on the Way from <hi>Charring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth:</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:38540:3"/>
But, neither Mr. <hi>Harrison,</hi> nor his
Servant, <hi>John Perry,</hi> returning that Night,
the next Morning early <hi>Edward Harrison
(William</hi>'s Son) went towards <hi>Charring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
to enquire after his Father; when
on the Way, meeting <hi>Perry</hi> coming thence,
and being informed by him he was not
there, they went together to <hi>Ebrington,</hi> a
Village between <hi>Charringworth</hi> and <hi>Campden,</hi>
where they were told, by one <hi>Daniel,</hi> that
Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> called at his House the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before, in his Return from <hi>Charring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
but stayed not: Then they went to
<hi>Paxford,</hi> about Half a Mile thence, where
hearing nothing of Mr. <hi>Harrison,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
towards <hi>Campden;</hi> and, on the Way,
hearing of a Hat, a Band, and Comb,
taken up in the Highway (between <hi>Ebring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and <hi>Campden</hi>) by a poor Woman, then
leasing in the Field, they fought her out,
with whom they found the Hat, Band, and
Comb, which they knew to be Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison</hi>'s;
and, being brought by the Woman
to the Place where she found the same (in
the Highway, between <hi>Ebrington</hi> and <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
near unto a great Furz-brake) they
there searched for Mr. <hi>Harrison,</hi> supposing
he had been murdered, the Hat and Comb
being hacked and cut, and the Band bloody;
but nothing more could be there found.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38540:3"/>
The News hereof, coming to <hi>Campden,</hi> so
alarmed the Town, that Men, Women,
and Children hasted thence in Multitudes to
search for Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi>'s supposed dead
Body, but all in vain.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Harrison</hi>'s Fears for her Husband,
being great, were now much increased; and
having sent her Servant <hi>Perry</hi> (the Evening
before) to meet his Master, and he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
that Night, it caused a Suspicion that
he had robbed and murdered him; and
thereupon the said <hi>Perry</hi> was, the next Day,
brought before a Justice of Peace; by whom
being examined concerning his Master's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and his own staying out the Night
he went to meet him, he gave this Account
of himself: That, his Mistress sending him
to meet his Master, between eight and nine
o'Clock in the Evening, he went down
<hi>Campden-</hi> Field, towards <hi>Charringworth,</hi> about
a Land's Length, where meeting one <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Reed</hi> of <hi>Campden,</hi> he acquainted him
with his Errand; and further told him, that,
it growing dark, he was afraid to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and would therefore return and fetch
his young Master's Horse, and return with
him; he did, to Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi>'s Court-Gate,
where they parted, and he staid still:
One <hi>Pierce</hi> coming by, he went again, with
him, about a Bow's-Shot into the Fields,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38540:4"/>
and returned with him likewise to his
Master's Gate, where they also parted: And
then, he the said <hi>John Perry</hi> saith, he went
into his Master's Hen-Roost, where he lay
about an Hour, but slept not; and, when
the Clock struck twelve, rose, and went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Charringworth,</hi> 'till (a great Mist
arising) he lost his Way, and so lay the rest
of the Night under a Hedge; and at Day-break,
on <hi>Friday</hi> Morning, went to <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringworth,</hi>
where he enquired for his Master
of one <hi>Edward Plaisterer,</hi> who told him
he had been with him the Afternoon before,
and received twenty-three Pounds of him,
but staid not long with him: He then went
to <hi>William Curtis,</hi> of the same Town, who
likewise told him, he heard his Master was
at his House the Day before, but, being not
at Home, did not see him: After which,
he saith, he returned homewards, (it being
about five o'Clock in the Morning) when,
on the Way, he met his Master's Son, with
whom he went to <hi>Ebrington, Paxford,</hi> &amp;c.
as hath been related.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reed, Pierce, Plaisterer,</hi> and <hi>Curtis,</hi> being
examined, affirmed what <hi>Perry</hi> had said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them to be true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Perry</hi> being then asked, by the Justice of
the Peace, How he, who was afraid to go
to <hi>Charringworth</hi> at nine o'Clock, became
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38540:4"/>
so bold as to go thither at twelve? answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That at nine o'Clock it was dark, but
at twelve the Moon shone.</p>
            <p>Being further asked, Why, returning twice
home, after his Mistress had sent him to
meet his Master, and staying till twelve
o'Clock, he went not into the House, to
know whether his Master were come home,
before he went a third Time, at that Time of
Night, to look after him? answered, That
he knew his Master was not come home,
because he saw Light in his Chamber-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
which never used to be there so late
when he was at home.</p>
            <p>Yet, notwithstanding this that <hi>Perry</hi> had
said for his staying forth that Night, it was
not thought fit to discharge him till further
Enquiry were made after Mr. <hi>Harrison;</hi>
and accordingly he continued in Custody at
<hi>Campden,</hi> sometimes in an Inn there, and
sometimes in the common Prison, from
<hi>Saturday August</hi> the 18th, to the <hi>Friday</hi>
following; during which Time he was
again examined at <hi>Campden</hi> by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Justice of the Peace, but confessed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than before; nor at that Time
could any further Discovery be made what
was become of Mr. <hi>Harrison:</hi> But it hath
been said, that, during his Restraint at
<hi>Campden,</hi> he told some (who prest him to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38540:5"/>
confess what he knew concerning his Master)
that a Tinker had killed him; and to others
he said, a Gentleman's Servant of the
Neighbourhood had robbed and murdered
him; and others again he told, that he
was murdered, and hid in a Bean-rick in
<hi>Campden,</hi> where Search was (in vain) made
for him. At length he gave out, that, were
he again carried before the Justice, he would
discover that to him, he would discover to
No-body else: And thereupon he was
(<hi>Friday August</hi> the 24th) again brought
before the Justice of Peace, who first exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
him, and asking him whether he
would yet confess what was become of his
Master, he answered, he was murdered,
but not by him. The Justice of Peace then
telling him, that, if he knew him to be
murdered, he knew likewise by whom
he was; so he acknowledged he did;
and being urged to confess what he knew
concerning it, affirmed that it was his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and his Brother that had murdered his
Master. The Justice of Peace then advised
him to consider what he said, telling him,
that he feared he might be guilty of his
Master's Death, and that he should not
draw more innocent Blood upon his Head;
for what he now charged his Mother and
Brother with, might cost them their Lives;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38540:5"/>
but, he affirming he spoke nothing but the
Truth, and that, if he were immediately to
die, he would justify it, the Justice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
him to declare how and when they
did it.</p>
            <p>He then told him, that his Mother and
his Brother had lain at him, ever since he
came into his Master's Service, to help
them to Money, telling him how poor they
were, and it was in his Power to relieve
them, by giving them Notice when his
Master went to receive his Lady's Rents,
for they would then way-lay and rob him:
And further said, that upon the <hi>Thursday</hi> Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Master went to <hi>Charringworth,</hi> going
of an Errand into the Town, he met his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Street, whom he then told whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Master was going, and if he way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid
him, he might have his Money: And
further said, that in the Evening his Mistress
sent him to meet his Master, he met his
Brother in the Street, before his Master's
Gate, going (as he said) to meet his Master,
and so they went together to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
about a Stone's Throw from Mr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison</hi>'s
Gate, where they parted, he going
the Foot-way, cross the Church-yard, and
his Brother keeping the great Road, round
the Church; but in the Highway, beyond
the Church, met again, and so went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38540:6"/>
the Way leading to <hi>Charringworth,</hi> till
they came to a Gate about a Bow's Shoot
from <hi>Campden</hi> Church, that goes into a
Ground of the Lady <hi>Campden's,</hi> called the
<hi>Conygree</hi> (which, to those who have a Key
to go through the Garden, is the next Way
from that Place to Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi>'s House);
when they came near unto that Gate, he,
the said <hi>John Perry,</hi> saith he told his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he did believe his Master was just
gone into the <hi>Conygree,</hi> (for it was then so
dark they could not discern any Man so as to
know him) but perceiving one to go into
that Ground, and knowing there was no
Way (but for those who had a Key) through
the Gardens, concluded it was his Master;
and so told his Brother, if he followed him he
might have his Money, and he, in the mean
Time, would walk a Turn in the Fields,
which accordingly he did; and then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Brother, about the middle of the <hi>Cony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi>
found his Master on the Ground, his
Brother upon him, and his Mother standing
by; and being asked, whether his Master
were then dead? answered No; for that, after
he came to them, his Master cried, <hi>Ah
Rogues, will you kill me?</hi> At which, he told
his Brother, he hoped he would not kill his
Master; who replied, <hi>Peace, Peace, you
are Fool,</hi> and so strangled him; which have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38540:6"/>
done, he took a Bag of Money out of
his Pocket, and threw it into his Mother's
Lap; and then he and his Brother carried
his Master's dead Body into the Garden ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining
to the <hi>Conygree,</hi> where they consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what to do with it; and at length agreed
to throw it into the great Sink, by <hi>Walling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s
Mill, behind the Garden; but said, his
Mother and Brother bad him go up to the
Court (next the House) to hearken whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any one were stirring, and they would
throw the Body into the Sink: And being
asked, whether it were there? he said,
he knew not, for that he left it in the
Garden; but his Mother and Brother said
they would throw it there; and if it were not
there, he knew not were it was, for that he
returned no more to them, but went into
the Court-gate, which goes into the Town,
where he met with <hi>John Pierce,</hi> with whom
he went into the Field, and again returned
with him to his Master's Gate; after which,
he went into the Hen-roost, where he lay
till twelve o'Clock that Night, but slept
not; and having (when he came from his
Mother and Brother) brought with him his
Master's Hat, Band, and Comb, which he
laid in the Hen-roost; he carried the said
Hat, Band, and Comb, and threw them
(after he had given them three or four Cuts
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38540:7"/>
with his Knife) in the Highway, where they
were after found: And being asked, what
he intended by so doing? said, he did it
that it might be believed his Master had
been there robbed and murdered; and have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus disposed of his Hat, Band, and
Comb, he went towards <hi>Charringworth,</hi>
&amp;c. as hath been related.</p>
            <p>Upon this Confession and Accusation, the
Justice of Peace gave Order for the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
of <hi>Joan</hi> and <hi>Richard Perry,</hi> the
Mother and Brother of <hi>John Perry,</hi> and for
searching the Sink where Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi>'s
Body was said to be thrown; which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
done, but nothing of him could
be there found: The Fish-pools likewise (in
<hi>Campden</hi>) were drawn and searched, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be there found neither: So that
some were of Opinion, the Body might be hid
in the Ruins of <hi>Campden-house,</hi> burnt in the
late Wars, and not unfit for such a Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
where was likewise Search made, but
all in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday August</hi> the 25th, <hi>Joan</hi> and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Perry,</hi> together with <hi>John Perry,</hi>
were brought before the Justice of Peace,
who acquainting the said <hi>Joan</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi>
with what <hi>John</hi> had laid to their Charge,
they denied all, with many Imprecations on
themselves, if they were in the least guilty of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38540:7"/>
any Thing of which they were accused: But
<hi>John</hi> on the other Side affirmed (to their
Faces) that he had spoken nothing but the
Truth, and that they had murdered his
Master; further telling them, that he could
never be quiet for them, since he came into
into his Master's Service, being continually
followed by them, to help them to Money,
which they told him he might do, by give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them Notice when his Master went to
receive his Lady's Rents; and that he
meeting his Brother <hi>Richard</hi> in <hi>Campden</hi>
Town, the <hi>Thursday</hi> Morning his Master
went to <hi>Charringworth,</hi> told him whither
he was going, and upon what Errand. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
confessed he met his Brother that
Morning, and spoke with him, but nothing
passed between them to that Purpose; and
both he and his Mother told <hi>John,</hi> he was
a Villain to accuse them wrongfully, as he
had done: But <hi>John</hi> on the other Side af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
that he had spoken nothing but the
Truth, and would justify it to his Death.</p>
            <p>One remarkable Circumstance happened in
these Prisoners Return from the Justice of
the Peace's House to <hi>Campden,</hi> viz. <hi>Richard
Perry</hi> (following a good Distance behind
his Brother <hi>John</hi>) pulling a Clout out of his
Pocket, dropped a Ball of Inkle, which one
of his Guard taking up, he desired him to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38540:8"/>
restore it, saying it was only his Wife's Hair-lace;
but the Party opening of it, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Slip-knot at the End, went and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it unto <hi>John,</hi> who was then a good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
before, and so knew nothing of the
dropping and taking up of this Inkle.; but
being shewed it, and asked whether he
knew it, shook his Head and said, Yea, to
his Sorrow; for that was the String his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
strangled his Master with. This was
sworn upon the Evidence at their Trial.</p>
            <p>The Morrow being the Lord's Day, they
remained at <hi>Campden,</hi> where the Minister of
the Place designing to speak to them (if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to persuade them to Repentance, and a
farther Confession) they were brought to
Church; and in their Way thither, passing
by <hi>Richard</hi>'s House, two of his Children
meeting him, he took the lesser in his Arm,
leading the other in his Hand, when on a
sudden both their Noses fell a bleeding,
which was looked upon as ominous.</p>
            <p>Here it will be no impertinent Digression
to tell, how the Year before Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi>
had his House broke open between Eleven
and Twelve o'Clock at Noon, upon <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
Market-day, whilst himself and his
whole Family were at the Lecture; a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
being set up to a Window of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Story, and an Iron Bar wrenched thence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38540:8"/>
with a Plough-share, which was left in
the Room, and sevenscore Pounds in Money
carried away, the Authors of which Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
could never be found.</p>
            <p>After this, and not many Weeks before
Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi>'s Absence, his Servant <hi>Perry,</hi>
one Evening, in <hi>Campden</hi> Garden, made an
hideous Out-cry, whereat some who heard
it coming in, met him running, and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
frighted, with a Sheep-pick in his
Hand, to whom he told a formal Story,
how he had been set upon by two Men in
White, with naked Swords, and how he
defended himself with his Sheep-pick, the
Handle whereof was cut in two or three
Places; and likewise a Key in his Pocket,
which he said was done with one of their
Swords.</p>
            <p>These Passages the Justice of Peace having
before heard, and calling to Mind, upon
<hi>Perry</hi>'s Confession, asked him first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Robbery, when his Master lost
sevenscore Pounds out of his House, at
Noon-day, Whether he knew who did it?
Who answered, Yes, it was his Brother:
And being further asked, Whether he were
then with him? he answered, No, he was
then at Church; but that he gave him
Notice of the Money, and told him in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38540:9"/>
which Room it was, and where he might
have a Ladder that would reach the
Window; and that his Brother afterwards
told him he had the Money, and had
buried it in his Garden; and that they
were at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> next to have divided it.
Whereupon Search was made in the Garden,
but no Money could be there found.</p>
            <p>And being further asked concerning that
other Passage, of his being assaulted in the
Garden, he confessed it was all a Fiction;
and that, having a Design to rob his Master,
he did it, that Rogues (being believed to
haunt the Place, when his Master was
robbed) might be thought to have done it.</p>
            <p>At the next Assizes, which were held
in <hi>September</hi> following, <hi>John, Joan,</hi> and
<hi>Richard Perry,</hi> had two Indictments found
against them; one for breaking into <hi>William
Harrison</hi>'s House, and robbing him of <hi>140l.</hi>
in the Year 1659; the other for robbing
and murdering the said <hi>William Harrison,</hi> the
16th of <hi>August,</hi> 1660. Upon the last In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
the then Judge of Assizes, Sir
<hi>Christopher Turner,</hi> would not try them,
because the Body was not found; but they
were then tried upon the other Indictment
for Robbery, to which they pleaded Not
Guilty; but, some whispering behind them,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38540:9"/>
they soon after pleaded Guilty, humbly
begging the Benefit of his Majesty's gracious
Pardon and Act of Oblivion, which was
granted them.</p>
            <p>But, tho' they pleaded Guilty to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,
being thereunto prompted (as is
probable) by some who were unwilling to
lose Time, and trouble the Court with their
Trial, in regard the Act of Oblivion par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
them; yet they all, afterwards, and
at their Deaths, denied that they were guilty
of that Robbery, or that they knew who
did it.</p>
            <p>Yet at this Assize, as several credible
Persons have affirmed, <hi>John Perry</hi> still per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in his Story, That his Mother and
Brother had murdered his Master; and
further added, That they had attempted to
poison him in the Gaol, so that he durst
neither eat nor drink with them.</p>
            <p>At the next Assizes, which were the
Spring following, <hi>John, Joan,</hi> and <hi>Richard
Perry,</hi> were by the then Judge of Assize,
Sir <hi>B. Hyde,</hi> tried upon the Indictment of
Murder, and pleaded thereunto (severally)
Not Guilty; and when <hi>John</hi>'s Confession
before the Justice was proved, <hi>Viva Voce,</hi> by
several Witnesses who heard the same, he
told them, He was then mad, and knew
not what he said.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:38540:10"/>
The other two, <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Joan Perry,</hi>
said, That they were wholly innocent of
what they were accused; and That they
knew nothing of Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi>'s Death, nor
what was become of him; and <hi>Richard</hi>
said, That his Brother had accused others,
as well as him, to have murdered his
Master; which the Judge bidding him
prove, he said, That most of those that
had given Evidence against him knew it;
but naming none, not any one spoke to
it, and so the Jury found them all three
Guilty.</p>
            <p>Some few Days after, being brought to
the Place of their Execution, which was on
<hi>Broadway-Hill,</hi> within Sight of <hi>Campden,</hi>
the Mother (being reputed a Witch, and
to have so bewitched her Sons, they could
confess nothing while she lived) was first
executed: After which, <hi>Richard</hi> being upon
the Ladder, professed, as he had done all
along, That he was wholly innocent of the
Fact for which he was then to die; and
that he knew nothing of Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi>'s
Death, nor what was become of him; and
did, with great Earnestness, beg and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
his Brother (for the Satisfaction of the
whole World, and his own Conscience) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what he knew concerning him; but he,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38540:10"/>
with a dogged and surly Carriage, told the
People, he was not obliged to confess to
them; yet, immediately before his Death,
said, He knew nothing of his Master's
Death, nor what was become of him, but
they might hereafter (possibly) hear.</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>IN Obedience to your Commands, I give
you this true Account of my being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away beyond the Seas, my Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
there, and Return Home. On a
<hi>Thursday,</hi> in the Afternoon, in Harvest-time,
I went to <hi>Charringworth,</hi> to demand
Rents due to my Lady <hi>Campden,</hi> at which
Time the Tenants were busy in the Fields,
and late e're they came Home, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
my Stay there 'till the Close of
the Evening. I expected a considerable
Sum, but received only <hi>231.</hi> and no more.
In my Return Home (in the narrow Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
among <hi>Ebrington</hi> Furzes) there met
me one Horseman, and said, <hi>Art thou
there?</hi> and I, fearing he would ride over
me, struck his Horse over the Nose; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he struck at me with his Sword
several Blows, and run it into my Side;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38540:11"/>
while I (with my little Cane) made my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
as well as I could: At last another
came behind me, and run me into the
Thigh, laid hold on the Collar of my
Doublet, and drew me to a Hedge, near
that Place; then came in another: They
did not take my Money, but mounted me
behind one of them, drew my Arms about
his middle, and fastened my Wrists toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with something that had a Spring-lock
to it, as I conceived, by hearing it
give a Snap as they put it on; then they
threw a great Cloak over me, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me away: In the Night they alighted
at a Hay-rick, which stood near unto a
Stone-pit, by a Wall-side, where they took
away my Money, about two Hours before
Day (as I heard one of them tell the other
he thought it to be then) they tumbled me
into the Stone-pit; they staid (as I thought)
about an Hour at the Hay-rick, when they
took Horse again; one of them bad me
come out of the Pit; I answered, they had
my Money already; and asked what they
would do with me, whereupon he struck
me again, drew me out, and put a great
Quantity of Money in my Pockets, and
mounted me again after the same Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and on the <hi>Friday,</hi> about Sun-set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
they brought me to a lone House
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38540:12"/>
upon a Heath, (by a Thicket of Bushes) where
they took me down almost dead, being sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bruised with the Carriage of the Money:
When the Woman of the House saw that
I could neither stand nor speak, she asked
them whether, or no, they had brought a
dead Man? They answered, No, but a
Friend that was hurt, and they were carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to a Surgeon. She answered, if
they did not make Haste, their Friend would
be dead before they could bring him to one.
There they laid me on Cushions, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
none to come into the Room but a
little Girl. There we staid all Night, they
giving me some Broth and Strong Waters:
In the Morning, very early, they mounted
me as before, and on <hi>Saturday</hi> Night they
brought me to a Place where were two or
three Houses, in one of which I lay all
Night on Cushions by their Bed-side: On
<hi>Sunday</hi> Morning they carried me from
thence, and about three or four o'Clock,
they brought me to a Place by the Sea-side,
called <hi>Deal,</hi> where they laid me down on
the Ground; and one of them staying by
me, the other two walked a little off, to
meet a Man, with whom they talked, and,
in their Discourse, I heard them mention
seven Pounds; after which they went away
together, and about half an Hour after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38540:12"/>
The Man (whose Name, as I after
heard, was <hi>Wrenshaw</hi>) said, he feared I
would die before he could get me on Board.
Then presently they put me into a Boat,
and carried me on Ship-board, where my
Wounds were dressed. I remained in the
Ship (as near as I could reckon) about six
Weeks, in which Time I was indifferently
recovered of my Wounds and Weakness.
Then the Master of the Ship came and told
me, (and the rest who were in the same
Condition) that he discovered three <hi>Turkish</hi>
Ships: We all offered to fight in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Ship and ourselves, but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us to keep close, and said he would
deal with them well enough: A little while
after he called us up, and when we came
on the Deck, we saw two <hi>Turkish</hi> Ships
close by us; into one of which we were
put, and placed in a dark Hole, where
how long we continued before we were
landed, I know not: When we were land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they led us two Days Journey, and put
us into a great House, or Prison, where we
remained four Days and a half; and then
came to us eight Men to view us, who
seemed to be Officers; they called us and
examined us of our Trades and Callings,
which every one answered: One said he was
a Chirurgeon; another, that he was a Broad-cloth-Weaver,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38540:13"/>
and I (after two or three
Demands) said I had some Skill in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick:
We three were set by, and taken by
three of those eight Men that came to view
us: It was my Chance to be chosen by a
grave Physician of eighty-seven Years of
Age, who lived near to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who had
formerly been in <hi>England,</hi> and knew <hi>Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> which he preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all other Places in <hi>England:</hi> He em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
me to keep his Still-house, and gave
me a Silver Bowl, double gilt, to drink in;
my Business was most in that Place; but
but once he set me to gather Cotton-wool,
which I not doing to his Mind, he struck
me down to the Ground, and after drew his
Steletto to stab me; but I holding up my
Hands to him, he gave a Stamp, and turned
from me; for which I render Thanks to
my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who
staid his Hand and preserved me. I was
there about a Year and three Quarters, and
then my Master fell sick on a <hi>Thursday,</hi> and
sent for me; and calling me, as he used, by
the Name of <hi>Boll,</hi> told me he should die, and
bad me shift for myself: He died on <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
following, and I presently hastened with
my Bowl to a Port almost a Day's Journey
distant; the Way to which Place I knew,
having been twice there employed by my
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38540:13"/>
Master about the Carriage of his Cotton-wool:
When I came thither, I addressed
myself to two Men who came out of a Ship
of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> which (as they said) was
bound for <hi>Portugal,</hi> within three or four
Days. I enquired of them for an <hi>English</hi>
Ship; they answered, there was none. I
entreated them to take me into their Ship;
they answered, they durst not, for Fear of
being discovered by the Searchers, which
might occasion the Forfeiture, not only of
Goods, but also of their Lives: I was very
importunate with them, but could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail;
they left me to wait on Providence,
which at length brought another out of the
same Ship, to whom I made known my
Condition, craving his Assistance for my
Transportation; he made me the like An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
as the former, and was stiff in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
till the Sight of my Bowl put him to
a Pause: He returned to the Ship, and after
half an Hour's Space he came back again, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with another Seaman, and for my
Bowl undertook to transport me; but told
me, I must be contented to lie down in the
Keel, and endure much Hardship, which I
was content to do, to gain my Liberty; so
they took me on Board, and placed me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in the Vessel in a very uneasy Place, and
obscured me with Boards and other Things,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38540:14"/>
where I lay undiscovered, notwithstanding
the strict Search that was made in the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel:
My two Chapmen, who had my Bowl,
honestly furnished me with Victuals daily,
until we arrived at <hi>Lisbon</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> where
(as soon as the Master had left the Ship, and
was gone into the City) they set me on
Shore moneyless to shift for myself. I
knew not what Course to take; but, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
led me, I went up into the City,
and came into a fair Street; and being weary,
I turned my Back to a Wall, and leaned
upon my Staff: Over-against me were four
Gentlemen discoursing together; after a
while one of them came to me, and spake
to me in a Language that I understood not: I
told him I was an <hi>Englishman,</hi> and understood
not what he spake; he answered me in plain
<hi>English,</hi> that he understood me, and was
himself born near <hi>Wisbich</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire;</hi>
then I related to him my sad Condition, and
he taking Compassion on me, took me with
him, provided for me Lodging and Diet,
and by his Interest with a Master of a Ship,
bound for <hi>England,</hi> procured my Passage;
and bringing me on Ship-board, he bestowed
Wine and Strong Waters on me, and at his
Return gave me eight Stivers, and commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me to the Care of the Master of the Ship,
who landed me safe at <hi>Dover,</hi> from whence
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38540:14"/>
I made Shift to get to <hi>London,</hi> where being
furnished with Necessaries, I came into the
Country.</p>
                  <p>Thus, honoured Sir, I have given you a
true Account of my great Sufferings, and
happy Deliverance by the Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, my most gracious Father in
Jesus Christ, my Saviour and Redeemer; to
whose Name be ascribed all Honour, Praise,
and Glory. I conclude and rest,</p>

            <p>MANY question the Truth of this
Account Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> gives of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and his Transportation, believing he
was never out of <hi>England:</hi> But there is no
Question of <hi>Perry</hi>'s telling a formal false
Story to hang himself, his Mother, and his
Brother: And since this, of which we
are assured, is no less incredible than that
of which we doubt, it may induce us to
suspend hard Thoughts of Mr. <hi>Harrison,</hi>
'till Time, the great Discoverer of Truth,
shall bring to Light this dark and mysterious
Business. That Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> was absent
from his Habitation, Employment, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
near two Years, is certain; and, if
not carried away, (as he affirms) no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Reason can be given for his Absence;
he living plentifully and happily in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of that honourable Family, to which
he had been then related above fifty Years,
with the Reputation of a just and faithful
Servant; and, having all his Days been a
Man of sober Life and Conversation, cannot
now reasonably be thought, in his Old-age,
so far to have misbehaved himself, as in
such a Manner voluntarily to have forsaken
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38540:16"/>
his Wife, his Children, and his Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and to leave behind him (as he then
did) a considerable Sum of his Lady's
Money in his House. We cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in Reason and Charity, but believe
that Mr. <hi>Harrison</hi> was forcibly carried away;
but by whom, or by whose Procurement,
is the Question. Those whom he affirms
did it, he withal affirms never before to
have seen; and that he saw not his Servant
<hi>Perry,</hi> nor his Mother, nor his Brother,
the Evening he was carried away. That
he was spirited (as some are said to have
been) is no ways probable, in respect he
was an old and infirm Man, and taken
from the most inland Part of the Nation:
And if sold, as himself apprehends he was,
for seven Pounds, that would not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the Trouble and Charge of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
to the Sea Side.</p>
            <p>Some therefore have had hard Thoughts
of his eldest Son, not knowing whom else
to suspect; and believe the Hopes of the
Stewardship, which he afterwards (by the
Lord <hi>Campden</hi>'s Favour) enjoyed, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him to contrive his Father's Removal;
and this they are the more confirmed in
from his Misbehaviour in it: But, on the
other Side, 'tis hard to think the Son should
be knowing of his Father's Transportation;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38540:16"/>
and, consequently, of these unhappy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons'
Innocency, as to the Murder of him,
and yet prosecute them to Death, as he
did; and, when condemned, should be the
Occasion of their being conveyed above
twenty Miles, to suffer near <hi>Campden,</hi> and
to procure <hi>John Perry</hi> to be there hanged
in Chains, where he might daily see him;
and himself to stand at the Foot of the
Ladder, when they were all executed, as
likewise he did.</p>
            <p>These Considerations, as they make it
improbable the Son should be privy to his
Father's Transportation, so they render the
whole Matter the more dark and mysterious;
which we must therefore leave unto Him
who alone knoweth all Things, in His due
Time, to reveal and bring to Light.</p>
