            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For not abiding to proue, either that they are in the right, or wee in the wrong, they content them selues generally to inueigh, against Schisme and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, &amp; to shew foorth the daunger of both, in which argument while they conteine them selues, they yeeld many good and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall reasons, as is not hard for them to do, which take a good cause in hande. But when they come to couple this argument of Schisme or Heresie, either by affirmation vnto vs, or by denial vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them selues, (without which there can no conclusion be made, of the whole cause in controuersie) they bring nothing but a stale, vnlearned, and miserable beggerie, of the whole matter in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: namely that they are the Catholikes, &amp; we the Schismatikes, they are the Church, and wee the Heresie. Such is the whole drift of Gregorie Martinus vaine Treatise of Schisme, such is the scope of Hides seditious Epistle <hi>Consolatorie</hi> vnto Papistes, and the same is the policie of this blasphemous and traiterous discourse, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the coulorable reasons made for the Papistes, that refuse to go to Church.

But this seemeth strange that you cite out of <hi>Nicephorus lib. 3 cap. 30.</hi> That <hi>the Apostles and their schollers, were so wary and circumspect in this case (of auoidyng Heretikes) that they would not so much as once reason the matter with any of them, who indeuoured by their lying, or newe deuises to corrupt the trueth.</hi> Haue you set out your cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, to challendge the combate, and will you nowe giue ouer the battell? must you follow the example of the Apostles and their schollers, not so much as once to reason the matter with vs, whom you account for here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Diuell ought the Papistes a shame to make so proude an offer of disputation, which they neuer ment shoulde holde, as appeareth not onely by the present flight of the challenger, notwithstanding hée prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth that hée was prepared to suffer any torment, that shoulde bée laide on his body, for his constant confession, but also by the plaine attestation of this his associate, wherby it is euidently bewrayed, that suche bolde prouocation was nothing els but a traiterous and seditious deuice, to erect the peoples mindes in eexpctation, of some change in religion, while other diuilishe practises were in working in Irelande and the like attempted in England.

Seeing euery naughtie action commonly hath some kind<note place="margin">Marke "these ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities.</note> of compulsion in it, but yet it may not bee excused thereby. As for example, the murtherer may say that hee did it not willingly, for that hee was compelled thereunto by rage of anger. And the Lecherer may say, his fleshe compelled him to sinne: and to take fitter example for our purpose: all those that denied Christe in time of persecution for feare of tormentes, mighte by your obiection, say that they did it not willingly but by compulsion of torments, and therefore were not to bee damned for it. But yet Christe saide, that hee woulde take it as doone voluntarily, and therefore damne them for it, by deniyng them openly before his Father, and his Angelles, at the day of iudgement.<note place="margin">Mat. 10. Luc. 12. lo. 12.</note> And yet to giue an other example neerer to oure matter: Sainte Iohn saieth of the noble men and Gentlemen of Iurie in his time. <hi>Many of the principall men did beleeue in Christe, but they did not confesse him outwardly for feare of the Pharisees least they shoulde bee caste out of the Sinagogue, for they did loue more the glory of men then the glory of God.</hi>

                  <p>Heere wee see the act of these noble men and Gentlemen: also the compulsion to the act, the cause of their compulsion, &amp; lastly Saint Iohns iudgement vpon the act. The act wherof they are accused is only holding their peace, &amp; not confessing Christ openly, according as they did inward ly beleeue of him: The cause or excuse that they had to lay for themselues,

                  <p>Fourthly, albeit the Protestantes seruice had not all this euil in it, as it hath: yet were it nought, because it hath not in it, those good things which Christian seruice should haue. For seruice may bee euil, as well for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing too litle, as for hauing too much. As the seruice of the Arrians was, for singing, Glorie to the Father, and not singing the same to the Sonne: And as if a man should recyte his Creede, and leaue out one article (as in effect the Protestants doe the article of discention into hell) all the whole Creede were nought thereby. Nowe, howe many thinges doe want in the Protestantes seruice, which should be in Christian seruice, it were too long in euerie point to rehearse: yet will I (for examples sake) name two or three thinges. First therefore, they haue left out the chiefest, and highest thinges of all: which is the blessed Sacrifice of Christ his Bodie and Blood appointed by Christ, to bee offered vp euerie day for thankes giuing to God, for obteyning of grace, and auoyding of all euil, and for the remission of sinnes both o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The which sacrifice bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, no Christian seruice can bee saide to be there: For so much as, for this cause were ordeined Priests, neither can there any be called Priest but in respect of this sacrifice: also in respect of this sacrifice were chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian churches called Temples, for this sacrifice were made Aulters: for an Aulter is the place of sacrifice, euen as an armorie is the place where armour is.

First, that that they are to bee had in great reuerence, and to bee contemned of no man.

Also for hauing their seruice in an other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and language then the vniuersall church vseth: But this is sufficient.

Which thinges, if a man consider and examine, there is no neede of large treatie or argumentes. The tryall vnto trueth, is easie by the compendiousnesse of trueth: Our Lorde speaketh to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: I say to thee (quoth hee) that thou art Peter, and vppon this stone, I will buylde my church, and the gates of hell shall not ouercome it.

You sée that Cyprian saith nothing for his title, but against the Antichristian authority, pretended therby, very much &amp; very effectuously.</q> But what saieth <hi>Chrisostome</hi> in his 2. booke <hi>de sacerdotio,</hi> sounding to that purpose? I finde nothing, but that he admonisheth <hi>Basill,</hi> that he had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury in being taken by sorce, and made a priest, séeing he was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made equall with Peter, euen as Peter excelled all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. <hi>Etiam ne nunc nobiscum, &amp;c.</hi>

Which by it, art to be made ouerseer of all the goodes of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, especially when thou doest those thinges, whiche when Peter did, Christ woulde haue him to be indued with authoritie, and also farre to excell the other apostles. These woordes shewe, that euery Priest when he doeth the same thinges which Peter did, is indued with the same authoritie that Peter was, and farr passeth all other men.</q> And that Peter was not simplie preferred in authority, but only when he did execute his charge &amp; therfore so preferred that euerie minister in teaching and administring the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, hath the same authoritie and excellencie.</p>
                  <p>The next title pretended to be giuen to the Pope, by all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, is the Bishop of the vniuersal church, For which is quoted <hi>Cyprian Epist. 46.</hi> that of <hi>Cyprian</hi> is no more, but that certaine Confessors, which had ioyned with the <hi>Nouatian</hi> Scismatikes, that made an other Bishop at Rome beside <hi>Cornelius,</hi> returning to the Church, acknowledged that <hi>Cornelius</hi> was the right bishop of the Catholike Church, and <hi>Nouatus,</hi> or <hi>Nouatianus</hi> a false by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of a scismaticall Church, The wordes of their confession are these, <hi>Nos inquiunt. &amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>We say they, doe know that Cornelius is set vp by God Almightie, and by our Lorde Iesus Christ, a bishop of the most holy Catholike church. We confesse our errour. We haue been circumuented, being carried out of our right minde by factious loquacitie of falshood, Wee seemed to haue as it were a certayne communicating with a schismaticall person: but our mynde was alwaye sincere in the churche, neyther are wee ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunte, that there is one GOD, and one Christe, our Lorde, whom we haue confessed, one holye Ghoste, that there</hi>

                        <hi>ought to be but one bishop in a catholike church.</hi>
                     </q> Meaning that in euery Catholike Churche, there ought to bée but one Byshoppe at once, not that there shoulde bee but one bishop of all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church, which were a monstrous absurdity.</p>
                  <p>The thirde title, is The Pastour of the Churche, for whiche is quoted <hi>Chrisostome lib. 2. <hi>de Sacer.</hi>
                     </hi> Where I finde nothing that hath any shewe of suche a matter, more then I haue alreadye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>

                     </hi> and <hi>Leo Epist. 84,</hi> These are both bishops of Rome, and partiall witnesses, to depose of theyr owne Prerogatiue, shewing what they claymed, and not what al antiquitie gaue vnto them.

Which this reasoner sayth was giuen him by all antiquitie.</p>
                  <p>The fifth title is the repurger of heresies, for which is quoted: <hi>Sy Alex. 4. apud Athanasium.</hi> But Athanasius allowed no suche<note place="margin">Conc.

                  <p>The sixth title is, The examiner of al bishops causes, for which is quoted. <hi>Theodor. lib. 2. hist. cap. 4.</hi> UUhere there is no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but that <hi>Athanasius</hi> desired to haue his cause examined and tried by <hi>Iulius</hi> Bishop of Rome, which when it procéeded not because his aduersaries would not appeare, his cause was referred by the Empérour <hi>Constantius</hi> his commaundement, to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Sardica,</hi> when finding no helpe in <hi>Iulius</hi> the Byshoppe he had first appealed to the Emperour <hi>Constance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last title is, The great Priest in obeying whom all vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie consisteth, and by disobeying of whome, all heresies and

Schismes arise. <hi>Cyp. Epist. 55.</hi> This place is alreadie answered, to pertaine no more to the bishoppe of Rome, then to any other Bishop.</p>
                  <p>A second cause he rendreth, why our seruice is blasphemous, because wee pray to be deliuered from papistrie, which hee sayth, is onely true religion, but that hath neede of many suppositions to prooue it.</p>
                  <p>A third cause he yeeldeth, <hi>Because they sing it and make other sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple men to sing it, in the beginning of sermons and otherwise, as though it were scripture it selfe, and one of Dauids Psalmes.</hi> If men were as ignorant in the scriptures and Psaimes of Dauid, as the Papists would haue them to be, this pretensed cause coulde haue but smale coller, seeing the title of this hymme, in euery booke plainly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that it is none of Dauids Psalmes, and the prayer conceiued therein for the Queene and her Councell, with diuers other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questes, pec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>The fourth reason in particuler, why the Protestantes must be déemed naught, is, <hi>Albeit it had not all this euill in it, yet because it hath not in it, those good thinges, which christian seruice should haue: for seruice</hi> (sayth he) <hi>may be euill as well for hauing too little, as for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing too much, as the Arrians seruice, for singing glory to the father, and not singing the same to the sonne. As if a man should recite his Creed, and leaue out one article, as in effect the Protestants doe the article of discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into hell, all the whole Creede were naught thereby.</hi> In deede whatsoeuer is defectiue in any necessarye parte, cannot bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly good, in the whole, but that for wante of some good partes, all other good partes shoulde bee naught, that is a great vntrueth: as also it is a senselesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For albeit, it be prohibited by the churche, yet not onely by the church: seeing that a thing may be prohibited by the canons of the churche (for more plaine explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sake) which was forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before by the law both of nature &amp; of God also: as Adulterie, Violence, Simonie, and the like.

For when a<note place="margin">Marke this obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of going to the materiall Church.</note> thing it selfe is naught, no protestation can make it lawefull, but rather maketh the doing of it a greater offence, by adding the vnlawefulnesse of the thing the repugnaunce of the doers conscience. But you will perhaps say: to goe to the material church, is not a thing euill of it selfe. I answere and graunt that it is true. But you must not single out the matter so. For in this one action of going to church, there be many things contained, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the whole action is compounded. As for example, there is the material church: the possession of the same by the enemie of the catholike religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the seruice and sermons in reproofe of the same religion: the dayes and houres appoynted for the same: the bel ringing and publikly calling al men thither: the Princes commaundemente for the Catholikes to goe to the same: the end of the commaundement in general, that they, by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Hovv many things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Then is there the peril of infection: the scandal wherby I offend other mens consciences: and perhaps bring diuers other to bee corrupted by my meanes: the dishonouring of God his case: the honouring of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies cause: hearing God blasphemed, and holding my peace: Semblably there is the conscience of the catholike, that thinketh he doth nought: the explication of the church, that is not lawfull: the matter nowe in tryall: and the vnlawfulnesse of it, defended both by word and writings of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, ann by imprisonment of many other: the controuersie now kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne to all the world and many thousand mens eies fixed vpon them, that are called in question for it: the Protestant, wheras he esteemed nothing of goeing to Church before, yet now so desirous to obtayne it, that hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the yeelding in that one poynt, to bee a sufficient yeelding to all his desires: the which thing on the other side, is so detested of the true catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, that, whosoeuer yeeldeth to this, they thinke him a flat Schismatike, and so abhor him. And by this meanes the matter is made a signe distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue betwixt religion and religion: whereof againe it foloweth, that if the thing were much lesse then it is (as for example, the holding vp of a finger) yet because it is made, <hi>Tessera,</hi> a marke, token, or signe of yeeling to

What neede the confutation in writing, when wee haue séene it in practise of déedes.
