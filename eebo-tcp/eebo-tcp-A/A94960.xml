            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Doctrine and the Practiſe of depoſing and deſtroying
Kings being meerly derived from the Principles of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
(as moſt abundantly may be ſhown if we had either
the room or the leiſure of giving you a Catalogue of their horrible
Poſitions;) we ſhall at this time wave that unpleaſing Enquiry, and
in the firſt place give you an Account of the Tryall and Execution
of many of thoſe perſons, who in the year, 1648 entred into an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
Conſpiracy for the taking away the life of our late dread
Soveraign <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, whoſe Memory (for all the bloudy En<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deavours
of his Aſſaſſinates) ſhall be bleſſed for evermore.</p>
            <p>The Sentence againſt the King being pronounced on <hi>Saturday,
Jan.</hi> 27. 1648: And all the Members of the ſaid Court ſtanding up, &amp;
aſſenting to what was pronounced by the Preſident by the holding up
of their hands; the King offer'd to ſpeak for himſelf but was not ſufferd</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> following, Sir <hi>Hardreſſe Waller,</hi> Maj. Gen. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> Col.
<hi>Ireton,</hi> Col. <hi>Dean,</hi> &amp; Col. <hi>Okey</hi> were appointed to conſider of the Time
and Place for the Execution of the King according to the Sentence.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Tueſday</hi> being the Fatal Day of the Execution, His Majeſty
continued in prayer all the morning, and received the Sacrament;
And about Ten of the Clock in the Forenoon, he was conducted on
foot from St. <hi>James</hi>'s Palace to <hi>White-hall</hi> by a Regiment of Foot
Souldiers, part before Him and part behind Him, with Colours fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Drums beating, and a private Guard of Part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

him; Doctor <hi>Juxon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> was next unto him on the one
fide, and Col. <hi>Tomlinſon</hi> on the other; being come to <hi>Whitehall</hi> he
continued in his Cabinet chamber at his Devotions refuſing to Dine,
only about Twelve a clock he Eat a bit or two of bread, and drank
a Glaſſe of Claret Wine; From thence he was conveyed to the
Banquetting Houſe, and the window being inlarged he paſſed
through it to the Scaffold, the Rayls being hung round, and the
Floor covered with Black, His Executioners were diſguiſed with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
which nothing at all affrighted his Majeſty. He ſhewed more
care of the people living, then of himſelf dying: And looking round
about upon the people, whom the thick Guards of Souldiers kept at
a great diſtance, and perceiving he could not be heard by them, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
(probably) what he purpoſed to have ſpoken to them, he
turned to the Officers that on the Scaffold were near unto him, and
expreſſed himſelf in a ſhort, and excellent Speech, which being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he meekly kneeled down and prayed; And afterwards, after
ſome heavenly Diſcourſe betwixt the Biſhop and Himſelf, He lifted
up his eyes to Heaven, and mildly prayed; And ſtooping down to the
Block, He moſt humbly bowed his neck to God, and the vizarded Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceutioner
cut off his head at one Blow. <hi>Thus fell King</hi> Charles, <hi>and
thus fell all Britain with Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have hitherto given you an account what theſe barbarous perſons have done,
we ſhall now repreſent unto you the moſt juſt judgements which after 12 years
forbearance, a great part of them have ſuffered, and which many more of them are
condemned to ſuffer for this horrible Murder they have committed.</p>
            <p>On the beginning of the month of <hi>May,</hi> there were Remonſtances preſented to
the Houſe of Lords then ſitting in Parliament, both from <hi>Ireland</hi> and from <hi>Scotland</hi>
demanding Juſtice for the moſt horrid, and unparallelled Murder committed on
the Sacred Perſon of the late King. And on <hi>Friday</hi> the 18. of <hi>May</hi> upon complaint
made by the Commons in Parliament, an order was iſſued from the houſe of Lords,
that the Eſtates both Reall, and Perſonall of thoſe perſons who ſate in Judgement
upon the late Kings Majeſty (whether in their own hands, or in the hands of any
in truſt) be forthwith ſeized and ſecured, and they agreed alſo upon the Names
and number of thoſe perſons who were to be exempted from pardon.</p>
            <p>Not long afterwards ſeveral of them came in, and ſurrendred themſelves in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of mercy, divers of them being Guilty of their Horrible Conſpiracy fled
beyond the Seas, and divers of them were taken and committed to the Tower of
<hi>London</hi> in order to their Tryall.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday September</hi> 22, His Majeſty ſent out a Proclamation for the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
of Col. <hi>Whaley</hi> and Col. <hi>Goffe</hi> who were exempted from pardon by Act
of Parliament, as Traytors for their execrable treaſon in ſentencing to Death our
late Soveraign King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt of bleſſed memory; it was there declared that
whoſoever ſhould diſcover the ſaid Traytors, and cauſe them to be brought in alive,
or dead (in caſe of reſiſtance ſhould have a reward of 100<hi>l.</hi> for each of the ſaid
Traytors, and it was ordered that a reward of 300<hi>l.</hi> ſhould be faithfully paid to
any that ſhould apprehend Col. <hi>Edmund Ludlow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Munday October</hi> 8. Was the long expected Tryal of many of the Judges of our
late Soveraign Lord King <hi>Charles.</hi> Sir <hi>Orlando Bridgeman</hi> in an Eloquent and a

But Major Gen <hi>Harriſon</hi> who in the way from the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>Newgate</hi> had ſhewed
ſome tokens of a very inſolent ſpirit did behave himſelf with the ſame boldneſs
when he was brought to the Bar, for he refuſed to hold up his hand at the Bar,
&amp; the Judges prompting him to his duty, he at the laſt ſaid I conceive it to be but
a formality, and therefore am contented to doe it, being demanded guilty or not
guilty, he did fly out oftentimes into impertinencies, but at the laſt being made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the great danger into which his obſtinacy did threaten to bring him, he
replyed not Guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, or not Guilty, he at the laſt replyed not Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry Marten</hi> pleading the Act of Indempnity, it was told him that he was an
Exempted perſon, but Alleaging that his Name was miſtaken, and that he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
all penal Laws were to be taken literaly, he was at the laſt ſatisfied in his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and pleaded not guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robert Lilburn</hi> did refuſe to anſwer, and would ſeem to ſtand out to Law, but
the Judges telling him how little the law would make for him, he ſaid not guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Carew</hi> would give no anſwer till his Majeſties Atturny General told him
that he ſhould be recorded for his ſtubborn ſilence, whereupon he ſaid not guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thomas Scot, Tho. Wayte,</hi> and <hi>Dan. Axtell,</hi> did all refuſe to anſwer to their Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctments,
but being urged to it by the neceſſity of incurring a greater danger, they
anſwered not Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> being demanded to anſwer, whether he was Guilty, or not Guilty,
did lift up his eyes and hands towards Heaven, and ſaid, Guilty? no, not for ten
Thouſand Worlds.</p>
            <p>All the reſt upon the firſt demand replyed not Guilty.</p>
            <p>On the day following Major Gen. <hi>Harriſon</hi> was brought again to the Bar where
after the impanelling of three Juries before he could be ſatisfyed in them, he was
Indicted for <hi>Imagining and Contriving the Late Kings Death,</hi> which was proved by
his preſence when the ſentence was pronounced, and by his ſigning and ſealing
the Warrant for his Execution, he did break out into many impertinent diſcourſes,
and anſwering nothing material for himſelf, the Jury without ſtirring from the Ear
did find him Guilty, for which he was condemned to ſuffer as a Traytor.</p>
            <p>On the day following, <hi>John Carew,</hi> Mr. <hi>Scot,</hi> Mr. <hi>Scroop,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gregory Clement,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> were all of them brought to the Bar and tryed, and the Charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them being proved by many Witneſſes, they were all found guilty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
in the ſame words to ſuffer death, as was Maj. Gen. <hi>Harriſon</hi> the day before.</p>
            <p>THE next day being <hi>Saturday,</hi> Maj. Gen. <hi>Harriſon</hi> was drawn upon a Hurdle
from Newgate to the Round, or railed Place neer <hi>Charing Croſſe,</hi> where a Gibbet
was ſet, upon which he was Hanged. Many of his acquaintance did ſeem to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
to ſee him die ſo Confidently; whiles numbers of true Chriſtians did grieve
in earneſt to ſee him die ſo impenitently. We have been told, that when he took
his leave of his wife, he comforted her, and told her that he would come again in
three days; but we hear nothing as yet of his Reſurrection. When he was half
hanged, he was cut down and quartered, his bowels burned, and his head ſevered
from his body to be diſpoſed at his Majeſties pleaſure.</p>
            <p>This day Mr. <hi>John Cook</hi> was brought to the Bar, he excepted againſt none of his
Jury as Maj. Gen. <hi>Harriſon</hi> did the day before. His Indictment being read he ſpake
many things very pertinently in his own defence, but being to clear himſelf as to
life, the Jury without ſtirring from the Bar, gave in their Verdict, that he was guilty,
and Sentence paſt upon him as on the former.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> being brought to the Bar, and his Indictment read, had very many
Witneſſes that were ready to give in their Evidences againſt him, and being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to contradict their Truth, the Jury gave in their Verdict, and the ſame Sentence
was pronounced on him as was before on Mr. <hi>Cooke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I made mention before that the Doctrine of the Seminaries of the <hi>Sectaries</hi> is
the very ſame, as to Regicide, as is the Doctrine of the Seminaries of the <hi>Jeſuites.
John Carew</hi> who being condemned on <hi>Saturday,</hi> was on <hi>Monday, Octob.</hi> 15. drawn
upon the Hurdle to Execution ſome hours before his departure out of the Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Newgate, was heard in his prayer (which he ſpake loud enough to ſhow ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his blind zeal, or bold Rebellion) to expreſſe theſe words. <hi>Take the Scepter
out of the hands of earthly Kings, and rout their Armies.</hi> Like <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and
others of the ſame ſtamp; he quoted many places out of the <hi>Revelations</hi> which
were never rightly underſtood by the beſt of that Sect, and is very likely not to be
fit Texts to be expounded by Traytors. It is a ſad thing for a dying man to add
more Coles to that Fire which by the Laws of Nature and Chriſtianity he is bound
to extinguiſh. If I hear the Truth, one thing is obſervable, that this Traytor, who
had ſo red a hand in the taking away the life of the King, did contribute alſo to
the taking away of the life of his own Brother, who ſome years before was Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on Tower-hill, for endeavouring to aſſiſt the Cauſe of the King.</p>
            <p>On the ſame day and much about the ſame Time, Col. <hi>Axtell</hi> was arraigned in
the <hi>Old-Baily;</hi> many and heavy Charges were brought in againſt him, The whole
Tryal (the Witneſſes being many, and all of them tending to ſhow what an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ſpirit he had againſt the King) did take up the ſpace of three hou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es; but the
Jury (obſerving how fully the Charge was proved) without any more delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
gave in their Verdict that he was Guilty.</p>
            <p>After him Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> appeared, who of himſelf confeſſed that he ſigned the
Warrant for the Execution of his Majeſty, but pleaded withall that he was drawn
in by the Artifice of that Arch-Incendiary <hi>Oliver Cromwell.</hi> The Jury without
any more adoe brought in their Verdict againſt him, and the ſame Sentence of
Condemnation paſſed upon him, as on the former.</p>
            <p>Immediatly after him <hi>William Howlet</hi> or <hi>Hewlet,</hi> who was one of the diſguiſed
perſons in a Frock on the Scaffold who gloried that he executed the King, had his
Charge and Indictment read, And the Jury on the Tryall of this man did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themſelves, and after a little Conſultation they found him guilty, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
Sentence was pronounced againſt him.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tuſeday October</hi> 16. Mr <hi>Cooke</hi> was drawed on a Hurdle from Newgate to
Charing Croſſe, to ſuffer the pains of Death for his Execrable Treaſon; he ſhewed
much contrition of ſpirit, and taking notice that <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> was there and to be
Executed next after, he heartily wiſhed that he might be reprieved, being as he
conceived, not prepared to Dye.</p>
            <p>And indeed it is very remarkable, that <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> who heretofore had expreſſ'd
himſelf a violent Enemy againſt the Letany, and for this Reaſon (amongſt ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
that it taught to pray againſt ſudden death, ſhould now at the Hour of his
Death, and after many weeks impriſonment be himſelf ſo unprovided, as to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
by all that knew him, and to have ſuch violent diſtempers that he was fitted
neither for Life nor Death.</p>
            <p>He came to the Ladder unwillingly, and by degrees was drawn up higher, and
higher. Certainly he had many Executioners within him; he leaned upon the
Ladder being unwilling to part from it, but being turned off, the ſpectators gave a
great ſhout, as they did when his Head was cut off, and held up a loft upon the
point of a Spear. The very Souldiers themſelves whom heretofore he did animate to
ſlaughter, and a thorough Execution of their Enemies were now aſhamed of him,
and upon the point of their Spears ſhewed that guilty head which made them guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſo much blood.</p>
            <p>On this day Sir <hi>Hardreſſe Waller, Hen. Marten, Jſaac Pennington, Will. Hevenning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Gilb. Millington, Rob. Tichburn, Owen Roe, Rob. Lilburn, Hen. Smith, Edmund
Harvey, J. Downs, Vincent Potter, Auguſt. Garland, George Fleetwood, Simon Meyn,
James Temple, Peter Temple,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Wayte</hi> were Condemned to be Hanged,
Drawn and Quartered; but the Execution of their ſentence was ſuſpended untill
the King by the advice of his Lords and Commons in Parliament, ſhall order the
Execution accordingly to be paſſed.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wedneſday Octob. 17. Tho. Scot, Greg. Clement, Adrian Scroop,</hi> and <hi>John Iones,</hi>
were drawn on ſeverall hurdles to the aforeſasd place of Chering Croſſe. Mr.
<hi>Scot</hi> did ſeeme to have wept abundantly, for his eyes were Red with penitence;
but comming to the place of Execution, he ſeemed to take new Courage, and for
the ſame cauſe to dye with the ſame confidence as heretofore hath been practiſed
and preſcribed by the Jeſuites of Rome. <hi>Gregory Clement,</hi> ſeemed to expreſſe much
ſorrow and much repentance, acknowledging that his Judges had done nothing
but according to the Law, and that he moſt juſtly ſuffered both by God and Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adrian Scroop,</hi> dyed full of the confeſſion of his enormous fault, and deſired the
prayers of all good people. He prayed to God to forgive his Accuſers.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>John Jones,</hi> all along as he was upon the Sledge deſired the prayers of all
beheld him; being come to the place of execution, he confeſſed that if he were in
his Majeſties condition he ſhould do no leſſe then his Majeſty did. Dying he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his Majeſty, and the happineſſe of his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday Octob.</hi> 19. Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> heretofore of Horſe, and Col. <hi>Axtell</hi> of Foot
were drawn upon the Fatall Hurdle from Newgate to Tyburn, Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> did
ſpeak but little, that which he ſaid was to excuſe himſelf, and to lay open the
errour of his Judgement, he had a paper in his hand (intended as it ſeems to ſpeak
for him, weakly declaring that he was an Officer in the Army, in which too perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
he endeavoured to diſcharge his Truſt.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Axtell</hi> ſaid that he was drawn to this War very unwillingly, Firſt in the
time of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and afterward under the command of the L. <hi>Fairfax,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
both which Authority he was a Commiſſionated Officer, yet notwithſtanding
he did nothing of himſelf, but was adviſed to what he did by a Miniſter, who
told him it was the cauſe of God, and upon which account he endeavoured to doe
his work. Col. <hi>Hacker</hi> was only Hanged, but Col. <hi>Axtell</hi> being cut down was
Quartered.</p>
            <p>Thus we plainly may perceive how the Kings of Chriſtendome are daily crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(as Chriſt their Lord was) between two Thieves the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and the <hi>Sectaries,</hi>
who haue deſigned all thoſe Princes to deſtruction, whom in their own Trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and Irreligious Hearts they have condemned for Tyranny. I hope neither
Peers nor people for the time to come will be ſo fond to believe them, or ſo wicked
to follow them. God in his great mercy grant us all of his ſpirit of Truth, to direct
us in all Loyalty, that being not ſeduced by theſe ſeditious Sectaries we may ſtand
faſt in Obedience, embrace Love, and follow Peace. <hi>Amen</hi>
