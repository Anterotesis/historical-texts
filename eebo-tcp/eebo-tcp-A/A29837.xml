         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE many great Favours and daily

received from you, may well chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
and command a double Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

and as you have ever ſtudied how to
interweave your continual Bounty with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
aſſiſtance of your great Art and Skill, each of
theſe heightning both my Advance and Profit;
ſhould I not publickly repay you the Tribute of
all imaginable thankful Acknowledgment, my
hopes of ever doing well may ſoon ſicken, and
like Liquors poured from one Veſſel to another,
as readily loſe their guſt, and grow ſlat and dull.
And although in theſe publick Addreſſes I may

               </gap>nt to offer my Mite to you,
whoſe Skill in Art is large, and whoſe Knowledge
in Univerſal Learning is great; yet have I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to ſhelter this Tumefying Brat under your
Wing, and commit it to your Patronage, not as
being worthy your Acceptance, but that it may
receive a kind Value and a candid Repute by your

            <p>SInce I have ventured the hazard of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the few Grains of my Knowledge and
Care to be put into the Scale of your Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and to be tried by the Standard of
your Judgment; and although I am ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
conſcious I may want ſomewhat of weight
or meaſure: yet had I rather be cenſured for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
ſuch an error, than be condemned for
omitting ſo neceſſary a duty; Man not being fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to ſerve himſelf alone, he that formed him
made him alſo a Brother to many, and this duty be
oweth to them all; he being made much like the
Princes Coin, the which after having once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his ſtamp proves current through his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
This Tract well deſerves the ſtudy and
practice of a young Chirurgion, who ought to read
it ſoberly, and practiſe it constantly. Whoever
therefore is bred in this Chirurgick School, or
brought up in the Nurſery of Healing, let him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to preſerve knowledge in his lips, as well
as judgment to guide his hand. I have here acted
the part of a faithful Chirurgion, who ſometimes
muſt be admitted and allowed to make the ſmart
the forerunner of his cure, and may be accounted
excuſable, though he ſeemeth to be hard hearted
in not regarding the lamentable mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
groans of his afflicted Patient, not ſparing
his Probe untill he have ſounded the bottom of
the Abſceſs. This is a ſubject indeed, which is not
to be touched by every common Pen, every ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whereof in ſome caſes may diſlocate the Diſcourſe,
and cauſe a Solution of Continuity in the Matter.
The Tract is not like a gay Tulip, clothed and tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with variety of Colours, fair and goodly for
view, but void of ſmell and all apparent vertue:
neither doth it look like a piece of Tapeſtry, which
appears beſt at fartheſt; its Leaves are not lined,
covered, or filled with the thin Bloſſoms of Aiery
Froth, or fetch'd from the Humours of an Emperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Romance, but rather gathered, furniſhed, and
delineated, with the digeſted wholeſom Fruits of
Learning, Example, and Hiſtory, moſt lively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling
the delicate and ſweet Roſe, the which
beſides its vertues of Perfuming the Air, proveth
no leſs Medicinal than Fragrant. And now to
you great Maſters of Art, Brave Souls, whoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
are above your Names, whoſe Vertues are no
Shadows, and whoſe Noble Spirits can ſoar far
above the common reach of Mankind, who can as
well pity the Wantonneſs of one part of the world,
who with a varniſh and guilded Frame can
plume their Impudence with the various coloured
Feathers of Ignorance and Boldneſs; as reward
the other part with the juſt dues and perquiſites
belonging to them; whoſe Hands are too white
and clean to receive or give any black Dirt. It's
you I may and intend to make my Judges, who can
ſooner pardon a thouſand Errors than others find
one. I queſtion not but the Brightneſs of my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
may have dazled my eyes, and my Expreſſions
may fall low and flat, yet ſince the Lading is well
beſtowed in our Veſsel, having received your gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb facs="tcp:43322:5"/>
Winds to breathe on it, I queſtion not its well
ſailing, and may be kept off from the Shelves and
Rocks of others, who make it their buſineſs to paſs
an unhappy Cenſure, although not capable to paſs
Examination themſelves. By ſome it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that this my Care and Pains may look like
Flowers pluck'd from others Gardens. The Bees
admirable Work is not to be diſcommended or
thought the worſe of, nor the Honey the meaner,
for its ſucking or extracting the ſame from the
ſweet Flowers of any mans Ground. I here have
been more plentiful in Authorities, becauſe very
few of our younger Brethren have a will to read
many or great Volumes, whileſt greater Masters
have leſs time or leiſure. To you alſo who are of the
lower Form in Practice, this Tract doth chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
it being as a guide to direct you in your whole
courſe of treating Tumours both general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
from head to foot; my requeſt to you is, if
you find any thing worthy Collection or your Inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
accept it with an amicable Hand; and if
you give it the time of a Survey, play not the part
of a Waterman, who <hi>Dum aliud proponit, aliud
ſupponit.</hi> Let every man ſtudy his Art quietly and
peaceably, that he may profeſs it openly and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
then may be expect it to have it guarded
with the Lion and Crown, and encouraged by
Royal Charters and Princely Privileges. I hope
this Tract will meet with a Gentlemans Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whoſe Soul is drawn out to his Fingers ends,
who can pardon an imperfect Draught, and
where he meets with too deep Shadows, can with
<pb facs="tcp:43322:6"/>
a light Hand and finer Pencil leſſen its dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
It may be well reckoned amongst Vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
in our days, wherein the Miſts of Ignorance
are very plentiful, the Evening of Knowledge
appearing but through a ſmall hole, and the dark
Clouds of Folly obſtructing our Light of Reaſon;
and hence is it that the Light which we enjoy is
ſo variouſly refracted by the glittering Vices of
our times, and looks much disfigured by the Glaſſes
of Humour and Fancy. If this may anſwer expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I am happy; if it be diſliked by ſuch who ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do meaſure another mans actions by number,
than by either order or weight, I am not troubled,
knowing it to be a common failing of ſome to be
tempeſtuous in Temper, and troubleſom either in
Judgment or Deſire, as to hate any thing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
themſelves perform, or yield or lend a good
look to another mans Labours, becauſe they were
not chriſtned by their Name, be they never ſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
good, advantageous, or honourable: To theſe
and ſuch others I offer this as a Concluſion; let us
all study to be quiet and peaceable, and to do our
own buſineſs for publick and private good, to
work with our own hands ſuch things as may gain
afair repute and good name here, and a happy
reward from Heaven hereafter; then ſhall our
preſent actions ſmell like the Roſe, and Eternal
Bliſs ſhall crown our end. And as I have in this
Tract ſtudied to be profitable to thee, ſo let thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
be to help others.</p>

TO CHIRURGERY.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONGST all the liberall
Arts which the wiſe Creator
hath made and beſtowed on
mankind, there is none extant
that carry more excellency
and dignity than this of healing: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
either its Origin or Antiquity,
its ſplendor of Invention, its honour and
excellency, nobility and vertue, its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and learning, benefit and neceſſity,
conſtancy and firmneſs, with its liberality
and charity. As touching its Origin and
Antiquity:<note place="margin">Its Origin and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</note> It came into the world almoſt
in the ſame day with man, for ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Birth was this ſought out as both
reaſon and hiſtory makes good, it being
generally our lots either ſooner or later
to make uſe hereof: for as ſoon as we
leave our mothers womb we grow ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to receive the vapors of a putrid air
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43322:10"/>
and winds, and do thereby exprome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
and ſickneſſes, as well as upon a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
growth we ſhare in others ariſing
from meats and drinks. Can we either
live well or act any thing to purpoſe
without health? Are there not many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this mundane ſeene with ſickneſs, and
make as ſpeedy exit without this help of
medicine? Are not our actions taken
from the Soul, produced from its effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
cauſe, and perfected by the body
as its Inſtrument? And ſince it is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to think that we can neither live nor
move or yet arrive at a well being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this Jem of Healing, ought we not
alſo to conjecture, that it was neceſſary
from the firſt? Man was not made like
an <hi>I per ſe I,</hi> to ſtand by himſelf, and
hear the warbling notes and pleaſant mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
of the pretty Bird, or ſee how the
ground out of a grain of corn yields
its increaſe. No, this reaſonable ſoul bred
out of a higher ſpark was here planted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to labour: <hi>Non otiandum in via, ſed
laborandum in vinea.</hi> And here alſo may
we opinionize healing and medicine
were invented before other Arts, they
being both of greater neceſſity and uſe:
and this reaſon teacheth. And if this may
not pleaſe, Holy writ and ſacred Hiſtory
will ſhew us a great deal of its Antiquity
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43322:10"/>
and Origination.<note place="margin">Its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhown in a great part by Holy writ.</note> Amongſt the people of

ſee out of <hi>Moſes, Solomon</hi> and ſo forth.

Phyſitians. <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. Theſe Holy autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
may be enough to ſhow its Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
the thing ſhoweth it ſelf evidently
that people before this time were not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
troubled with inward diſeaſes, but alſo
perplexed with outward troubles. <hi>Moſes</hi>
drew the Iſraelites out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43322:11"/>
3000 years ago; &amp; if any will enquire,
he may find there were Chirurgions; and
not theſe only, but Phyſitians alſo, before
which time they were in great eſteem
and admiration; and this was for certain
that there was little or no diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Phyſick and Chirurgery. About
500 years (as <hi>Avenzoar</hi> obſerves) before
his time amongſt the Arabians were they
joined together. I ſpeak of the time
where this art of healing flouriſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Greeks;<note place="margin">As to its honour and Excellency.</note> for the Aegyptians
had it much earlier, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> writes.
The wiſe man in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ſaies, God
made both Phyſitians and medicine; and
wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> makes mention of Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
healing inward diſeaſes, and of the
earth being furniſhed with plants and
herbs for curing outward ſores and hurts.
Did not our wiſe Creator frame both the
Phyſitians and plants for the good and
benefit of mankind? Did not our Bleſſed
Saviour make the blind ſee, the lame
walk, and the deaf hear? It is noted that
an Angel of the Lord taught <hi>Tobias</hi> to
cure his father's eies with the gall of a
fiſh. Have not Kings, Princes and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
ſtudied, exerciſed and imbraced this
Art, ſome for pleaſure, others for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or contemplation, whilſt ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
make a more deep inquiry into it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43322:11"/>
for neceſſity of life? Amongſt the Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans
<hi>Cham</hi> had a wife whoſe name was
<hi>Rhea,</hi> out of whom was bred <hi>Oſiris,</hi> who
for his knowledg in this Art was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a God, and adored and worſhipped
as a Deity. <hi>Jachenus</hi> amongſt the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
for inventing a way to purify
the Air was renowned as a mighty one,
and by them had a Temple erected, in
which he was interred. <hi>Mercurius Triſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megiſtus</hi>
a little after <hi>Moſes</hi> in the time
of <hi>Joſhua</hi> appeared in Phyſick with great
glory. <hi>Homer</hi> writes that <hi>Podalyrius</hi>
and <hi>Machaon</hi> ſons of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> went
into the Trojane war and exerciſed this
faculty; hence may we learn of what
great eſteem value and reverence this
Art was in former times: But to look
nearer home, have we not very oft times
ſeen it kept, preſerved, protected, and
propagated in the Royal palaces and
and Princely families of Kings and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates?
<hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, that <hi>Alexander</hi>
the great was not only a Scholar to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi>
but was alſo a very great admirer
of this Art. King <hi>Mithridates</hi> hath given
to the world to his perpetual ſame a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnal
token of his diligence and ſtudy in
this Art by his Antidote Chriſtned by
his own name. May we not read of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Reverend perſons who buſied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43322:12"/>
in ſtudying the knowledg of herbs
thus <hi>Chirou</hi> the Centaur accounted moſt
excellent in his time for curing of wounds
gave <hi>Century</hi> its name; and hence came
our Art to take its derivation, held by
ſome. <hi>Gentian</hi> came from <hi>Gentianus</hi>
King of the Illyricks. <hi>Avicen</hi> not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to any maſter of Art, came out of
the Lineage of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings. <hi>Arthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſia</hi>
had its name from the Queen <hi>Arthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſia.</hi>
May we not well with admiration
ſee the Almightie provedence working
ſtrange effects by the hands of our Sacred
King of bleſſed memory, and the French
King in curing <hi>Scrophulaes?</hi> Have we not
ſeen Rebellious tumours, which ſcorned
and trampled on medicine, forced to yeild
to his touch? Running ſores all in their
leakages, the weak made ſtrong, and
thoſe members brought into good order
which had formerly bin riſled and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorted,
by the Sons of the moſt high, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
as badges and true tokens of their
being the only true heirs of the Imperial
Crown? And as theſe are the great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of our health, ought we not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
and to defend them, and pray
that they may laſt with us in England
ſo long as the Sun and Moon ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue?
<hi>Fernelins</hi> telleth us there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be better ſhown or drawn to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43322:12"/>
the life in Phyſick than by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;<note place="margin">Its learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and vertue.</note>
for hereby may we, nay can we not
be ſo readily deceived, the foundations
hereof for the moſt part conſiſting of
Judgment and Experience: for as read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
makes a full man, conference a ready
man, and writing an exact man; ſo alſo
doth Experience give us the livelieſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a knowing man. In all theſe
ſome ages have been more happy than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Amongſt the Aegyptians this Art
of healing was very carefully treaſured
up, theſe like generous ſouls born for
publick good by great care and ſtudy
have left to the world examples of their
love and ſtudies: and as the firſt amongſt
theſe was <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> who have writ to
poſterity: yea before ever writing or
printing was, this Art was ſo much in
eſteem, that by the induſtry of man were
their remedies marked out with <hi>Hyere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick</hi>
ſigns; out from theſe came thoſe
rare volumns of <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> and he that
hareth this way to find advance in his
skill and judgement, may be well ſaid to
walk in the darkneſs of ignorance, and
fed with the Chymaerical fallacies of foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries
and flatteries. <hi>Galen's</hi> books have
been of great profit to mankind; may we
not count our ſelves much obliged to him
for his two books <hi>De Articulis &amp; Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturis?</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:43322:13"/>
Since theſe have <hi>Heraclides,
Diocles, Cariſtius, Praxagoras, Chryſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,
Eraſiſtratus</hi> and <hi>Hierophilus,</hi> been
eſteemed great Maſters of Art; after theſe
are <hi>Aſclepiades, Albucaſis, Paulus, Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginetta,
Eraſtus, Johannes Fernelius, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel
Fallopius,</hi> as ſo many riſing Suns
in their Art, by whoſe reſplendency have
many obſcured things been brought to
light. Are not in our times theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

own with <hi>Job,</hi> man hath not a part free

firmneſs it is to be preferred before any
other Art under the Sun:<note place="margin">Its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and firmneſs.</note> for as it came
ſoon after him into the world, ſo it never
leaves him to his dying minuit; nay it
continues longer for he being dead, it
ſerves to help his ſucceeding generation.
The truth of this daily experience makes
good: for although our life be but <hi>vita
brevis,</hi> yet our art is <hi>Ars Longa;</hi> and
although it may be ſubject to change, yet
this is to be better born with, being
like man with whom it is concerned: but
this is more conſtant, life is no life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
health; and is not this our daily friend
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43322:19"/>
afforded us by our wiſe Creator for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
and perfecting the ſame? It is
by this Art of healing we have our daies
lengthned, by cutting off diſtempers, era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating
their cauſes, and extripating
their effects; and indeed what is health
elſe, than the keeping of the whole body
perfect and intire? And this may then
moſt properly be ſaid ſo to be, when all
its actions are freed from the chains of
impediments and pains; for this great
happineſs of health is onely that affection
of the body, which from the firſt do make
every of its actions anſwer its nature.
This made <hi>Democritus</hi> write, that he
would have every man ſtudy the Art of
healing; becauſe as it is honeſt, ſo alſo it
is profitable and uſeful for life:<note place="margin">Its fruit neceſſity and profit.</note> Which
brings me to the next branch of it, which
ſhoweth its fruit neceſſity and profit.
This is a feild very large, conſidering ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
its order, condition, age or ſex, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no fruit; it is this alone that produceth
health, by divine permiſſion, a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

pains, extinguiſh their fervour; that can
reſtore the ſemiputrid to health, recreate
the afflicted, refreſh the troubled,
ſtrengthen the languiſhing, and bring the
half dead to a whole life. But ſhould theſe
fail, yet we have this to defend us before
the great Doctor of our Souls; if to the
utmoſt of our endeavous and judgments,
and theſe ſtrengthened by care and ſtudy,

our beſt knowledg can guide us to, we
have diſcharged our parts, and let us leave
the ſucceſs to that God, who can work

conclude with this maxim, That this Art
is by ſo much the more excellent and to

in Kings and Potentates it may receive
Princely rewards, and amongſt Lords
and Knights fair gratuities; yet alſo muſt
it be furniſhed with the graces of Charity
and Humility, thinking no ſcorn to help
the meaneſt; this being its rule, <hi>Quod

a maxim in natural Morality as well

command your diligence and care
in the managing the ſame for the poor,

me to the Chirurgion himſelf, which is to
be the man onely engaged both in their
applications and adminiſtrations; and let
us ſee what perſon he ought to be, how
qualified, armed, furniſhed, and exerciſed.
To conſider in what chair of honour and
eſteem a Chirurgion is ſeated, may well
require his care and ſtudy, learning and
excellency: and ſince there is ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of the mind with the body, ſuch
a connexion and ſociety, that they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
take ſhares of one anothers good and
bad fortune, as ſome deliriated with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
whilſt others are blown up with
madneſs by the fury of choller; To ſee the
wonderful effects of blood, while melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
acts her innumerable changes in
our bodies, may well call into admiration
the beſt of mens knowledg, our thoughts
varying according to the diverſity of
tempers in our bodies. Thus are we trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with diſeaſes, inflamed by anger,
ſweetned by love, exhilarated by joy,
dejected by ſorrow, tempered by ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſhaken by fear; and to ſearch out
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43322:24"/>
the depth of theſe, their originations and
cauſes, their diverſity of ſhapes and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures,
may well require a quick ſight to
penetrate, a powerful wit to ſearch out,
a well guided reaſon to conſider of. He
therefore that will enter this ſtage of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery,
muſt well underſtand its various
ſcenes and acts; for its he alone guided by
the provident hand and divine aſſiſtance
that can maintain and keep up our ſorts
and caſtles from the aſſailing batterings of
wounds and contuſions, &amp;c. and by him
alſo may herbs and roots, ſeeds and ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
gums and fruits, be made capable
inſtruments to baniſh the enemy having
once made its entrance. It's by his Art the
ſwelling bubbles of ſcalding water are
diſperſt, the burnings of gun-powder al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid,
its pain removed, and its black
marks fetched out. Its by his Art diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
Articulations and fractured bones
are brought into their right form and
order, old ulcers and fiſtuales dilated,
mundified, incarned and cicatrized, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niaes
and Stones bound up and drawn
forth: and ſince theſe and many more are
committed to his care and charge, what
skill, knowledg, fathoming of diſeaſes,
and judgment, ought he to have and be
furniſhed with to undertake this task?
Take with me this as a ſhort character of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43322:24"/>
a good Chirurgeon,<note place="margin">What perſon a Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to be.</note> he being a man both

ſo is it as rare, to gain awiſe medicine from

nerves, the trunks and channels of the
veins and arteries; here may he find the
difference between a nerve and a vein, a
Tendon and a Muſcle, a vein and an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,

are very oft applied with little ſucceſs,

hath purchaſed all theſe, thus furniſhed,

               <p>SInce daily experience ſhoweth, that
out of Humors Tumours do take their
Originals, our preſent task ſhall be to

they are, how made, and how many

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43322:26"/>
in one Scheme, their general Diviſion,
and then arrive at Tumours themſelves.
To underſtand the nature and eſſence of
a Humour, is and ought to be the work,
ſtudy, and care of a Chirurgion, as well
as a Phyſician; there being no diſeaſe
with matter, which is not framed of a
confuſed maſs of Humours. It his hence
that all Tumours, Wounds, Ulcers, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulaes,
and their differencies have their
acknowledgments and diſtinctions; the
which is the only cauſe which makes
both Phyſicians and Chirurgions run pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to the tempering of the Blood, that
is, to the correction of thoſe Humours
which are the occaſion of theſe Tumours.
By Phyſicians a Humour is taken for a
thin and liquid body,<note place="margin">What a hu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mour is.</note> flowing and cruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in our body. <hi>Tagaultius</hi> doth call
them more properly Humours, which are
juices made by the Liver in the ſanguina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
maſs, for its nutrition and thinning of
the blood all over our body. All theſe are
Choller Flegm and Melancholy, adjoined
to the Blood, ſcattered and ſent into our
veins and arteries, the which the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their colours and conſiſtence will
make good, as <hi>Galen</hi> hath it <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>b. Natur.
Human.</hi> Of theſe ſome are natural, ſome
not natural. Thoſe called natural, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſo ordered according to nature, for
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43322:27"/>
keeping, defending, ſuſtaining, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
the life of man: Thoſe counted
otherwiſe, which act contrary to the
rules of nature, and have unnatural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
The one again being either alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
proper for life and growth of the
body; the other excrementitious more
proper for cleanſing its ſinks and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels.
As the Humour is, ſo alſo is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſeen its Colour: for as Blood is of a
pure florid roſy colour, ſo doth it give
colour to the Muſcles: It is this that
graceth the cheeks, by affording them a
a ſhare of its redneſs: and as it is made
of Chyle and Blood, ſo alſo doth it ſend
forth its white and red; and by how
much the red exceedeth the white, by ſo
much are the Muſcles more red than the
Skin. Choller is citrine and yellow, thin
and griping; and as the four Humours do
work man into a good humour, ſo this
burneth him into a paſſion: it gives a
lively paint of its colour in the Jaundies.
Flegm is white and waſhy, and ſo are
they that have too much of it, being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cold and ſubject to Oedematous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
Dropſies and Agues. Melancholy is
black and masketh the whole body with
an Aſhy colour; this is long and tedious
in executing its office, it being the moſt
heavy an dſad part of the blood; but at
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:43322:27"/>
length bringeth forth the terrifying Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phula,
Corroding Cancer, Scirrhous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
Quartane Agues and the like: and
we daily find, when it hath hatched them
up to any growth, it is very long, if
ever, before it be made to part with
them. Beſides theſe there are two others:
one a ſerous Humour which ſerveth as a
vehicle to the blood, ordered by nature
for thinning it, that it may paſs to its
ſmalleſt capillary veſſels. Part of this is
ſucked up by the kidneys, where having
made a ſhort ſtay it maketh its further
progreſs into the bladder, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
whilſt it be loaded; the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therewith filled, is let out as uſeleſs
and unprofitable. Beſides theſe comes
Wind taking its circuits and turns, and
in our bodies is occaſioned and bred by ill
digeſtions, crudities, and wind: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
making watery Tumours, whilſt this
maketh ſlatuous Tumours. But that we
may well underſtand the foundation of
theſe Humours, let us examine from
whence they are bred, and whence they
come.<note place="margin">What blood is.</note>

Providence as a bag for reſerve, for the

and made pure blood, ſweet of taſte, and
florid in colour, mild and benign. This
ſanguification is a ſimilar action and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by aſſimulation; and therefore
taketh this chyle aforeſaid as its ſubject
matter for this aſſimulation, and as they
dewell together, ſo do they aſſimulate
together; and this is done by proceſs of
time, never paſſing to the liver, as the
Ancients dreamed, for the chyle ſeldom
or never reacheth it. This blood, as the
vital liquor, is ſent through the whole
body by its veins and arteries, as its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
trunks and channels. And although
at its firſt appearance it ſheweth it ſelf
pure and free, yet hath it alwaies theſe
three Humours adjoined to it, as three

another not only in taſte ſapour or colour,
but alſo in their effects: for as <hi>Galen</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth
<hi>lib. de natur. homin.</hi> the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
humour is acid, choller bitter,
blood ſweet, and flegm having little or

Phlegmon,</hi>

                  <hi>Oedema.</hi> It is hot and moiſt,
which are the two ſpecies of its natural

de Atra bile cap.</hi> 2. it is of a very red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
in its humour, and is made of the
beſt of juices, and ſo bred from the beſt
of tempers, made by a temperate heat;
and thoſe are its natural tempers. As
of its unnatural, its proper ſubſtance is
changed, as its thinner part converted
into Choller, as <hi>Gal. 2. de Differ.</hi> where
he ſaith, the thinner part is converted
into yellow choller, whilſt the thicker
turneth into melancholy.<note place="margin">Choller hot and dry.</note> Next to this
is choller, called by the greeks <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, it
being a humour hot, bred out of the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and hotter part of the chyle and
blood. It hath but few ſpirits, ſomewhat
of Sulphure in it, moſt of Salt and Earth.
Its parvity of ſpirits are evident, in that it
is of its own nature bitter; neither hath it
in it any great quantity of Sulphure, for if
we view its maſſe carefully, it being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Oleaginous or pingued, neither doth
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:43322:29"/>
it ſoon take fire; yet it taketh Sulphure
in it, being principally exalted by adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
whence it bred this bitterneſs; and
although its ſalt excelleth in quantity,
yet doth it not gain preheminence. Its
flegmatick watery ſubſtance doth enlarge
its liquid faculty; its earthly parts thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth
it, and gives it the body it bears; its
heats and drineſs are ſufficient ſigns of
its being an enemy to the radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
and ſo unfit for nutriment, that it
is declared by all to be excrementitious.
This heat is the manifeſt cauſe of its bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
made by a perpetual digeſtion of
the blood;<note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween milk and choller.</note> thus milk, unleſs oft times

do colours change from white into
red; as Quinces being pale by boiling
gain a red colour, and chyle turned into
blood by circulation and heat; ſo alſo
choller is as readily diſcharged of its firſt
taſte by aduſtion and perpetual digeſtion.
As to its uſes,<note place="margin">Its uſes.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> will grant it no
waies uſeful. <hi>Coryngius</hi> and ſome others
do as much cry up its value, offering that
it ſerveth to warm the liver, and to help
digeſtion. <hi>Helmontius</hi> calls it the balſom
of the blood deduced from the liver to the
meſentery; but this is contrary to Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy:
for Anatomy teacheth, that this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43322:29"/>
humour is carried out from the liver, not
brought into it, but onely ſucked up by
the Parenchyma thereof, as through a
ſtrayner. Others there are alſo, as <hi>Zer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>
amongſt the reſt, that offer, that if
the bladder or gall be removed from the
liver, the ſubſtance of the liver would
ſoon be diſſolved and melted. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this, its moſt proper uſe is to render
the excrements fluxile.<note place="margin">What flegm is.</note> The third is
Flegm, by the Greeks called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: and
this alſo is of two ſorts, natural, and not
natural: The natural humour is cold,
moiſt, crude in ſubſtance, white in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and ſometimes ſweet in taſte: that
alſo properly ſaid to be unnatural, which
is void of theſe, and hence doth it take
its ſeveral names; as that generally caled
a thin ſerious Flegm, which is endewed
with a wateriſh or windy ſubſtance; that
called thick and glaſſy, which is thick, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcous,
and mucilaginous, and growing
harder gets the name of glaſſy flegm;
if it putrify and corrode, it is called ſalt,

<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the 6. <hi>Top.</hi> ſaith flegm is the

and <hi>Gal. 2. de different. feb. cap.</hi> 6.
whatever humour in our body is cold and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:43322:30"/>
moiſt, this we call flegm; <hi>Avicen Prima
Primi</hi> numbreth up 8 kinds of unnatural
flegm. We may well conſider it in reſpect
of its ſapour, and of its ſubſtance: of its ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
and here are three differencies, ſalt,
ſweet, and ſowr; and its inſipidneſs may
come in as well; but in reſpect of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
there may be four coupled to the
former; and theſe will make up <hi>Avicens</hi>
8. Every nutrition is as an aſſimulation,
which nouriſheth that by which it is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed:
and as melancholy nouriſheth
the melancholly parts; ſo do flegm the
articulations: and as this is a cold and
flegmatick humour, yet in proceſs of
time it is digeſted and made blood held
by ſome; yet this generation is not to
be allowed reciprocally, for cold cannot
be made by heat, the humours by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being rightly diſpoſed; therefore
neither can flegm be made of blood; and
ſo will its generation prove it ſelf no
waies reciprocal.<note place="margin">What me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</note> We come now to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy:

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is ſaid to be either
natural, or not natural. That natural
which is the faeces or ſediment of the
blood, or the thicker part thereof, whoſe
colour is black, its taſte ſowr and ſharp,
generated for nouriſhing the melancholy
parts. The not natural which wholly
doth degenerate from its own nature; it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43322:30"/>
is a cold and dry humour ariſing out of
the thicker part of the chyle, whoſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are four.<note place="margin">4 Species of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</note> Firſt, that is properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

ſubſtance the blood is burnt and made
putrid; and hereby is made <hi>Bilis nigra,</hi>
which is acid, and being poured on the
ground like vinegar riſeth and bubbles
up. The ſecond is black choller, made
out of the aduſtion of the other humours.
The third ſpecies is unnatural, ariſing
with a lapidous concretion. The fourth
is when other humours are mixt with
this; for then it puts it into its own bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
frame, and makes it a part of eroſion.
<hi>Gal. 2. de Temperament. cap.</hi> 3. ſaith
the blood is the beſt of all juices, and that
this is as its ſediment. And 3 <hi>de Prognoſt.</hi>
here he telleth us it hath a double gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
one ariſing from thick blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the lees of wines ſetling in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom;
the other from yellow choller be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much burnt, which paſſeth through
and burns its parts. The natural is the
faeces of good blood, and a ſuperfluity,
being compared with the blood. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
is not as an Hypoſtaſis and faeces,
but more like a coal or cinder. <hi>Helmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
calleth the place, which is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43322:31"/>
underſtanding, venery, ſleep, of various
diſeaſes; but theſe are <hi>merae nugae;</hi> but
according to our later Anatomiſts it is
held to ſerve for other uſes, that it may
prepare an acid juice for the fermentation
of the whole maſſe of blood and chyle;
and this acid part of the blood it draweth
from the heart, and ſends it prepared to
the meſentery, that thereby the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part elaborated from the liver may
be more pure and perfect, as <hi>Wallaeus</hi>
obſerveth; and therefore as the bladder
of gall is appointed by nature to be as
a proper receptacle of choller ſtrained in
thither by the Parenchyma of the liver;
ſo is this ſettled and perfected in the
ſpleen, by which the ſpleen it ſelf is made
of a blackiſh blewiſh colour, and is acid.
This acid humour mixeth it ſelf with the
blood, both with the veſſels and chyle in
the ſtomack, and ſo rendreth them more
thin; for may we not oft find, the ſpleen
being obſtructed, that thick humours do
courſe about our bodies? not becauſe
theſe thick humours are drawn from the
ſpleen, but becauſe it cannot communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate

A fifth when vapours wind and the like
either naturally or preternaturally do
frame a Tumour. And the ſixth is that
which maketh the body unnatural to it
ſelf, as Sanies, Excrements, and the like.
But to bring this diſcourſe of <hi>Falloppius</hi>
to one head, you may find ſix Humours
generally in our bodies, of which are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
theſe ſix Tumours, as out of
Blood, Choller, Flegm, Melancholy,
Wind, and Water, <hi>Phlegmon, Eryſipelas,

Beſides theſe we have Inſects
and other Animals, that very oft times
are the occaſions of Tumours: as <hi>Fallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>
once obſerved in a Maid, who having
a large Tumour about the Inguen, the
Chirurgion in his preſence opening the
ſame ſaw it filled with Worms. Amongſt
the primary cauſes may well be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Air, for out of its Contagion ariſeth
many Tumours. Secondly, Contaction, as
a cold Stone may occaſion a Tumour:<note place="margin">A Hiſtory.</note>
and for this <hi>Falloppius</hi> brings in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtory of a Woman, who ſitting upon
a cold ſtone was afflicted with a cold Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.
And a third may be ſolution of
continuity, and this proveth either oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
or manifeſt; thus after fractures we
oft times find large Apoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and what was the occaſion of Luxation
is very oft alſo the occaſion of Tumours;
as too much contracting or binding of a
part may occaſion a Tumour, as <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene,</hi>

the motion of the diſeaſe; for it is as

theſe are we to conſider of the
times of diſeaſes; for ſome are ſhort, ſome
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43322:41"/>
long, ſome quick, others ſlow; and
therefore are we well to underſtand their
diverſity of times. Hence alſo are we
to conſider the largneſs or ſmalneſs of a
Tumour; and its ſpecies, without the
knowledg of which we cannot be ſaid to
underſtand the curative method; its cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which are conjunct with the diſeaſe;
the circumjacent parts, and the ſymptoms
which do follow, either from the nature
or cauſe thereof; and laſtly the ſigns.
And when we have thus far arrived, we
are to conſider the four great Tumours in
general; as <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> it being as our

the Son of nature generated for the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

               <p>HE that will undertake the curing of
Tumours, ought well to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
his curative ſcopes and intentions;
and the well timing of Tumours is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great matter here. And here may we
expect a Tumour either already made,
or in its making: And hence ariſeth a
double intention; the one prohibiting
Fluxion, whilſt the other cure is wrought
by diſcharging the matter already flown;
becauſe removing of cauſes do hinder
Fluxion. If this happen from Plethory,
breathing of a vein is very proper; whilſt
in a cachochymick body purging is as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
When a Tumour doth proceed from
Fluxion,<note place="margin">From whence cometh our firſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> we are to begin our cure from
the matter flowing, and hence cometh
our firſt intention; and this is performed

ſave onely in theſe ſeven caſes
ſet down as our ſeven cautions by <hi>Galen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Galens 7 Cautions.</note>
Firſt when the matter doth flow to the
Emunctories or glandulous parts: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
when a venenate matter flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
for this ſends it more inwards and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:43322:42"/>

Nature in her own way: Fourthly,
when Fluxion is excited in a Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
body: Fifthly, when the part, to
which this matter maketh its Flux, is
weak, and its heat but mean: Sixthly,
when there is vehement pain, for here
is more need of anodynes; and then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly,
when this Fluxion is near ſome
principal part. And as touching theſe
curative ſcopes, we are firſt to probihit
its Origination, and by this means to

Tumour, if we well underſtand its cauſe;
and this being ablated, the Tumour is
ſoon ſeen to vaniſh. Fluxion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
are the two cheif cauſes of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;
the firſt offending either in Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
or Quality, and ſo with violence doth
ſeize ſuddainly upon any member, either
by reaſon of its looſneſs or weakneſs;

               <p>IN this Diſcourſe we have many things
do offer themſelves to our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
As when there is a fulneſs, Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is in uſe; and here is to be let out
as much as is neceſſary: If there be a
Plethory <hi>Quoad vires,</hi> here it is to be
repeated. And as touching the part which
is to have the lancet exerciſed on it,
whether from above or below, this alſo
is to be minded and regarded; becauſe
Derivation, which Evacuation from the
adjacent part doth not, agrees in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the cure; becauſe this would
make the Fluxion larger, and the Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the part affected greater. And
if we will make Revulſion aright,<note place="margin">Note.</note> we
ought well to underſtand the place of
Fluxion, that we may happily revell in
the oppoſite part: Thus if the right kidney
be hurt, we open a vein in the left arm;
in Tumours of the groin <hi>vena Popli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi>
And if any may queſtion our mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between the upper and lower parts,
<hi>Galen</hi> himſelf giveth them this anſwer:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:43322:43"/>
All the parts above the navel, including
the Liver and Stomack, are called the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
parts; and thus have we one part
of the <hi>vena Cava</hi> called the aſcendent
Trunk: the other below theſe are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called the lower parts. This knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
difference between Repulſion, Revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and Derivation is not very eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied;
I ſhall thus endeavour to looſen it.
Fluxion ariſing from Expulſion ſhoweth
expulſion: if it followeth from the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of matter, this is either to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
or evacuated; and hence ariſeth
this twofold intention, Revultion and
Evacuation. This being out, another thing
is to be obſerved, the matter that ſlows
hath three places, one from whence it
floweth; the ſecond whither, and this is
to the part affected; and thirdly through
what parts, before it arrives hither. Theſe
being found out, we are to conſider how
to diſcharge this matter, and thereby
prevent its further ſpreading; ſecondly
we are to prevent the Fluent matter,
which hath got paſſage into the channels,
that it flow not to the part affected,
and ſo run this alſo into a Tumour. And
the well conſideration of theſe may well
make us uſe ſtudy, where, and when
to make this Revulſion; and where to
make evacuation. And in both of theſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:43322:44"/>
we are to obſerve <hi>Hippocrates</hi> Rule,<note place="margin">Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes his Rule.</note>
that all be done <hi>ſecundum rectitudinem:</hi>
and this is to be performed two waies,
as by comparing the left with the left,
and the right with the right; for with
theſe there is held a proper conſent. Thus
the Liver vein hath a rectitude with
thoſe veins which aſcend up to the head.
Thus upon an immoderate Flux at the
right noſtril by applying a cupping glaſs
to the Region of the Liver, the Flux doth
ſuddenly ſtop; if the left, by applying
one to the ſpleen doth work and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the ſame effects. <hi>Galen</hi> hath alſo
two ſpecies of Revulſion, the one from
the upper parts to the lower, from the
right to the left; the ſecond not ſo exact,
which we uſe when the matter is much,
and threatens danger. <hi>Galen</hi> alſo in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
of the upper parts doth revel by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
the upper veins, as in Tumours
of the head he doth order the Cephalick
vein to be opened: and <hi>Falloppius</hi> ſaith
in a Squinancy he hath breathed the left
arm, and the Humour preſently vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and in ſome caſes this is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
In Tumours of the Axillaries being
venenate, if we ſhould open the lower
veins we muſt conſequently draw its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
inwards to the heart; and <hi>vice
verſa,</hi> if we ſhould open the upper veins
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43322:44"/>
in a peſtilential Bubo, we may well make
a free paſſage for the peſtiferous matter
to make its addreſs to the heart, which
is not onely a great fault in the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion,
but alſo as unhappy to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.
And thus have I ſhown ſome of
its benefits. I now come to teach the
young Chirurgion how he is to uſe his
Lancet,<note place="margin">How the young Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion ſhould open a vein.</note> and prepare himſelf for this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

the Artery being too cloſe girt that
it cannot diſcharge it ſelf into the vein.
And as to his Lancet, let him make his
apertion a little ſloping; or upon placing
it a little obliquely, let him get his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet
into the vein, and ſo lift it up, not
penetrating too deep, leſt he commit thoſe
errours which daily are acted by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Pretenders and Quackes, who oft go
ſo deep, as that they prick an Artery,
and ſo cauſe Aneuriſms and pains. Let
the Orifice that you make, be neither too
great or too ſmall; the firſt endangering
the Diviſion of the vein, whilſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
runs it into a Tumour. Here alſo is
he to judg of the goodneſs or badneſs of
the Blood, and ſo according to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43322:45"/>
may take away more or leſs; and
alſo conſidering the neceſſity of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
the ſtrength of the Patient, and
the quantity and quality of the Blood.
The veins which are generally opened
are theſe the Frontal vein, one under
the Tongue, the Cephalick, <hi>Mediana</hi>
and Baſilick; but of every of thoſe in their
order, and as neceſſity requireth. The
Frontel vein is moſt properly opened in
infirmities of the Face, and in pains of
the Head. Two veins of the Temples o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in continual Head-ach, in diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Head and Eies. The veins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Tongue in Anginaes, Apoplexies,
pains of the Teeth, the Jugulars, good
in preventing ſuffocation, Squinſies, Aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes,
Dyſpnaea and the like. The three
in the Arm, the firſt being the outward
or Cephalick, this may ſafely be opened
in diſtempers of the head, as <hi>Mania</hi> and
other hot paſſions; The ſecond <hi>Mediana,</hi>
ſo called in reſpect of its Scituation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made both of the Cephalick and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilick
vein, in opening of this vein is
made a general evacuation of Humours;
this oft times opened in pains of the
breaſt, and Pleuriſies. The third is <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi>
or <hi>Hepatica,</hi> by ſome called <hi>Axilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
this diſchargeth thoſe parts which are
beneath the Neck, as the Breſts, Sides,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43322:45"/>
Liver, Spleen, and Pleuriſies. And this
note of the three in all ſickneſſes, and
times, except in time of Peſtilence, That
vein is to be taken, which is moſt full and
large. In the Feet alſo are three veins
<hi>Iſchiatiea, Saphaena,</hi> and <hi>vena Poplitis:</hi>
theſe or ſome of them are generally open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Obſtruction of the Monſtrues, in
bringing them down, pains, ſtoppings,
ſwellings and the like. I ſhall conclude
this with theſe directions. In an Apoplexy
open the Cephalick vein; if this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
not, open the <hi>Mediana:</hi> In a Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
open the Frontal or Cephalick vein:
In a Squinſey thoſe under the Tongue: In
a Pleurify the Baſilica, and here bleed
while the Blood doth change its colour: In
diſeaſes of the Lungs <hi>vena Axillaris</hi> or
<hi>Mediana:</hi> In inflammations of the Liver
<hi>Baſilica</hi> or <hi>Hepatica:</hi> In obſtruction of
the Spleen the Baſilick or Hemorrhoidal
veins: In diſeaſes of the Womb the Scia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
vein: In reſtraint of <hi>Menſtrues Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaena:</hi>
In pains of the Hips firſt open
the <hi>Baſilica,</hi> then the outward <hi>malcolus</hi>

               <p>IF a Tumour or Fluxion happeneth in
reſpect of matter not onely erring in
Quantity, but alſo in reſpect of Quality,
that this may be diſcharged we are to
conſider two things: Firſt, whether this
matter may be altered, as if hot cooled,
&amp;c. Secondly to remove the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hereof, and in the firſt, if Plethory,
Phlebotomy is proper; if leſs, Pharmacy
is moſt convenient: And herein are we to
obſerve theſe two Rules, that the matter
may firſt be educed or ſent forth being
contrary to the true genus of the part,
and then, if it doth ſtill remain, to alter it.
The moſt proper way to deal with this
is by our later writers found out, which
is by diſcharging the body hereof by
purging Medicines, which do work both
quickly and ſafely, ordering the ſtrength
of the Medicine according to the vigour
and ſtrength of the Patient:<note place="margin">If the thin matter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, it is to be revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and bow this as to be done.</note> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
alſo are we to mind the motion of the
Blood; for if it doth move to the eies,
this is to be revelled, firſt by Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes
without Scarrification, Secondly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:43322:46"/>
that the parts ought to be rubbed for the
better thinning the Humour, thirdly fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
which are proper for revelling
from the Center to the Circumference;
And <hi>Galen</hi> nameth the laſt when parts
are obſtructed, we ought to obſtruct with
Medicines; but theſe are tedious, painful,
and troubleſome. Our later Writers have
found out better means and methods, as
by waſhing with warm water, which doth
revell by opening the pores; another ſort
is by veſicatories, and theſe are in great
uſe in Apoplexies,<note place="margin">Obſervat.</note> Rheumatiſms, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillations;
the third and laſt is an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Cautery and Fontinels, and Setons
very much in uſe in our times. And in all
theſe we are to obſerve, that Revulſion
doth take its indication from that part
from whence the Humour ſloweth, not
from the Humour flowing, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
known we are to underſtand the

               <p>THE greateſt occaſion or cauſe of
attraction in a Tumour of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
body is cheifly to be attributed
to Laxity and Intemperiety of the part,
and pain. This Intemperiety is therefore
firſt to be removed, by running it into
a better temper. And this may be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
with oyl of Roſes, Violets and
the like, having fine linnen rags dipt
therein and ſo applied; and theſe are
oft to be repeated to prevent inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

               <p>THE knowledg of theſe times are
very proper for our Diagnoſis,
Prognoſis, and Cure. They are four in
number, Beginning, Augment, State, and
Declination. That time moſt properly
called the Beginning, when a part begins
to tumefy: thus if a Tumour be made in
a recipient part, Expulſion and Repercuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is the Intention; and this Repercuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
is nothing elſe but Illiſion and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
of the Humour, which floweth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the whole body or ſome part
thereof into the affected part. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
is a double motion from the part
hurt, and from another part ſending to
this hurt part. And here we are to adviſe,
that when members are looſe and ſoft,
then are we to ſtrengthen with Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
of a contrary affect,<note place="margin">Obſervat.</note> that is with
ſuch Medicines as are compact and dry.
<hi>Gal. 14. Meth. cap.</hi> 17. ſaith that pure
cold things do repel, as cold water; and
he there adds that others which are not
cold yet are reſtringent, as <hi>Mint, Roſes,
Wormwood</hi> and the like, and theſe he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43322:50"/>
ſaies do repel: theſe for the moſt part
are to be uſed in the beginnings of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
but not alwaies in every kind
of Tumour; For experience teacheth us
that in Peſtilential or Venereal Buboes,<note place="margin">Obſervat:</note>
if in the beginning we ſhould apply
repelling Medicines, we ſhould ſend the
peccant matter to the heart.<note place="margin">In 6 caſes no Repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to be applied in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:</note> In theſe ſix
caſes apply no Repellers in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
as if it be bred by a venenate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and repelling here you ſoon do ſhut
up the doors of life. If the matter be cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
yet this doth not alwaies deny
Repulſion; for in a violent Fever, in which
it happeneth that the matter doth ſend
it ſelf to the membranes of the brain, in
this critical caſe the Fluent matter is to
be repelled, leſt otherwiſe the brain
becometh inflamed. And then when this
Tumour happeneth either in a Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
or Plethorick body. When the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſloweth to the emunctories, we are
not to repel, as <hi>Galen</hi> adviſeth 6. <hi>de
Comp. per loc. cap.</hi> 2. Then when the part
into which this Tumour hath got footing
groweth weak, as <hi>Galen</hi> alſo hath it,
<hi>Meth. 13. cap.</hi> 7. And laſtly when pain
and exaſperation of the part is preſent,
for then Anodynes are more proper, as
<hi>Galen</hi> citeth 6. <hi>de Comp. Medic.</hi> theſe I
have formerly ſhown you in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43322:51"/>
of Tumours; but this being their
more proper place to bring them into, I
have alſo here given you their brief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition,
and in all other cauſes we may
and ought to come to uſe Repellers in
the beginning of Tumours. <hi>Avicen</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of repelling Medicines ordereth us
not alwaies to uſe one ſort or kind
thereof, but in cold caſes to uſe hot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers,
and in hot caſes to uſe cooling
Repellers. Now if pain ariſeth in the
beginning, and draweth ſomewhat of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to it, here are you to uſe mild Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers,
theſe being of a ſufficient capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to lenify the parts being ſtirred up
by pain. Such are <hi>Lettuce, Purſlain,
Trifole, Nightſhade, Endive, Violets,</hi>
and <hi>Plantane;</hi> theſe being endued with
a wateriſh moiſture do much better in
this caſe, than ſuch which are two aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
And out of theſe may you frame
many ſorts of Medicines by adding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>THE true waies and methods of
curing Tumours we have already
ſhown; but it oft times doth happen
that a Tumour doth tend to ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is the influxed Blood is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into <hi>pus</hi> or matter; whence doth
ariſe another method of curing. And
here <hi>Galen</hi> doth propoſe two waies,
which are performed either by Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Concoction: but the firſt is the
beſt; for theſe two things follow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction,
two much generation of this
matter, and an Abſceſs made hereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another place. In reſpect of its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
its long in curing: in reſpect of
the Abſceſs the Inflammation oft times
doth run it ſelf into another diſeaſe; as
oft times into a <hi>Gangrene</hi> as <hi>Jubertus,</hi>
obſerved in the wife of <hi>Rondeletius.</hi>
As touching the efficient cauſe of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Matter,<note place="margin">The effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of matter.</note> 
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> offereth <hi>lib. de inaequ.

part there is found both a native and
an extraneous heat; the firſt preſerving
the part, and doth adminiſter ſuch things
to it as belong to its health and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:43322:55"/>
the other Extraneous, ariſeth from
the influxed Blood, prolapſed out of the
veſſels, and there putrifying, this being
contrary to the former, and ſo doth
deſtroy and pull down or extinguiſh the
natural heat. The firſt matter is thick,
laudable, white, equal, well taſted; but
if the other prevail, it appears livid,
red or black, thin, inequal, grumous.
The Tumour offers it as a ſign of its
tending to ſuppuration by its intenſeneſs;<note place="margin">Signs of Suppurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
and when the inflammation is great, and
the pain vehement and doth daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
and when pulſation joins with
this Tenſion and this be large, when
theſe ſigns are at hand, uſe neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
Medicines nor Digeſtives; but
uſe your greateſt care to aſſiſt nature in
her progreſs of ſuppuration by matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Medicines, that is, to prepare the

then to diſcharge it when we have thus
prepared it. And that therefore we may
procure the Tumour for this ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and produce a good and laudable
matter, we are to encreaſe this Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

it ſelf, and ſo to the diſcharging of the
peccant matter: And for this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
four methods,<note place="margin">Four me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to four times by Guido.</note> according to the
four times; and whereas a Phlegmon
hath a Beginning while the Blood is now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
an Augment when in its Flux it is
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:43322:58"/>
made hotter, a State when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into <hi>Pus</hi> or Matter, and a Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
when the Inflammation is digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
reſolved, and the Tumour diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
So alſo the four Intentions ſhall be
theſe, firſt in having a reſpect to the
order of diet, ſecondly to hinder the Flux
of Humours, thirdly to diſcharge the
Matter, and then laſtly to correct and
amend the Symptoms. The firſt doth
conſiſt in moderating the Air, and this
more properly in a long inflammation:
the ſecond is eaſe and quiet, becauſe too
much motion heateth the body: the
third is watching and ſleep; for as the
one doth put our bodies into action, ſo
the other doth refreſh and cool them:
the fourth and laſt is order of diet: a
fifth may be added, which is retention
or inanition of excrements; for hard and
dry excrements do obſtruct, and hence
are bred ſharp and malign vapours,
which do courſe through the whole
body, and do render the inflammation
more dangerous; and then actions of
the mind may take a part here alſo. The
whole cure may be performed by Diet,
Pharmacy, and Chirurgery. Diet for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
Inflammation of ſuperfluous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and their generation, and making
them more unfit for Fluxion; and here
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43322:58"/>
the Patient's diet ſhould be thin,<note place="margin">His diet.</note> moiſt and
moderately cooling: as broths where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are boiled <hi>Lettuce, Borage, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloſs,
Spinage, Purſlain,</hi> or <hi>Marigolds;</hi>
if in Summer time, our green ſauce
(as we call it) is very good being made
of <hi>Sorrel;</hi> if he will drink wine, let him
mix it with three parts of water to one
wine. Fluxion is diſcharged, if we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
its cauſes, as <hi>Plethory,</hi> and <hi>Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy;</hi>
and theſe may be leſſened either
by <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> or <hi>Pharmacy.</hi> If the
Inflammation be large, and the Patient
young, ſtrong, and full of Blood, we may
ſafely breath a vein:<note place="margin">Obſervat.</note> and here we are to
obſerve, that we breath not a vein too
far diſtant from the part affected, both
for Revulſion and Derivation; the firſt
being to be made in the oppoſite part,
whilſt the ſecond is made in the ſame
ſide near the part affected. And ſince the
body is ſeen ſeldome ſo clean, but that
there is ſome ill humours or other mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

               <p>FROM Choller ariſeth this <hi>Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi>
accompanied with many other
Tumours, bred alſo from this Humour
as <hi>Herpes miliaris, Herpes exedens,
Pustulae</hi> and the like. There is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allowed three ſorts of Choller,<note place="margin">Natural:</note> natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
unnatural, preternatural. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
is that fourth part of the Blood,
which hath a hot and dry temper in it,
being of a reddiſh yellow colour, and
bitter-ſweet in taſte, much like toſted
honey. This is one of the natural Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
ſo called for a double cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they perfect natures work, and
are as vehicles for nutriment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the body; for if man were
without blood he could not be nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if without Spirits he could not be
ſaid to live; and were it not for this
natural bilious Humour man would ſoon
ſwell into a Dropſy.<note place="margin">Second not natural.</note> A ſecond ſort here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is ſaid to be not natural, becauſe this
yeilds no perfection to the body, its
ſubſtance being altogether unfit for this
office of nutriment, this hath in it no
bitterneſs or ſharpneſs: of this ſort is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43322:66"/>
that of the bladder of the Gall; and
ſhould this contain any ſharpneſs in it
it would ſoon fret the guts into pieces;
and beſides this, daily experience ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it is free of all Acidity, for it dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paſſeth through the Kidneyes into the
Bladder, and then maketh its exit. But
this Queſtion in the Phyſick Schools hath
been very oft times controverted.<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Was
not this Humour framed and ordered
for deterging the capillary veſſels, that
Chyle might paſs to the Liver, and
ſo the Blood hereby conſequently there
made?<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> But this conſequence may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
readily denied, for the Chyle does
never reach the Liver; and this may
appear different from the other, in that
it is not ſo natural.<note place="margin">Third pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural.</note> There is a third
ſort hereof different from both the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
being neither good to help the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in its nouriſhment, nor yet ſo mild
as unnatural; which although it do not
nouriſh the body, yet doth it not offer
any miſcheif to it; this is both unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
and unnatural, and preternatural,
alwaies hurting the body; and ſo is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
preternatural Choller, which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>perſe</hi> and <hi>in ſe</hi> is apparently ſo. There
is another ſort of preternatural Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
which mixeth it ſelf with other
Humours, and doth make them worſe;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43322:67"/>
the one having in it Serum and Flegm,
and this is very fit and proper for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
There is a ſecond ſort doth
mix it ſelf with tough viſcous Flegm,<note place="margin">Its diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencies.</note> and
this is called <hi>Bilis vitellina;</hi> and this
doth promote and help forwards obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
A third is burnt choller by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture,
and this doth make &amp; frame our
great pains and excoriations, whilſt it
doth lodge in the veſſels; and when it
getteth out from hence, is the moſt apt
Author of cancerous Tumours and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick
vlcers. And thus much of the
differencies of Choller. We now arrive
to an <hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> the proper ſubject of
this Chapter, and <hi>Guido</hi> doth give that
diſtemper which adhereth to the <hi>Cutis</hi>
the name of <hi>Eryſipelas.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The names of Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las.</note> Some of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
called it <hi>Ignis ſacer; ignis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it burneth like fire; <hi>ſacer,</hi> being
ſent as a puniſhment from the Sacred
hand: but it is more properly called
<hi>Eryſipelas, quaſi</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. For as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth ſignifie redneſs (by ſome called
<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> doth as well ſignifie near.
And thus may we define it, calling it
<hi>Eryſipelas,</hi> becauſe it maketh all its
neighbouring parts red: It is a hot Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
ariſing from the aforeſaid choller,
poſſeſſing ſome exterior part of the body.<note place="margin">What it is.</note>
A true and ſimple <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> is bred
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43322:67"/>
of thin, ſubtile, hot, and chollerique blood;
and this appearing in any one part of
the body doth form and faſhion this
diſeaſe; and becauſe it cannot by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of its thinneſs have any conſiſtence in
the inward fleſh, it therefore doth content
it ſelf with getting into the outward
parts of the cutis, and there it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
its terrifying Qualities. You may
know it by its hot ſigns,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> having belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it a large heat, pain, a red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or rather ſomewhat turning yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh.
But becauſe theſe ſigns are ſo
near related to thoſe of a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Its differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from a Phlegmon.</note> I
ſhall here make a larger diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. And thus it firſt doth differ
from a Phlegmon, in that a Phlegmon
doth apprehend both cutis and ſubject
fleſh; in this onely the cutis is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Secondly, this is much hotter, for
you ſee it appear as it were burnt up by
its bliſters, by how much the choller is
hotter than blood. Thirdly, here is leſs
pain. Fourthly, its redneſs doth oft times
change into a blackneſs or blewneſs.
Fifthly, it yeildeth to the touch. Sixthly,
upon the touch the redneſs doth vaniſh.
Seventhly, here is no tenſion. Eightly, it
doth differ from a <hi>Phlegmon,</hi> in that it
never doth move from its place; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this ſpreads it ſelf and encreaſes about
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43322:68"/>
its neighbouring parts. That which
doth proceed from yellow choller is mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt;<note place="margin">Praeſage.</note>
it is a bad ſign if an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> turns
inwards. In Tumours, Wounds, Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
and Diſlocations, it is generally
held mortal; or if it doth tend to ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
it is no waies to be accounted a
good ſign, neither may it be judged but
very very bad, if it do poſſeſs the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
parts of a bone being bare.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> As
touching its Cure, according to <hi>Galen</hi> in
his <hi>Arte medendi,</hi> whereas it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
encreaſing in a great quantity of
choller, this is to be evacuated, and the
whole Cure performed by diet, Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
and Pharmacy. As to the firſt, we
are to obſerve that the Air be cold and
moiſt, ſo naturally, or made ſo by Art;
let the Patients diet be cold and moiſt,
and as this choller is thin, let him take
ſuch diet as is cooling and thickning; and
for his broths may very properly be
boiled theſe herbs. <hi>Lettuce, Beets,
Mallows, Chichory Sorrel,</hi> and the like.
Chicken-broth here alſo is very good,
Barly water, Ptyſane, to which may be
added <hi>Borage, Bugloſſe,</hi> and the former,
or ſome of them. For his common drink
he may take Almond-milks made of
blancht Almonds, the cold ſeeds, wood-Sorrel
and the like, ſweetned with Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43322:68"/>

in this caſe it is very diſputable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be at all proper or not; but if
it be convenient at any time, and at
any place, it is when it gets into the
head and face, and then are we to open
the cephalick vein, for prevention of a
Pleurify or Squinancy. In an <hi>Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las

outward as contuſions, wounds, or the
like, which may be accounted capable
enough to excite heat and pain; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
taken too much hot wine, ſpice,

               <p>AS the former two have their varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of diſeaſes belonging to them,
ſo alſo hath this its various companions
bred of and from the ſame Humour;
for from Flegm are bred, <hi>Oedema, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theroma,
Steatoma, Meliceris, Nodi in
Juncturis, Ganglion, Leucophlegmatia</hi>
and the like. This Flegm is the fourth
part of the maſs of Blood, that is, the
colder and moiſter part thereof: and if
it ſo happen that this doth increaſe in
quantity,<note place="margin">What flegm is.</note> the expulſive faculty being
ſtirred up by the great plenty of this
Flegm, this doth offer very fair to the
generating of an <hi>Oedema.</hi> This Flegm
is cold and moiſt, and by ſome called
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43322:74"/>
pituitous Blood. And of this there is two
ſorts, one Alimentary, the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious.
The firſt is the origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hereof,<note place="margin">Its name.</note> by the Arabians called <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimia,</hi>
by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which word
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies no otherwiſe then an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency.
There are of natural or excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious
Flegm theſe three ſorts: the
firſt being acid, ſo called from its taſte;
the ſecond ſalt Flegm; the third glaſſy
Flegm, from its coldneſs, thickneſs, and
toughneſs. And if Flegm doth erecede
from its nature by admixing it ſelf with
Blood, it is called <hi>Oedema Phlegmonodes;</hi>
if with Choller, <hi>Oedema Eryſipelatodes;</hi>
if with melancholy, <hi>Oedema Scirrhodes.</hi>
A great matter hereof is a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Flegm reſiding in the body,
cheifly about the extreme parts, as the
hands, knees, or feet, theſe being the
moſt remote from the Fountain of heat.
This Flegm is thrown forth from the
greater veſſels to the ſmaller,<note place="margin">Its genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the which
being there deteined by the thickneſs of
the Cutis, is collected in the muſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
parts, and there doth form this Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dematous
Tumour. It is a Tumour ſoft,
indolent, looſe, yeilding to the touch,
generated from a pituitous matter.<note place="margin">Definition.</note> It
is ſoft and looſe,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> and theſe two come
from the Humour of thin Flegm; indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:43322:74"/>
for it neither doth make or cauſe
any pain, or diſſolve unity; It gives
way to the touch, and is a white Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme,
and without heat; white, being
moſt like its object Flegm; without
heat, being like the matter out of which
it is generated, which is cold and moiſt.
A pituitous Humour redundant in the
body is the cheif cauſe,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note> to the which
a cold and moiſt air, a flegmatick diet,
too much ſleep and idleneſs, and a cold
dyſcraſy both of Head, Stomack, or Liver
may help forward to the encreaſe of
its cauſe.<note place="margin">Praeſage.</note> And as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, <hi>Comm.</hi> 46.
that out of Fluxion of Humours ſome
are cruel, as Chollerick fluxes, and burnt
Melancholy; and others are more kind,
as this <hi>Oedema:</hi> ſo this is a tedious and
long diſeaſe, becauſe it is cold, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
heat being herein very weak. It
is oft times ſoft, and without pain, and
ſo carrieth the leſs danger; but if it be
hard, and with pain, it is dangerous.
As touching its cure, here ought we
firſt to uſe proper means by Retracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Revulſion of the Matter, and
leſſening of it. Secondly, becauſe it is
cold, remove its cauſe by implanting
heat and warmth herein. Let the Air
be warm and dry, the Diet attenuating
and drying; here Wine is good becauſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43322:75"/>
it doth digeſt and warm. Let his diet
be of good and light digeſtion, as
Chickens, Rabbets, Partridges, and the
like, to which may be added all ſorts
of ſpices. Let his ſleep be moderate;
and let him avoid all paſſions of mind,
and venery, and obſerve that he keep
a good habit of his body. After this
let him uſe ſuch evacuations, as may
both attenuate, open, and diſcharge this
Flegm. Bleeding here is in no wiſe to
be uſed, unleſs a <hi>Phlegmon</hi> do accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it, Fever, or the like. And for his
uſe theſe Phlegmagogicks are very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

Elephantiaſis, Pſoras</hi> and others.
Our late writers do call this <hi>Scirrhus
Durities,</hi> becauſe it is a hard Tumour
deſtroying ſenſe, lodging in a Member
in that Capacity, as that it produceth
little or no pain: or it may be called a
preternatural Tumour, having no infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſymptome. It is by ſome called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtema
Lapidoſum,</hi> by <hi>Avicen Sephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros.</hi>
It is the onely brat of Melancholy:
and this Melancholy hath a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
For there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,

a vaſt difference, the ſuccus or juice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as the fecies or dregs of the Blood,
and is drawn from the pureſt part of
it by the ſpleen: the other Black Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
being cauſed of immoderate heat
and burneth the parts, and like vinegar
being poured on the ground, it boyleth
and raiſeth it ſelf from thence. There
are four ſpecies of Melancholy;<note place="margin">4 Species of Melancholy</note> firſt,
when its ſpecies are burnt, it frameth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43322:78"/>
an illegitimate Scirrhus; Secondly, when
Melancholy is made preternaturally by
other Humours, it doth take ſhare of
their qualities; Thirdly, when it is made
thick by too much cooling or drying
of Humours; Fourthly, when it is mixed
with Flegm, Blood, or Choler, then it
maketh <hi>Scirrhus Oedematodes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Burnt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy made four waies.</note> 
                  <hi>Scirrhus
Phlegmonodes, Scirrhus Eryſipelatodes.</hi>
There are four waies alſo ſhown to the
making of burnt Melancholy. The firſt
is made of yellow Choler burnt, and ſo
repreſenting a yellow ſinder, and doth
burn like it; The ſecond is made of
thick and viſcid Flegm; The third is made
of burnt Blood, which is very bitter;
The fourth is made of Melancholy Juice,
being both acid and corroding.<note place="margin">How a Scirrhus is made.</note> There
are two kinds of Humours which do
make this Scirrhus; the one being a
Crudity, as Flegm, thick and yet not
viſcid; the ſecond is vitreous matter, or
a glaſſy ſubſtance of Flegm. And hence
may we take a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> either to be
exquiſite, or not exquiſite: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if Flegm be in a great quantity, it
ſhapeth out <hi>Scirrhus Oedematodes;</hi> if
Choler be predominant, <hi>Scirrhus Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceroſus.</hi>
Or if you pleaſe a <hi>Scirrhus</hi> is
bred out of a natural melancholy Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
which is cold, dry and thick,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:43322:79"/>
and from glutinous Flegm;<note place="margin">Its defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and hence
it may be defined a Tumour hard and
indolent, a Tumour proceeding from a
thick and glutinous Flegm, or a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
melancholick Humour. It may be
known by theſe Signs, it is a Tumour
without pain,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> hard to touch; if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite,
it is ſcarcely perceived. Every
Scirrhus hath not pain; and this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
happeneth, becauſe it is deprived
of ſenſe. Melancholick Scirrhous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
are generally of a leaden colour,
but a Scirrhus ariſing from a Flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Humour carrieth in it the natural
colour of the Cutis. They take their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Cauſes from the beginning of thick
and tough Humours, and collecting
themſelves in the parts; and that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by evil Diet generating a thick
and viſcid Humour,<note place="margin">Cauſes:</note> as by reaſon of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperieties
of the Liver or Spleen, all
ſuch cauſes may be ſaid outwardly to
generate thick juices, as a cold or dry
Air, Watchings, ſuppreſſion of Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrues,
and the like. Expect to do no good
on an exquiſite Scirrhus; for this alwaies
is to be ſuſpected: If it happeneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Joints,<note place="margin">Preſage.</note> Knees, or theſe remote
parts, be not too forward to undertake
them. If it be exquiſite and not turning
Cancerous, yet it is hard to cure: for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:43322:79"/>
firſt, the Matter is dried up; and then
cold and compact, and ſo tedious; and
that which is lapidous gives no way to
Medicine.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> As to the cure, the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
cauſes are firſt to be removed, by
chooſing a thin Air, hot and moiſt, free
from Fogs and Miſts; let the Patient
ſhun thick, leguminous and cold Diet;
let his Drink be Wine to help forward
Digeſtion, and warm the parts; and let
him get himſelf clear of all paſſions
of the mind. After this are we to take
care to remove the inward cauſes, by
preparing the Humour with Syrup of
<hi>Apples, Bugloſs, Fumitory, Hyſſop, Oxy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel,
Balm,</hi> and the like. This being
done, we are to purge this melancholick
Humour with <hi>Senna, Polypody,</hi> black
<hi>Hellebore, Confectio Hamech,</hi> &amp;c. of theſe
or the like may be framed excellent
compound Medicines, as this Apozeme.

this Tumour, and preventing ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

propoſed and followed, the Excreſcency

apprehended therewith, and ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
bringing it cloſer until it had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

               <p>I Proceed now to the other two Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
ariſing from Water and Wind,
out of which watery Fountain do ariſe
and ſpring up <hi>Aſcitis, Hydrocele, Hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalos,
Phlyctenes</hi> and the like. Now
this <hi>Serum</hi> from whence theſe Tumours
do ariſe, is a collection of Water in
ſome member of the Body, void of pain,
and there is but a ſmall quantity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in healthful perſons, it doth ſtamp
its various ſpecies on its places where
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:43322:82"/>
it inhabits or hath any thing to do.
<hi>Galen</hi> calleth all wateriſh Tumours Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
that have any moiſture in them.
And when it thus getteth into the
<hi>Scrotum,</hi> it maketh <hi>Hydrocele;</hi> if into
the Navel, <hi>Hydromphalos.</hi> They ariſe
from a thin Humour, which ſometimes
is profitable; profitable ſo far as it doth
perform its office, which doth ſerve as
a proper Vehicle to the Blood; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if it at any time happeneth that
a wateriſh Humidity be refunded into
the Body forcing its excretion, this
expelleth it to the Cutis through the
other parts, and doth form and make
theſe wateriſh Tumours. A ſecond may
be a redundancy of this wateriſh Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in our Bodies, which oft times doth
happen and ariſe from a weakneſs of the
Kidneyes, which are not ſtrong enough
to attract this plenty of <hi>Serum:</hi> or may
be occaſioned by drinking too much
Wine; for as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, this wateriſh
Humour is the excrement of potion.<note place="margin">Signs.</note>
You may know it by its Splendor and
Fluctuation, if you preſs it with your
Finger; and a particular Sign of a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh
Tumour is, that it is made with
itching, occaſioned by the ſaltneſs which
is contained in the Humour. Such as
cometh from an evil affect either of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

the part thick by reaſon of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43322:85"/>
groſneſs of theſe Flations, it doth oft
times make troubleſome and tedious
work for the Chirurgion. Its cauſes are
flatulent Spirits, viſcid, or vitreous
Flegm, and want of native Heat; thus
the heat is but ſmall which doth work
it ſelf into theſe Humours, and ſo doth
ſomewhat diſſolve them, and ſo doth
ariſe this flatuous Spirit; and this being
bred, doth elevate the part where it
once getteth footing, becauſe it cannot
work its free paſſage by reaſon of the
denſity of its parts. It is ſeen to ariſe
in ſeveral parts of the Body, as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

the diſaffection of the Liver: and there
is another Tumour ariſing from a windy
Vapour, and this by <hi>Avicen</hi> is called
<hi>Inſlatio.</hi> This is bred from Flegm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>AND becauſe this is a Tumour doth
happen very frequently in our Art,
and proves an enemy both very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and painful, that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the right way of dealing herewith,
it generally happening in the Breſt,<note place="margin">What the Breſt is.</note> let
us firſt conſider the Breſt it ſelf and its
parts. The Breſt, according to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman
<hi>Wharton,</hi> is ſaid to be framed
of a glandulous ſpongeous Parenchyma,
not divided into diſtinct conglobated
Glandules,<note place="margin">The Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Breſt.</note> but is rather to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a conglomerated Glandule; but in a
Scirrhus and in a Cancerous Tumour
they appear knotty. It hath Veins,
Nerves, Arteries, and Lymphaducts, and
a porous Cavity: its Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43322:89"/>
come from the <hi>Subclavians:</hi> it hath
its Nerves from the fifth pair, and from
other Originations: <hi>Lymphaducts</hi> are
here very frequently ſcattered: and as
touching its Poroſities or porous Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
theſe do ſerve for its Excretion, or
its excretory uſes, they being more large
in the Breſt then in the common <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus,</hi>
which is opened with many ſmall
Foramulaes, their general uſe is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the Milk fit for the Infant: and for
the making this there is held a great
controverſy, ſome holding the Blood to
be the <hi>Prima Materia</hi> hereof, whilſt
others do contend as ſtoutly for the
Chyle to be its Origination. The firſt
is not to be defended; for if Chyle be
to be made moſt properly into Blood,
it may very properly be accounted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde
for Blood to turn into Chyle.
And ſuch as do ſtand up for the Chyle
to be the onely ſubſtance of the Milk,<note place="margin">How milk is made.</note>
they do offer this as their aſſertion, that
the Chyle doth immediatly paſs through
the Milky veſſels into the Breſt, or
that it is there received into the Veins,
and thence effuſed through the Thora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cick
Arteries into the Breſts, and that
they have a power or faculty to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the Blood from the Chyle, and to
diſpoſe it through the Mammillary veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43322:89"/>
into the Body, and this they call
Milk; but the way or paſſage which
ſhould conduct this to the Lactiferous
veſſels is not yet arrived at. Our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<hi>Wharton's</hi> opinion is, that Milk is
peculiarly a nervous Juice, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
conſtituted for the ſubſtance of the
Milk, but alſo for carrying a double
Matter with it, as being both Chyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
and Spermatick; and theſe two
do breed the greateſt part of the Milk,
not immediatly ſent from the Ventricle
to the Breſts by the Milky veſſels, but
carried by or through the <hi>Ductus chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liferus</hi>
into the <hi>Subclavian,</hi> thence cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed
with the Blood through the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles
of the Heart, and ſo paſſeth
through the Thoracick Arteries, and in
time of the Mother giving milk it is
refunded into the ample capacity of the
Breſts, and there do ſeparate the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous
part from the Chyle, and do
reduce it through the Mammary Veins
into the Meditullium of the body. And
this he offereth as the cheif matter or
ſubſtance of Milk, and the moſt proper
nutriment for the Infant. And ſince we
daily ſee the young ſucking Babe is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
by alluring this Milk from its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Breſt by her Nipple, it is very
neceſſary that it ſhould contain in it
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:43322:90"/>
ſuch a ſubſtance as may give it ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And as the more noble part
thereof doth come from the <hi>Succus ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſus;</hi>
ſo alſo ought it moſt properly
to be derived from hence for the Infant's
nutriment: but thus much as touching
Milk. We arrive now to that which
nearer concerns our enquiry, which is
the tract of a Cancer: and this by the
Greeks is called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Its name:</note> by
us a Cancer, from the reſemblance it
hath with a Sea-Crab. For as the one
hath expanded claws and feet in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places, being of a livid or cineriſh
colour; ſo alſo is this Tumour of a round
Figure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a livid Colour, and ſticketh
or adhereth ſo cloſe to the part affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a Key to a Door, or a claw of a
Crab in its griping, having in it by ſome
reported to carry in it exalted Veins;
but this is more fabulous then true, for
not in four of a hundred, as <hi>Falloppius</hi>
obſerves, can you ſee them thus appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
It carrieth with it a train of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
pain and heat, ſhewing it ſelf to view
both cruel and horrible, it ariſeth from
black Choler. As <hi>Tagaultius</hi> ſuppoſed, it
ariſeth from the Fecies of Blood; but
this is onely his opinion, for this doth
more properly frame and make a Scir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhous
Humour; and that which to the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43322:90"/>
whole body doth make an <hi>Elephantiaſis,</hi>
to a private or particular part doth alſo
frame a Cancer: and where this black
Choler is ſharp and hot, it maketh an
Ulcerate Cancer: and by reaſon of its
thick Juice, it can neither be repelled,
or diſcuſſed; for as it ſlighteth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth
the company or acquaintance
of mild Medicines, ſo alſo doth it like
Lard or Oyl turn into a flame, rage,
and fury, by the applying of any ſtrong
or vehement Medicine. The Cauſes of
this <hi>Atra bilis</hi> are many; for firſt in
the Liver is bred this natural melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick
Humour, which is called the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the Blood,<note place="margin">Cauſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and hence ariſeth a
<hi>Scirrhus,</hi> ſo this <hi>Atra bilis</hi> is made up
of the aduſtion of the other Humours,
and without flattery is the worſt of all
the reſt, and as it groweth more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid,
ſharp, and malign, it doth more
ſpeedily, violently, and painfully create
an ulcerated Cancer. Sometimes it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
from a hot intemperiety of the
Liver, which burneth it, and by this
burning is bred <hi>Atra bilis.</hi> Sometimes as
<hi>Galen</hi> ſaith <hi>cap. 10. lib. 2. ad Gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>c.</hi>
from weakneſs and intemperiety of the
Spleen, it being made incapable to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
this melancholick Humour, in ſo
much that it is kept up and burnt up in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:43322:91"/>
the body. Sometimes it happeneth from
a ſuppreſſion of the Menſtrues. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
cauſes may alſo affect this, as a
thick, and viſcous Diet, as Onyons, Leeks,
Beans,<note place="margin">Its ſubject.</note> and the like. It may ariſe in any
one part of the Body; ſometimes it doth
throw it ſelf forth into ſeveral places,
but the Breſt being a ſoft looſe part
is moſt ſubject to its Tyranny, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the impreſs of its malitious
ſtamp. Sometimes it happeneth in the
parts of the Face, Noſe, Lips, Mandible,
and Tongue. Sometimes in the Inguens,
and Thigh; a lively example of which
I had in a Gentlewoman, my Patient in
<hi>Norwich</hi> when I writ this. Another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that a Cancer doth ſooneſt grow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Breſt before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part, is in reſpect of the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
that there is made between the
Breaſt and the Womb, by the Veins,
through which this thick and feculent
Blood is ſent and diſpatched; and for
the ſame reaſon is it, that there have
been ſeen ſo oft times Cancers of the
Womb.<note place="margin">Signs.</note> At its firſt touch it doth appear
hard in reſpect of its thick Humour; it
is of a livid Colour, and the more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign
the Humour is, the more livid the
Colour of the Tumour is; and then pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
for here is made a ſolution of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:43322:91"/>
occaſioned by much Matter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtending
the Nervous parts, Heat and
Inequality; it is hot like the Humour
that breedeth it. The greateſt matter
here to be minded is the Hardneſs and
Thickneſs of the matter; if you ſee a
black and livid Colour in the place, and
a Hardneſs accompany it, this is a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagnomonical</hi>
Sign: if you meet with a
melancholy Humour and a melancholy
Habit of Body, and the Breſt ſuſpected, and
the Body capable of entertaining ſuch a
Tumour furniſhed with evil Juices, this
giveth a fair proſpective to the thoughts
of a Cancer. The Cancer which is Ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
may well be known by theſe Signs:
For its Ulcer carrieth with it a fetid
Smell, having thick, ſwelling, and blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
Lips, horrid in aſpect, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with great Pain.<note place="margin">Preſage:</note> In its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it is hard, having a blewiſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and pricking Pain about it. The
event ſhoweth the ſucceſs; for you
may never expect a cure of this: if any
hopes may prompt on to proceed, it
will be with a great difficulty: if you
extirpate it, there oft times remaineth
a Cancerous Ulcer, or it maketh its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
ſome other way, and to ſome
other part; ſo that, as wiſe <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
ſaith, if the Patient be thus cured,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43322:92"/>
this Cure will onely be as a means to
ſhorten his daies. We ought not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

three things are to be minded, that we
have a great reſpect to the Patien'ts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
preſcribing convenient Medicines,
and well ordering the part affected; and
theſe are performed by Diet, <hi>Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
and <hi>Chirurgery.</hi> And becauſe the
beſt kind of theſe are bad enough to be
treated with, that it may have its great
force and fury ſtormed, and its ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
venemous Quality the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
and leſſened, we are here to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
our work with univerſal order and
method of the whole Body. The better
to ſtrengthen the other adjacent parts,
and to allay the fury and anger of this
ſo potent an enemy, we are firſt to look
to the good order of Diet, which in
Quantity ſhould be thin, although moiſt
in Quality; and endeavour to quell the
antecedent Cauſe by prohibiting the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43322:92"/>
of this Humour; and purge
gently your Patient by degrees: and in
purging obſerve this rule, that you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
prepare the Humour; the antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Cauſe being conquered, lay Seige
to the conjunct Cauſe with all ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
as may ſtorm the force of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
contained in the part affected; and
if any furious motion hereof may either
diſturb the Quiet, unſettle the Reſt, or
diſcompoſe the order of this princely
Fabrick, uſe all means to prevent the
incurſion of this private Enemy. And
for the firſt intention, it being the moſt
proper and ready method for hindring
the augment of a Cancer and keeping
it within its bounds, Purgation is as an
excellent weapon. And here may you
furniſh your ſelf with many excellent
Methods, being either made into Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zems,

All theſe or any of theſe may be
uſed in the beginning of a Cancer, when
it is but ſmall; but if it hath arrived
at a greater bulk and largneſs, this as
<hi>Galen</hi> directeth <hi>cap. 10. lib. ad Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>
is not to be dealt with, unleſs by
Amputation: and this I think in no wiſe
may be ſaid to come under the name
of an exact way of cure; becauſe it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
yeildeth the part its native Heat,
but taketh away with it the ſound as
well as the diſaffected part. And that
we may proceed more effectually in this
operation when occaſion and neceſſity
may command or oblige it, obſerve with
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:43322:94"/>
me theſe Rules, being as ſo many juſt
Guides which will hardly fail you in your
conduct: as firſt, that Cancer which
doth adhere to the Breſt or Breſts is
very deplorable. Secondly, that which
doth happen in the Head, Neck or Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
or alſo in the Inguens, all theſe
are to be pronounced incurable. <hi>Aetius
cap. 44. lib.</hi> 10. gives this for a reaſon,
becauſe they creep and get in ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the fleſhy parts, that they are
not to be got out thence. Thirdly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be not thus adherent, yet it
is not without great danger. Fourthly,
a worſe Symptome then any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
which is alſo ſeen very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
unleſs the Tumour be wholly extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
cured, and cicatrized, it may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grow again in the ſame place, or
in ſome other place, and ſo bring a life
full of greif, and a certain diſſolution
of the whole in the end. Ulcerate Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
do require Amputation by reaſon
of the great pain and heat they do car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with them. And that we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
methodically herein, I ſhall here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
what Inſtruments are moſt proper
for this work, as Inciſion Knives, a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
Knife, large Needles, Sponges,
other Needles and the like, the which
you ſhall have more fully afterwards,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43322:95"/>
I having there preſented the young Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion
with a draught expreſſing his
Inſtruments, and all other poſtures
which he may uſe. And before I ſet down
the method of Amputation, be pleaſed
to liſten to that famous Hiſtory of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe
Parrey,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> relating to a Maid of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
belonging to the Queen Mother,
who being perplexed with a Cancer in
her Breſt which did equal the largneſs
of a Walnut, had applied to it Plates
made of thin Lead rubbed over with
Quickſilver, the which although they
did not cure her Breſt, yet afforded her
the kindneſs of preventing its increaſe.
The above nominated Lady growing
weary of applying theſe Leads, thinks
upon a new Phyſician, who coming to
her, very confidently promiſeth her a
perfect cure, and rejecting theſe Plates
as trifles, began his cure with Emolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and heating Medicines, and added
ſuch things as attracted pain; upon the
Application of which, the Tumour did
ſuddenly grow to a vaſt bulk and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſo much extended the Breſt
that it did break in the middle, whence
iſſued out an immoderate Flux; for the
ſtopping of which he makes preſent uſe

ſo ſeized on her, that poor
Lady, inſtead of her promiſed health ſhe
yeilded her ſelf to the Grave in the
ſight of her Phyſician. This I bring in
as a Caution to all younger Brethren,
hoping it may direct them to uſe more
Reaſon than Paſſion, Study than Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

fall on a ſudden upon deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
matters, but rather with Judgment
and Reaſon back their Art, and ſecure
their Reputations. I ſhall here breifly
preſent you with my methodical way
of Amputation, which I uſed in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>
not many years ſince in a Woman
whoſe Breſt I amputated, the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ablated weighed near two pounds.
Her Body being prepared by Apozemes
and convenient Purgations, both for
hindring the Augment, and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to prevent a Fever,<note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> and ſhe in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reſpect being made fit for the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
being a Woman of an undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
courage, never did ſhrink at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpating
of the ſame. Having made
ready my Reſtrictives of Bolarmeny,
Draggons blood, Maſtich, and the like,
with convenient Buttons, Pledgets, Boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and Rollers, the Operation was
thus performed, by drawing through
two large Needles through the body of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43322:97"/>
the Breſt, armed with Silks croſs waies,
by the help of which I had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to elevate the Breſt for the better
extirpating it and its Radix. The Breſt
being amputated with my diſmembring
Knife, I with my Fingers expreſſed all
the Blood from the remote parts: after
this done I applied my Buttons made
of Tow to the Veins and Arteries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
covered with the Reſtrictive, whilſt
others were onely dipt in <hi>Acetum</hi> and
ſo well ſprinkled with <hi>Calcanthum Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum:</hi>
After theſe was applied my large
Pledget or Cap armed with a Defenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
then with convenient Bolſtrings
and Rollers I performed and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my firſt intention. Here let the young
Chirurgion take notice as a juſt Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Caution.</note>
that he attempt nothing of this
Operation in a large and thick Breſt,
it being both dangerous and no waies
ſafe. Within two daies after I took of
my firſt dreſſings, and then applied ſuch
Medicines as might remove the Eſchar;
the which being ablated, I deterged the
Ulcer, filled it up with Fleſh, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
a perfect Cicatrice, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
did receive a perfect Cure: But
within 2 or 3 years after, whether by
a blow or the like given her on her
Breſt I know not, but it flew out again.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:43322:97"/>
A Mountebank coming to this Town
promiſed her upon her addreſs to him a
perfect Cure; but poor Woman ſhe was
treated after the ſame manner as the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Honour was, which I have already
told you of, for he applying very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
Medicines, drew both her out of
her troubles by ſending her into another
world, and what ſhe had into his own
pocket.<note place="margin">How an ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer is to be treated.</note> If an Ulcerate Cancer might

may uſe this double Method, if any

is a Diſeaſe compoſed both of a Tumour

that is the thinner part thereof, which
is turned into yellow Choler, whilſt the

This Cruſtuous fleſh is circled with

writeth of one of four years of age who
was afflicted with a Carbuncle in the
middle of his Forehead, with a red Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
accompanied, being black in the
middle, and the whole Face tumefied;
to which was applied a Cauſtick to the
black part; and for removing the Eſchar
an Unguent made of Baſilicon, to which
was added ſome Treacle, oyl of Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and the Yolk of an Egg; and to
the whole Tumour was applied a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplaſm
of <hi>Arnogloſſus,</hi> purging and
bleeding being afterwards preſcribed, a
Veſicatory to his Neck, and a Cordial
ordered for ſupporting of his Spirits
with <hi>Confectio de Hyacinth.</hi> &amp;c. the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
abated, the Inflammation grew more
remiſs, and every thing did ſeem mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated.
In this caſe the Veſicatory did
perform the greateſt part of the Cure
by deriving a great part of this viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Humour. And to every Carbuncle
I think it very proper to apply it to all
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43322:104"/>
the neighbouring parts, and not to uſe

Definitions hereof; by ſome it is ſaid

called <hi>Mortificatio; Galen</hi> doth call a
Gangrene the beginning of a Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

doth ſo trouble and infeſt the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
parts, that without the beſt of
Medicine be applied by a very skilful
hand, it does ſpeedily run it ſelf into a
Mortification. Inflammation by him alſo
is accounted as a very great Inſtrument
hereof, and here beginneth a change of
Colour, decay of Senſe, a turning to
Mortification. We more properly allow
and decree it the beginning of a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,

is a Diſeaſe exeding and compreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the parts: It is a perfect Sydera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

for the moſt part remaineth in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſuperficies, and doth onely poſſeſs
and affect the Muſcles and ſoft parts:
in a Sphacelus not theſe onely, but the
Bones themſelves become affected. In a
Gangrene the Skin groweth red, by
reaſon of its companion Inflammation;
in a Sphacelus it firſt groweth pale,
then livid, and afterwards black. In a
Gangrene you have no very ill ſmell;
in a Sphacelus never expect a good
ſmell. In a Gangrene your greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
muſt be to prevent the ſpreading
of the Humour, and if it hath got place,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:43322:110"/>
to prevent its growth: in a Sphacelus
its loſt labour then to act or treat any
other waies than by Amputation; for
there is no hope of bringing a dead part
to life. It gains its Name of <hi>Syderatio</hi>
from that of Plants, being a proper paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of them; when they loſe their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
moiſture, the which doth afford
them their full growth and beauty, this
affect is called <hi>Syderatio,</hi> as if they were
ſtruck by the Stars.<note place="margin">3 Cauſes of a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene.</note> The immediate
Cauſes of a Gangrene are three. Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periety
of the part, when the tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Spirits are obſtructed, and
when both the Heat and Spirits of the
part are ſuffocated. Sometimes it cometh
by cold, and then is to be diſcharged
by heat; in Gun-ſhot Wounds it doth
frequently happen by reaſon of large
Contuſions; it is ſometimes alſo bred by
the careleſneſs of Phyſicians, who in
the curing of an <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
do order and preſcribe cold
things, ſo being in Act and Power, that
they are made capable to deſtroy the
natural Heat; oft times by defluxion of
Humours, or venenate Puſtles, which
are left uncured; ſometimes out of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Drineſs; other times ariſing
out of the Interception of the vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rits,
and very often out of Obſtruction
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:43322:110"/>
in the beginning of the Nerves. And
ſince there is a Mortification and Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of life, and Deſtruction of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Heat,<note place="margin">The univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Cauſes both of Gangrene and Spha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celus.</note> let us conſider which way,
and out of what univerſal Cauſes this
may happen. Mans innate Heat cannot
be ſupported without a radical Moiſture,
and its Spirits juſtly and in their order
implanted in all the parts of his body;
ſo that conſequently upon hurting or
offering any injury to this radical Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
its Spirits alſo will be reſolved,
diſſipated and conſumed; and therefore
firſt there is an Intemperiety occaſioned
out of the vehement alteration of the
manifeſt Quality: Secondly out of the
occult Quality a malign and virulent
Subſtance is contracted in the Body:
and thirdly the Parts are thus mutually
affected with an Interception and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation
of the vital Spirits. As to the
firſt,<note place="margin">To the firſt:</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> doth obſerve and offer, that
every thing is kept, preſerved, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
by its natural Heat and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
ſo that nothing can alter or deſtroy
this ſooner than a contrary preternatural
Temper and Heat; thus a Gangrene doth
happen after a long and tedious continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of an Inflammation, made either
by Affluxion or Congeſtion of ſome ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary
or cholerick Humour, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:43322:111"/>
Humour being dried up by the
preternatural.<note place="margin">To the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</note> It may ariſe ſecondly, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from a concomitant Malignity ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
brought outwards to the Body, by
the biting of ſome venemous creature, or
by adhibiting of <hi>Septicks.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Signs of a Gangrene from a hot intemperie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> In a hot In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperiety
the Pain and Pulſation which
formerly were concerned with the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
is much more remiſs, and the
red Colour of the Inflammation doth
begin to change into a Lividneſs; here
alſo do ariſe Puſtules filled with an icho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Matter, theſe being all Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of its tending to Mortification; and
both Heat and Blood do perfectly run
to the Center, whilſt the other parts
thereof do ſuffer Putrefaction. It ariſing
from cold doth cauſe and make a great
and pricking Pain.<note place="margin">Signs of its coming from cold.</note> Soon after this it
changeth its red Colour into Lividneſs,
and maketh it moſt cold; afterwards
ſending the Blood away by its Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and diſpatching the native Heat,
and diſſipating its Spirits, doth make the
affected part perfectly void both of ſenſe
and motion, a horrour and trembling
attending it much like the fit of a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane
Ague. There is generally held five
Signs of a <hi>Sphacelus.</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:</note> Firſt, the affected
part is much more heavy and dull than
formerly it was. Secondly, the Floridneſs
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:43322:111"/>
and Redneſs of the part do turn into a
Lividneſs and Blackneſs. Thirdly, the
part which was ſoft in a Gangrene
groweth hard in a <hi>Sphacelus.</hi> Fourthly,
the Cutis being taken up is ſeen with
eaſe to ſeparate it ſelf from the Fleſh.
And laſtly, there is no exquiſite ſenſe or
perfection, but a perfect Mortification
remains. We are, if we intend to cure a
Gangrene aright, to ſtudy and find out
the Antecedent Cauſe thereof,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> and from
thence to take our firſt Intention,<note place="margin">1 From the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Cauſe.</note> as
thus; If it happen from a fiux of hot
and moiſt Humours, let the Patient's Diet
be cooling and drying for purging; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more proper here than Cholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogicks,
as <hi>Electuarium Diaprunum,
Diacatholicon, Lenitivum,</hi> Syrup of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and the like. Phlebotomy is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
alſo, to prevent the further
growth of Inflammation, for opening
the paſſages, and making a more free
Tranſpiration: but in all ſorts or kinds
of Gangrenes this is not to be uſed; For
in a Cholerick and bilious Humour we
are not to attempt it, Blood being as
the bridle to check and command this
Choler.<note place="margin">6 Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</note> In the caſe of applying of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical
Medicines obſerve theſe rules. The
firſt is taken from the Cauſe; for if the
afflux be cold and flegmatick, evacuate
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:43322:112"/>
more powerfully, and warm the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
with Defenſatives. The ſecond is
taken from the Age of your Patient;
for in a young body the Fleſh and all
its parts are ſoft and tender, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are you to order and preſcribe mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Medicines than to thoſe of a fuller
growth. A third ariſeth from the Sex;
a Child being to be treated with more
mildneſs and Gentleneſs than one of an
elder age, and a Woman more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dealt with than a Man. The fourth
is from the Strength of the Patient; for
you may powerfully exerciſe your ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
on ſuch as are of a good and
ſtrong conſtitution, whereas you are
more ſparingly and tenderly to uſe ſuch
perſons as are weak and ſickly. The
fifth ariſeth from the part affected; for
the Eye, Mouth, <hi>Pudenda, Anus, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebre,</hi>
and other ſuch ſenſible parts are
not to be dealt with, as you may deal
with an Arm or Legg. Sixthly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Diſeaſe is to be much mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and regarded: If it be new done,
and the Putredneſs not much,<note place="margin">A particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Cure of a Gangrene coming from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> nor made
any deep impreſſion, to ſcarrify the part
lightly, and to apply <hi>Aegyptiacum</hi> alone
is enough; If it be more powerful and
do threaten a Sphacelus, here is to be
made a deep Scarrification, and you are
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:43322:112"/>
to mix Spirit of Wine with <hi>Aegyptia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>
very hot and often: Theſe are

as did his Foot, he refuſed it, hoping
by other Remedies, and advantage of
good Medicines, to put a ſtop to its
increaſe, and to quell its fury; but theſe
were ſpent to no purpoſe: the Patient
being both of a Cacochymick Body, and
weak, and perceiving no help by theſe,
was willing to have his Arm taken of,

perfectly recovered and grew very

for this would onely ſubject it to

with making a croſs Inciſion, having
well prepared and purged her Head with
Cephalicks, as <hi>Extractum Rudii, Pillu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae

opened the Abſceſs, and diſcharged
the Matter, ablated the Ciſtus; and
this being removed, I perceived a ſmall
Capillary Veſſel upon the taking away
of the Bag to ſpin and ſpend its
Blood which ſtreamed out, the which I
ſpeedily ſtopped by the application of
ſome of his Majeſties Stiptick water,
which I applied to the part by dipping
a ſmall Pledget of Lint (the which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
my expectation) and ſo bound
it up: The Day following I dreſt her
again with Spirit of Wine, <hi>&amp; Elixar

perfectly cured; her large Abſceſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged;
her other ſmall ones, which
were ſix (the which I believe were fed
and nouriſhed by the ſame ſmall Arterial

at length vaniſhed. Coming to the ſame

how ſhe was, I found the reſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
were gone, which gave me ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of my conjecture: for upon the

their growth were hindred, but alſo a
perfect baniſhment procured of the

ſhe remaineth very well without any fear
of a new growth of the ſame.</p>

from too much Humidity of the

                  <note place="margin">Its Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                  <hi>definitionis</hi> is thus deſigned, as
being a collection of wateriſh Humours,
or feculent Blood in ſome parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
which doth force it ſelf up to the
Head. And here is a double meaning to be
explained; the one, whereas he calleth it
not only a collection of a Serous Humour,
but alſo of a feculent Blood, as when the
Head &amp; Cranium ſuffers an outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion
or Colliſion, and the Veins by this
Colliſion do ſprinkle their Blood between
the Cutis and Pericrane. This Blood here
thus putrifying doth make a moſt ſoft Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
and if a ſerous aquoſity were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
the which by dayly experience
may well be offered to happen, from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion
thus happening it may frame a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drocephalos.
<hi>Aetius lib. 6. cap.</hi> 1. will have
that a Hydrocephalos may be generated
from a Feculent or bloody Matter, the which
being changed into a thin ſubſtance. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
of Galens is, that a Hydrocephalos is
a collection of an aquous Humour in ſome
part of thoſe Bodies, which have a
forcing quality towards the Head; out of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:43322:128"/>
which it may be conjectured, that <hi>Galen</hi>
doth offer, that <hi>Hydrocephalos</hi> to be a
Diſeaſe of ſome part of the Head, not a
Dropſie of the whole Head; and this
is confirmed by <hi>Aetius</hi> and <hi>Paulus,</hi> who
treating of <hi>Hydrocephalos</hi> do allow four
ſpecies hereof: Firſt, when this Humour
getteth between the Brain and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes:
Secondly, when it lyes between
the Membranes and the Skull: A third
between the Bone and the Pericrane:
And Laſtly, when between the Pericrane
and the hairy Scalp.<note place="margin">Signs:</note> I have already
ſhown you part of its Signs; that it is
a Tumour ſoft in touch, whitiſh in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
indolent, turgid, much like a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
to other parts, eaſily yielding to
touch, and as ſpeedily filling up its
former made vacancy, the Finger being
removed. If it ariſeth from a Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
it doth appear firſt red, and doth
carry pain with it, as <hi>Aetius</hi> doth write;
but being afterwards changed into a
thin ſubſtance, it doth ſpread it ſelf
without pain. In thoſe where it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
between the Pericrane and Bone,
they anſwer plainly the reſt; for here
it is hard in Tumour, and very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
by reaſon of the diſtention of the
Pericrane; If it happeneth (as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it doth) between the Membrane
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43322:128"/>
of the Brain and the Skull, it will be a

nor ſoft to touch. Here it maketh the
Infant ſoon to give way to it, and to
yield up its Ghoſt.<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> Its Cauſes may be
ſaid to be ſometimes outward, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
inward. One of the outward may
be ſaid to be that which is mentioned
by <hi>Paulus</hi> in Children newly born, who
had their Heads but ill bound up by
their Midwives; Another is contuſion,
or colliſion, or ruption of one or many
Veſſels; Another cauſe is a cold Air,
or too much Water, or thinneſs of its
paſſages or Veſſels, out of which this
Serum or matter do recide, as <hi>Aetius</hi>
hath it; or alſo too cold or wateriſh
Milk, which it may ſuck from the Nurſe:
theſe may be ſaid to be the inward
Cauſes hereof, as when the Brain is too
much cooled, or the matter being here
firſt collected, and hence ſent to the Brain.
Every Hydrocephalos is very ſlow in

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:43322:129"/>
One in which this wateriſh Humour is

that is out of an abundant collection of
this ſerous matter in the Body: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
doth not contain the ſincere Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
but as it were a mixt feculent
Blood, the which doth eat it ſelf out of
the lacerated Veins, ariſing from Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or ſome other outward Cauſes. As
to its Preſage,<note place="margin">Preſage.</note> 
                  <hi>Paulus Aetius</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi>
do offer, that if this Humour be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
between the Brain and its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,
it is mortal; in other parts it
may admit Cure, by curing its Cauſes,
and removing its Effects. But here, as
well as in other parts of the Body, the
Rules of <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
every Diſeaſe is ſo much the
more dangerous, by how much it gets
into a greater bulk and bigneſs. As touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its Cure,<note place="margin">Cure.</note> we ſhall begin with that
which is extant between the Hairy Scalp
and Pericrane: And herewe are to obſerve,
that every Hydrocephalos is to be cured
by diſcharging of this wateriſh ſubſtance,
which is to be performed by purging
the whole, and cleanſing the affected
part. And with this we are to begin with
general Cephalick Purgings; in which
Caſe may be uſed theſe and the like for

the cold and moiſt Brain: and this is to be
performed by Inſenſible Evacuation, the
which I much better approve of than of
a ſenſible; becauſe it is neither ſo ſafe

               <p>I NOW proceed to Tumours of the

                  </gap>, and this is an affect of the Eye,
whoſe cauſe is as it were a concreted
glaſſy Humour gotten between the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea
and the Chryſtalline Humour, cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it and obſcuring its Species of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
ſometimes covering the whole Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil,
whilſt at other times it is ſeen only
to cloud but half thereof. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its more or leſs ſpreading, it doth
either in proceſs of time wholly aboliſh,
or partly diminiſh the ſight. And as <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi>
doth obſerve, it groweth in length
of time to the thickneſs and hardneſs of
an excocted Egg. It is oft times made
by a concretion of a Flegmatick Humour,<note place="margin">Cauſe.</note>
bred either between the Coats of the
Eye, or its Pannicles or Spots: It ariſeth
alſo from an influx of Humours; or is
occaſioned by ſome outward Action, as
a Blow, or Fall; or thick and fumid Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
ariſing from the Stomach, and ſo
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:43322:137"/>
getting into the ſubſtance of the Brain, are
from thence ſent and diffuſed into the

its concretion. It may ariſe alſo out of
weakneſs and cold. <hi>Celſus lib. 7. cap.</hi> 7.
ſaith, that there is a ſpace or diſtance
between the Cornea and the <hi>

in this empty ſpace, as he does imagine,
lodgeth this Cataract or Suffuſion, and
there takes its Origination. <hi>Paulus
lib. 6. cap.</hi> 21. ſaith, that a Suffuſion is
a Concretion of an idle or ſedentary Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in the Cornea near the Pupilla;
but this carrieth not ſo full a meaſure of
truth as the former. <hi>Galen 10. de uſu
partium cap. 1. &amp;</hi> 4. offereth that this
Humour doth grow between the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea

ab aqua pendente</hi> doth affirm, that in
the three perſons which he hath couched,

and therefore it is probable, as he
mentioneth, that behind the Foramen of
the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea</hi> this Humour ſhould conſiſt,
becauſe if it did grow in its Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
it could not be dilated. Where this

thin Membranes viſited with a ſtrange
Species of a thin clouded Pupil, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
coloured according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of Humours, as ſometimes with
white, or black, or blewiſh, yellow, red,
or green; and by theſe or any of theſe
the Eye is oft times clouded and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of its ſight. If it do poſseſs half
the Pupil, it takes away but half; but
when it creeps and overcaſts the whole,
it doth cauſe perfect blindneſs.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> Its
Cure is to be begun with a good order
of Dyet, and convenient Medicines, and
Inſtruments artificially preſcribed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied:
Abſtaining from Wine and ſuch
hot things, as may diſturb the Brain;
Shunning flegmatick Dyet, and ſuch as is
of a flatulent and pituitous Juice. If the
Patients Bread have ſome Fennel-ſeed
put into it, it will be ſo much the better;
for this is generally reputed not only to
help the ſight, but alſo is very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
for diſſipating of cloudy Vapours.
Bleeding, Purging, Frictions, are here
very uſeful; Maſticatories chewed in the
Mouth are proper; Cupping Glaſſes and
Veſicatories applied to the Neck and
Shoulders are here alſo very requiſite for
Derivation; Pills and Potions for purging
the Head of theſe flegmatick Tumours
are wonderfully helpful. For Purging

Mix theſe, and being made lukewarm let
the Patient waſh his Eye oft times in a
Day. it both attenuateth, diſſolveth,
and penetrateth. And theſe are the moſt
powerful intentions in this propoſed
ſcope. But if all theſe ſhould fail, and
this Cloud do ſtill encreaſe and grow
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:43322:139"/>
thicker, leave off the uſe of external Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
and let it grow until it be full
ripe for manual Operation, and this you
may gain by obſerving this Method;
the ſound Eye being ſhut, if the other be
well rubbed with the Finger, the Pupil
will preſently dilate, and diffuſe it ſelf,
and will very ſpeedily return into its
place, figure, colour, and State, and this
by ſome is reputed to be ripe enough
for manual Operation. Thoſe Cataracts
are by moſt Authors held to be incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
which do ariſe out of a ſharp and
tedious Diſeaſe, and having with them
great pains of the Head, or that which
cometh by a vehement blow or ſtroke;
ſuch as are black, green, livid, yellow,
or of a Quickſilver colour are hardly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
On the contrary, ſuch as have a
Cheſnut colour, or reſemble that of the
Sea with ſome White, are cured without
much difficulty. And ſince it is not ſuch
an eaſie Operation, but may and hath
puzled the beſt Oculiſt and moſt exact
profeſſor of this Art, conſider that this
Cure by couching is not always ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful:
But as it oft times happens well,
ſo alſo hath it its intervals of bad ſucceſs;
for by theſe the Grapy Coat is too much
diduced, ſometimes rent, whence follow
its amplification; or diſtorted, often after
<pb facs="tcp:43322:139"/>

this do follow inflammations and loſs of
ſight. Therefore how careful, faithful,
and diligent ought the manual Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
be, who undertakes this ſo curious an
Art, the only piece to be admired of all
Chirurgery? And here ought we to
conſider and underſtand the Coats,
Muſcles, and Humours of the Eye, ſo
that not one part of the Eye may be
injured by your operation: We ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to conſider and obſerve, how theſe
parts are connexed together, while we
move the Needle upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
And having given you this as a
Caution or monitory Introduction, I come
now to teach you the way of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Chirurgick Operation, a lively
Protraict of which here you may ſee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsed,
with all its neceſſary Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
Inſtruments belonging and apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
thereunto. Your Patient having
both his Body and Head well cleanſed,
and all other accidents which may yield
any appearance of obſtructing your O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
you are to remove, and then
bind up the contrary Eye, and place the
Patient to the beſt advantage, both for
his eaſe, and your better ſight, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
your Operation; and having your
Needles both ſharp and round pointed
ready fixed, and fitted for your uſe, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:43322:141"/>
your other Dreſſings fit to be applied,
then with an intrepidant Hand and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
Courage thruſt through your
Needle, ſo as that it may enter the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ata</hi>
in the middle, charging your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to turn the Eye towards his Noſe,
thruſting it near half a ſtrawes breadth
from the Iris into the Cornea; and
having got it ſafely in, you are to work
it unto the hollow of the Eye; and
when the Needle hath touched the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract
endeavour to preſs it gently with
the Cataract downwards, and this you
are to do ſo often until you ſee the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil
quite diſcharged of its Cloud, and
with that ſtrength as to keep it down,
that it may not riſe up again; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your Patient not to ſtir his Eye;
for if it ſticketh below, and returns not
again, you may be confident of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Cure. Then is the Needle to be
brought up again, not to be taken out
preſently. Upon which done, and your
Needle taken away, cloſe up the Eye
with all ſpeed, by applying to the Eye
ſome linnen Clothes dipt in Roſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the White of an Egg, and a little A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
mixed together, taking as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
that you beware of hurting
the Cryſtalline Humour, and the ſound
Coats in the Operation,<note place="margin">Obſerv:</note> and with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:43322:141"/>
Bolſters and Rollers compleat
the reſt of your Operation; after this
get your Patient to Bed, and order him
to ly high with his Head, from all
Noiſe; and let your work be done with
ſobriety and carefulneſs, acquitting your
ſelves of all Mountebank geſtures and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures.
Let his Diet be Barley water,
Ptyſans, Gellies, poached Eggs, and the
like: At the eight day you may remove
your Dreſſings, and then waſh the Eye
with Roſe water, being made lukewarm
before you apply it to the Eye; and for
ſome ſeaſon, order your Patient to wear
a piece of green Silk over his Eye, that
it may not have the full Air come to it,
but by degrees; and let this ſerve for your
couching Method. I ſhall conclude this
Chapter, wiſhing all ſucceſs to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Operator, leaving this alſo with him
to have in his remembrance, that it
is the Eye alone which is Mans greateſt
Guide in this World, and therefore let
Conſcience and Charity perſwade all Men
that tender any thing of good, not to
meddle with this Cure or way of curing,
unleſs he be well Skilled and exerciſed in
the Art, and underſtandeth the Parts and
Coats very well, leſt he comes off with
no more Credit than that Mountebank,
of whom <hi>Montanus Conſil.</hi> 81. writes

the Story, I will here give you as a juſt
example of impudence in theſe Locuſts.
A Perſon being troubled with an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pthalmy
in part of the Cornea of the
Eye againſt the Pupil,<note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> the which being
but very ſmall and ſcarce diſcernable, an
Emperick coming under pretence of
giving eaſe, applies an Apple which had
been roaſted on hot Embers thereunto,
and ordered to let it remain on until
the next Day; that Night the pain ceaſed,
and the Patient ſlept well; Upon which
the Mountebank began much to praiſe
his Skill, and himſelf with hopes of a
ſpeedy Cure; but taking off his rare Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
the Wateriſh Humour followed it,
which preceded the Cryſtalline, ſo that
contrary to his boaſting expectation, the
Patient was made blind in this Eye. A
Day will hardly ſuffice to reckon up
thoſe miſchiefs and injuries, which are
dayly done by theſe Quacks and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks.
A Woman of thirty years of Age
(as <hi>Riverius</hi> in his 100.<note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> Obſervations
writeth) having a confirmed Cataract, and
being for a whole year blind, recovered
her ſight, her Body being well purged and

Operation is made with ſafety and with
repute; for this Inſtrument doth appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
cut and draw forth the Polypus,
the which are the three chief intentions
in this Cure. And beſides theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
it keeps and defends all the other
parts of the Noſe in ſafety and harmleſs.
It apprehends and draws it out without
effuſion of Blood, for it neither cuts nor
divides no other Veins or Veſſels, than
ſuch as are ſpread or interwoven into
theſe Caruncles, of which this Polypus
is made. I ſhall, after I have preſented
you with its commodities, ſhew you the
exact Figure of this Inſtrument; it cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
ſuddenly, ſafely, without pain, and

danger. This Inſtrument doth perform
theſe Four Intentions, it apprehends,
cuts or ſeparates it, ſeparateth its reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,
and doth induce a Cicatrice. It
hath an edge to cut, and apprehends
like Forcipes, and therefore is to be made
like a pair of cutting Forcipes: It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
and draws forth like Forcipes:
it preſently ſeparateth the Polypus from
the Bone; and for the laſt we only blow
up reſtrictive Pouder: And thus have I
ſhown you its Four Intentions. It cuts
inward to prevent all trouble and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and it bringeth this commodity

in ſome place, and with eaſe
lay its firſt grounds and Foundations
of a Tumour. There is held a great
difference between Strumae and Scrophu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae;
and by Dr. <hi>Wharton</hi> in his Book <hi>De
glandulis,</hi> the one of theſe is called by him
Wenns, the other the Kings evil: Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phula
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43322:152"/>
ſignifying the firſt, and Struma
the latter: Scrophulae are ſoft, Wenns
hard: the firſt pale, carrying in them
the colour of the Skin, the ſecond ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a redneſs turning to lividneſs;
Scrophulae ſoft and not much penetrating,
Strumae immovable and deeply fixed:
the Kings-evil ſwellings generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
into a great bulk and magnitude;
and beſides their glandulous Fleſhes they
do carry in them ſeveral ſorts of Juices
in their little Bags, the which do help
much forward their growth and bulk.
It is credible that theſe concreted Juices
are as ſome rejected Excrements thrown
from the glandulous Fleſh in its nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for theſe Glandules have no excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Veſſels, and therefore neceſſarily they
ſhould carry their Excrements in their
Bags: And this is one reaſon of their
growth. Secondly, the Blood effuſed
from hence through the Arteries is more
plentiful, than that which is reduced
through the Veins; and hence therefore
may there ariſe another reaſon of its
growth. Thirdly, The Nerve which
keepeth here is but ſmall, and that
makes them ſo dull; and hence is it that,
were the parts pricked with Needles,
the Patient would not much complain of
pain. Now as touching Strumaes, theſe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:43322:152"/>
are not always ſeen to run into a bulk
or magnitude,<note place="margin">Deſcript<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And by how much the Veins are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
capacitated and enabled to convey
and carry off that which is ſent them
from the Arteries, by ſo much alſo are
theſe Strumatous Tumours leſs capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of running into bulk, than ſuch as are
Scrophulated. And how theſe Tumours
are tranſlated from one place into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I attribute chiefly to the Nerves in
their Operations, theſe being moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Meſſengers to carry to and fro. Now
if there be any matter carried to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctuory
Veſſels or Glandules, and be
there excerned, the Struma doth ſoon
leſſen, and ſometimes doth wholly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,

terrifying young Children, whilſt others

doth happen the firſt day. There is no
Squinancy with ſafety, and the leſſer the
Tumour, the greater the danger: and
<hi>Hippocrates lib. 4. Aphor.</hi> 34, 35. ſaith, if
the Humour of the Angina be carried to
the Lungs, it maketh its exition before

the ſeventh day; otherwiſe the Patient
grows in danger of Suffocation. And if it
hath made its efflux without leaving any

help towards the Concoction of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle

theſe with much eaſe do contract Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which is the great Agent in Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

And as a moſt certain Sign it

lodging between the Ribs and the Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour

When you make your Section, let
it be between the fourth and fifth Rib,

and by this Method may you prevent all
fears of injuring Nerve, Vein, or Artery.
Make neither Inciſions, nor apply any
Cauſticks right downward, but according

                  <hi>obſevat. 79. centur.</hi> 1. of a
young man about 20 years of age, who
fell into a pleuriſie, ſo painful that he
could not lie on either ſide of his Bed, but
onely walk upwards. Many Remedies
were preſcribed in the Conſultation of
three phyſicians, and the patient was let
blood above ten times; yet the Affect
perſevered. Although the pain of the
Side ſometimes ſeemed to ceaſe, yet both
his pain returned and a Fever with it.
This Fever continued to the five and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
day, then the Side began to ſwell,
and proved painful to the Touch, ſuffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with redneſs; it was judged a pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
turned into an Empyema; and for
this reaſon ſuppurating Cataplaſms were
ordered, by which the Tumour might
encreaſe its bulk, and the peccant Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
endeavour to diſcharge it ſelf. But
the opening of this Side being procraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
too much, the Abſceſs broke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and the Patient did ſpit out ſome
of this Matter with eaſe by coughing,
which appeared very laudable, and not at
all fetid; and this he did for many days
in a great quantity. After the Abſceſs
brake outwardly, it was with eaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into either Side, becauſe he found
and felt a great pain in the pained Side:
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:43322:166"/>
which thing is noted by <hi>Hippocrates in
Prognostic.</hi> Having paſt the eighth day
of its running, this purulent Excretion
ceaſed, and he onely vomited up Flegm:
then he perceived the pain again in the
ſame Side, ſo as it turned not to the
ſound: then was conjectured that there
was a new Collection of Matter in the
Side, and he being prepared for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of the ſame, the Empyema was
opened by a Cauſtick being laid on the
Side, and Matter for a long while came
from the Side, and at length the Patient
perfectly recovered.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of a Tumour of the Diaphragma.</head>
               <p>THE Diaphragma hath two ſorts
of Tumours belonging to it, and
either of them do bring the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in danger of death; the one long, the
other ſhort: for by the Excrements for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
here they may make a Tumour both
with or without a Fever. If without a
Fever, from the beginning pain and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of breathing, a ſmall and a hard
Pulſe, and theſe Excrements we are to
allow to be thin and crude, and thence do
follow a Tenſion of the Bowels, becauſe
the Muſcles are extended to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma.
And if a Fever be joyned to
theſe Tumours, Experience does ſatisfie, it
is not ſharp; and it ariſeth from the too
long contention of Excrements in the
part affected. An Inflammation of the
Diaphragma beginning, there neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
does follow a Fever; and in reſpect of
the Affect, becauſe the Tumour is made
of hot matters, and in relation to the part
affected by reaſon of its near bordering
upon the Heart, there do generally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from this Inflammation, Pain, and
Difficulty of Breathing: and therefore,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:43322:167"/>
as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, Breathing here in this
caſe is ſmall and frequent, <hi>(lib. 5. de loc.
affect.)</hi> ſometimes Convulſions do ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
theſe Inflammations. When ſuch a
Tumour of the Diaphragma is offered to
you for cure, let your firſt Intention be to
diſcharge the Matter or Subſtance that is
lodged. And becauſe the Origination of
this does generally ariſe from Fluxion,
this alſo is to be prohibited, and this is
done by diſcharging the fluent Matter.
If you take them in the beginning, they
may give ſome hopes of Cure: but if
they be of any long continuance, they
admit of no Cure; becauſe they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hurry the Patient into a Conſumption,
and will not be taken hold of by the beſt
of Medicines.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> As to the Cure, the firſt
Intention is to diſcharge this Matter by
well purging and clearing the Body of its
Excrements: and here ſuch things are
moſt proper as can diſcharge both Flegm
and Water; ſuch as is Elaterium, Radix
Sambucinus, or the like. Phlebotomy is
no ways proper here; for the peccant Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is cold, and therefore Diſcuſſives are
here moſt convenient. And theſe may
be ſaid to be of two ſorts; ſome to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred
inwardly, whileſt others are
outwardly to be applied: and theſe ought
to be both emollient and relaxing, as
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:43322:168"/>
Butter, Fats, Marrows, and the like;
and theſe are to be ordered accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Humour and the Strength
of the patient; firſt beginning with milde
Medicines, and then proceeding with
ſuch as are ſtronger, as Oyl of Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile,
Dill, and the like. Here alſo you
may uſe Emplaſters and Unguents, as of
Mallows, Marſhmallows, Lilies, with
Linſeed, Fenugreek ſeed, &amp;c. preſerving
and deſending the inward parts with
ſuch things as can diſcuſs, as Treacle,
Methridate,<note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> Sarſaperilla, &amp;c. I once ſaw
in a Gentleman a Tumour bred in the
Diaphragma out of crude and thin blood,
in which pain and difficulty of Breathing,
a hard and ſmall pulſe were preſent, the
Matter and Humour was cold, and tough,
and crude, and this ſhewed it Mortal, for
it brought him into a Conſumption, and
the Abſceſs breaking he did ſpit up Blood
and much indigeſted Matter. Theſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
although they are bred of a thin
and cold Matter, yet in the place affected
they thicken; and for the performance
of this there is required pain, difficulty
of Breathing, a hard and a ſmall pulſe,
little or nothing changing it ſelf, no
apparent Tumour ſhewing it ſelf: and if
to theſe Tumours a Fever do joyn it ſelf,
as Experience does oft times ſhew it doth,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:43322:168"/>
it is not ſharp, yet they bring Death with
them; and when they perſevere, and are
not reſolved, they bring the patient into
a Conſumption, and ſo lay him even with
the duſt, as it did the aforeſaid Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

Imbecillity of the Teſticles does give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
great ſuſpicion hereof. Another
Cauſe amongſt ſome is attributed to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition
with a Menſtruous Woman. Oft
times it happens by overſtraining the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts; a thing very frequent in ſnch
who being in their Drunken fits do act
beyond their power of Reaſon. If the
Seed therefore which is thus thrown
forth be pure, and is not in any reſpect
tinged with any ſtrange quality, and is
void of all fetid ſmell, this either does
ſhew and expreſs a plenty thereof, or a
weakneſs of the Retentive Faculty, or
Convulſion of the Spermatick Veſſels.
But if it be accompanied with any other

yieldeth a ſmell which ſheweth no good

and invadingly ulcerateth. And
this Ulcer does much differ from that
which exerciſeth it ſelf in the Bladder,
and thus may with eaſe be diſtinguiſhed:
where the Neck of the Bladder is ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the <hi>pus</hi> or Matter does as it were
compactly precede the Urine it ſelf; and
the pain between making water is moſt
mightily ſharp about the ulcerated part.
On the contrary, the Bladder it ſelf being
ulcerated, there is no pain felt, nor Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
piſſed forth, ſecreted by the Urine,
but cometh along with it. The Urine
does yield a ſtrange ſtrong ſmell where
the Bladder is affected with an Ulcer.
When the Urinary paſſage is ulcerated,
the Yard is very painful and heavy, and
bendeth downwards. An U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

ſelf into preternatural Caruncles, by
which the Urinary paſſage is obſtructed:
For as out of moſt pure Blood the beſt

the Ulcers, there is oft times ſeen a ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious

Fleſh to grow and breed. And
therefore when we have arrived at the

which we may ſpeedily find out by

               <p>WE arrive now to Herniaes or
Ruptures, the which for the
moſt part do dwell on the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogaſtrick
Region. And whereas other
Humours have allowed them three
Cauſes, as being bred either out of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux
of Humours, or Decumbency of
Parts, or Congeſtion: All theſe have their
lively Forms and Shapes in the Tumours
of the Teſticles; for Tumours are made
here either by Humours flowing, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations,
Eryſipelaes, Oedema, and
Scirrhus; or from the Decumbent Parts;
or from Congeſtion, as from Water, or
any other Humour. Theſe kind of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
are better and oftner cured by
Chirurgery than Pharmacy. And as they
are various in their Places, divers in
Shapes, and manifold in Forms; ſo do
theſe, and every of them, make various
Intentions and Indications for the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.
And that every thing may fall
ſucceſſive to the wiſh both of Practiſer
and Patient, in this place it will be very
proper to know well and underſtand the
Parts framing the Teſticles, they being

as the chief Cauſes and Effects of moſt of
theſe Ruptures. <hi>Celſus lib. 7. cap.</hi> 28.
does account the Teſticles to be Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Bodies, wrapt about and twiſted with
various Veſſels, Coats, and Ligaments.
By the Greeks they are called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,

Authors and Workmen of the Seed; for
they have allowed them a vernaculate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty

Matter from all the parts of the
Body. The Coats of the Teſticles are
four, the firſt called <hi>Epididymis,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

we <hi>Bubonocele</hi> repreſent <hi>Hernia Ingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis,</hi>

There are many Differences of either, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Diſcriminancy of the
Conjunct Cauſes and Tumefying Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
Of <hi>Bubonocele</hi> are onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

affirms it an Inteſtinal Rupture of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen</hi>
onely or ſimply, that is, when the
Inteſtine does not deſcend any further:
by the Greeks called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And
here the large Veins which are in the
Groin may ſo ſwell, and prove ſo vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous,
that they may create a Rupture
here, ſo as this proves a Chirurgical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
But before I proceed any further
in this Chapter, be pleaſed to conſider
thoſe many Errors, which are committed
by unskilful Chirurgeons, who very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
do take Venereal Buboes for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinal
Ruptures, and ſo do cut for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
without either Wit or Honeſty, or
elſe do prejudice to the great Vein there
ordered by Nature, and thereby bring
danger of death. But that you may the
better underſtand the difference, conſider
with me, that if you perceive a ſoft Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in the <hi>Inguen,</hi> from the beginning
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:43322:177"/>
you may well ſuſpect a Dilation being
made by the Inteſtine; a Bubo in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
being hard, eſpecially being Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal.
It being a Rupture, if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
lie on his back, the Inteſtine falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
with eaſe, and the Tumour does
vaniſh; and upon the Patients riſing it
returns with as much eaſe: In a Bubo
there is always a contained Tumour.
But arriving to the matter of our preſent
Diſcourſe, a Bubonocele does moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
gain the name of being the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of an Inteſtinal Rupture more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
than the name of a Rupture; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine
firſt making its fall through the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi>
before it enters the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> and ſo
does neceſſarily dilate it: And therefore
<hi>Paulus</hi> ſaith, that the Inteſtinal Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>Inguen</hi> does precede a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
elſewhere; for if the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi>
be made intenſe in its lower part by
Wind, or any other cauſe, and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
makes its turgid way thither, being
alſo filled with Wind; or by being filled
with Excrements, and thereby forceth it
ſelf, it makes this <hi>Bubonocele;</hi> the which
by <hi>Paulus</hi> requireth a double method
of Cure, the one being to be performed
by Inciſion, the other by Uſtion. The
firſt of theſe by <hi>Paulus</hi> is thus perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
He cuts upon the tume<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ied place in a
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:43322:178"/>
ſtreight line the length of three tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Fingers, and ſo paſſeth through the
<hi>Membrana carnoſa,</hi> and then makes ſo
deep an Inciſion, untill he finds the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonaeum</hi>
bare, and the Fat alſo being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
and removed. <hi>Celſus</hi> will have this
done with courage, and the Inciſion to be
made to the middle Coat, which maketh
the <hi>Vagina;</hi> afterwards he with a Probe
does depreſs the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> and ſo as
that the Inteſtine be compelled inwards;
and having lodged his Probe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
the <hi>Peritonaeum,</hi> he by Sutures
does draw the lips of the Wound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the which being done, he takes
out the Probe, and cures the remain as
you do ſimple Wounds. This is <hi>Paulus</hi>
Method, which is performed by Suture,
binding up only the <hi>Cutis,</hi> as by Aſtriction.
The ſecond of his, which is performed by
Uſtion, is both cruel, painful, and terrible,
contracting the <hi>Cutis</hi> by the ſtrength and
force of the Fire, and making a contracted
and hard Ciccatrice, and by this means do
depreſs the Tumour, and will not ſuffer
the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> to lift it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
But leaving theſe, a well made
Truſs is much better, performeth its buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with more eaſe, gentleneſs, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;
this having in it the faculty
of prohibiting the ſoft Tumour, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:43322:178"/>
the Diſtention of the <hi>Peritonae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
and hindering the Impetuoſity of the
Inteſtine: to which Truſs we uſually ſix
a Quilt or ſmall pyramidal Pillow, it
ſometimes being made in form of a Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Leaf: and after the Reduction this
being ſown to the Truſs is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the part affected. In ſome caſes
here this may not be convenient; as
ſhould there happen a Varix in the Groin,
and the Veins tumeſie, the Veins by this
being compreſſed by the tying of both
its ends up; and if the preparing Veſſels
be varicoſed, if they be bound up, the
Generation of the Seed would be hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And therefore in this caſe Reſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Medicines are more proper, as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauſtians,
Cypreſs Nuts, Lignum vitae,
Galls, Pomgranate Rinds, Red Roſes,

               <p>BEfore I proceed to the Cure of a
perfect Inteſtinal Rupture, I ſhall
begin with that which hath the
<hi>Peritonaeum</hi> relaxed or dilated. The
Inteſtine does deſcend, either becauſe this
Coat is either dilated or rent. The Signs of
a Dilation are, becauſe the Inteſtine does
not ſuddenly deſcend, but does remain in
the Orifice; then it does not deſcend to
the bottom of the Teſticle, the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
is equal and profound. The Signs
of its Coat being rent are, a ſudden De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
of the Inteſtine, an unequal Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
a ſpeedy Relapſe of it into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Teſticle. <hi>Celſus cap. 14. lib.</hi>
does offer theſe as Signs of an Inteſtinal
Rupture; the Tumour ſometimes encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
ſometimes leſſening; encreaſing, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe a greater part of the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
falls down, or becauſe it is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted
than it ought, ſometimes by Wind,
ſometimes by Excrement. If the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
do encreaſe, becauſe the Excrements
are fallen into the Inteſtine, then
Scarſe it is to be expected to be drawn
forth again; then is there pain in the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:43322:180"/>
                  <hi>Scrotum, Inguen,</hi> and <hi>Abdomen;</hi> becauſe
here is made a ſolution of Continuity,
whereby the Stomach is affected, and
thereby throws forth Choler, afterwards
green or black, then Excrement, and after
theſe follows an inflammation of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles.
A ſecond Sign, the Tumour is
not painful, ſometimes it wholly vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and being compreſſed it with eaſe
returneth into the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and with as
much eaſe falls out again with ſome
noiſe, the Tumour being light, lubricous,
and round. Moſt times the <hi>Ileon</hi> falls
down, yet ſometimes the other Guts
come out with it, and do fall into the
<hi>Scrotum.</hi> But this happeneth not by a
ſimple Diſtention of the Peritoneal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
but it muſt neceſſarily burſt in all
great Ruptures. This oft times happens
in Children by falling, leaping, vomiting,
coughing, any vehement motion, crying,
concuſſion, or the like. The <hi>Duodenum</hi>
and <hi>Rectum</hi> cannot fall into the <hi>Scrotum,</hi>
this Anatomy ſufficiently maketh good.
The <hi>Jejunum</hi> is tied by the Liver by the
Meſeraick Veins, and the <hi>Colon</hi> knit to
the upper parts; and here is no Rupture
without diviſion of theſe. The <hi>Caecum,</hi>
becauſe it is ſlippery in the right ſide, and
ſeparates from the reſt, does eaſily fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the right ſide of the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritonaeum</hi>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:43322:180"/>
being either rent or dilated;
and this <hi>Galen</hi> alloweth <hi>Com. ad Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm.</hi>

double <hi>Enterocele,</hi> one of the <hi>Caecum,</hi>
another of the <hi>Ileon.</hi> This of the <hi>Ileon</hi> is
the moſt dangerous and terrible, becauſe
by this is intercepted the diſtribution
both of the Chyle and Nutriment, and
the ſecretion of the Excrement, which is
the neceſſary office of the <hi>Ileon</hi> as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preſervation of Life: beſides this an
intolerable pain is excited, and is oft
times inflamed, whence follows a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene,
into whoſe ſympathy of affection
are all the reſt of its neighbouring parts
drawn. Here is alſo made the <hi>Iliaca

Now as touching Dilatation according to

a reduction of the Inteſtine upwards into
the <hi>Abdomen</hi> or Belly, the ſecond pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
its coming forth again. The
firſt is eaſily reſolved, if the Inteſtine do
not much fall out, or it be not ſwelled
with Wind, or filled with Excrements,
for then it may with eaſe be driven in by
the Fingers, laying your Patient on his
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:43322:181"/>
Back, with his Legs ſomewhat elevated,
and a little aſunder: but if it be filled
with Excrements or Wind, then are we
to uſe another Method, by uſing of hot

if theſe fail,<note place="margin">A ſecond Method by Aduſtion.</note> and will not anſwer expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Avicen</hi> adviſeth us to uſe a ſecond
Method, which is performed by Aduſtion,
making a ſtrong impreſſion by the hot In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument,
which may hereby contract the
<hi>Cutis,</hi> and alſo hinder the deſcent of the
Inteſtine. But in this Operation take
ſpecial care of not touching the Inteſtine
with the Iron; for ſhould this happen, it
would or might bring danger of Death to
your Patient. This is to be performed
by many ſmall pungent red hot Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
keeping alſo all the Seminary Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
ſafe and ſecure from injury, the which
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:43322:185"/>
being any ways hurt, the Generation of
Seed would conſequently be impedited.
Some of theſe ſhould be ſemicircular,
whileſt others ought to be more pungent,
having a very ſharp point, ever beginning
the Uſtion from the upper part, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
through the whole Region of
the Rupture.<note place="margin">A third Method is Inciſion.</note> A third Method is Inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and this is two fold, the one perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Chirurgeon, of which we will
firſt treat; the other of an Emperick:
the firſt Cure being performed without
extraction of the Stones, the ſecond with
it. In the firſt let the Patient ſtand and
hold his Wind, that the Tumour may
more evidently appear; and when you
intend the Operation, you are firſt to
mark the place, with Ink where you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to open or inciſe, then are you to
make your Inciſion through the length of
the whole dilated Vaginal Coat, the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina
being elevated either with the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or ſmall Hooks, then with an Inciſion
Knife you are to make a Diametrical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
both to the Membranes and Vagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Coat rent or dilated, then with a firm,
thick, and crooked Needle, you are to
make a Suture according to the length of
the whole Dilatation in the dilated Vagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
drawing a thick and ſtrong Thred (the
inward Veſſels of the Seed inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:43322:185"/>
ſafe and entire) through, the
Coat is to be agglutinated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
extraction or hurting of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticles;
then let the Patient be put to
Bed, and after this apply ſuch things as
are agglutinative, then induce a Cicatrice,
and keep your Patient well truſſed.<note place="margin">The fourth Method.</note> The
fourth and laſt Method is performed the
Emperical manner, and this is with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of the Teſticle, a way very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and dangerous. It is thus repeated
by <hi>Paulus, cap. 65. lib.</hi> 6. The Patient
being placed with his Head downwards,
the Inteſtine being reduced, part of the
<hi>Abdomen</hi> being compreſſed by an Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
and the Patient being bound make
an oblique mark in his Groin, after this
make a deep Inciſion, ſo that the Teſticle
may come forth with the Spermatick
Veſſels, the which the Chirurgeon having
in his hands, let him ſeparate all the
Coats, and draw forth the Teſticle
through the ſame Orifice, all the other
parts being taken aſide with ſmall Hooks,
let them be ſown together or tied, after
this above the place tied take them off,
and with an hot cauterizing Iron being
there inſtantly ready, cauterize the
mouths of the Veſſels, hereby hindering
all Flux; beſides which you will find the
parts ſooner agglutinated: the which
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:43322:186"/>
being done, they leave a long Thred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
applying Digeſtions inwardly.
After this they make a Cavity in the
<hi>Scrotum,</hi> and there applying a Digeſtive,
they uſe Butter, to which they adde
Frankincenſe, the Yolk of an Egge, and a
little Turpentine; then they ſtudy the
generation of Fleſh with <hi>Baſilicon, Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum de Betonica,</hi> or the like,
and induce a Cicatrice with dried Lints

then pain was preſent, ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
very vehement, otherwhile more

can be ſeldom reduced into the
Belly; or if they might be, they are not
there retained without great difficulty;
they produce wonderful troubles to the
Patients that are therewith vexed, when
they by reaſon of the weight do draw
their upper parts downwards. For this
purpoſe he hath invented a new Bag, by

poſſibly be drawn upwards, and ſo eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the grieved Patient may bear
the burthen with much leſs trouble and

the ſubſiſtance of the Teſticle in proceſs
of time is alſo corrupted by its acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
By <hi>Aetius Leonidas</hi> this Aqueous
Tumour is ſaid to be looſe, and without
pain, the which is not to be eaſed by any
Cataplaſms, Fomentations, Emplaſters, or
Unguents. There's one onely Remedy

and apparent, becauſe the Seminal
Vein of this part ariſeth not from the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>

The Kidney being by this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy
affected, not performing its proper

the Emulgent protracts to it ſelf, whenas
it cannot deſcend to the Bladder from the

                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> The Cauſes hereof may be
many, ſome being occult, others mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt;
occult, as this wateriſh Humour being
gathered from the repleted Veſſels. <hi>Guido</hi>
adds a Vice of the Liver herein or Spleen,
by reaſon of which there is a Liquor col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
in the <hi>Hypocondries,</hi> which with
eaſe does make its deſcent manifeſt, as
Percuſſion, Colliſion, Fraction of Veſſels
which are in the Teſticles; for the Blood
which flows into the Veſſels is changed
and turned, by reaſon of the weakneſs of
parts, into an aqueous ſubſtance. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion
and Colliſion,<note place="margin">Signs.</note> and the like, are its
Signs; the Tumour vaniſheth if Hunger
hath preceded. If the Habit of the Body
be ill, this <hi>Hernia</hi> proceeds from the ill

may from too much Liquor, for Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made by too much Potation. <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
taketh the Cauſes from the Humour
it ſelf, the which if it be yellowiſh and
pale, the <hi>Hernia</hi> will appear from the
Repletion of the Veſſels; if feculent, from
Percuſſion; if white, from a Vice of the
Liver or Spleen; the Veins of the <hi>Scro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>

the Humour floweth into the Veſſels
which formerly were empty. It ſhineth
and appears very bright, and is ſoft, light,
and clear, by viewing it, and applying a
Candle on the oppoſite part. It is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Dropſie; and as a general Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
is bred by a collection of Matter, as in
a Critical Abſceſs, by drinking more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Water than can be diſcharged by
Vomit, by Generation, by interception,
or alleviation of a Sanguiſick Faculty. So
a <hi>Hernia aquoſa &amp; flatuoſa</hi> do either come
by a primogene affection, or by ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

ſomewhat ſeparated; and becauſe the

this in the lower part of the Ligature the

by degrees was drawn forth ſome pounds
of Water, after which was applied a Pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

               <p>THis is a Tumour <hi>contra naturam,</hi>

oft times <hi>Varices</hi> accompany the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and theſe are very troubleſom; and
theſe Humours being thick and viſcid,
bred from Flegm and Melancholy, as they
breed Scirrhous Tumours in other parts,
ſo alſo do they generate a hardneſs in
theſe.<note place="margin">Signs.</note> It is known by its Hardneſs, Aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Inequality, and Indolency. It ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
from Melancholy, it having a ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid

                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:43322:197"/>
If it ariſeth from burnt Melancholy,
it hath a pricking pain, and the Tumour
is inequal, in ſome places ſoft, in others
hard. If the Tumour be not confirmed,
cure it as you do a <hi>Scirrhus,</hi> by uſing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mollients,
then Diſcuſſives; but the laſt
ſeldom does any good here. But if theſe
fail, you are to come to Section; but if it
be Cancerous attempt nothing. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiolus</hi>
affirmeth, that he hath abſumed
a <hi>Sarcocele</hi> by the onely uſing of <hi>Pulvis
Radicis Anonidis</hi> being taken for many
moneths. But if it yields not to Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
Inciſion is the next remedy; and
this way or method is not void of danger,
the Teſticle being either left in or taken
out. And by the way we are to conſider,
that if any fleſhy ſubſtance grows about
the Coats or Teſticles, this is wholly and
abſolutely to be taken away in this caſe
for more ſafety; the Veſſels are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be drawn out and tied, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
inciſed and cauterized: for to leave
any part hereof, does more repreſent the
ignorance of a Quack, than know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of an Artiſt; for no Son of Art will
give the advantage of a new growth,
whenas he may well prevent any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of the ſame by a careful mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of his Operation, and taking care of
preventing all accidents; for a ſmall
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:43322:198"/>
quantity, but left remaining, will ſoon run
up (like a rank Weed) to a great bulk,
and this in a ſhort time grows worſe and
worſe. If the Tumour be not very hard,
the Chirurgion comprehending the
whole Tumour, that is the whole tumefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Subſtance in the Teſticle, every way
encompaſſing it, let him make his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
even to the Tumour above the
<hi>Scrotum;</hi> then abduce the Teſticle from
the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> drawing a ſtrong Needle
and Thread through the middle Proceſs
above the Region of the tumefied Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and then drawing it back again
through the ſame part of the Proceſs;
then tie both of them; theſe being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
cut off the whole Proceſs, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticle
being concluded with it. It being
ablated, apply a Repercuſſive Medicine,
and ſtrengthen the neighbouring parts
with convenient rollings and bolſterings,
and heal up your Ulcer as you do others.
<hi>Fabritius Hildanus</hi> tells a very pleaſant

Upon which a pain ſeized on his Groin,

<hi>Varices:</hi> and theſe (as <hi>Celſus</hi> and <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>

if the Rupture be in the <hi>Scrotum,</hi> you are
to apply thin and ſharp Inſtruments to
the Veins, and with theſe the Veins are to
be cauterized, and there to be moſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized
where moſt variced or twiſted.
The general Curative Method here is the
ſame to that preſcribed in curing of a
<hi>Scirrhus;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Intentions.</note> the Intentions here are three,
to repell the flowing Humour, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
and dry up that which hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſlowed, and to aſtringe the dilated Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.
Now Aſtringents do ſatisfie theſe
two ſcopes; for as being cold and reſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
they repell the fluent Humour; as
being drying, they dry it up; and by its
Aſtriction do alſo bind up the dilated Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.
And for this Affect, Balauſtians, Red
Roſes, Pomgranate Rinds, Juice of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocyſtus,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:43322:199"/>
Bol. Armen. Dragons Blood,
Maſtich, Olibanum, Glue, Amber, and
the like; theſe, or any, or ſome of theſe
mixed with the White of an Egge and a
little Vinegar, may very well be uſed
here: but if theſe do no good, come to
the uſe of Inciſion or Cauſtick, and here
are we to be very careful in onely caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
the parts where they are thus
twined or twiſted together; after which
done remove the Eſchar, then deterge and
digeſt it. But if the Veins of the <hi>Dartos</hi>
be tumefied, you are to make your Inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Groin, and the Membrane is to
be drawn through there with the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and after this ſeparate the dilated
Veſſels from the Coat either with your
Fingers or a convenient Inſtrument; then
tie up the Veſſels, and cut them off under
your Ligature; then repoſe or reduce
your Coat and Teſticle. And if the Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be in the <hi>Erythrois</hi> or <hi>Tunica vagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis,</hi>
and either two be dilated, proceed
in the ſame Method as in the <hi>Dartos;</hi>
but if it be between the inward Coat and
the Teſticle it ſelf, make your Inciſion in
the <hi>Inguen,</hi> draw out the Veſſels, ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Teſticle, and cauterize the parts.
And this is <hi>Paulus</hi> his Method and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.
As touching <hi>Hernia Humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis,</hi>
take this brief Deſcription of it:
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:43322:200"/>
It is framed out of a Confuſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

               <p>WE arrive now at the Inguens,
where we may meet with theſe
four following Tumours, <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo
Venereus, Peſtiferus, Phyma, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gethlon;</hi>
of each of theſe in their order.
Theſe Glandules have their proper names
as well as others, and hence is it that
they are called <hi>Bubones,</hi> by us in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
called the Popes eye, in veal and
mutton. They are held to be eight in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and very large. There is held to be a
great commerce between the Nerves
and theſe Glandules: for it is very credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the Nerves do conveigh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
hither, as their excrementitious
<hi>ſuccus,</hi> and alſo do ſend hither any ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veous
quality that at any time doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
them; but they do not unload them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into theſe as into their excretory
ports, but into their adjoyning veſſels; and
hence it is that they are placed at the
greater diviſion of the veſſels: neither is
it leſs probable, that they take ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
from hence as a nutritive juice,
the which being allured by a ſimilar at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
of the Glandulous ſubſtance, the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:43322:201"/>
Lymphaducts to pour out their <hi>Lympha</hi>
here, and by the benefit hereof theſe
Glandules do ſeparate one and leave the
other: And this is confirmed by their
ſweetnes and delicacy, they having a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
with the nutrive Succus. And the
reaſon they are ſo large and numerous is,
becauſe the Crural Nerves had need to
have ſuch large Organes for diſcharging
their ſuperfluities. We come now to their
Diſeaſes with the Affects; theſe being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſimple or not malign Tumours, or
peſtilential or venereal Tumours. The
Cauſes of all which may be reduced to
two. The firſt being the hindrance of
the Circulation of the Blood, and hence
ariſeth a Tumour by reaſon of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
and impetuous afflux of the Blood
from the heart through the Arteries, and
by reaſon of its making no reflux from
theſe through the Veins: An evident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
we have hereof in Contuſions of
the Glandules and in their Obſtructions.
A ſecond common Cauſe ariſeth general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the Nerves themſelves, ſpitting
forth their ſuperfluous Humidities being
either here vitious in Quantity or Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
now theſe are 2 common cauſes. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſpecial Tumour hath its ſpecifick cauſes
&amp; differences: and thus if theſe ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
only err in quantity or quality, as in
viſcidity, thicknes, or the like, it frameth a
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:43322:201"/>
ſimple Tumour: If from a malign quality,
there ariſeth a Tumour being of the ſame
nature (as malign;) and thus being either
venereal or peſtilential it occaſioneth a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal
or peſtilential Tumour.<note place="margin">Cauſes.</note> We are now
to enquire of the efficient cauſes of this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nreal
<hi>Bubo:</hi> and this poyſon oftimes is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the Liver, and hence is ſent
into the Inguens, as its proper Emunctuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and hence ariſeth theſe venereal Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes.
The cheif matter of which they are
bred is of a part of thick, cold and viſcid
Humours, which may wel be perceived by
the hardnes, whitenes, ilnes of pain, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the Tumour. Sometimes they ariſe
from a hot, ſharp, &amp; cholerick Humour
with a great pain, and a conjunct heat, and
theſe make them ſo oft to run into Ulcers,
being both virulent &amp; corroding.<note place="margin">Cure.</note> As to the
cure, never-uſe digeſtives, leſt the thinner
part being reſolved, the thicker excrement
lyes and encreaſeth inwards; much leſs
Repellers, for theſe do drive the virulent
matter inward; and therefore Attractives
and Suppuratives here only do take beſt
place. The Tumour being made ripe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
it with a potential Cautery. As
touching the cure of the whole body,
neither purge, bleed, or keep any order
of dyet. Make your orifice not very large,
but ſo as you may lodge in it a pretty
handſome large Tent for diſcharge of this
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:43322:202"/>
peccant Matter, you may keep it open for
20 or 30 dayes according to the greater
or leſſer quantity of Matter. This being
diſcharged, we may both preſcribe purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
bleeding, and a good order of dyet. It
being diſcharged, cleanſe it well, fill up
with fleſh, and ſkin it. And thus may
you cure the kinder ſort of a Venereal
<hi>Bubo:</hi> but if it proves more rebellious,
then inſtead of Suppurating Medicines
we ſhould come to the uſe of Cupping
Glaſſes every other day, and after theſe
to apply Diachylon <hi>cum gummi</hi> mixed
with black Soap, and theſe will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turate
the moſt rebellious Buboes; and
having brought it thus, deterge the Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
by keeping it a long while open,
and freed of its peccant Matter; then fill
up with fleſh,<note place="margin">Hiſt.</note> and ſkin it. <hi>Hildanus</hi> tels
us of one, who in an impure coition with
a Strumpet had all his genital parts ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
that a malign Vapour paſſed to the

courſed through the greater to the Liver,
and ſo infected the whole maſs of Blood,
hence were generated many crudities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead

Quality, and altogether altered and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

turneth an enemy to its nature. And here
ought we to enquire into the cauſe of this
Corruption. It is to be noted in an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

and in every putrid Fever you may ſee
him ordering Phlebotomy as you may ſee
it in 11. Meth. cap. 14. And in a Peſtilential
<hi>Bubo</hi> there is concomitant a putrid Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;

Beſides theſe, the common ſigns of

Bleeding: But this is to be done and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

A Veſicatory applied under the

the Throat apply a Veſicatory to the
Scapulaes; and after they have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their work, cut them open, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Matter, and keep them open
for ſome time, by applying Beets, or I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-leaves,

Theſe may be ufed if your Patient lives
to uſe them: But this is very rare, for
they ſeldome are cured, they dying the

which had a Peſtilential Tumour bred
behind her Ear, and he being ſent for
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:43322:205"/>
about eight hours after it was perceived,
it grew into a large Bulke in that time
with much pain, the pain afterwards
began to ceaſe, but the Venome deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Heart, and did horribly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and vex it; neither could ſhe beleive
herſelf to live an hour: being by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
ordered to ſmell to Vinegar and
Roſe-water; after this ſhe was bled on
each Cephalick, firſt Breathing a Vein
on the contrary Side, then on the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered
Side. Then was there applyed
a large Ventoſe to the Part affected with
a deep Scarrification, reiterating its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication:
And when there was drawn
near half a pound of Blood by this Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſe,
the Patient began to find her ſelf
ſomewhat better and to have ſome
hopes, and found manifeſtly that the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome
receded from her Heart by theſe
Frictions, Odours, Cordial Powders,

perfectly recovered. <hi>Hollerius</hi> ſaith

and this is confirmed with good reaſon,
for the rectitude of the Veſſels, the Blood
flowing downwards by its weight muſt
neceſſarily fill its Veſſels, and being girt
up or conſtringed, being thus filled by
the Muſcles, does make way for this
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:43322:208"/>
Apertion. And to give a better light to
the well ordering and curing of both
ſorts, let us make an exact Anatomical
Inquiry about theſe parts. Theſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoidal
Veins again have an Artery
belonging to them to feed them, this
Blood firſt coming from the <hi>Porta</hi> to the
<hi>Anus;</hi> for from the great Branch of the
<hi>Porta</hi> is this carried to the Spleen, and
thence through the Meſentery is it ſent to
the right Gut. Theſe Veins are onely
two, ariſing from the <hi>Cava</hi> and the <hi>Porta</hi>
for this cauſe, becauſe theſe ſerve, as do
the other Veins of the Body, for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the parts with Blood: and thus are
the parts of the <hi>Anus</hi> nouriſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
(This was a thing unknown to the
Ancients;) and therefore it is neceſſary
that the Melancholy Blood ſhould this
way be diſcuſſed; for by this Paſſage one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is Melancholy beſt diſcuſſed, and the
<hi>Schirrus</hi> of the Spleen cured. Beſides
theſe, theſe alſo are by nature as Scavin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to cleanſe the feculent Blood, and
make a ſound Body; and when therefore
ſhe cannot perform theſe, we make our
ſpeedy addreſs to Phlebotomy: and the
Evacuations thus made we daily find to
yield great comfort and eaſe to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Patient. Beſides, theſe not being
kept open, a man having a great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:43322:208"/>
of Melancholy Humour lodged in him,
the whole Body will hereby be leſs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to undergo any other Method
which may be preſcribed. And laſtly, in
Malign Fevers, being lodged in the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Veſſels, and there putrefying the
Blood, theſe moſt properly ought to be
opened, being nearer related to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
part, where more good may be
expected than from the Arm. Should
theſe be ſtopped, they breed a Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
in the Lungs, a Dropſie in the
Liver, by ſuffocating the Liver as it were
in its native heat; and if they flow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately,
the Blood being evacuated
the Liver is cooled, thereby is excited
a Dropſie, and a decay of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.

               <p>THis is a ſoft Tumour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yielding to
the Touch, made by Dilatation or
Relaxation of an Artery: Every
Artery, except thoſe which are diſperſed
through the Brain, have allowed them
a double Coat, the inward of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either corroded or rent, the outward
may extend ſo much as to cauſe an <hi>Aneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm.
Aneuriſms</hi> may be made by <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomaſis,
Diapedeſis,</hi> Ruption, Eroſion, or
Wound of the Arteries. It happeneth
in moſt parts of the Body, but chieſly in
the Throat. It is a Swelling encreaſing
by degrees, and hath the ſame colour
with that of the Skin, a continual Pulſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If it be ſmall,<note place="margin">Its Cauſes.</note> it eaſily yieldeth to
the Touch. It is difficult in Cure. If it
be large, and in the Axillaries or <hi>Inguens,</hi>
in which the Veſſels are large, here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
no cure. Inciſion very oft times
cauſeth ſuch a Flux of Blood and Spirits,
that it both diſchargeth Art and Life ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſpeedily. This too often happens by
the imprudence of an ignorant Chirurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by pricking of an Artery inſtead of a
Vein, and ſo occaſioning this Pulſation,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:43322:210"/>
Pain, and Tumour. Some allow inward
Cauſes, as Intenſion of the Spirits, Contuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Concuſſions, Obſtructions, theſe being
accounted as the chief of the inward Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Some alſo do adde Melancholy Blood
to be a Cauſe hereof lodged in the Veins
and Arteries; but the moſt uſual ſign of its
Cauſes is drawn from the ignorant Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion,
who by pricking too deep does
wound the inward Artery, the which is
not eaſily to be cured by reaſon of its
Spermatick Subſtance and Motion; and
thus the Blood by degrees is percolated
out of the Arteries, and making a Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

made by Dilatation, the outward Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

two Methodical Scopes in its Cure, <hi>viz.</hi>

times planting themſelves in the Joynts,
ſometimes making the Bones bare and
foul. The onely way to cure this Evil is
to diſcharge the Matter by Reſolution,
and if poſſible not to open it. At the end
of the Toe there oft times falleth a ſharp
pain, ariſing without any manifeſt
cauſe, not without ſome inward occult
Malignity, without Tumour or Redneſs,
depriving it of ſenſe or motion; and
hence oft times the end of the Foot being
deſtitute of its native heat and colour, is
affected with a Lividneſs and Blackneſs,
and in proceſs of time does terminate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Gangrene and Sphacelus; this more
frequently happening more in aged peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

themſelves are a great way from the
Fountain of Heat, ſo alſo are aged people
leſs capable to help towards the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
