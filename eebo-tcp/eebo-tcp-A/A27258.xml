         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>IT is Humbly PROPOSED, that, towards regulating, and making a <hi>New COIN,</hi> Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be reduced, and brought to <hi>Five</hi> Shillings <hi>per</hi> Ounce: And by way of <hi>encouragement</hi> to the Subject, for bringing in their <hi>Plate</hi> to be <hi>Coined;</hi> which I Humbly Conceive the only way to procure a ſpeedy Supply of <hi>Bullion</hi> at this <hi>Neceſſitous Juncture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Government,</hi> by way of <hi>Encouragement,</hi> allowing <hi>Ten</hi> Pounds <hi>Intereſt,</hi> for <hi>Eighteen</hi> Months, for <hi>One Hundred</hi> Pounds value of Plate, to be brought in to be <hi>Coined;</hi> and ſo in proportion for a greater, or leſſer Sum; and His Majeſty to have the uſe of the Money, as the ſame ſhall be Coined; which may (in a great meaſure) be compleated in Six Months, and will bring a ſpeedy Supply, by making daily Payments, ſo ſoon as the ſaid <hi>Money</hi> ſhall be Coined; which <hi>Money</hi> will Circulate amongſt the Subject, and, at the ſame time, anſwer His Majeſty's preſent Occaſions.</p>
            <p>AND by way of further <hi>Encouragement</hi> to thoſe, who ſhall bring in their <hi>Plate,</hi> at the time of weighing, and delivering the ſame, in order to be <hi>Coined,</hi> there may be <hi>Bills,</hi> or <hi>Notes,</hi> advanced by the <hi>Government;</hi> with the aforeſaid Intereſt allowed into the ſame: And the <hi>Bills,</hi> or <hi>Notes,</hi> (ſo advanced, being Stamp't or Marked, to prevent Frauds, or Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting the ſame) be made, to paſs from Man to Man, in any Payment whatſoever, which ſaid <hi>Notes,</hi> or <hi>Bills,</hi> will ſupply the uſe of Money, by ſettling a <hi>Fund</hi> for that purpoſe, as a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> for the ſame; and <hi>ſupport,</hi> and <hi>carry</hi> on <hi>Trade,</hi> until ſuch time as the ſaid <hi>Eighteen Months</hi> ſhall be Expired, by which time, there may be <hi>Coin</hi> ſufficient to diſcharge the ſaid <hi>Bills,</hi> or <hi>Notes,</hi> otherwiſe, they may be continued for a longer time, as to Your <hi>Great Wiſdoms</hi> ſhall ſeem Meet.</p>
            <p>AND the better to enable His Majeſty to pay the aforeſaid Intereſt, with Submiſſion to this <hi>Honourable Houſe,</hi> (I humbly conceive) there may be <hi>Two</hi> Shillings <hi>per</hi> Pound diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the value of <hi>Coin,</hi> by leſſening it <hi>Six</hi> Pence in every <hi>Five</hi> Shillings; which Amounts to <hi>Ten</hi> Pounds <hi>per Cent,</hi> and will anſwer the Intereſt of the <hi>Ten</hi> Pounds <hi>per Cent</hi> allowed to thoſe Perſons, who ſhall bring in their <hi>Plate</hi> ſo to be <hi>Coined;</hi> and not only diſcharge the aforeſaid <hi>Intereſt</hi> ſo allowed, but (as I humbly preſume) will be a <hi>great,</hi> and the <hi>only means</hi> to keep our Money at Home: Which, ſhould <hi>Coin</hi> be made of the full value with <hi>Bullion,</hi> in caſe of a Riſe of <hi>Bullion,</hi> it will be in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being <hi>melted,</hi> or <hi>carried abroad</hi> to ſupply a <hi>dearer Market:</hi> And, upon the aforeſaid conſiderations, 'tis to be hop'd, all people will readily bring in their <hi>Plate;</hi> which did not Coſt them above <hi>Five</hi> Shillings <hi>per</hi> Ounce, beſides the making, they having the preſent Advantage of uſing their Moneys, and receiving ſuch <hi>Large Intereſt</hi> for the ſame; which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe remain in their hands as a <hi>Dead Stock</hi> and <hi>Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is ſuppoſed, by moſt People, that the value of <hi>Plate,</hi> in this Kingdom, exceeds that of our <hi>Coin;</hi> and conſidering the great Numbers of Silver Tankards, and other Plate, in all Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, Victualling-Houſes, and Publick Houſes of all ſorts, there may be a ſufficient Supply from thence (without having regard to greater Quantities in Private Houſes) to Coin ſeveral Millions, when ſo brought in; beſides what will be brought in by private Houſes, under the Encouragements for that purpoſe. And Publick Houſes are very ſenſible their <hi>Plate</hi> is of great Diſadvantage to them, in many kinds, being glad to embrace ſuch an Opportunity as this may be, [if approved on by this <hi>Honourable Houſe</hi>] to diſpoſe of the ſame under ſuch Advantages, and for the preventing ſuch Miſchiefs as they have often met with.</p>
            <p>BUT ſhould an Unwillingneſs appear in ſome Perſons, after all the Encouragements before premiſed, to bring in their <hi>Plate,</hi> (I humbly conceive) a Duty, or Tax, may be laid upon all perſons, as to this <hi>Honourable Houſe</hi> ſhall ſeem convenient, thereby to Obliege them to the ſame; Goldſmiths and Traders excepted, for the ſupply of their Shops and Trades: And the ſaid Goldſmiths and Traders to be limited from Buying, or Melting down any Old Plate, for the ſpace of <hi>Eighteen</hi> Months; which will invite all other perſons to bring in their <hi>Plate,</hi> to be Coined for the Uſe of the Government. And the Duty, or Tax, ſo laid upon thoſe who ſhall not bring in their Plate, 'twill be a help to Repair the Loſs, ſuſtained by <hi>Clipped</hi> and <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> Money.</p>
