         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

T. C. wisheth health, and happines,

Eternall felicitie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may seeme somewhat strange
vnto your Ladiship, that I should
thus presume to publish this my
poore &amp; <hi>Penitent Publican,</hi> vnder
your Honorable protection: yet
in regard of your Ladiships Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie
of heart vnto God, manifes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by your most vertuous life, and zealous loue
vnto true Religion. I am animated to aduenture
him in the worlds view, being shadowed vnder the
shield of your sacred vertues, which (like the bright
beames of <hi>Phoebus)</hi> may Illustrate, and giue a long
life, to this my illiterate, &amp; litle-worth labour, which
(wanting your fauorable reflection) might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regard. For (Madame) I am not ignorant,
that Enuie attends vpon all good attempts: <hi>Ismael</hi>
will scoffe, and mocke at <hi>Isaack,</hi> euen in <hi>Abrahams</hi>
house, and <hi>Shemy</hi> will reuile <hi>Dauid</hi> to his teeth, and
<pb facs="tcp:16555:5"/>
therefore the godlie in these dayes, may well say
with holy <hi>Iob,</hi> my soule is cut off, though I liue. <hi>Iob</hi>
the 10. and 1. verse. The righteous as the prophet
speaketh, are most despised: for let <hi>Elisha,</hi> goe vp to
<hi>Bethel,</hi> and euen the little children will call him
Bald-pate: and so he that labours to liue vprightly,
and to keepe the true path, he is accounted precise,
and called a Puritan: the consideration whereof,
makes manie men that would be feruent, to be
fearefull; and like <hi>Peter,</hi> to follow a far off, and rather
to denie him, that died for vs; then to the face of his
enemies, affirme that we knowe him: such is the
times impietie, and our infirmitie, that we are easily
intreated to retire from any godly action, or good
intention. And with <hi>Demas,</hi> quickly drawne to
abandon God, and imbrace the world: yea euen
this vild &amp; vaine world, which many excellent wise
and worthy men, haue most fitly compared vnto a
sea of glasse, of the which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> speakes, <hi>Reuelat.</hi>
the 4. and the 6. verse, for it is both so slipperie and so
vncertaine; so full of troubles &amp; tempestious waues,
one wallowing vpon the necke of another, that it is
high time for vs to say with the Disciples: <hi>Maister
saue vs, or else we perish: Mathew.</hi> 8. and, the 25. verse,
for so small is our faith, that we soone faint: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in Gods affaires.</p>
            <p>Yet wee seeme vnto men, as though wee were
both so constant and so confident in God, that we
might say with <hi>Iob, Though he kill mee, yet will I trust
in him. Iob.</hi> the 13. and the 14. verse. But (alas) if
we do behold but a litle persecution, lay hand vpon
<pb facs="tcp:16555:5"/>
our profession, for feare of the one, wee are readie
to flie from the other. Forgetting the charge that
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giues vnto <hi>Timothie, Fight the good fight
of Faith, and lay holde of Eternall life. Timot.</hi> the 6.
and the 12. verse: Wee are not onely cold in loue,
but also carelesse in Religion. For like the readie,
(yet recanting) sonne, some say, they wil come into
Christs congregation, but come not: &amp; others say,
they wil not come, yet they do: but it is at the end of
the day, before they will drawe neere; And long
doth <hi>Wisedome crie in the streetes,</hi> before she can call
them together, to <hi>goe to the Tabernacle, and returne
to the Lord,</hi> who by his Prophet <hi>Ezekiell,</hi> makes this
proclamation: <hi>Ezek.</hi> the 18. and the 23. verse. <hi>Haue
I any desire</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that the wicked should die? or
shall hee not liue, if hee returne from his owne wayes?</hi>
And againe, in the 31. verse of the same chapter, he
saith, <hi>Cast away your trangressions, wherewith you haue
transgressed, and make you a new heart, and anew spirit,
for why will yee die, oh yee house of Israel?</hi> Nay more,
hee promiseth by the same Prophet, in the 34. and
the 16. verse, <hi>I will seeke that which was lost, and bring
againe, that which was driuen away, and builde vp that
which was broken, and will strengthen the weake;</hi>
wherby we may see, that the Lord would haue none
to be lost, but with the penitent Publican, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
our sinnes, and to reforme our selues, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the counsell of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> in his 2. chap.
and 1. verse, laying aside all maliciousnes, all guile,
and dissimulation, all Enuie, and euill speaking, as
new borne babes, let vs desire the sincere milke of
<pb facs="tcp:16555:6"/>
the word: that wee may growe thereby, from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to vertue, and from grace to grace, vntill we be
come perfit men in <hi>CHRIST IESVS;</hi> which wee
can neuer be, vnlesse with the <hi>Penitent Publican,</hi> we
doe truely humble our selues before the Almighty,
and vnfainedly craue mercie and remission.</p>
            <p>The which, that we may the more be animated
vnto, I haue here (though but in a homely habit) set
him, to be a patterne of true penitence, to all such
persons, as haue any desire to imitate him, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and repentance: by whose example, if any be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
(as I hope there shall) to confesse their sinnes,
and craue pardon for the same; let them first giue
glorie vnto God, by whose holy aide I did indite it,
and then thankes vnto your <hi>Honour,</hi> vnder whose
protection I haue presumed to publish it, that it may
thereby (as with a buckler) be defended from the
venemous tongues of the Enuious.</p>
            <p>And thus with my most humble and hartie prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
vnto the Almightie, for your Ladiships
long life, and prosperitie, I ende,
