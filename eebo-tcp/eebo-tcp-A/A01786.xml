            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>For as the Scythians were a plaine people, ignoraunt and altogether vnſkyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the pompous magnyficent conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucions of other princes: ſo were they wholly directed in the footeſteppes of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, after the documentes of nature: they lyued in the moſt playneſt ſimplicitie of this lyfe: they were people that although of ſmall vnderſtanding of the eternall gouernaunce, yet theyr lyues and good manners were not the worſt: they had
<pb facs="tcp:6045:10"/>
in contempt, the deuice of noueltyes: As they began with good order, ſo they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and ſo they ended. Theyr cloathing was of beaſtes ſkinnes: theyr dyet of the naturall fruites, which the earth brought forth by courſe of kinde.</p>
               <p>Among theſe Scithians, there were ſom obſtinate and vnruly people, and ſuch whiche woulde not put on ſo harde and ſtraite kinde of lyfe: were contented ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to endure the ſame, to become baniſhed men, forlorne of theyr owne countrey: and to ſeeke theyr habitation elſe where.

               <p>Theyr owne brittle foundation wayed and conſidered after theyr owne hartes deſire was eſtabliſhed, and all thinges brought to paſſe, euen as they wiſhed for: they with one conſent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the more ſurer faſtening, and grounding of theyr eſtate by the counſell and aduiſe of the chiefeſt and wyſeſt men of the Raellyans: gathered together with one agreement, to chooſe a King: thinking thereby theyr gouernaunce, not onely to become ciuile: but alſo theyr eſtate bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and happyer, and that theyr countrey ſhoulde the rather he dreaded.
<pb facs="tcp:6045:11"/>
And alſo that they all throwing themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues vnder the obedience, &amp; ſcepter of one man, ſhoulde become one: whereas eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans opinion bearing ſwaye, there was many factions, treaſons, conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which dyd enſue: one enuying ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eſtate, within them ſelues.</p>

I Wyll ſurelye cleare and purge thy lande, and reſtore thée to as muche pleaſure, as euer thou haddeſt in thy lyfe before: yea, and muche more: and I am glad that ſo good occaſion is offered mée, againſt that wynding Snake of the Hircans: <hi>Hellepatrus,</hi> and <hi>Hellidorus</hi> his ſonne were ſuccoured, and very rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mayntained among the Trebonyans. And as <hi>Hellepatrus</hi> dyd geue him ſelfe to great exceſſyue drinking, among the Trebonyans: ſo the Trebonyans were a very inordinate people in drynking. <hi>Hellydorus,</hi> although geuing him ſelfe to an accuſtomed order of myldneſſe, for that he in all his lyfe neuer laughed: ſo he practiſed him ſelf to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great actiuitie of the Trebonyans: for the Trebonyans were verye actiue and nymble people, in the feates of Armes, &amp; moſt ſtrongly woulde they fight, when they were exceſſiuely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome with drynking: But the king of the Trebonians, and the people practiſed many pleaſant deuiſes, to moue <hi>Hellydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to laughter: but ſuch was his myldnes, that it coulde neuer be brought to paſſe:
<pb facs="tcp:6045:39"/>
Whylſt the Raellyans pleaſure increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and their eſtate beganne to be ſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>Hellepatrus</hi> and the king of the Trebonyans ceaſed not to conſent, and take great counſell for the reſtoring of the king vnto his kingdome. And at the laſt, the king made ſuch prouiſion of ſhippes, and of warlyke armour: with ſuch a huge hoaſt of men, as though they would haue eaten vp at on byt, the whole countrey of the Raellyans, and not by force of armes to haue conquered them.</p>
               <p>The kinges prouiſion was an hoaſt of men of a hundred thouſand, and fiue thon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Nauie of ſhippes: And hauing lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they marched towardes the highe countrey of the Raellyans: which when he drewe neare, they deuyded the hoaſte into thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
