            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Preaching work, <hi>verſ. 16.</hi> and exhorts <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him
all Chriſts Miniſters in the publick Worſhip of God, firſt to

            <head>II. The Forms of the general part of the Liturgy uſed in the
Church of England, compared with ſuch Forms as
we finde in Scripture.</head>
            <p>1 THe beginning of the Book of Common Prayer is, Firſt,
to read one of ſeveral places of Scripture there aſſerted,
taken out of the Word of God.</p>
            <p>2 The next thing is an Exhortation to ſtir up the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to Prayer, which Chriſt did to his own Apoſtles when
he went to Prayer in the Garden, <hi>Luke 22. 40</hi> &amp; 46. thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
ſtirred up the people by Arguments, and then went to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:133248:3"/>
prayer, <hi>Pſal. 106.</hi> and much might be ſaid more for this, but I
think none will deny it, that know any thing of God.</p>
            <p>3 The next thing is, a form of Confeſſion of Sins, and I
ſhall give you ſome other forms in Scripture, that for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of them are the like.</p>
            <p>One Form of Confeſſion is, the thirty ninth Pſalm, which
was a form appointed by God himſelf, to be read in the Church
of God; That it is a Confeſſion of Sins is plain, by the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, and that it was a Form appointed by God, to bee u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Church, I prove by the title of it, which is the very
Word of God. and in the Original in the Hebrew Bible, as
well as the body of the Pſalm, <hi>To the chief Muſician, even to
Jeduthun,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Jeduthun</hi> was one of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the Church of God, appointed to miniſter his part
of the Liturgy, or Publick Service of God, 1 <hi>Chron. 25. 1.</hi> &amp;
<hi>verſ. 6.</hi> and this Pſalm was a Form appointed to bee uſed by
him in the Church of God at the publick Ordinances.</p>
            <p>Another Form of a Confeſſion we find that <hi>Ezra</hi> uſed,
<hi>Ezra 9. 6.</hi> to the end of the Chapter, and the like <hi>Dan. 9.</hi>
at the beginning, and ſeveral others in Scripture.</p>
            <p>4 Then follows the Declaration of Gods Mercy and Grace,
in the abſolving of penitent Sinners, by the form of an Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to be read by the Miniſter, which hath a good warrant,
if we conſider the like form uſed in the Church of God by the
ſons of <hi>Korah,</hi> appointed thereto by the Lord, <hi>Pſal. 84.</hi> by
the title of which it appears, that they did uſe it as part of their
Liturgy, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> A Pſalm for the ſons of <hi>Korah,</hi> who
were Miniſters appointed to miniſter their parts of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of the publick VVorſhip of God, 2 <hi>Chron. 9. 19.</hi> and this
eighty fourth Pſalm doth highly exalt God for his mercy and
love to penitent Sinners that cry after him, make him their
ſtrength, and truſt in him.</p>
            <p>5 The Lords Prayer was given by Chriſt himſelf, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them by his own unerring lips to uſe that form, <hi>Matth. 6.
Luke 11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 There are in the Liturgy many ſhort Prayers, and
Collects for ſeveral things, and touching ſeveral eſtates and
conditions of people; and the like we finde in the Scriptures
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:133248:4"/>
of many ſhort prayers that have been uſed in the Church of
God, and warranted by the Lord, <hi>Nehem. 11. 17.</hi> ſeveral Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
were appointed to their parts of the publick prayers, ſo,
<hi>Acts 4. 24.</hi> to <hi>verſ. 31.</hi> is ſet down an expreſs form of a
ſhort prayer uſed by the Church of Chriſt, and the Lord
gave a clear teſtimony of hearing their prayer. So alſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
had a ſhort form of Prayer uſed for thoſe that they
laid their hands on, that they might receive the Holy Ghoſt,
<hi>Acts 6. 6.</hi> and 8. 15. And ſo again we finde a form of a ſhort
Collect uſed by the Prophet <hi>Habbakkuk,</hi> Chap. 3. and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts expreſly, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 6. In every thing by
prayer and ſupplication with thankſ-giving, let your requeſts bee
made known unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a Caution to admoniſh all men to take heed of mocking,
or ſcorning at the ſhort prayers in the Liturgy, I ſhall here
inſert a notable example of a lamentable Judgement of God
upon one <hi>John Apowel,</hi> mentioned by Dr. <hi>Beard,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi>
in their Book of the <hi>Theater of Gods Judgements,</hi> p. 147. out
of the <hi>Acts and Monuments,</hi> p. 2103.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Apowel,</hi> hearing one Maſter <hi>Malden</hi> reading ſome of
thoſe ſhort prayers in the Liturgy, mocked him with contrary
jeers, and flouting terms as he went on; and when Mr. <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
was ſaying, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, &amp;c. Apowel</hi> in his
ſcoffing was terribly affrighted by the Devil, who appeared to
him, and his hair ſtared upright on his head, and the next day
he grew worſe, and in great horrour cried out night and day,
<hi>The Devil, the Devil, O the Devil of Hell, now the Devil of Hell,
there he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7 <hi>Glory be to the Father, &amp;c. And praiſe the Lord,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prayer to ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi> Theſe have good warrant from the
Scriptures, where wee finde the like expreſſions, <hi>Hallelujah,
praiſe the Lord</hi> is often in the Pſalmes, <hi>Pſal. 41.</hi> the laſt verſe,
this form is ſet down, <hi>Bleſſed bee the Lord God of Iſrael from
everlaſting, and to everlaſting, Amen, and Amen;</hi> and this was
a Pſalm appointed of God to be uſed in publick by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of God, as appears by the title of it. And to the ſame
purpoſe is the concluſion of <hi>Pſal. 82.</hi> and ſo again the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

            </p>
            <p>8 The Hymn to be uſed before the Pſalms of the day, is
that very form which is the 95 Pſalm; and the Pſalms of
the day daily to be read, are the Pſalms of <hi>David,</hi> in order,
morning and evening, untill the whole book be gone tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
once every month.</p>
            <p>9 The Leſſons (except a very few) are all out of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the firſt Leſſon out of the old Teſtament, and the ſecond
out of the new, every day, as the Prieſts under the Law read
in the order of their courſe, out of the old Teſtament
<hi>Luke 1. 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10 That excellent ſong of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> called <hi>Te Deum</hi> is
highly approved of by almoſt all Churches, and it bears
much reſemblance to the 1 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the <hi>92 Pſalm,</hi>
entituled a ſong for the Sabbath day, joyned both together;
And the Miniſter hath choice either to ſay that, or <hi>Benedicite,</hi>
which is extracted from <hi>Pſal. 136.</hi> and <hi>Pſal. 148.</hi> for the
morning ſervice, and for the evening ſervice, there is liberty
or choice for the Miniſter after the firſt Leſſon, either to ſay
the <hi>Magnificat</hi> taken out of the 1. Chap. of St. <hi>Lukes</hi> goſpel,
verſe. 46, &amp;c. or the <hi>98 Pſal.</hi> at length, both which are forms
recorded in Scripture.</p>
            <p>11 After the ſecond Leſſon is to be ſaid the ſong of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi>
the Prieſt, taken out of St. <hi>Luke</hi> the 1 Chap. begining at
verſe 68. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or the 100 Pſalme at length, for the morning:
And the ſong of <hi>Simeon,</hi> taken out of St <hi>Luke</hi> Chap. 2. verſ
29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or the 67. Pſalm at length, for the evening, all
which are formes expreſly taken out of the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>12 The Creed, or profeſſion of faith to be made in the
Church of God, is a clear Chriſtian duty (which is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
contracted in each of the Creeds, in our Engliſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,
that called the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Creed, and the <hi>Nicen</hi> Creed,
and <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Creed.) To ſatisfie any ſoul that would be
further informed herein, let them read, <hi>Rom. 10. 9, 10. 1
John 4. 2. Deut. 26. 17. 1 Tim. 6. 12. Heb. 10. 23. Luk. 9.
26.</hi> And there is ſcarce a Church in the world, but owns
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:133248:5"/>
ſome form of profeſſion of Faith, and there are very few
Chriſtian Churches but do own the Creeds in our Rubrick.</p>
            <p>13 Now for the Letany ſo much ſcrupled (by many) by
reaſon of the often repetitions therein, of the ſame thing; (for
as for the matter of what is prayed for; I think all ſober men
will ſay, that it is not inferiour to any prayer that was ever
made by meer man. Therefore touching the ſame thing often
to be repeated in ſaying of it) this I can ſay, that the like is to
be found in Gods holy Word. Such like repetitions of the
ſame words wee finde, <hi>Pſal. 130.</hi> the whole Pſalm, yea
our bleſſed Saviour Chriſt himſelf, when he had prayed in
the Garden in his bloody Agony, <hi>Mark 14.</hi> Chap. He pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
what his words were are ſet down, <hi>verſes 35, 36.</hi> who
afterwards repeated the ſame words again, as appears, <hi>verſe
39.</hi> And the poor Publican that only ſaid, <hi>God be mercifull
to mee a ſinner,</hi> and ſmote on his breaſt, repeating that, was
Juſtified before God, <hi>Luk 18. 13, 14.</hi> And I appeal to any
ſoul that hath had neer communion with God in ſecret
prayer, if in the breathings of his ſoul, in which he hath had
the higheſt raptures, and been moſt earneſt with God; he
hath not often made repetitions of his moſt hearty groans,
and deſires to God in the ſame words, for pardon of ſin, for
Grace, for a clearer manifeſtation of his preſence; Oh! with
what affection have groans been from the ſoul, crying, <hi>mercy
Lord, mercy, mercy, Lord be merciful to my poor ſoul, grace
Lord, ſanctify my ſoul by thy grace; help Lord, help, ſome dram of
grace, ſome diſcovery of thy ſelf to my poor ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14 Wee are to pray for the Kings Majeſty and the Royal
Family, and for his Majeſties Councel, and for the Biſhops, and
for all in Authority, under his Majeſty; which is a clear du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to which wee are exhorted by the word of God, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
given therein <hi>1 Tim. 2. 2.</hi> (St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts, that
prayer be made) <hi>for Kings, and for all that are in Authority,
that wee may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and
honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15 The ten Commandments, are the writings of Gods
own hand, containing the whole moral Law, <hi>Exod. 20.</hi> And
the Lord not only there, but often in other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:133248:5"/>
gives a great charge for the reading of them.</p>
            <p>16 The Epiſtles and Goſpels appointed by the Rubrick
are taken out of the Bible, and each of them ſuited to the
ſeaſon and time for which it is directed to be read.</p>
            <p>17 The Bleſſing to be given at the diſmiſſion of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
is of Divine authority from the Word, in which
wee may finde both command and example, and a form
alſo not much unlike that uſed in our Liturgy for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of it, only that was for the Church before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Chriſt, and we live in the times after the coming
of Chriſt; a Form was commanded by <hi>Moſes</hi> from God,
<hi>Numb. 6. 23, 24, 25, 26. On this wiſe yee ſhall bleſs the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael, ſaying unto them, The Lord bleſs thee and keep
thee, the Lord make his face to ſhine upon thee, and be gracious
unto thee, the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give
thee peace.</hi> And examples wee have of that practice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the Church, by the Prophets and Miniſters of the
Lord, confeſſed by <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 118. 26 Wee have bleſſed
you out of the houſe of the Lord.</p>

things moſt excepted againſt in the other parts
of the Rubrick appointed to be uſed on
particular occaſions.</head>
            <p>1 TOuching the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, There are
chiefly two things ſcrupled at by ſome.</p>
            <p>1 That (as ſome object) all that come, yea the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and ſcandalous, are admitted to the Lords Table, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>Jer. 15. 19.</hi> and <hi>1 Cor. 5. 11.</hi> and <hi>2 Cor. 8. 5.</hi> which
is a falſe charge upon the Rubrick, and the Diſcipline of
the Church, for by the <hi>Canons of the Church,</hi> none are to bee
admitted to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper untill they
be inſtructed in the Principles of Religion, and confirmed
by the laying on of the hands of the Biſhop; and every Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:133248:6"/>
that hath Cure and Charge of Souls, is to take eſpecial
care that none be preſented to the Biſhop to bee confirmed,
but ſuch as can render an account of their faith, <hi>Canon 61.
Anno Dom. 1604.</hi> and touching ſuch as are ſcandalous, the
Rubrick directs expreſly in the Preface to the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
That if any be a notorious Evil-liver, ſo that the
Congregation by him is offended, or have done any wrong
to his Neighbour by word or deed, the Curate having
knowledge thereof is to admoniſh him, in no wiſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to come to the Lords Table, until he have openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
himſelf to have truly repented, and amended his
former naughty life, that the Congregation may thereby
be ſatisfied. And Chriſt himſelf teacheth every individual
Member how to carry himſelf towards an offending Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Mat. 18. 15. 16, 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Another ſcruple by ſome is, about Kneeling at the
Lords Table, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt ſate down, and the
twelve Apoſtles with him,</hi> Luke 22. 14. whereas neither Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
nor Kneeling is the eſſential part of the Sacrament, as
they are not the eſſential part of Prayer, but for decency
and order, which ought to bee obſerved in the Church,
<hi>1 Cor. 14. 40.</hi> we finde prayer ſometimes uſed kneeling,
as <hi>Dan. 6. 10. Hee kneeled upon his knees three times a day and
prayed;</hi> and we finde Prayer ſometimes uſed ſitting, <hi>Nehem.
1. 4. I ſate down — and prayed before the God of heaven;</hi> and
as it is hard to determine exactly the poſture of Chriſts Body
in his Agony in the Garden, which Saint <hi>Luke</hi> calls <hi>Kneeling,</hi>
Luke 22. 41. <hi>He kneeled down and prayed;</hi> and Saint <hi>Mark</hi>
calls falling on the ground, <hi>Mark 14. 35. Hee fell on the
ground and prayed</hi> (though moſt probably it was a falling
down on his knees on the ground) ſo it is hard to determine
exactly what that poſture was, which the Diſciples were in,
when Chriſt delivered to them the Sacrament; for though it
be ſaid, <hi>Luke 22. 14. He ſate down and the twelve Apoſtles
with him,</hi> yet Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that at that time, <hi>John 13.
23. There was leaning on Jeſus boſome one of his Diſciples;</hi>
but kneeling being by an Ordinance of the Authority of
this Land commanded at the Lords Table, it is decent for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:133248:6"/>
us to ſubmit to that Ordinance, and it is our duty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
thereunto, <hi>1 Pet. 2. 13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Touching the Sacrament of Baptiſm, two things are
chiefly ſcrupled about it.</p>
            <p>1 Some do ſcruple at the Baptizing of Infants as perſons
not fit ſubjects (in their ſenſe) for Baptiſm, though they be
the Children of beleeving Parents, born within the pale of
the Church; but being the Children of Beleevers, they have
a right to be Baptiſed; which I prove by ſeveral teſtimonies
and reaſons.</p>
            <p>1 They are the Holy Seed, as they are the natural Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the people of God, <hi>Ezra 9. 2. And if the root be holy,
ſo are the branches,</hi> Rom. 11. 16. if the father be a baptized
perſon, and continue in the Church, ſo the children are to
be baptized; for the children of beleevers (of Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents)
have an intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, being
children of the Covenant <hi>Acts 3. 25.</hi> The ſeal of
the Covenant of Grace (the ſanctifying ſeal whereby they
are dedicated to God) belongs to them by Chriſt, for <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is greater, the gift, or the Altar that ſanctifieth the gift,</hi>
Matth. 23. 19. they being the children of beleeving Parents,
are through Chriſt to be Conſecrated as (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) holy things,
<hi>1 Cor. 7. 14.</hi> and to have a right to the clenſing Ordinance,
for what God hath clenſed, none ſhould dare to call unclean,
<hi>Acts 10. 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 The Children of Gods People had right under the
Law to Gods ſeal of the Covenant of Grace in Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Gen. 17. 10, 11, 12.</hi> therefore much more have they
right now under the Goſpel, to Gods ſeal of the Covenant
of Grace in Baptiſm, by which all the priviledges of Gods
People are much inlarged, and made more glorious, <hi>2 Cor.
3. 7, 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 It is againſt Goſpel light, that thoſe that are judged
to have received the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be deprived of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Baptiſm, <hi>Acts 10. 47.</hi> of which thing there is as good
teſtimony in behalf of Infants, as for men of riper years, <hi>Jer.
1. 5. Luke 1. 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 The very deſign of the Ordinance of Baptiſm is, to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:133248:7"/>
declare the perſon baptiſed to bee a diſciple to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.
28. 19. Go yee therefore and teach</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) Diſciple <hi>all
Nations, Baptiſing them,</hi> declare them to be Diſciples by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing
them. And Infants who were Circumciſed at eight
daies old were declared to be Diſciples, <hi>Acts 15. 10.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Infants have right to water Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>5 Thoſe that are to bee judged beleevers, ought to bee
baptiſed. Beleevers are fit ſubjects, for baptiſm. <hi>Acts 8. 37.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I prove them beleevers plainly thus.</p>
            <p>1 They are ſuch as the Kingdome of God doth belong
to, <hi>Mark. 10. 14. Luke 18. 16. John 3. 5.</hi> which cannot be,
were they not beleevers, for unbeleevers are to bee cut off
from the Kingdome of God, <hi>Luke 12. 46.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 They have hope in God, even while they are ſucking
at their mothers breaſts in their infancy <hi>Pſal. 22. 9.</hi> which
none can have but beleevers, for <hi>Heb. 11. 1. Faith is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of things hoped for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Chriſt himſelf doth with his own unerring lips declare
them to bee beleevers, <hi>Mat. 18. 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe priviledges are of Gods free grace vouchſafed to
them, <hi>Rom. 11. 28. as touching the Election they are beloved
for the Fathers ſake,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for their Fathers ſakes.</p>
            <p>6 There is command in Scripture for Children as well as
others to bee baptiſed, becauſe the promiſe reacheth to them
with the Parents, <hi>Acts 2. 38, 39.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7 There is examples of Baptiſing Infants as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>1 Cor. 10. 1, 2.</hi> and other places.</p>
            <p>2 Others do ſcruple the Croſs in Baptiſm, whereas the
very Ordinance it ſelf baptizeth the perſon into the Croſſe
or death of Chriſt; <hi>Rom. 6. 3.</hi> And for the making of the
ſign of the Croſs with the finger, on the fore-head of the
perſon Baptized; It is declared in the 30 Canon Anno Dom.
1604. That the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſince the aboliſhing of
Popery, hath ever held and taught, and ſo doth ſtill hold
and teach, that the ſign of the Croſſe uſed in Baptiſm, is
no part of the ſubſtance of the Sacrament. For when the
Miniſter, dipping the Infant in water, or laying water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the face of it, (as the manner is) hath pronounced theſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:133248:7"/>
words, <hi>I Baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> the Infant is fully and perfectly Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.
So as the ſign of the Croſſe being afterwards uſed, doth
neither add any thing to the vertue or perfection of Baptiſm,
nor being omitted, doth detract any thing from the effect
or ſubſtance of it.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Touching Confirmation by laying on of the hands of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</hi>
However it bee a ſcruple to ſome, yet wee finde it an
Ordinance uſed to perſons after Baptiſm in the Apoſtles
time, <hi>Acts 8. 17. Acts 19. 6.</hi> and it is reckoned up to be one
of the foundation principles of Church diſcipline <hi>Hel. 6. 1, 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 Touching the Catechiſm appointed by the Rubrick to
be taught, ſome ſcruples are made about ſome things in it.</p>
            <p>1 That it ſhould be ſaid, that by Baptiſm a Childe is
<hi>made a member of Chriſt, a Childe of God, and an inheritor of the
Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> By which is meant onely in an outward
relation, as all the Circumſiſed Jews were the people of God.
Thus by Water-baptiſm, we are made outwardly in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
myſtical Members of Chriſt, <hi>1 Cor. 6. 15. Know yee not that
your bodies are the Members of Chriſt,</hi> and ſo alſo we are by an
outward right, made the Children of God, <hi>1 John 3. 2.
Beloved, now are wee the Sons of God; But it doth not yet appear
what wee ſhall be,</hi> by outward profeſſion in appearance they
were ſo, but what they were inwardly and ſpiritually, that
appears not to men certainly in this world; And ſo again,
By water Baptiſm wee are made inheritors (by an outward
right) of the Kingdome of God, that is to ſay, of the Church
of Chriſt, <hi>Coloſ. 1. 13. Who hath redeemed us out of Darkneſſe,
and hath tranſlated us into the Kingdome of his dear Son.</hi> God
doth it by a viſible ſeparation of us from the Heathen, and
Kingdome of Satan, by water-Baptiſm, as the Lord promiſed
<hi>Ezek. 36. 24, 25. I will take you from among the Heathen, and
gather you out of all Countries, and will bring you into your own
Land.</hi> i.e. into the pale of the Church by Water-Baptiſm,
<hi>Then will I ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The next ſcruple is, about the engagement of the God-fathers
and God-mothers, who do promiſe and vow thoſe
things, in the childes name, which are to be promiſed in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:133248:8"/>
to underſtand which, it is to be conſidered: 1. That
the Childes right to Baptiſm is from the Parent. 2. The
people of God have right to come before the Lord, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into Covenant with him for themſelves, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
(yea, for the poor ignorant ſucking infant) by vertue
of the Covenant of Grace through Ieſus Chriſt, as plainly
appears by theſe Scriptures, <hi>Deut. 29. 10, 11, 12, 13.</hi> and
<hi>Deut. 31. 12 13.</hi> And 3. The Parents entring into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God for their Children, it is but right it ſhould be
eſtabliſhed by two or three witneſſes, <hi>Mat. 18. 16. 2 Cor. 13. 1.
4 Some doe ſcruple that part of the Creed, where it is ſaid of
Chriſt, He deſcended into Hell,</hi> becauſe when Chriſt dyed his
Body was buried in the Sepulchre, and his Soul was that day
with God the Father preſently in Paradiſe; both which is confeſt,
yet is that alſo true, that <hi>Chriſt deſcended into hell,</hi> not that he
deſcended into the Papiſts feigned Purgatory; but hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
into <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the eſtate of the dead, ſo the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies,
in his Human nature; and hee deſcended into Hell, by
his Divine Power, accompliſhing the effect, and triumph of
his Death over Hell, and he deſcended into Hell by his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of ſoul in the Garden, and on the Croſs, and hee deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Grave, ſo it is frequently rendred, by his
Soul from Heaven to his Body to be coupled again with it,
to give it life, and raiſe it up again from the dead.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>Touching Matrimony,</hi> the greateſt ſcruple that is made
in the forms thereof, is about the Mans ſaying to the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>With my body I thee worſhip,</hi> which is no more but <hi>te colo,
I imbrace thee,</hi> (and ſo it is in the Latin Service) as if a man
ſhould ſay, <hi>With this Ring I thee wed, with my body I thee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace,
and with all my worldly goods I thee endow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 The chiefeſt thing ſcrupled in <hi>the Viſitation of the Sick,</hi>
is, about the Abſolution, becauſe it is ſaid to the penitent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
ſick Perſon, when the Miniſter judgeth him to bee
ſuch a one; <hi>By his authority</hi> (ſpeaking of Chriſt) <hi>committed
unto me, I abſolve thee from all thy Sins, in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> but this is done only
declaratively and with a <hi>Proviſo</hi> provided that he be ſuch a one
as is expreſſed in the Prayer immediately going before theſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:133248:8"/>
words, on which they have a dependance, <hi>(viz.) Our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, who hath left power to his Church to abſolve all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
which truly repent and beleeve in him, of his great mercy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
thee all thine offences;</hi> and upon this ground if the like
Perſon be ſuch a one, the Miniſter doth declare, <hi>By</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
committed to him, he doth abſolve him.</p>
            <p>7 <hi>Touching the burial of the Dead,</hi> ſome doe ſcruple, that
at the interring of every Corps it is ſaid, <hi>Wee commit his body
to the ground, earth to earth, aſhes to aſhes, duſt to duſt, in ſure
and certain hope of reſurrection to eternal life;</hi> whereas none
can have ſuch ſure and certain hope touching any; and ſome
have lived ſo profainly, and even to the laſt have not given
any teſtimony ſatisfactory of their repentance, ſo that there
is little hope of their intereſt in eternal life at all. But this
ſcruple ariſeth from a miſtake, for it is not ſpoken of the body
of the deceaſed particularly, but of the bodies of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
that is to ſay of the faithful; as we ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi>
when there are ſometimes many unbeleevers and carnal men
in the Congregation. And it is not ſaid in ſure and certaine
hope of his Reſurrection to eternal life, but indefinitely, in
ſure and certain hope of reſurrection to eternal life, through
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>(i.e.)</hi> to thoſe that have an intereſt in
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which rather is to bee referred to the
faithful, than to the preſent interred Corps, except he be one
of that number, even ſuch a one concerning whom the
Miniſter then declares, That Chriſt <hi>ſhall change our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
(not his Body, except he be one of that number) <hi>that it
may be like unto his glorious body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8 <hi>Touching the Thanks-giving of Women after Child-birth,</hi>
the greateſt ſcruple is about that part of it where it is ſaid,
<hi>The Sun ſhall not burn thee by day, nor the Moon by night,</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that not to concern the Woman to whom it is ſaid;
but it is Scripture, and it cannot be denied but that the reſt of
the Pſalm is very ſutable; why then ſhould this be ſcrupled,
ſeeing it is part of the ſame, for the whole is the one hundred
twenty firſt Pſalm, which is all appointed to bee read, and
that which God hath put together in his holy Word, let no
man think much that the Church doth not put aſunder. And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:133248:9"/>
beſides, theſe very words ſcrupled are a precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
for the Woman to lay hold on, and for all that beleeve,
for it is made to every faithful ſoul, That neither the Sun of
Proſperity ſhall annoy them with ſcorching heat of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
by day, nor the Moon of Adverſity, hurt them
with the cold vapours of deſpair by night: it is (in a word)
Gods promiſe of protection to them night and day.</p>
            <p>9 Touching the Commination of the Curſes to be read
by the Miniſter, and the Peoples ſaying, <hi>Amen,</hi> much ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
by ſome, me thinks when they read, that God did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
command the like in the Scripture to be done, by his
own peculiar people, we ſhould all bee ſatisfied in it. Now
that God did ſo, is plain by the twenty ſeventh Chapter of
<hi>Deutrenomy.</hi>
