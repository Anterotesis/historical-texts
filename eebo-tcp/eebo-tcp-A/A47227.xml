            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>KING</hi> WILLIAM, <hi>or KING</hi> LEWIS. <hi>Wherein is ſet forth</hi> The Inevitable Neceſſity theſe Nations lie under, of Submitting wholly to One or Other of theſe Kings; and that the Matter in Controverſie is not now between King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and King <hi>JAMES</hi> the Second, but between King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and King <hi>LEWIS</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> for the Government of theſe Kingdoms.</head>
            <p>AT the firſt breaking out of theſe Motions in our Countries, there was nothing more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly enquired after, than the Secret League with <hi>France,</hi> for the Subverſion of the Laws and eſtabliſh'd Religion of <hi>England</hi>: And there was a miſguided Party amongſt us, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hitherto that no ſuch abominable Contrivance was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly proved againſt the late King <hi>James,</hi> that therefore he was never guilty of any ſuch evil Machination, and ſome were ſo far miſled, as from hence to doubt, whether he were guilty of ſome other Enormities that were objected againſt him. But to thoſe it may be ſufficient to anſwer, That the then Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> did not in his Declaration publickly charge King <hi>James</hi> with any ſuch League; and therefore the World cannot object againſt King <hi>William,</hi> that in this Matter he has falſely aſperſed him. There is nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Declaration (which I ſuppoſe is the Summary of what King <hi>William</hi> has to object publickly againſt King <hi>James</hi>'s Proceeding) that the moſt Devoted to King <hi>James</hi>'s Party can poſſibly deny; it contains nothing but Publick Matter of Fact, tranſacted before the Face of all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59211:3"/>
ſave only in the Matter of the Pretended Pr. of <hi>W.</hi> which is a thing ſo ridiculous and deſpicable, that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has not thought it fit to be taken notice of, or inſiſted upon. So that granting the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s and King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Death to be unjuſt Accuſations, which have never been otherwiſe mentioned than as Coffee houſe Chat, and in ſome idle Pamphlets publiſhed by Private Perſons; and granting even the <hi>French</hi> League to be ſo too; there remains many and grievous Accuſations, certainly true, and ſufficient to make us conclude with the incomparable <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> That <hi>Voluntas Regendi &amp; perdendi Populum conſiſtere ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queunt.</hi> But what if the League with <hi>France</hi> be not yet publickly proved? I hope by this time the Eyes of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are ſo opened, that now there needs no ſuch Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Proceſs. King <hi>James</hi> the Second deſerted his People, abdicated his Kingdoms, leaving the Throne Vacant, and his Kingdoms in the firſt State of Nature, without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Head; and threw himſelf into the Arms and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the <hi>French</hi> King, the moſt inveterate Enemy to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation and Government both in Church and State: To him he applied for Help and Succour in the Diſtreſs he had brought on himſelf, by obſerving the Meaſures ſet him by <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> for the utter Extirpation of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion in theſe Kingdoms: And the Ambitious <hi>French</hi> Monarch preſently lays hold on this Opportunity, receives him graciouſly, and promiſes all Aſſiſtance. Great Preparations are immediately ordered at <hi>Brest,</hi> for <hi>Ireland;</hi> and after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> King had received his full Inſtructions from <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, and was put under the Tutelage of two or three <hi>French</hi> Generals for managing the War, and <hi>French</hi> Treaſurers and Officers for managing the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, together with Monſieur <hi>d'Avaux</hi> for giving Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he embarked for <hi>Ireland,</hi> with a great Stock of Money and Arms.</p>
            <p>It was expected, and certainly promiſed, by ſeveral in <hi>England</hi> that ſtood very well affected to King <hi>James,</hi> tho' not of his Religion, That as ſoon as he ſhould put his Foot
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59211:3"/>
on <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ground, he would immediately begin with all Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Mercy to his Proteſtant Subjects, he would wholly caſt himſelf upon them, by turning out <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Sword to a Proteſtant Governour, by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Proteſtants, eſpecially of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> into all Imploys, both Civil and Military: For this they knew was the only Meaſures he could reaſonably take, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining the Hearts of his Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>England,</hi> and of obtaining once more his Deſerted Throne. But what difference is there between <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Politicks? Inſtead of theſe Methods, as ſoon as he arrived at <hi>Dublin,</hi> he was Addreſſed by Speeches from ſome <hi>Iriſh</hi> Popiſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Clergy, (particularly by Biſhop <hi>Terrell, Tyrconnel</hi>'s Secretary, and Doctor <hi>Moor</hi>) adviſing him to conſider his Papiſt Subjects of that Kingdom for all their Sufferings theſe Thirty laſt Years, and to reſtore them to the Churches and Poſſeſſions which had been ſo unjuſtly uſurped from them. (They ſhould have added<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the horrid Rebellion they had raiſed in Forty one, and for the many thouſands of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Murders committed by them to maintain the Romiſh Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) Monſieur <hi>d'Avaux</hi> alſo at his Publick Audience as Ambaſſadour from his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, adviſed him in his Maſter's Name to the ſame Favours towards his Catholicks of that Kingdom. Whereupon immediately the few Proteſtants that remained in Imploys, were commanded to lay them down: Not a Proteſtant was allowed to ſit in Council, or bear Arms; Lord <hi>Grauard,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Keating,</hi> Sir <hi>John Davis,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Newcomen,</hi> Colonel <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, &amp;c.</hi> were all laid aſide, and no one permitted to hold any Place, but Papiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' theſe Gentlemen went as far to ſerve the King, as made ſome ſuſpect them for being of his Religion. But a ſignal Example we have of his Majeſties Gratitude to thoſe that ſerve him, in the late Biſhop of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> who coming with him out of <hi>France,</hi> died at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and was ſo miſerably Poor, as to want Common Neceſſaries; and being dead, was buried at the Charge of a Charitable Prelate there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59211:4"/>But to proceed: The Proteſtants, who for two Months before King <hi>James</hi> came into <hi>Ireland</hi> had ſuffered moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Violences and Wrongs from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Soldiers, being Pillaged and Robbed of all their Cattel and movable Goods, thought that upon his Majeſty's Arrival they ſhould find ſome Protection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Abatement of their Troubles; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeveral Complaints made by them to the King for Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries received, he would anſwer them, That he would do for them what he could; but they never received further Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or Juſtice: And particularly, the Lord <hi>Galmoy</hi> had in the North moſt barbarouſly cut off a Gentleman's Head, and made the Gentleman's own Son carry it on a Pike in Triumph before his Regiment: Upon Complaint of this to the King, he ſeemed mightily diſpleaſed at the Bloody In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity; yet the Lord <hi>Galmoy,</hi> the very next day after the Complaint, carried the Sword before his Majeſty to Maſs. When the Proteſtant Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> with a Body of Clergy-men, waited on the King, the Biſhop addreſſed himſelf to him in this manner: <q>
                  <hi>May it pleaſe your Majeſty, The Clergy of this City of</hi> Dublin, <hi>with ſeveral of the Rural Clergy, that are retired from this Country for Safety, attend your Majesty, to congratulate your Arrival in this Kingdom; and do humbly implore your Royal Protection to them, their Churches, and Religion; deſiring that from time to time they may be admitted to make their juſt Complaints of thoſe Injuries they have lately received:</hi> His Majeſty's Anſwer was, <hi>That he would protect all Men in their Religions and Properties, and as for the Wrongs that had lately been ſuffered by ſeveral, 'twas impoſſible, in theſe Times of Commotions, but ſuch would happen; but he ſhould as far as he could prevent and redreſs them: However, if I am Invaded in the Kingdom, as I have been in</hi> England,</q> 
               <hi>I muſt ſecure my ſelf as well as I can.</hi> What could the King poſſibly intend by this laſt Expreſſion? Can it be otherwiſe, than that as he found the Proteſtants of <hi>England</hi> deſert him upon the Invaſion, and ſome of them fly over to the Prince's Party, he would prevent the like Trick in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by cutting them all off, or ſecuring them under cloſe Confinement? Now what reaſon have Subjects
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59211:4"/>
to truſt a King, that will nor truſt them? When the Band of Mutual Credit is broken, all Government fails immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. But that we may ſee more plainly, that King <hi>James</hi> never deſigns any more to truſt his Proteſtant Subjects, but to oppreſs them, and utterly to extirpate their Religion from theſe Nations, I ſhall here relate a remarkable Paſſage that was lately between a Proteſtant Clergy-man of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Lord who came thither with King <hi>James</hi> out of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Clergy-man ſaid to the Lord, <hi>That he hoped now the King was come amongſt them, he would protect his Proteſtants, and redreſs them in thoſe Injuries they had of late groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and not only ſo, but that his Majeſty would be more than ordinary kind and favourable to them, advancing them to Places of Truſt and Power, and granting them a Share both in Civil and Military Imployments; for that this was the moſt probable Method for gaining on his Proteſtants of</hi> England, <hi>by whoſe means only he muſt expect, if ever, to be reſetled in his Throne.</hi> To this the Lord (who is one of the beſt ſenſe amongſt them, and coming with the King from <hi>France,</hi> does certainly know all their deſigned Meaſures) made this Return; <hi>That his Majeſty was naturally Merciful and Compaſſionate, and that he would, as far as he could, prevent all Injuries to any of his Subjects: But for doing this with the Deſign you mention, or for his truſting his Proteſtants, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you 'tis far from his Thoughts: Both he and we had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould hazard and loſe Forty Crowns, than be obliged to his Proteſtants for the Poſſeſſion of his Kingdoms. He can never expect to come in by their means, unleſs tied and fettered with Conditions, which he cannot, nor ſhall not obſerve to them. 'Tis by the Force of the Arms of his good Catholicks, and by Aſſiſtance from the Glorious Monarch of</hi> France, <hi>that he deſigns to regain his Dominions: And then he comes in free and boundleſs, like an Abſolute Conquerour, and ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards do what he pleaſes.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59211:5"/>By this we may plainly ſee, what King <hi>James,</hi> by Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from King <hi>Lewis,</hi> deſigns. And if after all this, the Eyes of the Nation are not enlightned, we are all deſtin'd <q>to Ruine and Miſery.</q> But, thanks to God, in a great meaſure, theſe Proceedings of King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> have had their natural Effect on ſeveral good Proteſtants, that before were pretty well inclined to his Government; but by theſe moſt unreaſonable Methods which he has taken in <hi>Ireland,</hi> contrary to their expectation, and his own viſible Intereſt, they are clearly taken off, and have abandoned him to be deſtroyed by the Meaſures ſet him by <hi>France;</hi> and are reſolved to ſtick firm to the Proteſtant Intereſt, under Their Majeſties King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> on whoſe auſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Government the Proteſtant Religion, not only of theſe Kingdoms, but of all <hi>Europe,</hi> does wholly rely.</p>
            <p>For ſhould King <hi>James</hi> ſucceed in his Deſigns, we may plainly ſee what we are to be brought to: And after that, what will follow? We ſhall be made a Prey to <hi>France,</hi> whoſe reſtleſs Contrivances have been bringing that about theſe Twenty Years, for which this ſeems to be the moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Opportunity that ever preſented. <hi>Holland</hi> muſt certainly expect to be ſuddenly deſtroy'd by that ambitious Monarch; and then I propoſe it to the Conſideration of all thinking Men, whether he will let <hi>England</hi> be quiet, tho' under the Government of his Dearly beloved Catholick Brother King <hi>James?</hi> No certainly, he knows well enough, that King <hi>James</hi> has neither the Conduct nor Power to defend his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions from his Powerful Arms: He has lately ſupply'd him with Money, Ammunition, and Arms, in great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and is yet making greater Preparations for him at <hi>Breſt,</hi> deſigning to Land an Army of Forty or Fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>French</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> or ſome other of theſe Kingdoms, on purpoſe to conquer them. And can we think, that he does all this meerly out of a Principle of Generoſity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, for Re eſtabliſhing his Brother? All the World knows, the <hi>French</hi> King's Generoſity extends no farther than his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; and in his moſt glorious Archievements, he has his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59211:5"/>
ſecret Deſigns. What then can he more reaſonably intend, than that one day or other <hi>England</hi> may be brought to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Account for theſe vaſt Expences; and the Non repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, may be a ſufficient Pretence of War, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleaſes? Moreover, we may plainly ſee, the <hi>French</hi> King uſes King <hi>James</hi> in this Juncture meerly as a Stalking-Horſe, over whoſe Back he deſigns to render himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of theſe Kingdoms. By his Covert he has already got ſtrong Footing in <hi>Ireland;</hi> All there is tranſacted, even at this time, by King <hi>Lewis:</hi> King <hi>James</hi> has only the empty Name; Monſieur <hi>d'Avaux</hi> gives all Inſtructions, and was ſent there by the <hi>French</hi> King ſo to do. The <hi>French</hi> Officers manage the War againſt the poor Remains of ſtrugling <hi>Engliſh</hi> there: Only King <hi>James</hi>'s Name is uſed; but he has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in the whole Affair. And even in the Treaſury for Disburſing the Money, 'tis perform'd ſolely by a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer ſent out of <hi>France;</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> has no more Power in the Matter, than the King of <hi>Bantam:</hi> And ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Iriſh</hi> Officers are diſplaced, to give way for thoſe <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries. So that already we may reckon his <hi>French</hi> Majeſty ſole Maſter and King of <hi>Ireland.</hi> If therefore theſe Meaſures are taken there, what may we ſuddenly expect in this Place? The ſame <hi>French</hi> Power that has ſeized on that miſerable Kingdom, will ſoon overſpread this, unleſs we unanimouſly unite together under their Majeſties King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> for oppoſing this Deluge of Tyranny that threatens us. And in doing this, we may plainly ſee, that we oppoſe not King <hi>James;</hi> his Name is an empty Sound, uſed only as a Cheat upon the People: 'Tis the Great <hi>Lewis,</hi> the Tyrannical <hi>Lewis,</hi> that implacable cruel Enemy to the Reformed Religion, whom we oppoſe. He has of late been ſo puff'd up with theſe nauſeous Flatteries offered him by his Barbarous Clergy, for his glorious Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Hereſie, that he will venture half his Kingdoms at this Juncture, to render himſelf Maſter of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he may practiſe the ſame Cruelties here, for bringing us over to the deteſtable Abominations of <hi>Rome.</hi> And when the Proteſtant Religion is ſuppreſſed in <hi>Holland</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59211:6"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> there's an end of it over the Face of <hi>Europe.</hi> In <hi>France</hi> 'tis already vaniſh'd, and the Leſſer States of <hi>Germany</hi> will ſoon be reduced: So that at preſent the univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of all the Proteſtant Princes ſeems ingaged in this Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. And as we cannot miſtruſt God's good Providence in preſerving our pure Reformed Religion, notwithſtanding all Attempts of Wicked Men; ſo we cannot doubt of an hearty and unanimous Agreement of all Good Men to the only viſible Means for the effecting thereof; which is an intire Adherence to Their Majeſties King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in whom, as our late Deliverance, ſo our future Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeems wholly wrapt up. Under their Government, if <hi>Great Britain</hi> will be at unity in it ſelf, <hi>Great Britain</hi> will be ſafe and happy: Happy in a Pure Religion, Juſt Laws and Liberties, and a flouriſhing Trade. <hi>Holland,</hi> our Potent Allie, will be able to ſecure it ſelf, and help us; and in ſo doing, to confirm the Proteſtant Intereſt all over <hi>Europe.</hi> And all other the Injured Princes of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> will be able to take their juſt Revenges againſt <hi>France,</hi> that aſpiring Monarch, who, to gratifie his Ambition, has baſely abuſed all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Europe.</hi> Wherefore their Intereſt ſeems alſo involved in the preſent Affair, and they are obliged to hinder the <hi>French</hi> Tyrant from trampling theſe Nations under foot. I hope I need ſay no more to make us unite. I ſhall add but one word to the ſcrupulous Clergy-men, ſome of whom do yet ſeem to heſitate and make a pauſe. Is it for fear of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Church, that you do thus? (And I ſee no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you can poſſibly pretend.) Is it that you fear the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be undermined by ſome other Reformers? <q>Conſider with your ſelves, whether we ought to ſtand upon the Intereſt of any one Church or Congregation, when the Concern of the Univerſal Proteſtant Church is in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard? Can you expect, if King <hi>Lewis</hi> (for I will not mention King <hi>James,</hi> as being only a pretended Name, as he himſelf, if he had any Conſideration, may perceive) Can you expect, I ſay, that either you, your Churches, or Religion ſhall be preſerved? No certainly, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, except you are blind.</q> What then remains to be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59211:6"/>
done? Let us unanimouſly joyn in our Prayers to Heaven, in behalf of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> That God would protect and preſerve them, and ſtrengthen their Hands to the accompliſhing that great Work which they have ſo happily begun, and hitherto ſo ſucceſsfully carried on with the joint conſent of both Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein all things have hitherto been carried on, for the Advantage of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and by God's Bleſſing and our own Unity will ſo continue. But if by our own Diviſions and Animoſities amongſt our ſelves, we give King <hi>Lewis</hi> a ſignal Opportunity of deſtroying us, we ſhall be the moſt contemptible, as well as the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Nation upon Earth, and our Ruine will come upon us unpitied. How ridiculous will it appear in the Eyes of the preſent Generation, and how deſpicable will it found in the Ears of Poſterity, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation (hitherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for its Wiſdom and Conſtancy) ſhould thus happily begin and carry on their own Deliverance and Security, and in the Middle way reſign both to a perpetual Overthrow.</p>
