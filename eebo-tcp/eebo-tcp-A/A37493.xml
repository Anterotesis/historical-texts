            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Doctrine <hi>of</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisms <hi>hath been dark and obscure in the Church, from the very Primitive Times, and hath had more of</hi> Humane Notion, <hi>than of</hi> Divine Truth <hi>in it; and therefore</hi> Zuinglius, <hi>Writing, touching this Point, speaks thus in the beginning of his Book, Entituled,</hi> De Baptis. Tom. 2. f. 57. Illud mihi ingenuè cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca libri initium dicendum est, ferè omnes eos, quotquot ab

ipsis Apostolorum temporibus, de Baptismo scribere institue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, non in paucis (quod pace omnium hominum dictum esse velim) à scopo aberravisse: <hi>That is,</hi> In the beginning of my Book (<hi>saith he</hi>) I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously Profess, that almost all those that have undertaken to write of Baptism, even from the very times of the Apostles, have (which I desire may be spoken with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of all) not in a few things erred from the scope. <hi>And as he affirms, that almost all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him had erred in many things touching Baptism, so did he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self also err as well as they, not in a few: And it is as free for</hi>

               <hi>me, or any Body else, to differ from him and other late Writers, as for them to differ from former Writers; especially if that be true which Godly and Learned</hi> Chemnitius <hi>affirms out of</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, <hi>that these things are not</hi> tanquam articuli fidei, a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus diversum sentire piaculum sit Anathemate dignum, <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit.</hi> Examen Concil.

               <hi>And therefore, Reader, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thee before hand that, in this Point, I shall speak much</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise <hi>than all former or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Writers whatever, that I have met with: And though I do not; without some</hi> Fear <hi>and</hi> Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, <hi>dissent from so many</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

            <head>THE DOCTRINE OF <hi>Baptisms,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Lord,</hi> fore-seeing how great an Evil it would be in the <hi>Church,</hi> to leave Men either to their own or other Men's <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Iudgment</hi> in the things of God, did, in the very beginning of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> command and bind all the Faithful, to hear <hi>Christ</hi> alone; saying from <hi>Heaven</hi> (that we might give absolute <hi>credit</hi> to his Voice) <hi>This is my Beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, hear him:</hi> And the more the <hi>Faithful</hi> have kept to the <hi>Word</hi> of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105740:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Christ,</hi> the more they have been free from <hi>Error;</hi> and the more they have left <hi>this,</hi> and turned aside after the <hi>Doctrines of Men,</hi> (though Men in some measure <hi>Faithful</hi> and <hi>Holy</hi>) the more have they been <hi>perverted</hi> and <hi>seduced;</hi> insomuch that the <hi>true Church of God,</hi> and the very <hi>faithful</hi> themselves, have received, held, and maintained divers <hi>Errors.</hi> and <hi>False Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> even for many Ages and Generations; yea and have not been altogether free from some, from the very <hi>Apostles</hi> times: And because many or most <hi>Godly,</hi> Men in former Ages, held such and such <hi>Opinions,</hi> therefore the <hi>following</hi> Ages have taken them upon <hi>trust</hi> from them, and have entertained them as <hi>sure</hi> and <hi>certain,</hi> though not at all <hi>consulting</hi> in those points, with the great <hi>Doctor</hi> and <hi>Apostle</hi> of the New Testament, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> And thus have the very <hi>Elect</hi> themselves been drawn into <hi>much Error,</hi> though they have still
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105740:6"/>
had <hi>Christ</hi> for their <hi>Foundation,</hi> and were <hi>built</hi> on him so firmly by Faith, that the <hi>Gates of Hell could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, to free the <hi>Faithful</hi> from the <hi>former mistake,</hi> (and consequently from all <hi>Error</hi>) there is no other way than this, <hi>wholly to forsake the Doctrines of Men,</hi> and to <hi>lay by</hi> all those <hi>Opinions</hi> that we have sucked in from our very <hi>Cradles,</hi> and which are now become even a <hi>Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> to us; I say, utterly to <hi>lay by,</hi> and wholly to forget all these things, and to come <hi>immediately</hi> to the <hi>pure unerring Word of God,</hi> and to the Voice of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> himself by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> wherein all things are <hi>true, sincere</hi> and <hi>perfect;</hi> and not bring <hi>Hearts</hi> to the <hi>Word,</hi> that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possest with <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> Learned of <hi>Men,</hi> but to come thither with Hearts and Consciences <hi>free</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged,</hi> and in all meekness uprightness and simplicity of Heart, to hear what <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105740:7"/>
and <hi>true Witness,</hi> will say to his <hi>Spirit,</hi> which also is the <hi>Spirit of Truth;</hi> and to receive and believe <hi>that alone,</hi> though never so <hi>differing</hi> from the <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> of this <hi>present Age,</hi> as well as of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and though perhaps the <hi>whole Nation</hi> would be <hi>offended</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>Course</hi> that I have observed, to come to some <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>certain Knowledge</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Baptism:</hi> For having <hi>Read much,</hi> and <hi>Discoursed</hi> with <hi>many</hi> touching this <hi>Point,</hi> and having <hi>seriously</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what they <hi>say,</hi> as <hi>one</hi> that searched after the <hi>Truth,</hi> for it self only, and for the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of my <hi>own Soul;</hi> I do prosess, I could not find <hi>any thing</hi> almost spoken, for my Spirit <hi>boldly</hi> and <hi>safely</hi> to lean on, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>most</hi> of what they <hi>said,</hi> to be but the <hi>Apprehensions</hi> and <hi>Thoughts</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and that they spake very much by <hi>Conjecture</hi> and at <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty</hi> in this matter: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I resolved, <hi>wholly</hi> to withdraw
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105740:7"/>
from such <hi>Discourse,</hi> and to <hi>lay down</hi> whatever <hi>Opinions</hi> I had before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained touching this <hi>Point,</hi> and to come to the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>manifest Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> &amp; from <hi>thence</hi> (after much seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God) to <hi>learn</hi> whatever the <hi>Lord</hi> should please to <hi>teach</hi> me; <hi>chusing</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>build</hi> on the <hi>clear Word,</hi> though <hi>alone,</hi> than on any <hi>uncertian inferences</hi> and <hi>blind conjectures</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> tho' imbraced and magnified by <hi>all</hi> the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, in this <hi>inquiry</hi> from the <hi>Word,</hi> I met with that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. where the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaking of some of the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>initial points</hi> of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> names <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105740:10"/>
Him, touching his <hi>Baptism with the Spirit, was not yet</hi> fulfilled, but was <hi>shortly</hi> to be fulfilled, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 4, 5, <hi>Christ being Assembled with the Apostles, commanded them that they should not depart from</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>but wait for the Promise of the Father, which,</hi> saith he, <hi>you have heard of me; for</hi> John <hi>truly Baptizeth with Water, but ye shall be Baptized with the Spirit, not many Days hence;</hi> and this was fulfilled at the Day of <hi>Pentecost;</hi> whence it is evident, that <hi>Christ's Baptism</hi> did not <hi>go along</hi> with <hi>Iohn</hi>'s, and make that up <hi>one entire Baptism</hi> with it <hi>self,</hi> seeing it <hi>followed</hi> almost <hi>four Years</hi> after; and therefore <hi>Iohn's Baptism</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi>'s must needs be <hi>distinct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It is evident, that <hi>Christ</hi>'s Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism and <hi>Iohn</hi>'s were <hi>distinct,</hi> in as much as the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> was necessary for those <hi>very Persons,</hi> who had <hi>before</hi> been Baptized with the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Iohn,</hi> whereas if <hi>Iohn's Baptism</hi> had been <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:105740:11"/>
with <hi>Christ;</hi> that only had been <hi>sufficient;</hi> but now, those whom <hi>Iohn</hi> had Baptized with <hi>Water, Christ</hi> was to Baptize again with th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Spirit,</hi> as in that place before mentioned; I have <hi>Baptized you with Water, but one comes after me, who</hi> shall <hi>Baptize you with the Spirit;</hi> even <hi>you</hi> whom I have before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with <hi>Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And this was not a <hi>second Baptism,</hi> but the <hi>first Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> of the <hi>New Testament, Iohn</hi>'s Baptism being more <hi>Legal</hi> than <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical;</hi> and <hi>Evangelical</hi> only in so much, as it pointed out this <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> at hand.</p>
            <p>Again, The <hi>Baptist</hi> himself saith, <hi>I have need to be Baptized of thee;</hi> so that the very <hi>Author</hi> or chief <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Water Baptism</hi> stood in need of <hi>Spiritual Baptism</hi> himself: <hi>Paul</hi> also, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. when he found cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Disciples Baptized only with the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Iohn,</hi> he Baptized them <hi>again</hi> in the <hi>Name of Christ,</hi> because they had not received the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105740:11"/>
               <hi>Spirit;</hi> and <hi>this Baptism</hi> into the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> was not the <hi>repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of any <hi>Water,</hi> but meerly the <hi>Gift of the Spirit;</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> Preached to them largely the Doctrine of <hi>Faith in Christ,</hi> (for the <hi>Text</hi> relates but the <hi>Abstract</hi> of the thing) and <hi>laid his hands</hi> on them, and through his <hi>Ministry</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> came upon them; and this was <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Baptism</hi> indeed, and no <hi>renewing</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> at all, as the <hi>Anabaptist</hi> would fain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force from this place.</p>
            <p>By these things, it is evident that <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>'s are <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct;</hi> and therefore as what <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>joyned,</hi> no <hi>Man</hi> ought to put <hi>asunder,</hi> so what <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>put asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> no <hi>Man</hi> ought to <hi>joyn;</hi> as if the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> were <hi>insufficient</hi> and <hi>incompleat,</hi> except we should add to it the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Iohn;</hi> which is exceedingly to eclipse the <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as to draw <hi>

                  <hi>Spiritually,</hi> he did not <hi>that</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> but as <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Believer:</hi> And so the <hi>same Iohn,</hi> in regard of his <hi>Baptists Office,</hi> belonged to the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> but according to the <hi>Revelation</hi> which he had from the <hi>Father</hi> touching <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Faith</hi> in him, and <hi>Confession</hi> of him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the <hi>New,</hi> And except we learn thus to <hi>distinguish</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to wit, what he Preached as <hi>Baptist,</hi> and in his <hi>Proper Office,</hi> and what as a <hi>Believer,</hi> who had the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> we shall never understand his <hi>Baptism</hi> aright: For <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Baptism</hi> was the <hi>Seal</hi> of his <hi>Old Testament</hi>-Doctrine, and not of his <hi>New,</hi> or of his <hi>own</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <hi>Ministry,</hi> and not of <hi>Christ</hi>'s; at the highest, <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Ministry</hi> and <hi>Baptism</hi> pointed out <hi>Christ,</hi> but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them were the same with <hi>Christ</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>And thus having cleared from the <hi>Word,</hi> that <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Baptism</hi> is <hi>distinct</hi> from <hi>Christ</hi>'s, I shall proceed to speak

               <p>2. <hi>Christ himself,</hi> who was born under the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>subject</hi> to the <hi>Law,</hi> submited himself also to the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as the <hi>last</hi> and <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest Ceremony,</hi> Mat. 3. 13. <hi>Then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Iesus from</hi> Galilee <hi>to</hi> Jordan <hi>to be Baptized of him;</hi> and so Christ who had submitted himself to the <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> submitted himself also to the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Iohn;</hi> and as he submitted himself to all the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> not for his own sake, but for ours, so also to the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Iohn.</hi> For seeing <hi>Christ</hi> was free from Sin, he stood in no need of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and so not of that <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> which was the <hi>Baptism of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for the Remission of Sin;</hi> but there the <hi>Head,</hi> who was <hi>free</hi> from Sin, was Baptized for the <hi>Body,</hi> which was full of Sin, <hi>that he might</hi>

                  <hi>fulfil all Righteousness</hi> in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

               <p>Thus it appears, that the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> was very <hi>Honourable,</hi> and of <hi>high Account</hi> in its <hi>time,</hi> so that the very <hi>Disciples</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> took it up, and <hi>Christ</hi> himself suffered them, because <hi>Iohn's Baptism</hi> was the <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Fore-runner</hi> of His, and because the time of his own Baptism was not yet <hi>come;</hi> but <hi>Christ</hi> himself used it not, as <hi>Iohn</hi> witnesses Chap. 4. 2. saying, <hi>Iesus himself Baptized not, but his Disciples;</hi> to wit, with <hi>Iohn's Baptism,</hi> which was <hi>Water-Baptism.</hi> For it became not the <hi>Son of God</hi> to <hi>Baptize</hi> with a <hi>Creature;</hi> nor the <hi>Lord</hi> of all to use the <hi>Baptism</hi> of a <hi>Servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus having shewed how <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Iohn's</hi> Baptism was in it <hi>self,</hi> (wherein I conceive I have not done

him, though a <hi>Servant,</hi> the least Prejudice, but have <hi>fully</hi> attributed to his <hi>Office,</hi> whatever the <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>He himself</hi> a Messenger from God attributes to it) I shall now proceed to shew, <hi>That the Baptism of</hi> John, <hi>how Honourable and Excellent soever, is yet far beneath and below</hi> Christ's; <hi>yea, and most Weak and Imperfect in comparison of his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For first, <hi>Iohn's</hi> Baptism was with a <hi>Creature,</hi> with the <hi>Element of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> for the <hi>Creature</hi> could <hi>Baptize</hi> but with the <hi>Creature;</hi> that is, <hi>Iohn</hi> with <hi>Water;</hi> and so this was far <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath</hi> the Baptism of Christ, which was the Work of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> the Work of the <hi>Father</hi> by the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Son</hi> by the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Iohn's</hi> Baptism was <hi>tantum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius lavacrum,</hi> but <hi>Outward,</hi> and reached the <hi>Outward Man</hi> only; the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> reached but the <hi>Body,</hi> and it could pierce no <hi>deeper;</hi> and after all the washing of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105740:16"/>
as full of <hi>Filth, Sin</hi> and <hi>Corruption</hi> as ever; and so it was far beneath Christ's, which reaches the <hi>Soul:</hi> The <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>John</hi> was the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Bodies,</hi> but the Baptism of Christ the Baptism of Souls; and only the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> reaches the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and attains to the Soul, Conscience, and Inner Man, to Purge and Purifie them.</p>
               <p>3. The Baptism of <hi>Iohn</hi> was but a <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Ceremony,</hi> though it had more <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> in it, than any of the <hi>Signs</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> as being nearer to Christ, and more newly revived by God; and so thought useful in its <hi>Season,</hi> yet the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of it (after the manner of all Signs) was but weak.</p>
               <p>For <hi>first,</hi> It did not <hi>give the Spirit,</hi> one drop of the Spirit; yea some who were Baptized with <hi>Iohn's Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> did not <hi>know the VVay of the Lord</hi> perfectly; that is, had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of Christ, the only Way to God, as <hi>Apollos, Acts.</hi> 18.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105740:16"/>
yea, some of them did not so much as know, <hi>whether there were any Holy Ghost or no,</hi> as those Twelve Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. much less had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Neither did it <hi>give Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Remission of Sin;</hi> (for what was the Plunging of a Man in <hi>cold VVater</hi> towards <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Remission of Sin?</hi>) but these were the Works of Christ's own Baptism, which is the Baptism of the Spirit: For no Man can repent of Sin, but by the <hi>Presence</hi> of the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of God in his Heart, which is the work of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is given in <hi>Christ's Baptism:</hi> Neither can any remit Sin but God: Our Sins are never forgiven by <hi>God,</hi> till <hi>God</hi> dwell in us through <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> by the Work of the Spirit: So that <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> was given, and Sin forgiven, not in hope only in <hi>Iohn's Baptism,</hi> but really and truly in <hi>Christ's,</hi> which was the real Baptism of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Remission</hi> of Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:105740:17"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Neither did it <hi>give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance</hi> into the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> for the Kingdom of God is a <hi>Spiritual Kingdom,</hi> and no <hi>Earthly</hi> or <hi>Corporal</hi> thing can give entrance into it: The <hi>Baptism</hi> in the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Iordan</hi> could deliver no Man up into the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> but the <hi>Baptism in that River</hi> that <hi>makes glad the City of God,</hi> Psal. 46. 4. in that <hi>River clear as Christal, that proceeds from the Throne of God and of the Lamb,</hi> which is the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which delivers up all that partake of it, <hi>first,</hi> into the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>after</hi> thro' that into the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of the <hi>Father.</hi> The <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> left Men in that <hi>Old World,</hi> wherein it found them, but the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> delivers them up into the <hi>new World,</hi> or the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, in all these <hi>Regards,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Baptism</hi> did not do the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Baptism</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> for then that only had been <hi>sufficient,</hi> and there had been no need <hi>of Christ</hi> to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:105740:17"/>And thus you see that the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as it is <hi>Distinct</hi> from <hi>Christ's,</hi> so it is far <hi>Inferiour</hi> to <hi>His.</hi> And therefore great hath been the <hi>mistake</hi> of many, for <hi>several Ages,</hi> who have made <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Baptism equal</hi> to <hi>Christs;</hi> for what is this but to make the <hi>Servant</hi> equal to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and to set down the <hi>Creature</hi> in the <hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>only begotten</hi> of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Tea,</hi> and it is the quite <hi>pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Office,</hi> for <hi>Iohn</hi> was to be a <hi>burning and shining Light,</hi> to usher in Christ the <hi>true Light:</hi> He was to be as the <hi>Morning-star</hi> to usher in Christ the <hi>Son of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and was not to be so much <hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>Darkness</hi> to obscure him: He was but to <hi>point</hi> out Christ, and <hi>depart</hi> again, and not to sit in equal <hi>Glory</hi> with him, on his <hi>Throne</hi> in the <hi>New Testament. Iohn</hi> said, He was not worthy to bear his <hi>Shoes;</hi> and therefore they do not well, who have prepared an <hi>equal Crown</hi> for him with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105740:18"/>
Christ, who is <hi>King of Kings; and Lord of Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore we must take great <hi>heed</hi> that we do not so <hi>magnifie Iohn</hi>'s Office, as to <hi>intrench</hi> on <hi>Christ</hi>'s, and to make the <hi>Son,</hi> out of the <hi>Bosom</hi> of <hi>the Father,</hi> to take up the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> a <hi>Servant,</hi> and to Administer one, <hi>entirely his own;</hi> surely this would not have been <hi>suitable</hi> to the <hi>Glory of the only begotten Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing I propound to speak to, touching <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Baptism,</hi> is the <hi>Time of its Durance</hi> or <hi>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> and that was but <hi>very short:</hi> For <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Baptism,</hi> as all the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> was but for a <hi>time;</hi> yea, <hi>This</hi> being nearer the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> than <hi>they,</hi> was of <hi>less Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> as the <hi>Morning-Star,</hi> though <hi>brighter</hi> than the rest of those <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> Lights, shines less while than <hi>they,</hi> because the hasty <hi>Appearance</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> swallows it up: And so <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Baptism</hi> was of great <hi>use</hi> a little before <hi>Christ's Manifestation</hi> to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105740:18"/>
                  <hi>Israel,</hi> and continued till the time of his <hi>Ascension;</hi> and then, when <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Baptism</hi> began, the <hi>Shadow</hi> was to give way to the <hi>Substance,</hi> and the <hi>Sign</hi> to the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Letter</hi> to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Servant</hi> to the <hi>Son:</hi> So that <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Baptism</hi> put an end to <hi>Iohn</hi>'s, <hi>Free-Baptism</hi> to <hi>Water-Baptism,</hi> and <hi>Spirit-Baptism</hi> to <hi>Creature-Baptism:</hi> For as all the <hi>Prophets</hi> were until <hi>Iohn,</hi> so <hi>Iohn</hi> was until <hi>Christ;</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> must no more <hi>exceed his</hi> bounds, than <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets theirs;</hi> but as the <hi>Prophets</hi> gave up to <hi>Iohn,</hi> so <hi>Iohn</hi> must give up to <hi>Christ. Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Ministry</hi> had a <hi>Temporary Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;</hi> but the <hi>Everlasting Gospel,</hi> (which is, <hi>that</hi> Word in <hi>our</hi> Flesh) hath an <hi>Everlasting Baptism,</hi> which is <hi>the pouring out of the Spirit.</hi> So then, <hi>Iohn</hi> being a <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner</hi> of Christ, <hi>Christ</hi> was not to take up <hi>his Baptism,</hi> but <hi>Iohn</hi> was to <hi>resign</hi> up <hi>his Baptism</hi> to <hi>Christ;</hi> yea, and as a <hi>Servant</hi> to deliver up
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105740:19"/>
                  <hi>all things</hi> into <hi>his</hi> hands, as <hi>Heir</hi> and <hi>Lord:</hi> And so <hi>Iohn's VVater-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> was to last but till Christ's <hi>Fire-Baptism</hi> should come in, and then the <hi>Fire</hi> should <hi>lick</hi> up the <hi>VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> and as <hi>Spirit Baptism</hi> should <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, VVater-Baptism</hi> should <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</hi> So that <hi>Iohn's Baptism</hi> or <hi>VVater-Baptism</hi> (which is all one) belongs not to <hi>Christ's Kingdom,</hi> which is a <hi>Kingdom</hi> not of the <hi>Letter,</hi> but of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> not of <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> but of the <hi>Truth:</hi> And therefore we <hi>leave</hi> it where we <hi>found</hi> it, even without the <hi>bounds</hi> and <hi>reach</hi> of Christ's <hi>Kingdom:</hi> For <hi>Iohn's Office</hi> and <hi>Baptism</hi> reached <hi>unto Christ's Kingdom,</hi> but hath no place <hi>in</hi> it; and to bring <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> into the Kingdom of <hi>Truth,</hi> is (if rightly understood) to act against <hi>Christ Glorified.</hi>

                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:105740:28"/>
of the <hi>Spirit</hi> by the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> to be the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> or the <hi>Baptism</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> which Christ promised at his <hi>Ascension</hi> into Heaven.</p>
               <p>And this is the <hi>only Baptism</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>New Testament</hi> are to partake with <hi>Christ,</hi> I say not the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Water,</hi> but of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: He</hi> and <hi>we</hi> drinking into one <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the same <hi>Spirit</hi> descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>Us</hi> as did on <hi>Him. The pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> out of the <hi>Spirit</hi> on the <hi>Flesh</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> was his <hi>New Testament Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> and it is ours too; and all our <hi>true</hi> and <hi>sound comfort</hi> and <hi>happiness</hi> lies in <hi>this,</hi> that <hi>we</hi> are <hi>Baptized</hi> with the same <hi>Spirit</hi> that. <hi>He</hi> was; for it would be as little <hi>Spiritual Comfort</hi> to be dipped in the <hi>same VVater</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> as to <hi>eat</hi> with him at the <hi>same Table,</hi> or to <hi>drink</hi> with him in the <hi>same Cup,</hi> or to go along with him in the <hi>same Ship,</hi> as <hi>Iudas</hi> did, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the <hi>unbelieving Iews;</hi> but to <hi>drink</hi> with him in <hi>one Spirit,</hi> is to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105740:29"/>
partake of <hi>one Flesh</hi> with him, and to be <hi>one Christ</hi> with him; and this is a <hi>Comfort</hi> indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Outward Instrument</hi> of Christ's, or <hi>Spirit-Baptism,</hi> is not <hi>Material Water,</hi> but the <hi>VVord,</hi> as Christ shews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. where he saith, <hi>Teach and Baptize,</hi> shewing that <hi>Teaching the VVord</hi> is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of <hi>Baptizing</hi> with the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And again, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. <hi>Now are you clean through the Word,</hi> not which <hi>Moses,</hi> but <hi>which I have spoken to you</hi> (and therefore is the <hi>Gospel</hi> called the <hi>Ministration</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> because it <hi>proceeds</hi> from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Communicates</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> Baptizes with the <hi>Spirit</hi> thro' the <hi>Ministration of the Spirit,</hi> which is the Preaching of the <hi>Gospel</hi>) and <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26. <hi>Christ gave himself for his Church that he might sanctifie and cleanse it,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>with the washing of Water by the</hi> Word; that is, <hi>Christ</hi> cleanses his <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>such</hi> a washing of <hi>VVater,</hi> as is
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105740:29"/>
brought about by the <hi>VVord</hi> and the <hi>VVater</hi> with which the <hi>VVord</hi> washes in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> for by the <hi>VVord</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> is given, and the <hi>VVord</hi> clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> by the <hi>VVord:</hi> And therefore it is also said, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Having</hi> these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, <hi>Let us cleanse our selves from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all this it appears, that <hi>Spirit-Baptism</hi> is not to be performed by <hi>Water,</hi> but by the <hi>Word;</hi> and no Man under the <hi>New Testament,</hi> receives the <hi>Spirit</hi> through the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Water,</hi> but through the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which is the only <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, this <hi>Baptism</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is performed only by the <hi>Word,</hi> is <hi>that Baptism</hi> of which so many <hi>excellent things</hi> are spoken in the <hi>New Testament:</hi> As,</p>
               <p>1. This <hi>Baptism</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> gives a <hi>new Nature,</hi> and this <hi>Nature</hi> is a <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> or the <hi>Nature of God;</hi> and hence it is said, <hi>Exept a</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:105740:30"/>
                  <hi>Man be born of Water and the Spirit;</hi> So that the <hi>Baptism</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> gives a <hi>new Birth,</hi> and so a <hi>new Nature:</hi> And again, <hi>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit;</hi> so that the <hi>Baptism</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> makes us <hi>Spirit,</hi> and through the <hi>Baptism</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> we become that which the <hi>Spirit it self</hi> is: And so the true Foundation of <hi>Christianity</hi> begins from <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>new Creature,</hi> and not from <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>washing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. This <hi>Baptism</hi> gives a <hi>new Name,</hi> not <hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Thomas,</hi> &amp;c. but as Christ saith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>I will write upon him</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>my new Name:</hi> Our <hi>own Name</hi> is <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>Injustice,</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>Covetousness</hi> and <hi>Uncleanness,</hi> and <hi>all Evil;</hi> and this is the Name which the first <hi>Adam</hi> wrote upon; but the Name the second <hi>Adam</hi> writes on us, is <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Meekness,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>all Good,</hi> and this is the Name the second <hi>Adam</hi> writes on us,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105740:30"/>
or his own new Name; for Christ himself was Baptized by the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Name of God; that is, was taken up into God, and the things of God, which are Himself, as into the Truth, Wisdom, Justice, Mercy, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all the whole Flesh or Humanity of Christ, even all his Members are Baptized into the same Name of God with Him, and so are called by his new Name; So that this Name of Christ, this new Name which is given us by God through the Baptism of the Spirit, is infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that Name which is given us by <hi>Parents</hi> or <hi>God-fathers</hi> in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptism.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Christ's Baptism</hi> translates us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new World: <hi>Except a Man be born of that Water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God:</hi> No Man can possibly enter into the Church of the New Testament, which is the Kingdom of God, but through the Baptism of the Spirit; the Baptism of the Spirit makes a new
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105740:31"/>
Creature, and this new Creature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into a new World, which is the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that comes down from God out of Heaven.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Spirit-Baptism</hi> inables us to the same Work with Christ, that is, to the Ministry of the New Testament, saith Christ, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he hath Anointed me to Preach,</hi> Isa. 61. 1. And he began his Ministry from his Spirit-Baptism, which did immediately follow his Water-Baptism, but was in no sort one Baptism with it; and having, thro' the opening the Heavens, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit which taught him the Name of God, he presently began to Teach the Name of God to others, and Christ himself was not a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the New Testament but thro' the Baptism of the Spirit. Now all Believers that are Anointed with him in his Unction, or which is all one, are Baptized with him in one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of Spirit, are Anointed and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized to the same Ministry: For the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105740:31"/>
Anointing of the Spirit is the teaching of God, and they that are taught of God themselves, ought also to teach others: and the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of Prophecy, and they that have received that Spirit must Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, as it is written, <hi>It shall come to pass in the last days, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Flesh, and your Sons and Daughters shall Prophecy;</hi> which very place <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to the Baptism of the Spirit; so that this Spirit-Baptism of Christ, makes all Prophets that partake of it.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Spirit-Baptism</hi> makes all those One with Christ the Head, who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>As many as have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>been Baptized into Christ have put on Christ;</hi> so that by the true Baptism of the New Testament we do actually put on Christ, and are made one with Christ, and this is not done by any Water-washing, but by the Spirit; for through the gift of the Spirit only are we made one Flesh with Christ, yea, through this we necessarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105740:32"/>
one Spirit with him too, as it is said, <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit;</hi> so that not through Water but Spirit-Baptism do we put on Christ, the Spirit carrying Us into Christ, and bringing Christ into Us, and being one and the same Spirit in both; and this is to be Baptized into Christ.</p>
               <p>Now this Baptism that makes us one with Christ, makes us to partake hoth of his Death and Resurrection.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Through Baptism of the Spirit</hi> we are dipt into the Death of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. <hi>Know ye not that somany of us as are Baptized into Iesus Christ, are Baptized into his Death?</hi> And this is, as the <hi>Apostles</hi> unfolds it, <hi>vers.</hi> 6. <hi>The Crucifying of the old man with him, that the Body of Sin may be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve Sin:</hi> And all this is done, not through any Water-wash, but through the gift of the Spirit; for it is through the Spirit only that we are able to mortifie the deeds of the Flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and nothing but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105740:32"/>
the presence of the Spirit in us is the destruction of Sin; so that the Spirit of Christ Baptizes us into the death of Christ.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Spirit-Baptism</hi> makes us partake of his Resurrection as well as of his Death, yea, therefore do we dye with him, that we may live a better life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. <hi>Therefore we are Buried with him by Baptism</hi> (that is, Spirit-Baptism) <hi>into Death, that like as Christ was raised up from the Dead by the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Father,</hi> i. e. The Spirit, <hi>so should we also live in newness of Life; for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his Death, we shall be also in the likeness of his Resurrection,</hi> Where you see the same Baptism of the Spirit that makes us Dye with Christ, doth also quicken us into his Resurrection, and deprives us of our own Life; not that we remain Dead, but that it may communicate to us a better Life than our own, even the Life of Christ himself, that we that are Men may Live the very Life of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105740:33"/>
the Son of God in our own Souls and Bodies, and may be quickned with him, and raised up with him, and set in Heavenly places in him.</p>
               <p>6. As <hi>Spirit-Baptism</hi> makes us One with Christ the Head, so with the Church the Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>For by one Spirit are we all Baptized into one Body, whether we be</hi> Jews <hi>or</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>whether we be</hi> Bond <hi>or</hi> Free, <hi>and have been all made to drink into one Spirit;</hi> so that by drinking into one Spirit with the Church, we become one Body with it, and no other-ways: I say, not by being dipt into the same Water, but by receiving the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit do we become one Body with the Church; and it is not being of one Judgment, or Opinion, or Form, or the like, that makes Men one true Church or Body of Christ, but the being of one Spirit; and there are no more of that Church, which is the Body of Christ, than they that are Baptized with that one Spirit of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:105740:33"/>7. <hi>Spirit-Baptism</hi> it truly washes and cleanses from Sin: What Water-Baptism doth in the Sign; this doth in the Truth, even cleanses from all Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Spiritual Filthiness: And no man is cleansed from Sin but by the washing of the Spirit; the pouring forth of the Spirit on all Flesh, is the killing of Sin in all Flesh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Neither Fornicators, nor Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with Mankind, nor Theeves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extortioners, shall inherit the Kingdom of God; and such were some of you, but ye are WASHED, but ye are Sanctified in the Name of the Lord Iesus Christ by the SPIRIT of our God:</hi> So that Spirit-Baptism cleanses from all <hi>Sin</hi> whatever it is, and there is no man cleansed from <hi>Sin,</hi> but through this Baptism.</p>
               <p>And again, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26, 27. <hi>Christ gave himself for the Church, that he might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the Word, that he</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:105740:34"/>
                  <hi>might present it to himself a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish;</hi> and nothing doth thus purifie the Church, till it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>spot, wrinkle,</hi> or <hi>blemish,</hi> and till it be perfectly holy, but the Baptism of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And therefore, tho' the Baptism of <hi>Iohn</hi> was administred but once, yet the Baptism of Christ is a continued Baptism, for as long as Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is in the Flesh, the Baptism of the Spirit is in use: So that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; Life of a <hi>Christian</hi> are under a constant and continual Baptism, God every day pouring forth his Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Believer, for the purifying and sanctifying of him, and making him meet for the immediate presence of God, whither no unclean thing comes, nor the least uncleanness in any thing.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Spirit-Baptism</hi> saves: Whatever in us is washed with the Spirit, is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as well as sanctified; and how much any one hath received of the Spirit, so much is he already saved:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105740:34"/>
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>According to his mercy he hath saved us by the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit, which he shed on us abundantly, through Iesus Christ our Saviour:</hi> Where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle teaches us how God saves, and that is not by <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptism or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-washing, but by the Laver of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, which is the renewing of the Holy Spirit, poured on us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly through Christ; so that he calls the Baptism of the Spirit, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Regeneration, such a Laver as renews the old Nature, yea and begets a new One, so that a man through this Baptism is wholly changed, not in a few good Works, but in his whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and from his newness of Nature flows newness of Life, so that he is no more as he was, but is, and lives, and loves, and thinks, and speaks, and acts otherways than he was wont; and this cannot be the work of Water in any measure, but wholly of the Spirit; for where men are destitute of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, tho' washed with Water a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105740:35"/>
times, there is no change of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in them; but the change of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wrought by Spirit-Baptism, is so much present Salvation, even in this present World. There is another Scripture witnesses the same thing, and it is 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20, 21. <hi>A few (that is Eight Souls) were saved by Water, to to which figure Baptism answering, doth now also save us, not that whereby the filth of the Flesh is cast away, but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a good Conscience answers well to God by the Resurrection of Iesus Christ. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> having said that Baptism answers to the Flood, and saves the Church now, as the Flood did the Church then, yea saith he, but I mean not the outward Baptism, or the washing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the filth of the Body, but the <hi>answer of a good Conscience towards God, by the Resurrection of Iesus Christ:</hi> Which place is difficult; but I thus conceive it. The efficacy of Christ's Resurrection is the gift of the Spirit, and the Spirit of Christ, in a Believer, rectifies his Conscience, and makes it
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105740:35"/>
good, so that it can return a sweet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to God upon every word of his; for the work of the Spirit in the heart, answers every word of Faith spoken from God; particularly it can say to God, I was indeed filthy and unclean throughout, but I am now washed, and justified, and sanctified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of my God; and this Spirit-Baptism is that that saves, and not the Water, which puts away the filth of the Flesh only, but leaves the filth of the Spirit as much as ever.</p>
               <p>So that, in this place, <hi>Peter</hi> puts an end to Baptism in the Flesh, as <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 2. 28. puts an end to Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Flesh, saying, <hi>He is not a Iew which is one outwardly, neither is that Circumcision which is outward in the Flesh, but he is a Iew which is one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and Circumcision is that of the Heart in the Spirit, and not in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whose Praise is not of Men, but of God:</hi> That is, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ, where all things are
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105740:36"/>
Spiritual: Circumcision in the Spirit puts an end to Circumcision in the Flesh: And in the same Kingdom of Christ, saith <hi>Peter,</hi> Baptism in the Spirit puts an end to Baptism in the Flesh; for he is not a Christian who is one outwardly, neither is that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism which is outward in the Flesh, but he is a Christian who is one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and Baptism is that of the Heart in the Spirit, and not in the Letter, whose praise also, is not of Men but of God. For under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is the Ministration of the Spirit (as ye have been oft minded) we can find nothing among all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, through the use and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise whereof we may attain the cleanness and purity of Righteousness in our Natures; and therefore Christ hath put an end to all outward, carnal, and earthly things of the first Testament, by the Inward &amp; Spiritual &amp; Heavenly things of a second &amp; better Testament: And by his own Death and Resurrection only, not without us; but within us, through the power and efficacy of his Spirit, all the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105740:36"/>
Baptism of the New Testament is fully and perfectly performed.</p>
               <p>And thus, in all these particulars, you see the infinite excellency and glory of the Spirit-Baptism above Water-Baptism, and this only is sufficient in the Days of the Gospel, as being the True and Proper Baptism of the New Testament: For as Christ himself only is sufficient to the Faithful without <hi>Iohn,</hi> tho' <hi>Iohn</hi> were of use in this season to point our Christ; so the Baptism of Christ only is sufficient to the Faithful, without the Baptism of <hi>Iohn,</hi> tho' the Baptism of <hi>Iohn</hi> were of use in its season, to point out the Baptism of Christ; and the Baptist himself was of this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who said to Christ, <hi>I have need to be Baptised of thee;</hi> which he means not of Water-Baptism (for so Christ himself as you have heard, did not Baptize) but with the Baptism of the Spirit, and so the Baptist himself, who was never Baptized with Water, neither by Christ nor the Apostles, nor any Body else, yet was Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the Spirit, and the Baptism of the Spirit was sufficient for the Baptist, without any Water-Baptism; and so Christ's Spirit-Baptism, by the Word, is sufficient for all the faithful now, without <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Water-Baptism; for he that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105740:37"/>
washed from all filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, and hath the Holy Ghost in him to renew his nature, and to conform him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to Christ's own Image, and to work him in this present World into the true si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of Heaven, and to be in him a <hi>Fountain of Water springing up unto everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life,</hi> what need hath he of cold ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Water to be poured on his Body, under the pretence of any sign whatever, either of <hi>Moses</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> when as, he hath the Truth, Substance, and Heavenly thing it self?</p>
               <p>Now this, it may be, may seem strange and dangerous to some of low, and fleshly and customary Religion; but let all such (if it be possible) consider, that where the Substance comes; the Shadow is at an end, and the Ceremony were the Truth comes, and the Creature where God comes: And if they understand not <hi>this</hi> for the present, I hope they may understand it afterwards; for we speak not at uncertainties in this point, but what we have in some measure seen, and felt, and <hi>handled of the Word of Life, that we deliver to you, that ye may have fellowship with us? and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and his Son Iesus Christ,</hi> through the Spirit.</p>
