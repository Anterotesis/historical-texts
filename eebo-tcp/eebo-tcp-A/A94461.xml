         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That this Honorable Aſſembly will repreſent ſuch prevalent arguments to his ſacred Maieſty, and the Houſe of Peeres, that the ten thouſand men tendred by the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> and accepted of by this Honourable Aſſembly, may be ſpeedily or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to reſort into <hi>Vlſter:</hi> Not but that we doe alſo deſire there may be as great a proportion of ſouldiers ſent out of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as ſoone as they can be prepared, if ſo it may pleaſe his Maieſty and both Houſes of Parliament, the contagion of rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> having ſpread it ſelfe over ſo many other parts of the Kingdome, and yet daily more and more increaſing, as will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſervice of thoſe who ſhall be ſent out of <hi>England,</hi> for the ſubduall of the Rebels, and comfort of his Maieſties good ſubiects in the other provinces.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as your petitioners many of whoſe whole eſtates, and ſome of whoſe wives, children, and neereſt kindred and friends are already in the hands and poſſeſſion of thoſe barbarous and bloudy rebels of <hi>Vlſter,</hi> and that they may have more then ordinary cauſe to feare, that the remayning proteſtant party, together with the important Townes of <hi>Caricfargus, London-Derry</hi> and <hi>Colerane,</hi> being the chiefe Bulwarks and Fortreſſes of that Province, may for want of ſpeedieſt reliefe be ſurpriſed and deſtroyed, and by that meanes the reſt of the Kingdome extreamely indangered, to the irrepairable dammage and diſcomfort of his Maieſty, and all his good and loyall Subiects of all his dominions; Therefore your petitioners doe moſt inſtantly ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this Honourable Aſſembly, to indeavour the haſtning thither with all poſſible expedition the tenne thouſand men out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe aſſiſtance being within three houres ſaile, may be ſooneſt conveyed, and whoſe conſtitutions will notably match with the rebels, being well able (as many of theſe petitioners have knowne by former experience) to follow them through the bogges and mooriſh places (frequent in thoſe parts) during the winter ſeaſon, which other ſupplies poſſibly may not be ſo fit for at preſent; This number added to thoſe raiſed and to be raiſed in thoſe parts (through Gods bleſſing) may ſoone checke theſe inſolencies, and contribute much for reducing that kingdome to due obedience, and yeeld unſpeakable comfort, and reliefe to many thouſand diſconſolate bleeding proteſtant ſoules, who have long languiſhed in expectation of aide from that and this kingdome, the longer retarding whereof will carry loud cries to heaven againſt thoſe who cauſe the ſame.</p>
