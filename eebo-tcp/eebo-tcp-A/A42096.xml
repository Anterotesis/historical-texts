            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>That Incen≈øed God, who hath for our manifold provocations, and more particularly (wee have rea≈øon to believe) for our Carnall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the Arme of Flesh, &amp; Di≈øobedience to Gods Vice-Gerent, powred out the vialls of his wrath on three Kingdoms, is not like to be appea≈øed, without the ≈øerious practice of the contrary Graces, in a manner, as Univer≈øall, and generall, as hath been our late noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Defection towards the King, by an abhorr'd &amp; dete≈øtable Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the many ≈øacred, &amp; often repeated Oaths, whereby all ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jccts were obliged to ≈øupport his Crowne &amp; Dignity.</p>
                  <p>Such is my ≈øen≈øe of what is pa≈øt, &amp; Dread of Allmighty Gods fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Indignation, when I con≈øider that I am (how weak and unworthy ≈øoever) advanced to a publick ≈øtation in the Church of England, that I cannot ≈øatisfy my ≈øelfe, with mourning in ≈øecret, but conceive it my indi≈øpen≈øable duty to proclame (after ≈øuch a Stupendious Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution) as ≈øoon, &amp; as well, as I am able, to all per≈øons in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, my unfeigned Re≈øolution to adhere to my Soveraigne, in his di≈øtre≈øse; lea≈øt I may, by ≈øilence, contribute to the increa≈øe of that dangerous Lethargy, which hath ≈øeized on the People of England, who, by Re≈øi≈øting, &amp; at length De≈øerting, their Prince, have Apo≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized from their Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:110636:10"/>
I have helped, po≈øsibly<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> as litle as any one of my Brethren, or fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-≈øubjects, in the Nation, to the fir≈øt growth of this di≈øea≈øe, having for ≈øix &amp; tuentie years together openned my mouth widely<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> on To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, which would have prevented (had they met vvith due regard) our pre≈øent mi≈øery: &amp; for the truth whereof, I appeale to the whole Juri≈ødiction whereto I have long related.</p>
                  <p>But however I cannot think my-≈øelfe perfectly di≈øengaged to ioyn in attempting the Cure, or, at lea≈øt, to help on vvhat is, God bee than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, in ≈øome ≈øort begun, &amp; vvhereto the contradictory, &amp; prepo≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, proceedings of the Kings enimies have a≈øsi≈øted; I mean to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penning the eyes of thou≈øands in England, to ≈øee already the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of their Change, &amp; the Errors of their late method to redre≈øse Grievances; by labouring to bring their Soveraigne to Termes (all that vvas aimed at, I do in Charity beleive, by the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glands fallen ≈øons) and to deliver the Nation from Dome≈øtick Evills by calling for Forreigne A≈øsi≈øtance. ¬ß. The number of ≈øouls committed to my charge, in the Cathedrall, in my Archdeaconry, &amp; in the Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Juri≈ødiction depending on the Church of Durham, are too many, &amp; too con≈øiderable, to be forgotten, or neglected by me, now, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated othervvi≈øe to Preach to them.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ≈øame nece≈ø≈øity vvhich drove mee from my Home, at the very time vvhich my Soveraigne vvas forced to vvithdravv from his ovvne Palace, compells mee to ≈øend the≈øe, as vvell as my other, Papers, to the Pre≈øs, to shevv the manner, hovv I parted vvith my Freinds &amp; Flocks in the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of Durham, and that the la≈øt Di≈øcharge of my Archidiaconall Office in a Tyme of trouble, vvas ≈øuitable to my pa≈øt life &amp; Acttings, during more than tvventy yeares, in a time of Peace.</p>
                  <p>Hovv imperfect &amp; in≈øufficient ≈øoever both have been, I never vvanted, through Gods Grace, Re≈øolution all a long to Oppo≈øe the Subjects in croaching on the Prerogative of their King; as heartily as I have vvith-≈øtood the Dutch their Invading of the Land. It vvill be no great ground of Admiration then to all vvho throughly knovv mee, that, at ≈øuch a Iuncture, I did dare ≈øpeake plaine English, to fortify my Brethren again≈øt Temptations, and encourage them, as I have done, in their Duty to God &amp; the King. And I Ble≈øse Gods mo≈øt holy name, that hee hath been plea≈øed to be≈øtovv on mee, for the ≈øupply of my mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Defects, allvvayes Chri≈øtian Confidence, in the Pulpit, vvho have not injoyed much of it any vvhere el≈øe.</p>
                  <p>By vvhat God gave mee boldne≈øs, at that time, to speak in the ears of a large &amp; Publick Auditory of Clergy &amp; Layity (not rashly but vvith the mo≈øt mature con≈øideration that I utter'd any thing in my vvhole life) they might perceive I did not intend to ≈øtay at Durham, if my Soveraigne should bee Banish'd from his Kingdom. As by committing the ≈øame di≈øcour≈øe to the Pre≈øs, after more ≈øerious thoughts &amp; greater deliberation, all men vvill bee ea≈øily Convinced, that till my Soveraigne be re≈øtored (vvhich I do heartily pray for) I have no thoughts to returne.</p>
                  <p>Tho I found it very ea≈øy, &amp; intelligible, hovv to behave my ≈øelfe under a Roman Catholick Prince, in the di≈øcharge of all Duties, incumbent on mee, as a Right Church-of-England-Subject, or Chri≈øtian, yet mu≈øt acknovvledge that I am void of Logick &amp; other Learning to ≈øupply mee vvith di≈øtinctions, and furniture, nece≈ø≈øary to live under an V≈øurper.</p>
                  <p>And therefore if the Reader di≈øcover the vvhole cour≈øe of my life, as vvell as my vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, de≈øtitute of Craft to transforme my ≈øelfe into any shape, and change vvith the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, let him not be a≈øtonish'd; or accu≈øe mee over rigidly, for not doing that, for vvhich I am not ≈øo vvell, as others, quallified, either by nature, or education.</p>
                  <p>It hath been my fate to have ≈øuck'd in other Principles, &amp; to have been trained up under better Tutours; nay, po≈øsibly, in my vvhole <hi>Make,</hi> to be ≈øo contrived, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, that it is not in the Povver of man to nevv-mould mee, into that ≈øort of Animal, vvhich can blovv Hot &amp; Cold vvith the ≈øame Breath, and is able to ≈øave his ≈øtake, vvhat ever Card turnes up trump.</p>
                  <p>To the≈øe vvho shall condemne it in mee<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> as a deplorable piece of Madne≈øs, or folly
<pb facs="tcp:110636:30"/>
to talk or vvrite avvay ≈øuch a Con≈øiderable Revenue, as Providence &amp; my Kind Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons have be≈øtovved on mee, (vvhich I am like to do by ≈øetting my name<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> to vvhat I print) I mu≈øt declare that I am one of tho≈øe Fooles S. Paul ≈øpeakes of, vvho <hi>that I may bee vvi≈øe</hi> am vvilling, in the ≈øight of the vvorld, <hi>to become a Foole,</hi> valuing my Innocency, &amp; Quiet of Con≈øcience, more than I do the be≈øt Deanery, or Bishoprick in Chri≈øtendom. And as nothing yet hath tempted mee, I thank God, to Compliment avvay my Religion, (tho I have been by ≈øome ≈øo reproached) upon Gods rai≈øing &amp; ≈øetting over us a Prince of a different Communion. So no Con≈øideration vvhat≈øoever (I rely on Gods Grace) shall be able to prevaile vvith mee to pro≈øtitute it, by falling dovvne to adore the multitude, or any Image (tho it be of Gold) that shall be ≈øet up by the People.</p>
                  <p>Tho≈øe therefore that attack mee by arguments, or Threats, in letters, to ≈øeduce mee back, and dravv mee into a Compliance vvith the nevv Government, that I might ≈øet my hand to she rai≈øing up the Babell vvhich they are building in England, may ≈øave their labour &amp; ink. For till they have confuted the Doctrine vvhich they have preached, as vvell as the ≈øound Divinity of their Mother, vvhich they have for≈øaken, they may cea≈øe from offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mee other arguments to convince mee. And till they per≈øvvade mee to ≈øet a higher value upon my money, than I do on the Grace of God, &amp; prize my temporall intre≈øt more than mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Integrity (vvhich no magick I have yet met vvith all hath been able to effect, ≈øo as to fill my pockets) they may al≈øo forbeare to affright mee vvith Deprivation.</p>
                  <p>I have long con≈øidered, &amp; ≈øtudied the point of Allegiance, vvhich I ovve to my only Leige Lord &amp; Soveraigne King Iames <hi>2,</hi> and to no other, and am firmely vvithout doubt, or ≈øcrupule, ≈øatisfied that my Religion vvill not permitt mee to ≈øvveare fidelity to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides him.</p>
                  <p>That the greate≈øt part of my Brethren notvvith≈øtanding the faithfull &amp; frequent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours I have u≈øed to e≈øtablish them in Conformity &amp; Loyalty, should for≈øake Gods Vice-Gerent, to do Homage to the Peoples, is an unexpre≈øsible greife to my ≈øoule.</p>
                  <p>To prevent the Incurring ≈øuch guilt, and the lamentable ≈øcandall of ≈øuch Apo≈øtacy, I did in due time (as may appeare from the date of the en≈øuing Addre≈øs) expo≈øe my ≈øelfe to much cen≈øure, by delivering my mind, to an Auditory, vvhich ≈øeem'd ready to run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves (as they have done) into that Yoke &amp; ≈øervitude; vvhich I (vvho had greater tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than others) vvas re≈øolved to run out of the Kingdom, &amp; from my preferment, rather than ≈øubmit to.</p>
                  <p>And to demon≈øtrate that I am (after great thought fullne≈øs &amp; much prayer to God to direct mee) of the very ≈øame mind here in France on Nov. <hi>15. 1689,</hi> that I vvas in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland on the ≈øame day of the month <hi>1688,</hi> as vvell as de≈øirous to expre≈øse my vvillingne≈øs, to do all that in mee lyes, to avvaken tho≈øe out of their ≈øin, vvhich I could not confirme in their Duty; I am as vvilling to commit to the Pre≈øse the di≈øcour≈øe I then made.

                     <p>Wee mu≈øt not think ≈øo bla≈øphemously of the Deity, that the God of Heaven (a God of Purity &amp; Truth) can have more favour to ≈øuch a Rebellious Rout, than to a Loyall Army fighting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Royall ≈øtandard of their lavvfull Prince in defence of an antient Monarchy, &amp; mo≈øt excellent Government.</p>
                     <p>No, no wee mu≈øt not imagine, that God (who is of <hi>purer eyes than to behold any iniquity vvith approbation) can have regard to ≈øuch a Gathering together of the frovvard and In≈øurrection of VVicked Doers (as holy David heartily Prayes again≈øt in the</hi> 64. <hi>P≈øalme) vvho have vvhet their tongue like a ≈øvvord, and shoot out their Arrovvs even bitter vvords.</hi> Where Davids Character of the Wicked (you vvil ea≈øily perceive, if you vvill take, the pains to peru≈øe the whole P≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me) exactly agr√©es with our Invaders.

                  <p>A bout the End of ≈øept. la≈øt, on the fir≈øt Intelligence of the Dutch Inva≈øion, I retired to my Cures in the Country. Fir≈øt to ≈øedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild &amp; then to Ea≈øington, u≈øing my utmo≈øt zeale &amp; di≈øcretion, in my private di≈øcour≈øes, as vvell as publick Sermons, to e≈øtablish my people (in so ≈øad a Day of temptation when ≈øome ≈øtars of the fir≈øt magnitude fell from Heaven) in the E≈ø≈øentiall Duties of ≈øubjection &amp; Allegiance to their Soveraign, shevving that ≈øubjects vvere upon noe Con≈øideration what≈øoever, nether of Religion, Liberty, nor life, to Re≈øi≈øt, or De≈øert, their Lavvfull Soveraigne, tho hee vvere no better than ≈øuch an One as S. Paul lived under, vvhen hee vvrit the Epi≈øtle to the Rom. not only a Heathen, but a Cruell Per≈øecutour, A Nero, A Caligula, or A Diocle≈øian; And that Subjects to a Chri≈øtian Prince, and to a Prince ≈øoe Mercifull &amp; Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious as ours, by con≈øequence vvould bee infinitely more Guilty, if they should Rebell again≈øt, or Re≈øi≈øt him, merely becau≈øe hee profe≈øs'ed a Different Religion.</p>
                  <p>After I had endeavoured thus to approve my ≈øelfe a faithfull shepherd in taking Care of my Country Flocks, I repaired to my Deanery at Durham, vvith the hone≈øt De≈øigne of demon≈øtrating my fidelity to my Soveraigne, &amp; my Mother the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore I ≈øummon'd my Brethren the Prebendaries together into Our Chapter-Hou≈øe; vvhere I propounded to them, the A≈ø≈øi≈øting of the King in ≈øo ≈øad an Exigent vvith their Pur≈øes, as vvell as their Prayers, vvith vvhich motion all pre≈øent complied, giving readily their Con≈øent vvith their voices, as all ab≈øent (≈øaving one) did by their letters: vvhich occa≈øion'd an Act of Chapter to the Effect follovving, tovvit, that the Deane should advance an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound &amp; Every Prebend fifty for his Maje≈øties Service tovvards the rai≈øing of Hor≈øe &amp; Men, if occa≈øion should require, &amp; to bee di≈øpo≈øed of, to the afore≈øaid Ends &amp; Purpo≈øes, in ≈øuch manner as our Bp. should appoint.</p>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:110636:45"/>
And this I did, not thinking it any very con≈øiderable Service to the King to give him 700 (to vvhich ≈øumme it vvould amount) but that this Act of ours might bee an Occa≈øion of ≈øetting the vvheele a going (and at that time t'vvas not too late) through the Kingdom. Conceiving it no ≈øin (in ≈øuch an Extraordinary Juncture) to lead the van in Point of Loyalty to my Prince; ≈øince the Dioce≈øse &amp; Archdeaconry of Durham in Particular (none can deny) had been all along during the Time of Bishop Con≈øins &amp; ever ≈øince a notable Example to the vvhole Nation of Conformity to the Lavves, &amp; dutyfull regard to his Maje≈øties Honour and Intre≈øt.</p>
                  <p>In the next place Remembring that I bore another Eccle≈øia≈øtick Office &amp; Dignity in the Church of Durham about the beginning of Nov., I ≈øummond all the Clergy of my Archdeaconry together, (vvho met on the 15.) labouring in the Ab≈øence of my Superiour, the Bp. (vvho vvas gone up to London) to give them right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures in point of Church of England Loyalty &amp; Religion; laying before them the Indi≈øpen≈øable Nece≈ø≈øity of their per≈øonall A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of their Soveraign, as far as any vvere Obliged, and Exerting their zeale to ≈øecure their Flocks that they might not be ≈øeduced from their Allegiance, by the Canting Sophi≈øtry, &amp; Di≈øtinctions of the Age.</p>
                  <p>And tho the zeale I there Evidenced in my Vi≈øitaction Speech, hath had ≈øince as formely small effect (as is too vi≈øible by the Clergyes generall Compliance vvith their nevv Gevernours &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp; renouncing their old) yet it vvill ≈øerve at all times to proclame, that their Archdeacon did on that Occa≈øion (as hee had done before) faithfully deliver his ≈øoule.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly Beleiving it might bee ≈øome Service to his Maje≈øtie, for both Clergy &amp; Layity to shevv their ABHORRENCE of that unnaturall Inva≈øion vvhich vvas then ffeared, I moved fir≈øt my Brethren of the Chapter, &amp; aftervvards my Brethren of the Bench, to Joyne vvith mee in an Addre≈ø≈øe of that Nature to his Maje≈øtie, but the fir≈øt Refu≈øing, and the la≈øt (all but tvvo) vvaving the ≈øame, I thought my ≈øelfe (the mo≈øt publick per≈øon in the Bishops Ab≈øence) obliged to give A demon≈øtraction of my ovvne Loyalty vvhich I vvas not afraid to do, (tho the Prince of Orange vvas at that tyme advanced as far as Salisbury) and accordingly on Nov. 27. ≈øent to his Maje≈øtie by the Po≈øt an A≈ø≈øurance thereof in an

                  <p>Moreover Con≈øidering my ≈øelfe once more in the Capacity of a Civill Magi≈øtrate, as vvell as Eccle≈øia≈øticall, I did a fevv dayes after de≈øire my Brethren Ju≈øtices &amp; Deputy Lieutenants, to give mee a Meeting, to con≈øult about Serving his Maje≈øtie to the Utmo≈øt of our Povvers (Hearing as yet nothing from our Bishop) and more particularly hovv to defend our ≈øelves again≈øt the Lords &amp; Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, vvho had Seized on Yorke for the Prince of Orange, &amp; vvere ≈øome of them, advancing northvvards to ≈ø√©cure Durham and Nevvca≈øtle. But this hone≈øt Zeale of mine, vvas by their shunning this Opportunity of Meeting likevvi≈øe renderd fruitle≈øs, and the Lord Lumly on Wensday the fifth of Dec: Surprized us, &amp; enterd Durham (whiles J vvas preaching in the.

                  <p>On Thursday follovving the Lord Lumly vvithout any Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition read the Prince of Oranges declaration at the Ca≈øtle in the Pre≈øence of mo≈øt of the Deputy Lieutenants, Ju≈øtices, &amp; Gentry vvho flock'd into his Lordship; and by their Compliance encouraged him to ≈øend to the Magi≈øtrates of Nevvca≈øtle to demand Reception there, but being refu≈øed Admittance, the Saturday after, ha≈øtily &amp; vvith ≈øome precipitation, returned, hee and his Company, to Yorke, after having read Publickly at the Market Cro≈ø≈øe the Prince of Oranges declaration, attended on by a great Number of Gentry &amp; the Country Troop; but I thanke God there were no hor≈øes nor men of mine (tho the Deane at other times ≈øent four) to encrea≈øe the number, &amp; honour that Cerimony; vvhich hinderd ≈øeverall of the Clergy, at that tyme; to ≈øend in theirs to the le≈ø≈øenning of the Appearance.</p>

Hereupon I did Judge it meet the next day after being ≈øunday, to Preach againe, tho I had done it lately in my ovvne Proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, in the Cathedrall Pulpit, √† ≈øea≈øonable Loyall Sermon (≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to my pa≈øt life and Actions in that Country) to per≈øvvade the members of that Church, &amp; all the Auditory to ≈øtand firme to their Allegiance, in that day of Temptation &amp; never to Joyne in the lea≈øt vvayes vvith that Horrid Rebellion vvhich vvas at that tyme Set on foot in the Nation.

                  <p>That our Ble≈ø≈øed ≈øaviour Chri≈øt &amp; his di≈øciples were, of all the Doctors who ever were in the world, the mo≈øt carefull to pre≈øerve the Doctrine &amp; Practice of Allegiance, and entire Submi≈ø≈øion &amp; Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Supreme Powers, which were deputed by God as his Vicegerents to Governe the world; even then, at that very time, when they lived under Heathen Emperours, who where not only Great Oppo≈øers of Chri≈øtianity, but Cruell Mercile≈ø≈øe &amp; Bloudy Per≈øecutors.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore it will bee worthy of Ob≈øervation, that Chri≈øt Je≈øus, tho hee were as God, the King of all Kings, &amp; might have changed &amp; di≈øpo≈øed of their Dominions, as hee plea≈øed, yet did not thinke fit to make any Alteration in the Government hee found on Earth when hee was born; but on the Contrary, Judged it meet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue &amp; ≈øettle all in that Cour≈øe, where in it had been formerly placed by God him≈øelfe, living in a mo≈øt Exemplary manner in ≈øubjection to the knowne Lawes, paying Tribuute to Cae≈øar; Nay shewing ≈øo great Concerne that the Supreme Powers should receive their Due, that hee thought fit rather to work a miracle, than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate deficient in Paying Tribute.</p>
                  <p>Whereto if wee add our Lords Refu≈øall to accept of the Judiciall Cognizance of an Offence, when hee was put upon it, as hee did of A Crowne when it was offer'd him by the People, there will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare ≈øtrong matter of Conviction, &amp; proof of the Inviolablene≈ø≈øe

of the Rights of Government, which it is not lawfull for any per≈øon on earth to u≈øurp or meddle with, without a Ju≈øt Call. So far was our Humble &amp; Righteous Lord, the Capt: of our Salvation, from retrenching any of the Magi≈øtrates former Rights, that hee added to MOSES in this matter, enjoyning greater Awe &amp; Reverence to be given to the Civill Power.</p>
                  <p>Wherein wee may take further notice, that Chri≈øt Je≈øus hee was ≈øo extraordinarily Carefull &amp; Tender: That where as MOSES among the Egiptians, when hee was but a Private man, did take upon him to exerci≈øe an Act of Judicature on the Egyptian which wronged the I≈øraelite Exod. 2. 12.

                  <p>Of which Heinous Guilt it concerns every one, who hath been unfortunately dipt therein (as every Complier with, as well as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of, the new Government in England certainly is) with greate≈øt ≈øpeed, &amp; care to purge him≈øelfe.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110636:56"/>
whereof wee ≈øpeake, the bui≈øne≈ø≈øe was ≈øo accorded betwen the Senate &amp; the Emperours, that the Emperour now Reigned unque≈øtionably without any Competition of the Senate: In him the Power was quietly ≈øeated, the money ≈øuper≈øcribed with his Image, and Edicts ≈øent out in his name, and hee looked on by all (with out any Rivall) as inferiour to God only. In which ca≈øe of his acknowledged Power, Chri≈øt being borne in his Dominious, thinkes not fit to make a Que≈øtion of his Right, where there was none made by the Romans, or to di≈øpute Cae≈øars Title (However acquired by violence at fir≈øt) when they from whom it was taken did acquie≈øce, &amp; di≈øputed it not. Which Ca≈øe how different it is from other forcible U≈øurpations (where the legall Soveraigne doth ≈øtill Claime his Right to his Kingdomes, and to the Allegiance of his Subjects, no way acquitting them from their Oathes, or laying down his Preten≈øion, tho hee be for the pre≈øent Ouerpowred) is ea≈øily di≈øcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible to any who have the Courage &amp; Fidelity to con≈øider it, &amp; is not by his own Intre≈øts bribed, or frighted from the performance of his Chri≈øtian Duty.

                  <p>I am not ignorant, but that this attempt may render me ab≈øolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cap√†ble of all the favour you have shew'd me, ≈øince my Flight into France, in your voluntary kind interpo≈øition to ≈øecure my Revenu; &amp; that it mu≈øt al≈øo expo≈øe me for a ≈øubject of Common Talk &amp; Cen≈øure thoughout the Nation. But ≈øince an un blemis'd Loyalty is infinitely mote valuable than the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions of this world, &amp; that, I was per≈øvaded that the Cour≈øe<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> which I did, by Gods grace, Steer, was the mo≈øt effectual way to ≈øecure that, the very Reputation whereof I e≈øteem far beyond the Rents I had at Durham, Ea≈øington, &amp; Sedgefeild; nay moreover ≈øince that my pa≈øt Life, &amp; la≈øt Deportment in England, had not been all of a piece, if I had not done as I did; You will not, I tru≈øt, condemn my Cariage, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever contrary to the Maxims &amp; Temper of the Reigning Generation, as unworthy of your Hou≈øe &amp; Family.</p>
                  <p>What I have done, I have perform'd, thanks be to the Almighty, <hi>in the Integrity of my Heart &amp; Innocency of my hands,</hi> &amp; the ≈øence &amp; Con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here of (the I≈ø≈øue of things exery day more &amp; more convincing me that I was in the Right) doth afford un≈øpeakable Comfort to my ≈øoule.</p>
                  <p>My Feeding of ≈øome Friends, in my voyage from Scotland hither, with Expectation of an Inter-view in Kent, &amp; talk of a Pa≈øsport (the fit≈øt of which I did not intend, &amp; the la≈øt, if I could get away without it, I did not de≈øire) is a crime I do a≈øsure my ≈øelfe of Gods pardon for, &amp; of tho≈øe friends likewi≈øe whom I deluded &amp; di≈øapointed, when God shall be pleas'd to ≈øend us a happy meeting.</p>
                  <p>As for that more unpardonable ≈øin where with ≈øome do reproach me, &amp; whereof I cannot ≈øo well clear my ≈øelfe before the World (but is the only one, thanks be to God, that the World can accu≈øe me of) I me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

frugall &amp; crafty than my ≈øelfe have done in le≈øs time, with a ≈ømaller E≈øtate or Revenu, I am like to do a ≈øad Pennance for it here abroad in a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Kingdome. And the Friends &amp; Relations I leave at home, will not, I hope, add affliction to affliction (if they will not help me with their Pur≈øes) by loading me with their Cen≈øures; e≈øpecially con≈øidering two la≈øt Acts of mine to demon≈øtrate the ≈øincerity of my Repentance for it: Fir≈øt that I did voluntarily diminish my Revenu very con≈øiderably, by Rent-Charges to ≈øatisfy my own ju≈øt Debts; Secondly that I look'd on my long Neglect to practize Frugality as ≈øo great a ≈øin, that I did as voluntarily put my ≈øelfe into a kind of white sheet to atone fot the ≈øame, by confe≈ø≈øing it to God &amp; the world, in a ≈ømall Peice I printed in the year 85.</p>
                  <p>This is my Comfort, that no per≈øon in England is like to loo≈øe by me, unle≈øs by his own proper Choice, &amp; if one man doth ≈øo, he mu≈øt thank him≈øelfe rather than blame me. If I ≈øuffer Deprivation to his lo≈øs, he mu≈øt quarrell with God &amp; the King, who≈øe Commands have unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably oblig'd me to hold fa≈øt my Religion &amp; Loyalty. And if the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of both, or either of them, was in my Judgement too dear a purchace of my Revenu for my ≈øelfe, no one could rea≈øonably expect that I should undergo it for an other.</p>
                  <p>Hoping that the≈øe few Hints may give ≈øome ≈øatisfaction to all, but the Malitious Authors of our pre≈øent Mi≈øery, I shall not enlarge this Po≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcript farther, than to acknowledge with all thankfullne≈øs the kindne≈øs which you have shew'd me in procuring A Di≈øpen≈øation for mee (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding I have contradicted your Example) which I e≈øteem thegreater Obligation, at tho≈øe friends hands who were in≈øtrumentall therein, ≈øince they did it without my Privity or Motion.</p>

                  <p>I shall only embrace this occa≈øion ≈øolemnely, &amp; publickly, to a≈øsure your Lordship, in generall, that I did faithfully, and with as much punctuallity as I was able, di≈øcharge tho≈øe Tru≈øts which were committed to me, in every one of the places, and offices, which I had the honour to beare under your Lordship; &amp; maintain'd my Po≈øte in your Ab≈øence, not with≈øtanding mighty di≈øcouragements, till it was not po≈ø≈øible for me any longer to ≈øtrive again≈øt that Torrent, which had hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all matters, in that &amp; other parts of the Nation, into great di≈øorder &amp; confu≈øion.</p>

                  <p>When my Soveraine was forc'd from his own pallace, nay driven out of the Realme, it was time for tho≈øe who were firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly re≈øolv'd to adhere to, &amp; ≈øuffer with Him, to yeild to that force &amp; nece≈ø≈øity, which A mighty Potentate, by complying with, proclaim'd to be invincible.

                  <p>As for my part (how great a parodox soever it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to ≈øome) I am fully convinced of the truth thereof, as I alwayes was of Gods wonderfull Goodne≈øs &amp; Providence, in bringing his Father, our Gracious Soveraine, through all his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, to the Crown. And I fear, that our abhorr'd Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude towards God for two ≈øuch ine≈øtimable ble≈øsings, as the ≈øecurity of the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion by an Heire Male, &amp; tho≈øe Halcyon dayes, which we for two years enjoy'd (and might have enjoy'd longer had it not been our own faults) under a Gracious Prince of a conde≈øcending race, have above other ≈øins pull'd down God's judgements, &amp; contributed towards the mi≈øerry we now groan under, &amp; the greater mi≈øery which hangs over our heads, &amp; out of which we can never be deliver'd, but by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary a≈øsi≈øtance of the ≈øame mercifull &amp; gracious God and King, whom we have above mea≈øure provoked and incens'd.</p>
                  <p>I have never been asham'd, I thank God, to owne ≈øuch ≈øentiments, as the≈øe, amid≈øt all the delu≈øions, which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men of a contrary opinion have layen under, &amp; the greate≈øt Obloquy &amp; Contempt, which by them hath been ca≈øt on every one, who ≈øtuck clo≈øe to his Maje≈øty (as I thank God I have done to the utmo≈øt of my power) in a≈øserting his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. But I need not affirme this to your Lordship, or any within your Dioce≈øse, having ≈øufficiciently proclaim'd my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110636:61"/>
concerning the≈øe matters, in the pulpit, both in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall &amp; other Churches, after his Maje≈øty's happy acce≈øs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to the Imperial Crown, &amp; the Birth of the Prince of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</p>
                  <p>Towards the Filling up the mea≈øure of that Iniquity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our ju≈øt God would no longer di≈øpen≈øe, &amp; whereto <hi>our Kings, our Princes, &amp; our Prophets, nay all the people in the land,</hi> (to ≈øpeak in the Evangelical Prophets phra≈øe,) <hi>have contributed more or le≈øs,</hi> I know, that I my ≈øelfe [a wretched mi≈øerable ≈øinner] have ≈øadly help'd in every one of my capacities, &amp; heartily beg pardon of God through JESUS-CHRIST for my share of the guilt. But it is to me an un≈øpeakable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that neither my Enemies, nor my own Con≈øcience, can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øe me of tho≈øe ≈øins, which do ≈øeem to be the more immediate ingredients of God's wrath, &amp; which certainly more than others have provoked him, in <hi>≈øuch Manner,</hi> &amp; by <hi>≈øuch In≈øtruments,</hi> to punish Us.</p>
                  <p>For I have heartily, from the bottome of my ≈øoule, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd at our Gracious Soverain's mounting the Throne, at Gods ble≈øsing him &amp; us with a hopefull Prince. I have been all along, without murmuring, contented with his Government. I have had allwayes more jealou≈øy of the ≈øubject, than of my Soveraigne. I have thought our ≈øelves (as it hath proved) nearer a Rebellion, than the Introducing of Popery. And la≈øtly I am not, no not in the thoughts of my heart, guilty, in the lea≈øtwi≈øe, of that <hi>Perfidiousne≈øs, &amp; Ingratitude,</hi> to my <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> or <hi>Inju≈øtice &amp; Vnnaturalne≈øs</hi> to my <hi>Fellovv-Subjects,</hi> of calling in <hi>Forreigne a≈øsi≈øtance</hi> for our <hi>Pre≈øervation.</hi> Or if I had, it should have been any Nation in the world rather than our Neighbours of Holland, being not ignorant of their dealings with the English both at Amboina &amp; Bantam.</p>
                  <p>Tis highly probable, my Lord, that the≈øe very things which I here alledge for my ju≈øtification, &amp; wherein I ≈øo much glory, will be received with deri≈øion, and objected again≈øt me as my crimes, &amp; that mine &amp; other men's forwardne≈øs to <hi>obey, &amp; comply vvith,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> has contributed to his Fall. This is a fate, which I am ≈øure it will not be po≈øsible for me to avoid, ≈øince that, before I left the Nation, I had this lay'd to my

                  <p>But I would crave leave, here, to know who are the Objectors. If they are ≈øuch as have renounced their Allegiance to their lawfull Soveraigne, I may ≈øave the labour to an≈øwer them; they being not qualified to cen≈øure &amp; accu≈øe me, for helping to what they were well pleas'd with, &amp; de≈øir'd should be brought to pa≈øs.</p>
                  <p>If they be ≈øuch as will not, at la≈øt, ≈øubmit to the change of Government, &amp; take new oaths, tho they have been too far concern'd in, &amp; have too much contributed to, the ≈øetting up an u≈øurp'd power (by a greater Complai≈øance with the Prince of Orange, than I have been guilty of towards my Soveraigne) I reply, that the <hi>Doctrine of Non-re≈øi≈øtance</hi> which we have alwayes, till of late, been fond of, ≈øet forth at large in our <hi>Church-Homilies,</hi> doth ju≈øtify my behaviour; whereof any one may be ≈øoon convinced that will be pleas'd to take the paines (which I have lately done) of ≈øeriously peru≈øing, ≈øtudying, &amp; analizing the Homilies published by authority, Concerning <hi>Obedience,</hi> &amp; again≈øt <hi>vvillfull Di≈øobedience</hi> or <hi>Rebellion;</hi> From whence, no more than from the Holy ≈øcripture, can I learn any Medium betwixt <hi>Re≈øi≈øtance &amp; Compliance.</hi> He that doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with Expre≈øs &amp; Po≈øitive commands of his Soveraigne, when he beleives tho≈øe commands lawfull, doth in ≈øome ≈øort re≈øi≈øt Him; that ≈øaying of our Lord, in this ca≈øe, being certainly applicable, <hi>He that is not for me is again≈øt me.</hi>

                  <p>But the≈øe, &amp; like cen≈øures, will not, my Lord, in any great mea≈øure afflict me. It hath been my fate to be, from my Youth, inur'd to ≈øuch, &amp; greater, exerci≈øes of patience.

                  <p>Your Lordship, I am ≈øure, (which is my comfort) will be none of tho≈øe, who shall load me with reproaches, for my dutifull Complyances whith his Maje≈øty, ≈øince your example, (which did out run others) as well as your advice, did power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully invite me thereto.

I was a≈øtonish'd, my Lord at ≈øo ≈øuddaine &amp; unexpected, a change, &amp; was, out of re≈øpect to your Lordship, one of the la≈øt that, in the Citty &amp; Church of Durham, gave credit to the reports (wherein your honour was concern'd) which bu≈øied for a while the mouth of almo≈øt every per≈øon in the County.</p>
                  <p>That, that very method which we were affraid, nay well a≈øsur'd of, before parting, was likely to de≈øtroy our pre≈øent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment &amp; Governours (things portending as badly as in forty one) should ≈øo immediately (according to your own expre≈øsion) <hi>become the only, &amp; mo≈øt a≈øsur'd, means of the Pre≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings per≈øon, &amp; e≈øtablishment of his Government in Church and State,</hi> gave me occa≈øion beyond all mea≈øure to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.

                  <p>This change of Mea≈øures in your Lordship my Dioce≈øan, who≈øe Coun≈øell, Example, and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, I did more than ever need and expect, at ≈øuch a de≈øperate Cri≈øis, did wonderfully weaken mee in the di≈øcharge of all Duties incumbent on mee, either as a Church-man or Ju≈øtice of the Peace, and did put mee under an unavoidable nece≈ø≈øity of abating in my zeale to attempt ≈øundry things, and ingage in ≈øeverall De≈øigns, which could not be pro≈øecuted, much le≈øs accomplish'd, without the concurrence of my Bishop and Lord Lieutenant.</p>
                  <p>This did likewi≈øe incapacitate me to cen≈øure, or ≈øo much as curb tho≈øe in≈øolent Young Clergy-men, who before your Departure were arriv'd to ≈øuch a pitch of blodne≈øs, as to expo≈øe by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in≈øinuations in the Congregation, not only their Dean, but Bishop, for Obedience to the King.

                  <p>Tho the bodily Infirmities I now feele, as well as the greater ones I have ≈øtruggled with ≈øince I left Durham, [in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in a letter from Edingburgh] have been, and are, ≈øufficient to excu≈øe my Ab≈øence, and may ju≈øtify me in the eyes of God &amp; Man, for leaving, for ≈øome time, ≈øo cold and moi≈øt an air, as the North of England, and repairing into a Clime more warme and benigne, Yet I, who have been, all my dayes, a Lover of Plain-dealing, think not fit to conceal, any longer, the more ≈øub≈øtantial rea≈øons, which did at fir≈øt hurry me away from You, and do ≈øtill detain me abroad.</p>
                  <p>Till I was well got out of the reach of tho≈øe New Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, whom I could neither owne, nor obey, and from whom, for that very cau≈øe, had hopes of ≈ømall favour, I was, as well as my Betters, nece≈ø≈øitated to u≈øe, the mo≈øt plau≈øible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I could with Innocence, for a Voyage into France, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out declaring the bottome of my de≈øigne. And Providence, at that time, furnishing me with one very Authentick, and rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough [to witt, upon the returne of a dangerous Cough to go once more into a Country, from which I had receiv'd formerly con≈øiderable advantage, in point of Health,] I should have been much to blame, if I had not made u≈øe thereof, as I did, in order to my E≈øcape.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:110636:66"/>
On this account (in my letter to You, &amp; di≈øcour≈øe with tho≈øe I mett in my journey) I in≈øi≈øted on little el≈øe, than what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to my then growing Indi≈øpo≈øition, which was come to a great height; neither did I (God be thank'd) meet, or conver≈øe with any ≈øo unrea≈øonable, or inqui≈øitive, as to demand ≈øtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger motives, than the recovery and pre≈øervation of my health, (the next valuable Ble≈ø≈øing to the Salvation of my Soule,) to authori≈øe my de≈øigne of ha≈øtning into this Kingdome: famous for it's Soveraigne &amp; Beneficial air for all Con≈øumptive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitutions; &amp; the virtue whereof, tho I am not got into the mo≈øt ≈øalutiferous Region, I now already, in a very great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure perceive.</p>
                  <p>But tho all I alledge be very true and real, yet I dare not deny that other and greater matters (≈øet forth in a precedent letter) did fir≈øt put it into my thoughts, and incline me to quitt my Station, and without which, had the danger of my life been never ≈øo great, I mu≈øt confe≈øs, that, I think, I had never more thus left my Charges, after ≈øo con≈øiderable an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence heretofore (to recover my health) from my Offices &amp; Cures.</p>
                  <p>In plain English then, I declare to all the World, that the true Cau≈øe of my ≈øuddain flight was, that I carried about me a Con≈øcience more untractable, and le≈øs pliable to an U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, than mo≈øt I left behind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, as proce≈øs of time hath made too apparent. My Con≈øcience (≈øuch as it was) did oblige me, to the utmo≈øt of my Strength, to oppo≈øe all u≈øurp'd power (as I did to the la≈øt, wittne≈øs all the Congregation pre≈øent in the Quire the Sunday before my departure) and then, I need not tell You, it was <hi>not fitt</hi> for me to ≈øtay there, any longer. I might u≈øe the word <hi>impo≈øsible</hi> rather than <hi>unfitt,</hi> ≈øince I could not with good Con≈øcience ≈øtay. <hi>Id tantum po≈øsumus</hi> (≈øayes the Civillian) <hi>quod jure po≈øsumus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot deny that every one of You, and all tho≈øe Clergy in the Nation, which were ≈øatisfied and re≈øolv'd, to <hi>Submitt;</hi> that is to ≈øay renounce your Allegiance to your Lawfull Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigne, and ≈øwear new to tho≈øe, who have ungodlily, and unju≈øtly, depos'd him, have done politickly enough to remaine at home, ≈øit ≈øtill, &amp; hold your Tongues; at a time, when
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110636:66"/>
the Right Church-of-England-Religion, (according to the be≈øt notion I have of it) nay Chri≈øtianity in generall, required all faithfull Preachers <hi>to lift up their voices like a Trumpet,</hi> to oppo≈øe the madne≈øs of the People, &amp; ≈øtop them in their Carreer to De≈øtruction.</p>
                  <p>But I, your unworthy Dean, who, without doubt or ≈øcruple, beleived it, at that time, as I do at pre≈øent, a peice of dete≈øtable Rebellion to joyne with any, in a Con≈øpiracy again≈øt our Kings Crown, as well as Life, (and de≈øire to be torne with wild Hor≈øes rather than ≈øo to do,) did as politickly, (and I am ≈øure more hone≈øtly) in withdrawing.</p>
                  <p>But I de≈øire You to remember, that I did not ≈øtir from my Po≈øte, till the Citty of Durham was polluted by the Reading of a Declaration, which by a late Proclamation of the King's was pronounced trea≈øonable; &amp; that there wer√® not four pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Magi≈øtrates, nor one Mini≈øter in the Town, had the Courage any wayes to oppo≈øe it, or declare their di≈øsent thereto: a v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Nay I de≈øire you moreover to con≈øider, that I did not <hi>runn avvay</hi> &amp; for≈øake my flocks, as ≈øome may be apt to object, when I ≈øaw the Wolfe coming, but after I ≈øaw him come, &amp; with open mouth ready to devoure, &amp; had my ≈øelfe in ≈øome ≈øort ta≈øted his Fiercene≈øs.</p>
                  <p>I be≈øeech You therefore ≈øo take notice, that it was not till the 11. of December, at night, that I left Durham; a day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Sacred Maje≈øty was driven from Whitehall.

                  <p>And farther, and above all this, tho I could not ≈øtay lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Durham, without being defiled by concurring, or confined for

                  <p>Among the many applications, which, upon my withdrawing, and leaving the Nation, I have been oblig'd, out of common decency as well as good con≈øcience, (con≈øidering the publickne≈øs of my circum≈øtances,) to make to my Relations, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall &amp; Spirituall, I might, without cen≈øure, or blame, omit all Laborious penning down of my thoughts for You, the Clergy of my Archdeaconry, having for more than twenty years together, with the greate≈øt indu≈øtry &amp; be≈øt zeal I was able, from year to year, by word &amp; letter, &amp; ≈øometimes in Print, not only incited you at my Vi≈øitations, faithfully &amp; diligently to execute your offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but plainly &amp; fully deliver'd my ≈øoule, at my la≈øt, &amp; more memorable, Vi≈øitation, on the 15: of the never to be forgotten month of Nov: 1688 (ten dayes after our late [Dutch-Prote≈øtant] Gunpowder-Trea≈øon) Brotherly advi≈øing, nay earnestly pre≈øsing, you, to ≈øtand the Te≈øt in that great day of tryall, that you might not have lo≈øt either the honour or reward of Confe≈øsors for a Righteous Cau≈øe; in A≈øserting whereof, I am willing (and re≈øolve by Gods grace) to ≈øacrifice my life, as I have done my Revenue; if the wi≈øe God should thinke fitt to call me to the one, as he hath done to the other.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110636:72"/>
me that day, that I was not, among all my weakne≈øses, afraid or ashamed to owne my pa≈øt life &amp; Doctrine, &amp; to compleat the Office of a Vi≈øitor, as hone≈øtly &amp; heartily as I began, I cho≈øe, you may remember, to lay before you the cheife heads of all the Good Coun≈øell &amp; Advice, which I had given you at the former Conventions of the Clergy of my Jurisdiction, for four years together; even the four la≈øt extraordinary years, that is to ≈øay, ever ≈øince his gratious Maje≈øtie, our Liege Lord &amp; Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igne King Iames the 2:, mounted his Throne; tho I had too much rea≈øon, then to apprehend, by your long neglect thereof, &amp; running counter to the principles &amp; practice of your Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, it would badly ≈øuite with your palates, which at that time, to my greife, appear'd, &amp; ≈øince, without all di≈øpute<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> are found, not only vitiated, but poi≈øon'd, by the Leaven &amp; Magick of the Age.</p>
                  <p>It was ever my hopes, that his Maje≈øtie's <hi>Loyall County of Durham</hi> (the appellation which my gracious Ma≈øter King Charles the 2: was wont, as I have often minded You, to afford Us) would have re≈øi≈øted longer than any Dioce≈øs in England, by vertue of the Good Government which was very ≈øea≈øonably, &amp; more effectually than el≈øe where, therein ≈øet on foot at his joyfull Re≈øtauration.</p>
                  <p>How little prevalent, &amp; un≈øucce≈øsfull ≈øoever my poor &amp; weak endeavours prov'd towards your e≈øtablishment, I could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the Clergy of the Bishoprick of Durham, could have ≈øo ≈øoon forgotten (much le≈øs have fru≈øtrated) the precepts, &amp; Example, given them, by ≈øo great a <note n="*" place="margin">Bishop Co≈øins.</note>Confe≈ø≈øor, and ≈øtout Champion of the old orthodox Church of England, as had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily reviv'd good order, &amp; conformity to the Churche's Rules among them.</p>
                  <p>But ≈øince we find, by ≈øad experience, that it is ≈øo, &amp; that even the very <hi>Leaders</hi> have apo≈øtatiz'd, from their Duty to God and the King, It becomes me (who dare not follow their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) to do all that I can, to prevent the People of my Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaconry, from being ≈øeduced thereby.</p>
                  <p>You know, I have labour'd faithfully, &amp; with zeale more than ordinary, to a≈øsert the King's cau≈øe from the yeare 1678 (through all the Combu≈øtions occa≈øion'd by an Infamous Impo≈øtor,) home <hi>to the</hi> Dutch Inva≈øion, &amp; at that very time, even on the 15 of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110636:72"/>
Nov. 1688, brought all the whole≈øome advice which I had given at ≈øeverall Vi≈øitations, to your view in one Addre≈øs, (as before mention'd,) which I have printed for your farther edification, &amp; my own ju≈øtification. And in the next place, I knew of nothing better that I could do, than to preach to you by my example, in leaving my Station, &amp; my Revenue, (when I could not be permitted longer to discharge a good con≈øcience,) rather than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve my ≈øelfe, in the guilt of an u≈øurpation. Which act of mine, how grealy ≈øoever it may have been cen≈øur'd, I e≈øteem as the be≈øt ≈øermon I ever preach'd in my life, the reflection on which affords much comfort to my ≈øoule; ≈øince thereby I clear'd my ≈øelfe from the guilt of renouncing my Allegiance, as the generality have done, which will prove an eternall blot to the Nation, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Clergy of the Church of England.</p>
                  <p>Tis too late, now to give you Cautions again≈øt Perjury, or to ≈øett before your eyes, how much more heinous it is in a Prie≈øt, than in a Lay man, becau≈øe the greate≈øt part of you allready have swallow'd a new oath to an U≈øurper. And to informe you in the obligation that lyes on you, to repent of, rather than keep the oath you have taken, is to conclude you (what I ought not to do) not only bad Chri≈øtians, but very weak Divines.</p>
                  <p>There is no man that under≈øtands any thing of Religion, but knows that a rash oath only obliges to Repentance; whereof that there might be ≈øome MEET AND WORTHY FRUITS brought forth among the Clergy of my Jurisdiction, would prove to me great matter of Con≈øolation; &amp; if it were done <hi>very ≈øpeedily,</hi> it would be a great extenuation of their crime, &amp; afford good ground to hope, they were overborne with the Boi≈øterou≈øne≈øs of a Violent Sorme, rather than did willfully plunge them≈øelves, in ≈øo horrid a guilt.</p>
                  <p>Let not the fear of loo≈øing your po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, (which I thank God has not prevail'd on me) tempt you to lye, one moment, under ≈øo in≈øupportable a load. The enjoyments of your Livings will be ≈øadly purchas'd, by the increa≈øe of ≈øo enormous an Impiety. And there will be a lamentable Precedent left to your flocks, if You, the Pa≈øtours, have not ≈øufficient ≈øincerity to make a ≈øpeedy Confe≈øsion of your ≈øin, &amp; courage enough publickly to owne the ≈øame by <hi>giving glory to God</hi> &amp; taking shame unto your≈øelves. There
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110636:73"/>
can be no more effectuall way to redeem your own honour than by re≈øtoring Gods. Nothing contributed ≈øo much to the glory of St. Augu≈øtin as his <hi>Confe≈øsions, &amp; Retractations,</hi> &amp; con≈øequently nothing can be more to your's, than to betake your ≈øelves to this E≈øsential part of Repentance, I mean the <hi>Confe≈øsion</hi> of your Crime, whereby you have ≈øcandaliz'd your flocks.</p>
                  <p>You that have taken an unlawfull oath to ≈øave your Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have thereby put your ≈øelves under a greater nece≈øsity of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with them, or retaining your guilt. For nothing lefs, than ≈øo, ≈øeems to be a ≈øufficient evidence of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> your ≈øincerity. God hath ≈øo ordered it, by his divine providence, that a ≈øinner alwayes mi≈øses of his aim. Tho≈øe that betake them≈øelves to unlawfull cour≈øes, to ≈øave their lives or e≈øtates, mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily for≈øake them, &amp; enter on ≈øuch as are diametrically contrary to the former, or loo≈øe their ≈øoules, which are infinitely more valuable than both. Repentance ought to be e≈øteem'd by every ordinary Chri≈øtian a <hi>Returning from ≈øin,</hi> yea ≈øuch a Returning as requires the treading out the very ≈øtepps, which the ≈øinner made in order to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of it. And ≈øurely, then, what ≈øoever is binding in the Di≈øciple, mu≈øt be much more obligatory in the ≈øpirituall Guide.</p>
                  <p>But I shall not dive too far into particulars, &amp; chalk out the exact method, &amp; <hi>manner hovv</hi> you shall make reparation, for the wrong which You have done, by ≈øubmitting to an U≈øurper, both to the King &amp; Church of England. I have rea≈øon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, that all of you know your duty well enough, &amp; many I am ≈øure, better than I can in≈øtruct you; ≈øince the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of <hi>the King, Pa≈øsive-obedtence &amp; Non-re≈øi≈øtance</hi> were preach'd up with more zeal, by you in the Bishoprick of Durham, than they were by others in any Dioce≈øs in England. Where Conformity to the orders of the Church, &amp; Execution of other Laws of the Land, were ≈øo well practis'd (tho not as they ought to have been) that the BISHOPRICK which anciently was ≈øtil'd the <hi>Land of Prei≈øts,</hi> was generaly reputed the <hi>Seat of thorough-Conformi≈øts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You on the place of acting, mu≈øt ≈øee, more clearly than I can, at this di≈øtance, (tho your eyes have been in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure blinded by the ≈ømoak of a Rebellion) the fitte≈øt manner &amp; opportunities of making ≈øatisfaction for your <hi>egregious Apo≈øtacy.</hi>

I shall therefore, rather than pre≈øcribe the means, mind you of your indi≈øpen≈øable obligation to do the thing, &amp; ≈øo redeem your honour, &amp; redre≈øs the ≈øcandall you have given, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe of your own ≈øin, &amp; the un≈øpeakable greife of my ≈øoule; who did faithfully labour to make every one committed to my charge, ≈øuch as God hath given me grace to approve my ≈øelfe; even an unalterable Loyall Subject to King Iames the ≈øecond, as well as ≈øo legitimate a ≈øon of the Church of England, as can never be per≈øwaded, that it can be for her Intre≈øt to contradict her Doctrine; Which, as I have hitherto profe≈øt, &amp; held fa≈øt amid≈øt all the bla≈øts of Temptation, (from what ever point of the Compa≈øs they have blowne) I am re≈øolv'd by the Divine a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance to practi≈øe unto the end; in ≈øpight of the mo≈øt prevalent examples, or malicious cen≈øures, u≈øed now as arguments, or engins, to overthrow mee.</p>
                  <p>That ≈øuch a Generall neglect of <hi>Church-Order</hi> among the Clergy, through the Nation, (as I long, and loudly complain'd of, and warn'd you again≈øt,) should be attended on by ≈øo fatall an Y≈ø≈øue, as an <hi>Vniver≈øall Defection,</hi> should not be a thing perfectly new to You, to whom I addre≈øs my ≈øelfe, ≈øince you, your≈øelves, can be my wittne≈øses, that I have often faithfully foretold, that an Univer≈øall Semi-conformity would end in as Univer≈øall Semi-Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance: &amp; would God we had not found, by lamentable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that it had done much more, by producing that degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate offspring, who have not only imbrew'd their hands, in ≈øo horrid a crime, as the <hi>dethroning</hi> their <hi>lavvfull Soveraigne,</hi> but like Vipers have, in a manner, eaten out their very <hi>Mother's Bovvells.</hi>

                  <p>Amid≈øt all the mortifications &amp; exerci≈øes of Patience, which have been occa≈øion'd to me, by the late Revolution of affairs in Church &amp; State, &amp; more particularly by the Defection of the Clergy of my own Jurisdiction, nothing has created ≈øo much di≈øquiet, &amp; ≈øo la≈øting a di≈øturbance to my mind, as that there should happen any ≈øcandalous failure in either of you, my more peculiar Deputies, &amp; fellow Labourers in the Go≈øpell of Chri≈øt.</p>
                  <p>Tho the members of that Community whereof I am Head, together with the Clergy of my Archdeaconry, began to take different mea≈øures from mee, which gave mee too ju≈øt grounds to fear that they would, (as they afterwards did,) <hi>Bovv dovvn to Baal,</hi> in shaking off their Allegiance to their Leige Lord and Soveraigne, &amp; ≈øubmit to an U≈øurper, yet I did comfort my ≈øelfe with ≈øtrong hopes, that you, my immediate Supporters,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:110636:76"/>
would ≈øtick by me, &amp; endeavour to the uttermo≈øt of your powers to uphold me (again≈øt the violence of that ≈øtorme which threatned<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>) notwith≈øtanding our different ≈øentiments, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øions touching ≈øome matters in relation to the tran≈øactions of the year pa≈øt. But, after all tho≈øe my Expectations, that one of my <hi>Crutches</hi> (give me leave ≈øo to terme you ≈øince I did ≈øo e≈øteem you) should break, in a time of Danger &amp; Difficulty, is to me great ground of greife &amp; trouble.</p>
                  <p>That about the begining of the year 1688, I &amp; you should ≈øometimes differ in our opinion of things, (when there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bean unhappy Divi≈øion among the Clergy, not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the very Fathers of the Church of England,) afforded no great matter of wonder or admiration, But in the month of December following, when all eyes were (or ought to be) open'd, by a <hi>real unnaturall Inva≈øion,</hi> &amp; ≈øaw all the ha≈øte imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable made violently to u≈øurp the Crown, by the Dethroning of a Lawfull &amp; gracious Prince, ≈øtrikes me with great a≈øtonishment; e≈øpecially con≈øidering my earne≈øt &amp; unwearied endeavours, by the utmo≈øt conde≈øcention &amp; rea≈øonings, to informe you of the ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øignes carried on (which I had the good luck you mu≈øt now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to fore≈øee better than your ≈øelves) again≈øt the Church as well as King of England; that one of you, I ≈øay, (God be prais'd it is not both) with whom I had taken ≈øo much pains to keep ≈øteddy, should after ≈øo plain a Di≈øcovery of the bottome of ill men's intrieges, to involve the Nation in that deplorable mi≈øery under which it doth at pre≈øent groane, should, I ≈øay, not only totter, but at la≈øt fall into ≈øo abhorr'd a Crime as Perjury, doth pierce my very ≈øoule to think on't; ≈øince by ≈øuch ill example there is an irreparable injury done to my Flock, &amp; to the young Clergy of my Jurisdiction, like to be influenc'd by the Example of the Archdeacon's Curate, who till this late Epidemick Apo≈øtacy had been very exemplary in keeping up good order &amp; Di≈øcipline, according to the good old right principles of tho≈øe venerable <note n="*" place="margin">Bp.

                  <p>I cannot reflect on ≈øo unpardonable a <hi>Breach of Tru≈øt,</hi> tho never ≈øo much varnish'd over, with the fal≈øe paint now vented in the Kingdome, without ≈øore indignation; nor cea≈øe to charge the

guilt of ≈øo great a ≈øin upon you, my Repre≈øentative in my Parish of Sedgefield, (to whom I now ≈øingly ≈øpeak) who have committed the ≈øame with many high Aggravations, as the following particulars will make appeare.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt you being a Per≈øon, that was happyly train'd up not only in a [hitherto ever] <note n="*" place="margin">Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nvval.</note>

                  <p>Thirdly were, with much affection &amp; hone≈øt intention, ≈øingl'd out, &amp; pitcht on, by me (I having a great opinion of your Loyalty) to be my Co-adjutour, in <note n="*" place="margin">Sedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</note>one of the mo≈øt con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Country Parishes of England, the burthen of which tru≈øt, as well as my great concern for the ≈øpirituall wellfare of that my flock, you ought to have learn'd, from the extraordinary zealous applications, which I us'd at fir≈øt coming to ≈øet you, &amp; all along after to keep you, right, in my hone≈øt <hi>Particular</hi> notions of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the orders of the Church, &amp; of ≈øubjection to all ≈øorts of lawfull Authority.

                  <p>I did not expect that both, or either of you, should have

                     </gap> Con≈øcience, in the delivery of the Di≈øcour≈øes hee hath

                  <p>Secondly, He long expected that ≈øome eminent per≈øon in England, better qualified, would have ≈øaved him the labour of ≈øuch an application, as he hath here in print made to the people under his authority, by publishing, ere this, ≈øome ≈øub≈øtantiall work that should have ≈øtrenuously a≈ø≈øerted the Cau≈øe of King James the 2, &amp; that Church of England whereof he is ≈øupreme Governour, by unmasking the wickedne≈øs, inju≈øtice, and ingratitude, nay unnaturallne≈øs of Dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their lawfull Soveraign, and under a religious pretence u≈øurp his Crowne; The afore-≈øaid Per≈øon not ≈øticking, to ≈øet his name thereto, tho it might have co≈øt him his life, to proclaime undeniably to the World, that what hee writ hee beleived to be ≈øuch truth of God, as hee did dare ≈øeale with his Bloud. Which desireable peice of Charity to the ≈øoules of the poor people, who were unhappily drawn into Perjury, by the powerfull Example of their leaders, the authour hath not yet di≈øcover'd to be done by any, tho he thinks ought to have been performed long ago (what ever had been the i≈ø≈øue) to have given right mea≈øures to the People of the Land, while they were <hi>≈øtaggerring,</hi> &amp; not quite fallen into the abominable ≈øins of Perjury, and Renouncing their Allegiance. Which Chri≈øtian work, if it had been acted, in due ≈øea≈øon, would, among other good effects, have edified al≈øo the Dean's Flocks, and render'd unnece≈ø≈øary what hee<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> hath ≈øaid
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110636:85"/>
to keep tho≈øe ≈øteddy who ≈øtand, &amp; to re≈øtore tho≈øe who are fallen, for want of timely under-propping. The authour's earne≈øt longing, and waiting with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>ience<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> to have ≈øeen ≈øuch de≈øireable fruit of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive zeale, did detaine him a while from plunging him≈øelfe over head &amp; ears, (tho hee made many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ≈øo to do) into that Deluge which did over-spred the land; thinking him≈øelfe a bad swinmer in ≈øuch Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled waters; &amp; moreover (like Elihu Job. 32. 4.) being very unwilling to ≈øpeake out thus boldly, &amp; shame the ≈øilence of his Elders, till hee had given them all ≈øufficient opportunity to ≈øpeak and write; Tho his boldne≈øs &amp; zeale (as may be ob≈øerv'd, by the way, &amp; is before noted,) was not levell'd, directly, to any but tho≈øe under his own Charge &amp; Care (or nearly related to him) to whom ≈øuch a hearty application, and ≈øuch plain Reproofs, even in the very language of the letters, became ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary, that hee could not, in good Con≈øcience, have wav'd them. And therefore he conceiv's that people have the le≈ø≈øe rea≈øon to be di≈øtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed thereby.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, after the authour had made a con≈øiderable progre≈øs in printing the letters and other di≈øcour≈øes he was forced to undertake a hazardous Journey into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland Feb. 1689 (whereby hee got a ≈ømall ≈øuply of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to ≈øub≈øi≈øt a while abroad without defiling him≈øelfe with any Oath of fidelity to the Prince of Orange,) tho with much trouble and Danger, occa≈øion'd him by an impertinent and malitious Po≈øtma≈øter, who di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd him in Canterbury. Which voyage made it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to lay a≈øide, till his returne, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigne of publishing the papers he had penn'd at his fir≈øt Coming over, unle≈øs he would willfully, and unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably, have run his neck into a halter. Which, all know, was the Fate lately of a <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. Ashton.</note>right hone≈øt and loyall man.</p>
                  <p>THIRDLY, all ≈øorts of Readers may hereby be informed, that the≈øe papers are, at this time, the more hastily published without polishing, becau≈øe the authour, hath had this ≈øummer after a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110636:85"/>
long intervall, ≈øome returne of tho≈øe infirmities that he brought out of England<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> which being ≈øea≈øonable memento's of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of his condition, and uncertainty of his life, have cau≈øed him, without any more ado, or longer delay, thus plainly and hone≈øtly to <hi>deliver his ≈øoule:</hi> the comfort of which doth to him abundantly ballance the unea≈øine≈øs of any obloquy, which may accrew from the provoked friends of the new government in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, where he de≈øires to appeare no more, (unle≈øs it plea≈øe God to re≈øtore his Soveraign,) as all may be per≈øwaded ea≈øily to beleive, by his pre≈øent manner of proceeding.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. All tho≈øe who shall blame the Dean's undertaking, may, in a word, ≈øatisfy them≈øelves, that hee had never thus expo≈øed him≈øelfe to their cen≈øure, if hee had beleived that a a Dignified Divine in his circum≈øtances (being the onely one here abroad out of the Reach of England, and who≈øe Con≈øcience would not permit him to ≈øwallow any new di≈øpen≈øatory oathes, or di≈øtinctions) could without the ju≈øt cen≈øure of all right Church<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>of England-men, and loyall ≈øubjects to King James 2., have remained ≈øilent. Since hee hath not now tho≈øe prudentiall con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, that others have, to ≈øtop his mouth, or ≈øtay his pen: His own per≈øon being ≈øecure &amp; his Revenue lo≈øt. Whereas ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt Divines &amp; men in England (where hee hopes there be many that <hi>never bovved the knee to Baal,</hi> tho hee be ignorant who they are) cannot attempt what hee does, without the hazard of their lives, or ruine of their familyes. And therefore conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that a weak and bad performance, as this, of ≈øo good &amp; ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall a de≈øigne (the more incumbent on him) would be better than none at all, and be gratiously accepted, through JESUS-CHRIST, by that ALMIGHTY GOD who can make the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt enterpri≈øes in his name, ≈øucce≈øsefull to accomplish his will.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, &amp; la≈øtly, the Dean's innate indignation to many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, &amp; late prepo≈øterous unaccountable procedures in the Subjects of England: to wit, <hi>Fir≈øt</hi> the <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> or rather <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity,</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> (who did with zeale more than enough, &amp; ≈øometimes too bitterly, inveigh again≈øt nonconformi≈øts) which ingendred that Brood which are the authours of our Mi≈øery: <hi>Secondly</hi> their <hi>Forvvardne≈øs</hi> to <hi>di≈øpen≈øe</hi> throughout the Nation, with the <hi>Church-Di≈øcipline,</hi> as they pleas'd, where &amp; when, there appear'd no

                  <p>The≈øe, and the like, perver≈øions of Law and Religion, did cau≈øe, (the authour profe≈øseth &amp; is de≈øirous to proclaime) ≈øo much di≈øgu≈øt in his Soule, as hurried him over all the difficulties and dangers that he met with, in his way to this publication, in ≈øuch a degree, that the con≈øideration of his book's reflecting on the new Government (which was de≈øigned to edify the people within his own province) hath push'd him on, in≈øtead of deterring him<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> to ≈øend it forth into the light (committing it and his reputation to the mercy of a Gratious God) amid≈øt a crooked and perver≈øe Generation, which hee is willing may learne thus much by his boldne≈øs, (or fool-hardine≈øs as it will be po≈ø≈øibly termed,) to wit, that God hath given him (among a multitude of infirmities,) the Grace not to be afraid or asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to <hi>do his duty</hi> or <hi>di≈øcharge his offices faithfully,</hi> who ever may be rebuked by the doing thereof; and that hee is ≈øure, hee had done neither, if hee had not, as hee hath done, deliver'd his ≈øoule, without mincing, in ≈øuch plaine and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble language, at ≈øuch a juncture, as to allot, every thing its right epithet &amp; appellation; giving the very names of REBELLION

                  <p>Which is a Ca≈øe of Con≈øcience that the Authour will, in Gods name, now venture here publickly to decide (as hee hath long ≈øince don to ≈øome in private) and put his name to the deci≈øion, what ever comes of it, ≈øince no body el≈øe hath done ≈øo, for the ≈øake of tho≈øe many thousands of ≈øoules, under his authority, in the Jurisdictons belonging to the Archdeacon &amp; Deane of Durham; whereof none can deny but that hee hath a Call from God to take care.

                  <p>For if it be a whole≈øom truth which is recomended, by the Authour, to their thoughts, it cannot, he is ≈øure, in the conclu≈øion, produce ill effects to be repented of.
