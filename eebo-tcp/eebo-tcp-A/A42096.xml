            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Subject-matter of theſe enſuing sheets, concerning Chriſtian Reſolution, &amp; Humble Submiſsion to the will of God, in times of diſtreſse, (according to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the holy Patriach Jacob) &amp; Hearty ſubjection to the King, according to the Doctrine of the Church of England, &amp; our many Indiſpenſable tyes of Conſcience, will, with all thoſe few who truly <hi>Feare God &amp; Honour the King,</hi> ſufficiently a pologize, I hope, for the publication of them, in a Juncture, &amp; an Age, advanced to the higheſt contempt &amp; defiance both of Loyalty and Religion.</p>
                  <p>That Incenſed God, who hath for our manifold provocations, and more particularly (wee have reaſon to believe) for our Carnall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the Arme of Flesh, &amp; Diſobedience to Gods Vice-Gerent, powred out the vialls of his wrath on three Kingdoms, is not like to be appeaſed, without the ſerious practice of the contrary Graces, in a manner, as Univerſall, and generall, as hath been our late noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Defection towards the King, by an abhorr'd &amp; deteſtable Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the many ſacred, &amp; often repeated Oaths, whereby all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jccts were obliged to ſupport his Crowne &amp; Dignity.</p>
                  <p>Such is my ſenſe of what is paſt, &amp; Dread of Allmighty Gods fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Indignation, when I conſider that I am (how weak and unworthy ſoever) advanced to a publick ſtation in the Church of England, that I cannot ſatisfy my ſelfe, with mourning in ſecret, but conceive it my indiſpenſable duty to proclame (after ſuch a Stupendious Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution) as ſoon, &amp; as well, as I am able, to all perſons in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, my unfeigned Reſolution to adhere to my Soveraigne, in his diſtreſse; leaſt I may, by ſilence, contribute to the increaſe of that dangerous Lethargy, which hath ſeized on the People of England, who, by Reſiſting, &amp; at length Deſerting, their Prince, have Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized from their Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:110636:10"/>
I have helped, poſsibly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as litle as any one of my Brethren, or fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſubjects, in the Nation, to the firſt growth of this diſeaſe, having for ſix &amp; tuentie years together openned my mouth widely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, which would have prevented (had they met vvith due regard) our preſent miſery: &amp; for the truth whereof, I appeale to the whole Juriſdiction whereto I have long related.</p>
                  <p>But however I cannot think my-ſelfe perfectly diſengaged to ioyn in attempting the Cure, or, at leaſt, to help on vvhat is, God bee than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, in ſome ſort begun, &amp; vvhereto the contradictory, &amp; prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, proceedings of the Kings enimies have aſsiſted; I mean to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penning the eyes of thouſands in England, to ſee already the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Change, &amp; the Errors of their late method to redreſse Grievances; by labouring to bring their Soveraigne to Termes (all that vvas aimed at, I do in Charity beleive, by the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glands fallen ſons) and to deliver the Nation from Domeſtick Evills by calling for Forreigne Aſsiſtance. §. The number of ſouls committed to my charge, in the Cathedrall, in my Archdeaconry, &amp; in the Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Juriſdiction depending on the Church of Durham, are too many, &amp; too conſiderable, to be forgotten, or neglected by me, now, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated othervviſe to Preach to them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in this low Ebb of Loyalty, vvhen Inſtances of firme fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ones Prince are ſo rare, the Dean of Durham, it is hoped, vvill be pardonned, if he ſets ſo much value on his ovvn Example, as to make uſe of it, as vvell as his vvords &amp; vvritings, tovvards the Extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the People, vvith vvhoſe ſoules hee hath been Intruſted, out of the Labyrinth vvhereinto they are Run, by Non-Compliance vvith their Lavvfull &amp; Gratious Soveraigne, &amp; ready Concurrence vvith a Forreign Uſurper, or, at leaſt, tovvards the Hindring them from Running farther yet into it, &amp; remaining ſtupidly in ſo ſinfull and deplorable a ſtate &amp; condition.</p>
                  <p>This induces me to vvish, that I could bring the laſt vvords, I ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke to the Clergy &amp; Eccleſiaſtick Officers of my Archdeaconry, &amp; to the Members of the Cathedrall and Citty of Durham (contained in the enſuing Diſcourſes) to the vievv and conſideration of the vvhole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; Dioceſse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that thoſe, vvho vvere abſent vvhen I utterd them, may, as vvell as thoſe preſent, partake of my poor zeale and endeavours for their ſpirituall Advantage; vvhich is all the Returne, I can at preſent make, for the temporall Benefits I have reaped in that country, during
<pb facs="tcp:110636:10"/>

Man may diſcover, not Expell, them, but (which is the cheifeſt miſery) the nearer hee pries into them, the worſe, ſo doing hee makes a new wound, by too deep a ſearch into the Old.

This Continuall <hi>Involving of all things,</hi> and winding of mens minds vvith them, drove the Stoicks of Old to their <hi>Fatum,</hi> making, as it vvere, an immutable lavv of Mutability in naturall things.

                  <p>Such <hi>Heathenish reſolutions</hi> need no confutation in a <hi>Christian auditory;</hi> vvee have changed their <hi>Fate</hi> into <hi>Providence,</hi> looking more to the firſt than the ſecond Cauſes; to theſe only as they are diſpoſed by the former, in vvhich all things conſiſt, and by vvhich all things are Governed. But did the Heathens then ſo firmely rely on naturall Cauſes, vvhoſe effectts though certaine, (as by the firſt cauſe the God of nature before determined) yet they eould not, vvithout injury to Experience, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect uncertaine? It vvere a double shame for a Chriſtian, not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt more reſolutely to divine Providence, vvhich hee believes un chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable. Such a Reſolution is the ſtrongeſt Fort, that can defend a Good mans Heart (and let us novv fly unto it in our preſent viſitation) No Engine of Sathan can reach it, No ſtorme of Fortune shake it, nor Calme betray it. Whereas vvithout it Man shakes at the firſt ſight of Every Cloude of temptation, and like a hot iron hiſſes (as it vvere) at every drop of Affliction vvhich touches him.</p>
                  <p>I need ſtand no longer to prove ſo Granted a principle. Wee vvill conclude Chriſtian Warfare muſt be under the Banner of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

                  <p>A man on the top of an high tower looking downe &amp; conſidering the danger of a fall trembles to thinke thereon, but looking back on his feet &amp; ſeeing himſelfe environned on every ſide with battlements rejoyceth that hee is ſo ſecure of the danger. So the moſt ſteddy beleiver tho hee know that under the protection of the Allmighty hee cannot miſcarry, yet hee (ſometimes) trembles to reflect on the deplorable Eſtate of Falling away.

                     <hi>To Doe Good &amp; ſuffer vvrong</hi> after CHRISTS bleſsed Example, is an Eſpeciall part of <hi>Christian life &amp; Duty.</hi> Your <hi>Diligence</hi> hath been required for the firſt, the laſt requires your <hi>Humility</hi> upon the ſame grounds of <hi>Faith &amp; Feare;</hi> whereto if you do add (ſince <hi>Heaven</hi> frowns upon this Land,) a <hi>profound Humiliation,</hi> you will do more than <hi>God</hi> Expects at your hands.</p>
                  <p>Not to feare <hi>Affliction</hi> becomes a <hi>Rigid Sceptick,</hi> or <hi>ſenſeleſs Stoick,</hi> not an affectionate <hi>Iacob,</hi> or tender hearted <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> On the other ſide,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110636:21"/>
to be utterly caſt downe in the Bed of Sorrow, fits not an <hi>Abraham,</hi> but a <hi>Cain.

                  </p>
                  <p>Happy then are thoſe <hi>troubled ſpirits</hi> (let mee minde them) where this <hi>Conſtellation</hi> appeares, where <hi>Feare</hi> acknowledgeth <hi>God</hi> a <hi>Iust Iudge,</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> beleiveth him a <hi>loving Father.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Adverſity</hi> indeed, is the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> houſe, under which hee brings up his <hi>Children,</hi> through feare of which hee bridles their inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affections, &amp; by diſenabling and mortifying them workes an unwillingneſse to offend. For Example.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Rich man</hi> ſpoiled of his Riches, ſees their uncertainty, and ſo flies back from his eager purſuit of them to him that gave them. The <hi>Vain-glorious &amp; ambitious man</hi> degraded from Court to Cottage, and after all his Induſtry &amp; endeavour to Riſe, brought Low, &amp; made an Object of Contempt, ſees plainly there is no Confidence in any humane Helpe, no not in the beſt and moſt Potent of Princes, nor in any child of man (according to Davids obſervation) <hi>teaching</hi> him to truſt only on the <hi>King of Kings.</hi> The <hi>Good Father</hi> here in the text <hi>bereaved of his Children,</hi> confeſſes they were but a broken ſtaffe, and when hee could not longer continue a Father, contented himſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe fully that hee was the <hi>Child of God.</hi>

                  <p>So prone is our Nature to all Voluptiouſneſse and uncleaneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo rebellious are our affections againſt any good, that nothing but this Wormewood can weane us from ſucking the dregs of worldly &amp; ſenſuall Pleaſures, or ſtop us in this Earthly pilgrimage from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning headlong to deſtruction. <hi>Hee is certainly miſerable, vvho never felt any miſery,</hi> if wee beleive Seneca, and it is good Divinity in the Heathens own ſenſe. <q>

                     </q> Very neare that of the Apoſtle, Heb. 12. 6. <hi>The Lord Chaſteneth vvhom hee loveth, and ſcourgeth every ſon vvhom hee receiveth,</hi> but reſerveth whom hee <hi>ſeemeth</hi> to paſſe by <hi>(Quibus parcere videtur,</hi> hee doth but <hi>ſeeme to paſse them over)</hi> for greater punishment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God leſse regards a thouſand beames in the Eyes of the wicked, than one Mote in the eyes of his people.</hi> I vvill not punish <hi>(ſaith</hi> God <hi>by his prophet)</hi> your daughters vvhen they Commit vvheredom

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Gods</hi> People in this life are as it were travelling from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan.</hi> Tho our deadly <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Enemy of mankind, be over whelmed in the <hi>red ſea</hi> of <hi>Chriſts bloud,</hi> that hee cannot throw us downe, yet can hee eaſt Rubs in our way to ſtumble us. Some <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi> there will bee ſtil to Oppoſe us. The <hi>Canaanite</hi> is yet in the Land. The <hi>Flesh</hi> &amp; the <hi>VVorld</hi> erect <hi>Golden Calves,</hi> ſuggeſt Murmurings, &amp; Luſts, whereby wee provoke <hi>God</hi> to wrath, and force him by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Chaſtiſe and correct us into the right way.</p>
                  <p>Our Journey is as theirs numb. 21. 22. from <hi>Bamoth</hi> to <hi>Piſgath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> from the vale of humility &amp; Death, to the plain hill of Happineſſe &amp; Everlaſting life. So <hi>S. Ierôme</hi> applies theſe words in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Fabiolam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this (before wee proceed) may alſo afford a proffitable leſson for this Worlds Darling. Hath any aſcended this hill of Happineſs? Let him not caſt his ſcornfull eye on his brother in the vale, but look rather towards <hi>Ieshimon</hi> the wilderneſſe ouer againſt him, pitty them which are in it, and praiſe <hi>God</hi> for his better Manſion. Let him not forget that the Hill whereon hee ſtands is <hi>Piſgah,</hi> which <hi>S. Ierôme</hi> Interprets <hi>dolatus,</hi> Smooth as if it were plained, very ſlippery, with an Eaſy deſcent, from which the leaſt ſlip may caſt him downe thither, whence with great labour hee got up making him feele by experience that a Relapſe is a double Fall. But this by the way.</p>
                  <p>Wee may take one type more of the Sts. afflictions from the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> There was never any honey (obſerves the ſame Father) in their Sacrifices; neither were the lights vvhich burnt in their Tabernacles of wax which is ſweet, but of Oyle sharp and bitter. As if they ought not enjoy the leaſt Embleme or Shaddovv of Pleaſure. But however it was withthem, certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne itis to us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that our Ioy &amp; feli city is not in the Creature here belovv, but in <hi>thoſe things vhich are above, vvhere Cbriſt ſitts on the right hand of God,</hi> vvhereon vvee ought to ſet our Affections, &amp; vvhich are the only object of a right mortified and faithfull <hi>Chriſtians Search.</hi> Our <hi>Light</hi> as vvell as <hi>Life</hi> is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> Where <hi>our Converſation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

of <hi>men</hi> and <hi>Angells</hi> and <hi>Captaine</hi> of our <hi>Salvation,</hi> if wee readily &amp; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily follow him &amp; Truſt in him, <hi>vvill bring us</hi> (and it is only Hee <note place="margin">

The Fire of Adverſity is deſigned to refine us, to purge away our droſse, &amp; to fit us for thoſe pure manſions, whereinto no uncleane thing can enter.</p>
                  <p>Who will not then cry out with <hi>David,</hi> Pſ. 119. v. 71. in his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, <hi>it is good for mee that I have been afflicted.</hi> It is as neceſſary a Duty to Praiſe <hi>God</hi> after Affliction, as to pray unto him in it, though wee may not pray for it, tribulations, in themſelves, being evill &amp; the effect of Diſobedience. Had not man grown Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious, God had not viſited, but <hi>becauſe of the vvickedneſse of his doing, Gods ſends upon him Curſing, vexation &amp; Rebuke,</hi> Deut. 28. 20. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Rock</hi> of our <hi>Salvation</hi> (bleſſed be his name) has turned the edge of this ſword. So that <hi>(non eſt malum jam Pati, ſed malum facere.)</hi> It is not evill now to ſuffer, but to do Evill.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Croſſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (like the <hi>tree</hi> of <hi>God</hi> shewed <hi>Moſes</hi> Exod. 15. 25.) hath altered the nature of our troubled waters, they are no longer bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; unſavoury, but pleaſant &amp; Wholeſome.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt they increaſe our knovvledge,</hi> &amp;c. While our Outward man is conſumed the inner man is renewed. For as long as the body trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes in his ſtrength, the ſoules whole imployment is to furnish the corporeall organs with vigour &amp; power for their more baſe Exerciſes. But thoſe parts diſabled by Adverſity to receive thoſe Faculties, they returne to the ſoule, and united worke more ſtrongly in a weightier matter, even in a divine Contemplation. There is now no fewel for Luſt, no shews for Pride, every ſenſe failes to bring in thoſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:110636:23"/>
delightſome ſpecies, which in the time of bodily health overloaded the fainting ſoule. This Priſon therefore of the ſoule thus, once, broken, she becomes active in her buſineſse, &amp; <hi>runs the vvay of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> Whereas before she only <hi>heard of God</hi> (as Job ſpeakes) <hi>by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Eare,</hi> The <hi>Vail</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> once rent by ſickneſs, or other adverſity, now <hi>her Eyes ſee him.</hi> The <hi>Eye</hi> of her <hi>underſtanding</hi> shee more clearely apprehends his <hi>Povver.</hi> The <hi>Eye</hi> of her <hi>Faith</hi> shee more confidently relyes on his <hi>mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly <hi>This knovvledge inflames her Devotion,</hi> and renders us fitter ſubjects for his pitty. Wee moſt Earneſtly ſue for a Remedy of Danger from him whom wee beſt know cares moſt for us. While wee are in our Jollity, juſt like the <hi>Prodigall,</hi> in <hi>S. Lukes Goſpell,</hi> wee look no further than our ſelves. And that I am afraid hath been one of the ſins of this Nation, &amp; of this Place. A litle croſs may drive us to our Neighbour, but when wee are driven to eat Huskes with the ſwine, in our greateſt Extremity, then <hi>(humiliatio in humilitate)</hi> our minds are humbled with our Bodies; then, &amp; not till then, Neceſſity becomes a vertue; <hi>I vvill</hi> (becauſe I muſt) <hi>go to the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God</hi> deales with his Children, as a Nurſe with hers, ſuffers them to ſtagger now &amp; then, that they may looke the better to their feet. There is a Hand behind, which the Child ſees not, that holds him up. Our <hi>Heavenly Father</hi> indeed plunges us (if I may ſo ſpeake) here into the depth of Sorrow, that wee may dive into the depth of our own Heart; and to make us more ſenſible, punishs us by degrees (as hee did <hi>Iacob)</hi> firſt with the loſs of <hi>Rachel,</hi> then of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards with famine &amp; feare of <hi>Benjamin.</hi> Even as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> dealt with his brethren, but as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> alſo, tho hee began in wrath, hee ends in Peace.</p>
                  <p>Mercy follows Judgement and nothing but impenitency doth make a ſeparation. If <hi>God</hi> at any time be long in punishing, it is to teach his people more ſenſibly the guilt of their ſin; that ſo, by the better knovvledge of their guilt, they may be driven the ſooner to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance the ſeat of mercy. Both which methods of <hi>Allmighty Gods</hi> dealing vvith his ſervants have been often experienced by the People of this land.</p>
                  <p>Rough hevvn timber and unpolishd ſtones, are unfit for any Princely Building, therefore <hi>God</hi> ſavves us (as it were) in pieces by Adverſity, ſmoothes our inordinate affections, &amp; hevvs dovvn our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110636:23"/>
Rebellious luſts, before vvee can become a meet <hi>Temple of the Holy</hi> Ghoſt.</p>

                     <hi>God</hi> vvell knovvs vvee have loſt that image &amp; ſuperſcription vvhich hee ſtampt us in, and therefore melts us anevv, as the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, Jer. 9. 7., and purifies us in the fire of Affliction, that vvee may bee made fit materialls, in that day in the vvhich hee maketh up his Jevvells, Mal. 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>In a Chriſtian life then, as in the Almond tree, vvee muſt expect a hard shell, tho there be a ſvvee kernell. Hardneſs, all knovv by Experience, thus many times conteines ſvveetneſs, and ſundry other uſefull quallityes, as comfortable Health often follovves after an unpleaſant Potion.</p>
                  <p>Let us approve our ſelves therefore the ſervants of God, in much Patience, <hi>as dying but behold vvee live, as chaſtned but not killed: as ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovvfull yet allvvay rejoycing.</hi> 2. Cor. 6. 9. 10. Our <hi>Sorrovv</hi> is but <hi>Quaſi triſtitia,</hi> tranſitory (it ſeems) as there noted, by the <hi>Apostle, a dreame</hi> or <hi>shaddovv</hi> of <hi>ſorrovv.</hi> But the <hi>Ioy</hi> of a <hi>true Chriſtian</hi> is other vviſe, there is <hi>Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Hath then <hi>God</hi> taken avvay our Worldly vvealth from any of us? It is (vvee may conclude) becauſe it should not deprive us of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Happineſſe.

It is becauſe vvee may bee more fit for <hi>Glory</hi> hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Externall Benefits (none can deny) are <hi>Gods</hi> Bleſſings: but ſo is the vvant of them alſo. <hi>All things vvorke together for the best to thoſe vvho Love God.</hi> Rom. 8. 28. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to his faithfull ſervants <hi>both in life &amp; Death advantage.</hi> Would not any vviſe man vvillingly <hi>ſovv in teares,</hi> that hee might <hi>reape in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And thus much the <hi>Holy Prophet David</hi> aſſures us of, Pſ. 120. 6. <hi>Hee that goeth on his vvay vveeping, bearing forth good ſeed, shall doubtleſſe come againe vvith Ioy, &amp; bring his sheaves vvith him.</hi> The <hi>Keeper of Iſraell</hi> may ſometimes ſeeme to <hi>vvink,</hi> but indeed <hi>hee neither ſlumbers nor ſleeps.</hi> If hee ſuffer a ſtorm for a tyme, (vvherevvith vvee are at this inſtant dreadfully threatned) hovvever the ſhip shall not ſink. <hi>God</hi> is moſt povverfull oftentimes vvhen vvee ſeem moſt neglected,

                     <hi>Mans Extremities are Gods opportunities,</hi> hath allvvayes ben the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; language of Holy men.

Come, BRETHREN, let us all be well-adviſed before wee imbrue our hands deeply in one anothers Bloud, ſuch like Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences &amp; Beginnings had, once, no better conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Behold, I ſay, two Parties of the Kings ſubjects making the ſame Proteſtation, and yet all the while fight with one another, ſo that one of them cannot bee ſincere. If two Perſons declare for the King, &amp; yet fall to Blows, one of them (pretend what hee will) muſt certainly be a Rebell in fighting againſt the King.</p>
                  <p>I would, in Charity, thinke that you all conclude <hi>Rebellion</hi> a moſt odious thing; and that few will (I am ſure no good man would) dip themſelves, in ſo hainous a crime knowingly and willfully.</p>
                  <p>The danger is that many worthy &amp; Honeſt Gentlemen, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (and now in our Preſent Iuncture) may be inſnared, before they are aware, into this foule Offence, ſo farre, that they cannot tell how to gett back againe: or (if they do themſelves) cannot hinder ill men from proceeding on, &amp; effecting their ends by vertue of the Reputation which they have given to an ill cauſe.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore ceaſe to contend in this place, who is the <hi>beſt ſubject</hi> or <hi>verieſt Rebell.</hi> Whether I, that declare my ſelfe for the <hi>King,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi> or hee, that declares himſelfe for the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> &amp; the <hi>King,</hi> is the moſt Loyal, &amp; the beſt Proteſtant.</p>
                  <p>I have here openly &amp; frequently enough diſcoverd my Principles concerning Subjection. I am, Brethren, of the ſame minde I ever was, &amp; ſo reſolved, by Gods Grace, to live &amp; dye.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of ſuch diſputes, I'le endeavour to paint, &amp; ſett before your Eyes, this abominable ſin that neither party wil owne. And (without telling you any more who are <hi>Rebbells)</hi> I'le plainly shew you, what is <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and what, it is to be <hi>Rebellious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In proſecution whereof, I'le keep preciſely (as well as I am able) to the very Termes, &amp; Wordes, of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> in her Printed <hi>Sermons</hi> or <hi>Homilies,</hi> Published by <hi>Royall authourity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rebellion</hi> then, you muſt know, is there eſteemd by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> whereever it is found, either among <hi>Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (either on the 5 of Nov. or on the 30. of Jan.) the worſt, as it was the firſt, of ſins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the firſt of her Homilies againſt</hi> Rebellion, <hi>it is ſtiled</hi> the Root of all vices, &amp; the Mother of all Miſcheifs: <hi>and in the ſecond part.</hi> the vvorſt of all vices, &amp; the Greateſt of all Miſcheifs, at the Breaking in

vvhereof all ſins, &amp; Miſeries, did flovv in, &amp; over-vvhelme the vvorld: The Authour of that accurſed ſin of Diſobedience (vvhich brings in all other at its heeles) being no other than <hi>LUCIFER</hi> himſelfe, vvho of the Brighteſt &amp; moſt Glorious Angell, for this very ſin of Diſobedience, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt his King, became the Blackeſt &amp; fouleſt Fiend, and from the Height of Heaven fell into the Bottome of Hell. <hi>As our Church expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it in the afore ſaid</hi> Homily.</p>
                  <p>Rebellion, <hi>in another place ſpeedily after, is ſtiled</hi> the Fouleſt of all ſins, being, as it vvere, the Source &amp; Originall of all other, and inſeparable from the Higheſt Pride &amp; Contempt of God.

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, that <hi>Rebells are Commonly punished vvith Remarkable shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Deaths, &amp; that they do very ſeldom repent</hi> (the greateſt of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) wee are aſſured, by the very ſame Homily, pag. 363.</p>

                  <p>I thinke I need not produce any more quotations, or arguments, out of this Repoſitory of our Church, to convince you, that <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> is the moſt abhorred ſin; and that it can never prove a <hi>ſoveraigne ſalve</hi> (whoever are the Authours or ſupporters of it) for the <hi>King, Church,</hi> or <hi>Kingdome.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Dec. 11. 1688.</note> 
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſame neceſſity vvhich drove mee from my Home, at the very time vvhich my Soveraigne vvas forced to vvithdravv from his ovvne Palace, compells mee to ſend theſe, as vvell as my other, Papers, to the Preſs, to shevv the manner, hovv I parted vvith my Freinds &amp; Flocks in the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of Durham, and that the laſt Diſcharge of my Archidiaconall Office in a Tyme of trouble, vvas ſuitable to my paſt life &amp; Acttings, during more than tvventy yeares, in a time of Peace.</p>
                  <p>Hovv imperfect &amp; inſufficient ſoever both have been, I never vvanted, through Gods Grace, Reſolution all a long to Oppoſe the Subjects in croaching on the Prerogative of their King; as heartily as I have vvith-ſtood the Dutch their Invading of the Land. It vvill be no great ground of Admiration then to all vvho throughly knovv mee, that, at ſuch a Iuncture, I did dare ſpeake plaine English, to fortify my Brethren againſt Temptations, and encourage them, as I have done, in their Duty to God &amp; the King. And I Bleſse Gods moſt holy name, that hee hath been pleaſed to beſtovv on mee, for the ſupply of my mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Defects, allvvayes Chriſtian Confidence, in the Pulpit, vvho have not injoyed much of it any vvhere elſe.</p>
                  <p>By vvhat God gave mee boldneſs, at that time, to speak in the ears of a large &amp; Publick Auditory of Clergy &amp; Layity (not rashly but vvith the moſt mature conſideration that I utter'd any thing in my vvhole life) they might perceive I did not intend to ſtay at Durham, if my Soveraigne should bee Banish'd from his Kingdom. As by committing the ſame diſcourſe to the Preſs, after more ſerious thoughts &amp; greater deliberation, all men vvill bee eaſily Convinced, that till my Soveraigne be reſtored (vvhich I do heartily pray for) I have no thoughts to returne.</p>
                  <p>Tho I found it very eaſy, &amp; intelligible, hovv to behave my ſelfe under a Roman Catholick Prince, in the diſcharge of all Duties, incumbent on mee, as a Right Church-of-England-Subject, or Chriſtian, yet muſt acknovvledge that I am void of Logick &amp; other Learning to ſupply mee vvith diſtinctions, and furniture, neceſſary to live under an Vſurper.</p>
                  <p>And therefore if the Reader diſcover the vvhole courſe of my life, as vvell as my vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, deſtitute of Craft to transforme my ſelfe into any shape, and change vvith the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, let him not be aſtonish'd; or accuſe mee over rigidly, for not doing that, for vvhich I am not ſo vvell, as others, quallified, either by nature, or education.</p>
                  <p>It hath been my fate to have ſuck'd in other Principles, &amp; to have been trained up under better Tutours; nay, poſsibly, in my vvhole <hi>Make,</hi> to be ſo contrived, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that it is not in the Povver of man to nevv-mould mee, into that ſort of Animal, vvhich can blovv Hot &amp; Cold vvith the ſame Breath, and is able to ſave his ſtake, vvhat ever Card turnes up trump.</p>
                  <p>To theſe vvho shall condemne it in mee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a deplorable piece of Madneſs, or folly
<pb facs="tcp:110636:30"/>
to talk or vvrite avvay ſuch a Conſiderable Revenue, as Providence &amp; my Kind Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons have beſtovved on mee, (vvhich I am like to do by ſetting my name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to vvhat I print) I muſt declare that I am one of thoſe Fooles S. Paul ſpeakes of, vvho <hi>that I may bee vviſe</hi> am vvilling, in the ſight of the vvorld, <hi>to become a Foole,</hi> valuing my Innocency, &amp; Quiet of Conſcience, more than I do the beſt Deanery, or Bishoprick in Chriſtendom. And as nothing yet hath tempted mee, I thank God, to Compliment avvay my Religion, (tho I have been by ſome ſo reproached) upon Gods raiſing &amp; ſetting over us a Prince of a different Communion. So no Conſideration vvhatſoever (I rely on Gods Grace) shall be able to prevaile vvith mee to proſtitute it, by falling dovvne to adore the multitude, or any Image (tho it be of Gold) that shall be ſet up by the People.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe therefore that attack mee by arguments, or Threats, in letters, to ſeduce mee back, and dravv mee into a Compliance vvith the nevv Government, that I might ſet my hand to she raiſing up the Babell vvhich they are building in England, may ſave their labour &amp; ink. For till they have confuted the Doctrine vvhich they have preached, as vvell as the ſound Divinity of their Mother, vvhich they have forſaken, they may ceaſe from offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mee other arguments to convince mee. And till they perſvvade mee to ſet a higher value upon my money, than I do on the Grace of God, &amp; prize my temporall intreſt more than mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Integrity (vvhich no magick I have yet met vvith all hath been able to effect, ſo as to fill my pockets) they may alſo forbeare to affright mee vvith Deprivation.</p>
                  <p>I have long conſidered, &amp; ſtudied the point of Allegiance, vvhich I ovve to my only Leige Lord &amp; Soveraigne King Iames <hi>2,</hi> and to no other, and am firmely vvithout doubt, or ſcrupule, ſatisfied that my Religion vvill not permitt mee to ſvveare fidelity to any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him.</p>
                  <p>That the greateſt part of my Brethren notvvithſtanding the faithfull &amp; frequent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours I have uſed to eſtablish them in Conformity &amp; Loyalty, should forſake Gods Vice-Gerent, to do Homage to the Peoples, is an unexpreſsible greife to my ſoule.</p>
                  <p>To prevent the Incurring ſuch guilt, and the lamentable ſcandall of ſuch Apoſtacy, I did in due time (as may appeare from the date of the enſuing Addreſs) expoſe my ſelfe to much cenſure, by delivering my mind, to an Auditory, vvhich ſeem'd ready to run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (as they have done) into that Yoke &amp; ſervitude; vvhich I (vvho had greater tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than others) vvas reſolved to run out of the Kingdom, &amp; from my preferment, rather than ſubmit to.</p>
                  <p>And to demonſtrate that I am (after great thought fullneſs &amp; much prayer to God to direct mee) of the very ſame mind here in France on Nov. <hi>15. 1689,</hi> that I vvas in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland on the ſame day of the month <hi>1688,</hi> as vvell as deſirous to expreſse my vvillingneſs, to do all that in mee lyes, to avvaken thoſe out of their ſin, vvhich I could not confirme in their Duty; I am as vvilling to commit to the Preſse the diſcourſe I then made. Tho I vvell knovv, that I shall, in ſo doing, in caſe theſe Papers get into England, (and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering mens preſent Genius &amp; Actings there) be expoſed to the danger of running (as it vvere) the <note n="*" place="margin">Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delop.</note>Gantlet through the Nation.</p>

Catholick Country, where they could not be permitted to paſs the preſs without the peruſal, &amp; approbation of R. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks; and that it was a great mark of favour, and an eſpetiall token of their preſent forwardneſs to concurre with, and encourage Loyalty, to ſuffer Sermons and A ſpeech, ſpoken by a Divine of the Church of England, to be printed here at all, notwithſtanding the caſtigations which have been made, by the retrenchment of ſundry expreſſions, &amp; omitting all Compariſons which did carry with them any Reflections. And therefore the aforeſaid people have no juſt cauſe given them to conceit, that the Authour hath, in any reſpect, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his ſentiments of the Religion of the Church of England, which he hath ever profeſſed, &amp; where in he deſires and reſolues, by gods Grace, to live and Dye.</p>

In ſo much, that if a ſatyricall Invective (of which the Authour was never a great louer) be at any time allowable, in the writings of a Divine, it cannot be denied, ſurely, but that it may paſse here, in this Inſtance: eſpetially Conſidering that he did very ſeaſonably shew ſuch his indignation, even before the Forces that Landed had rowled to ſo great a number, but that they might have been Oppoſed, nay ſuppreſsed, by any one County of England, which would have shewed it ſelfe, right valiant, faithful, and unanimous.

                     <p>And here it will not be amiſse to mind you, that, Repetition-Taske there, in the Church at Oxford, is the moſt difficult Imployment of the whole yeare.

But the Major part of that Loyall Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vviſely foreſavv, vvhereto ſuch a prepoſterous proceeding did tend, and like faithfull Patriots did readily oppoſe, &amp; ſoon Quench the flame of that ill-timed Zeal; reſolving vvithout any more adoe (Would God none had ever changed their minds) firmely to rely on the vvord of their Gratious Prince, for the ſecurity of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion &amp; Lavves; dutifully expreſsing their juſt Indignation againſt thoſe rash, as vvell as horrid Rebels, vvho did at that time, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently make a deſperate attempt to overthrovv our Antient Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy: The Parliament Paſsing a Bill of Attainder, in the firſt place, againſt the Arch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Rebell &amp; Head of that Republican Crevv, vvho vvere Wafted hither from the Lovv-Countryes; and then after vvards aſsiſting their Soveraign vvith their Purſes &amp; Perſons to the utmoſt of their Povver, till (by the Bleſsing of God) hee had vvholly ſuppreſs't a Dreadfull Rebellion; vvhich, hovvever ſmall it might be, in the beginning, might have prov'd fatall to the vvhole Church, as vvell as Kingdom.</p>

                     <p>Wee may learne the Favour of the Hollander, in the ſtories of Amboina &amp; Bantam. From Dutch Acts of Mercy (tho ſome I do behold vvould not be convinced a fevv dayes ago, that, if the Dutch

And let thoſe vvho abound vvith ſo unaccountable &amp; abſurd a ſort of Charity, only feel, &amp; experiment their Compaſsion. And novv from this ſeaſonable, and pertinent digreſsion I am led to my third particular of that Viſitation-Speech vvhich I am Epitomizing. To vvit.</p>

Which diſappointment, it is plaine, greived them, ſince they are, at this very inſtant, maintaining the ſame Quarrell; publishing a no leſse Wicked Manifeſto, or Declaration; only vvith this difference, that theſe treacherous Enimies (vvhich in this juncture of Affaires have impudently invaded us) ſeem a little more angry, than thoſe traytors vvhich landed at lime, vvith the God of Heaven, for poſtponing their Stateholders pretences to the Crovvne, by the Bleſsed Birth of a hopefull Prince (vvhom God preſerve) To vvhom the Barbarous Dutch (and ſome more barbarous among our ſelves) have been more cruell than Bloody Herod in killing the Children, by endeavouring to prove him ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate &amp; disinheriting him (vvhich Providence &amp; the Kings vviſedome &amp; Care ſeems to have put out of diſpute) thereby deſtroying the Hopes &amp; felicity of three Kingdoms, in depriving them of ſo unvaluable a Bleſsing as an heir Male, to ſucceed to &amp; ſupport the Monarchy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But, to returne, the Remarkable Juſtice &amp; Vengeance of God, in cutting of vvith great ſpeed thoſe Traytors, laſt ſpoken of vvhich they had foſtered in their Boſome, and

That our Neighbours the Dutch, of all others, are become thus zealous &amp; devout, &amp; concern'd for the liberties and Religion of England (as they vvould have us imagine) is ſome vvhat unintelligible. <hi>Bibit Flander editque benè,</hi> hath been by vviſe men heretofore aſsigned for the Flemmins Character; and I never ſince heard of his Reformation.

Such Goodneſs of God to our Royall Family, not leaving it deſtitute of a Prince of the right line, but ſettling upon the Throne ſo accomplish'd an one in all reſpects, that if hee had been of our Ovvn Religion, vvee should have thought our ſelves loaded vvith more Happineſs than vvee had been able to beare. This Mercy Iſay, in raiſing a Gratious Princs (tho of a

Which vvee cannot do (give mee leave on ſuch occaſions allvvaies to be your monitor) till nee do approve our ſelves truly Genuine, obedient ſons of the Church, as vvell as Dutifull Complying ſubjects (I knovv no difference in thoſe tvvo Epithets of Obedient &amp; Complying, tho the laſt hath been turn'd into a reproach) in all things vvhich are not Contrary to the Clear Word of God.

                     <p>THe cheife points of my ſecond diſcourſe which I shall lay before you, are, as followeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt our preſent Kings further Expreſsion of his Gratious Good neſse and Condeſcenſion in the ſeaſonable &amp; happy Renevvall of thoſe vvholeſome &amp; Ecexllent Directions to Preachers, vvhich vvere publish'd by his martyr'd Father, and ſet forth, a ſecond time, by his Royall Brother K.

Injoining ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of the Pulpit (out of which have iſsued our former and our preſent Flames ready to devour us) ſuch Exact conformity to our Rubrick, ſuch frequent Publication (in all parochiall Churchs) of the Doctine and diſcipline of our Church, ſuch reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the Lords day, and cheifly ſuch a Training up of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:110636:35"/>
Youth, &amp; Catechiſing them in the Book of Common Prayer, as was the moſt likely meanes, (valuable infinitely beyond all our Diſputes &amp; Harangues from Either Pulpit or Preſſe) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the Church of England. And which wee Clergy had gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily embraced (God forgive us that fatall Error of Neglecting them) had wee not laboured under ſome kind of Infatuation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, that bitter Invectives a gainſt the Pope of Rome (vvhilſt vvee live under a Prince of the Roman Communion) omitting the more ſure vvayes to preſerve our Religion, allovved by this, and the laſt Good King, as vvell as biting declamations againſt the non-Conformiſts in the late Kings Reign, by thoſe vvho vvere themſelves but ſemi-Conformiſts, vvere an Effect of very blameable &amp; dangerous Zeale, and had mightily increaſed our ſchiſme and vveakened our Church:</hi> It being not Satyricall Harangues, in the dayes of K. Ch. the 2. (as I then told you, &amp; ſtill thinke ſeaſonable to repeat) againſt the Fanatiks, which did without a Compleat Conformity to our Rules, ſignalize a Right Church-of-England-Divine. No more than fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Railing, or hot Diſputing againſt the Pope, or Church of Rome, in the preſent Reign of K. James. 2. Can give an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Demonſtration, that wee are Good Subjects, or firme Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.

                     <p>Thirdly I shevv'd <hi>the indiſpenſable Duty of every one of us, to betake our ſelves to a more indubitable Courſe, than the former, of maintaining our Religion by thoſe lavvfull meanes (and much more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall than the other) vvbich vvere allovved by the King as vvell as our Church to ſave our ſoules,</hi> that is, by living according to our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, rather than by Talking for it, &amp; moſt particularly by ſtudying and practiſing our Common Prayer Book; not Spending our Povvder &amp; Ball in needleſſe and impertinent pickarings, but laying up a ſtore of Ammunition, &amp; furnishing our ſelves by the foreſaid preſcribed Courſes vvith Courage &amp; Magnanimity againſt a Day of Battell.</p>

                     <p>Three things I did adviſe, and beſeech you in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to take heed and be vvare of; (And ſo I shall in the name of God, as long as I have the Honour to be your Archdeacon) Things vvhich really portend much vvotfe than moſt grounds uſually aſsigned in this ſuſpitious Age for Fears &amp; Jealouſies.</p>

                     <head>Reflections on ſome of the points repeated, &amp; the circumſtances of the Nation, at the time of the delivery of this ſpeech in reference to the Invaſion.</head>
                     <p>AND novv, Reverend Brethren, I have, by the aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of God finish'd the Task vvhich I propoſ'd; (to vvit,) of Refreshing your memory vvith the recitall of the moſt important matters vvhich I recommended to your Conſideration, in all my Publick Viſitation-diſcourſes ſince the Death of the King. And I am ſure that there is not one of them, but is very vvorthy of your thoughts, eſpetially in ſuch a Juncture of Affaires, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliges every man in authotrity, to uſe the moſt povverfull Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110636:38"/>
vvhich ever vvere uſed, to raiſe men to a high pitch of Loyalty, &amp; affection to the Crovvn of England.</p>
                     <p>I might very properly, &amp; profitably farther reflect and inlarge on any of the paſt particulars, in theſe our Circumſtances. But I shall confine my ſelfe cheifly to the tvvo laſt, vvhereon I did moſt breifly Touch, as moſt pertinent for our Meditation, in this day of Rebuke &amp; Trouble.</p>
                     <p>All men are novv, I ſuppoſe, ſufficiently Convinced (vvho do not labour under ſome deſperate Deluſion) of the Miſcheivous deſigne of our Treacherous neighbours; vvhom vvee shall bee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed nay a fraid any more, ſurely, to ſtile Freinds, or to cry <hi>they vvill do us no harme,</hi> (language wherevvith my eares have been long grated) it being novv by Proclamation Treaſon ſo to do.</p>
                     <p>If the Prince of Oranges landing vvith 14000 Traytours (or ſupporters &amp; Abettors of Treaſon) at his heels (the particulars of vvhoſe forces you have in the laſt Gazette, together vvith ſome Heads of his Rebellious Declaration) vvill not convince men, that there vvas ſuch a thing as an Evill intended Invaſion, and that there can be no good deſigne to our Liberty, nor Religion, by ſo manifeſt a Violation of both, I shall give them up for loſt, for men void of common ſence, and not ſpend any more paines or breath upon them.</p>
                     <p>As soon as his Majeſty told us, in his late Proclamation, that hee had undoubted advice of a Wicked Deſigne to invade, &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his Kingdom, I did (&amp; thought it my duty ſo to do) fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely beleive it, and have ever ſince accordingly, in my poor ſphere, not only offer'd my moſt fervent Prayers to Heaven, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of our Gratious King, Church &amp; Kingdom, but have done all that in mee lay, both by vvord &amp; example, to exhort every perſon Committed to my Charge, to defend our King and Country.</p>
                     <p>And if all perſons had been as forvvard, as my poor unvvorthy ſelfe, to give credit to, &amp; rely on the Word of our Prince (vvhich I have not yet doubted) the Nation had been, it is manifeſt, in a better ſtate of Preparation. Tho God be praiſed, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtyes vigilance hath been ſuch, that (if his Officers continue faithfull) the Kingdom is in no bad poſture to receive, &amp; requite
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110636:38"/>
the malice of our Enimies: triumphing, at laſt, as gloriously over theſe inveterate Foes as hee did three yeares ago, over the laſt rebellious villains, vvhich landed in the ſame Country.</p>
                     <p>Thirty thouſand vvel-diſciplin'd &amp; loyall ſubjects, under the banner of ſo valiant a Prince, as ours, are able undoubtedly, by the bleſſing of God (deſpaire not) to encounter any Prince in the vvorld, attended on, but vvith 14000 Rebbells. By vvhich appellation I do no injuſtice, ſince in the Caſe of Rebellion &amp; Treaſon, as in that of murder, all companions are adjudged to be acceſſaries, and juſtly are to under go their triall, as vvel as the principall Actors.</p>
                     <p>The Goodneſse of our own Cauſe, &amp; the Badneſs of our Eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie's, is as cleare as the ſun, &amp; put beyond all mann'er of doubt, or ſuſpition. Neither of which can be brought into Queſtion by any perſon, but ſuch an one, as having ſuck'd in ſedition with his milk, is Antimonarchicall (whiles hee pretends to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papiſticall) in his nature, and ſo much more zealous for the Name of Proteſtant (the worſt thing in it) than for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Proteſtants, as to become a Well-willer to Turks againſt Chriſtindom, wishing ſucceſs to Infidells, becauſe Cerent Tecli, Bearing the name of a Proteſtant (a Rebell and an Apoſt ate, or as bad) is one of their number.</p>
                     <p>Wee muſt not think ſo blaſphemously of the Deity, that the God of Heaven (a God of Purity &amp; Truth) can have more favour to ſuch a Rebellious Rout, than to a Loyall Army fighting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Royall ſtandard of their lavvfull Prince in defence of an antient Monarchy, &amp; moſt excellent Government.</p>
                     <p>No, no wee muſt not imagine, that God (who is of <hi>purer eyes than to behold any iniquity vvith approbation) can have regard to ſuch a Gathering together of the frovvard and Inſurrection of VVicked Doers (as holy David heartily Prayes againſt in the</hi> 64. <hi>Pſalme) vvho have vvhet their tongue like a ſvvord, and shoot out their Arrovvs even bitter vvords.</hi> Where Davids Character of the Wicked (you vvil eaſily perceive, if you vvill take, the pains to peruſe the whole Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me) exactly agrées with our Invaders. Both the wickedneſs &amp; ſecrecy of their Undertaking having been ſuch as hee deſcribes. But as his Character &amp; Complaint in the former part of the pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me doth well agree with thoſe of our Enimies; ſo, I truſt in God,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110636:39"/>
                        <hi>and heartily pray, that the latter &amp; prophetick part, may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of them likewiſe. v. 7. 8. 9.</hi> But God shall ſuddenly shoot at them vvith a ſvvift arrovv, that they shall be vvounded, yea their ovvn tongues shall make them fall; inſomuch that vvho ſo ſeeth them, shall laugh them to ſcorne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And all men that ſee it shall ſay, this hath God done; for they shall perceive it is his vvorke.</p>
                     <p>Many conſiderations, together with Gods Providence, in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this and other pertinent pſalms to the Churche's uſe, ſince certain intelligence of the Enimyes landing, do (for my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular) incourage mee to put my Truſt in God, that hee will not give us up, (I am ſure hee will not unleſse our ſins riſe to a higher Pitch than theirs) as a Prey to theſe our Malitious Eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If all orders of men amongſt us, vvho have transgreſs'd his righteous Lavvs, and render'd</hi> (to uſe the words of our preſcribed prayers) <hi>both his Mercies &amp; Iudgements ineffectuall to our amendment,</hi> do but unfeignedly confeſſe to God, &amp; Heartily repent for ſuch their Provocations, turning avvay from their wickdneſse (for vvhich it is not yet too late) Hee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vvill be pleaſ'd to turne avvay from his vvrath, vvhich novv hangs over our heads, &amp; doth greivously threaten us.</p>
                     <p>But let us all reſt aſſured, that vvee of England can never be throughly reconcil'd to Almighty God (and ſomuch I dare in his name to aſſure you) vvithout repenting of our Ingratitude (of the late Odious unparallell'd Ingratitude) to our Soveraign, as vvell as himſelfe. Which brings mee home to the Topicks, that are of all other, at this time, moſt pertinent for our Conſideration. Which Ingratitude, I ſay your Ingratitude to God &amp; the King; vvhich among other ſins, &amp; innumerable impieties, (many of vvhich I feare cry for veageance) doth dare Heaven, not only to chaſtiſe us it ſelfe, but to make us <hi>to be rebuked of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and a By-vvord among the Heathens, ſuffering us to be laught to ſcorne, &amp; had in deriſion of thoſe that are round about us:</hi> The leaſt vvhich the beſt of us, at this Criſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I shall not omitt the repetition there of (tho late car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages &amp; tranſactions perſuade mee, it vvill be unpleaſant to ſome
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:110636:39"/>
of your ears) ſince out of Gods Rods vvee may at this very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant pluck a feſcue to teach us our leſſon.</p>
                     <p>Wee have impudently defied HEAVEN, by all imaginable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, but by nothing more (I am not afraid, nor ashamed, yet to harp upon my old ſtring) than by our contempt of it, in making bold vvith it's VICE-GERENT. Tho God hath bleſs'd us English, vvith a more happy Race of Kings than any Nation in the World can boaſt of; yet it is notorious, that no people under the ſun, have transgreſs'd more egregiously by murmuring &amp; Complaints, or that hath Copied out vvith more exactneſs the <hi>unthankfullneſse, Infidelity,</hi> &amp; Diſtruſt of the Impenitent &amp; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted. Ievves, Both in reference to God himſelfe in Heaven, and their Conductors, MOSES &amp; AARON, here on Earth.</p>
                     <p>If God in his vvrath had ſent us a vvicked Heathnish Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutour, a Nero, a Caligula, or Diocleſian, to Reigne over us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vvee muſt vvith Confuſion have confeſs'd, that it had been much leſse than vvee deſerv'd; And yet vvee (the moſt incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible people, I thinke, under Heaven) are ſo ſqueamish, that vvee cannot digeſt a Chriſtian Monarch, Gratious &amp; mercifull even to Wonder: A Prince, vvho hath demonſtrated himſelfe, beyond all gainſaying, to be a true ſon of K. Charles the Martyr, vvho vvas A King (I am perſvvaded) of the greateſt clemency that ever vvas upon the face of the Earth; cannot digeſt, I say, a Soveraign endovved vvith all theſe Graces (and a multitude of other Kingly Qualyties relating to War &amp; Government) merely becauſe hee is not of our opinion, in point of Religion; tho hee gives us no other diſturbance in the exerciſe of ours, than to deſire li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, for himſelfe &amp; party to enjoy their ovvn.</p>
                     <p>Since vvee have thus Ungodlily Brovv-beaten Strugled vvith, and in a manner Diſclaimed, if not rejected, ſuch a Chriſtian Prince, God in his Juſtice threatens to give us up a Prey to our Enimies, &amp; the vvorſt Maſters upon the face of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>Our abhorr'd Ingratitude to his Royall Brother &amp; ſelfe (vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout putting in to the ſcales our other innumerable ſins &amp; impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) may give us juſt ground to feare, that our incenſ'd God may deſigne to teach us ſubmiſſion and ſubjection by ſo ſevere a Method, as to make us (vvho have been yet one of the freeſt and moſt happy Nations of Europe) TRUCKLE to an Upſtart-Commonvvealth,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110636:40"/>
to an Antimonarchicall Generation, vho by their continuall shelt'ring, encouraging, and aſſiſting of Traytors, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame their Emnity to the very name of King; and that they vvould not leave (if they could have their vvill) one Crovvn'd Head in Chriſtendom,</p>
                     <p>But let us not be diſcouraged, or deſpond over much. Our condition (Bleſsed be God) is far from deſperate. England cannot be deſtroyed, unleſſe it deſtroy it ſelfe. If vvee vvill, in this our day, but forſake our ſins, and ſtoop firſt to the God of Heaven, and aftervvards to his Anointed ſervant, our Indulgent Soveraign, as far as hee hath for this laſt month paſt condeſcended to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of his People; flinging the vvorſt of Traytours, our ſins out of our Boſomes, and I do not doubt, but that vvee shall ſoon drive the Dutch victoriously out of the Land.</p>

But I pray conſider that, I ſpeake to you in avery extraordinary Time, vvhich requires every one of us (Publick Perſons) to do if hee can, ſomething extraordinary in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his Duty, And beſides, tis a time of danger and vvar, vvhich may be attended on, if God in his mercy doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, vvith Blood &amp; Confuſion.

                     <p>I do, as vvell as the King, next under God, rely on the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve antient valour of the English Nation: English men fighting vvith ſvvords, vvhile their Enimies put their Truſt, cheifly, in Lyes, &amp; Libells.</p>

                  <p>A bout the End of ſept. laſt, on the firſt Intelligence of the Dutch Invaſion, I retired to my Cures in the Country. Firſt to ſedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild &amp; then to Eaſington, uſing my utmoſt zeale &amp; diſcretion, in my private diſcourſes, as vvell as publick Sermons, to eſtablish my people (in so ſad a Day of temptation when ſome ſtars of the firſt magnitude fell from Heaven) in the Eſſentiall Duties of ſubjection &amp; Allegiance to their Soveraign, shevving that ſubjects vvere upon noe Conſideration whatſoever, nether of Religion, Liberty, nor life, to Reſiſt, or Deſert, their Lavvfull Soveraigne, tho hee vvere no better than ſuch an One as S. Paul lived under, vvhen hee vvrit the Epiſtle to the Rom. not only a Heathen, but a Cruell Perſecutour, A Nero, A Caligula, or A Diocleſian; And that Subjects to a Chriſtian Prince, and to a Prince ſoe Mercifull &amp; Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious as ours, by conſequence vvould bee infinitely more Guilty, if they should Rebell againſt, or Reſiſt him, merely becauſe hee profeſs'ed a Different Religion.</p>
                  <p>After I had endeavoured thus to approve my ſelfe a faithfull shepherd in taking Care of my Country Flocks, I repaired to my Deanery at Durham, vvith the honeſt Deſigne of demonſtrating my fidelity to my Soveraigne, &amp; my Mother the Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of England being perſvvaded that their Intteſts could never bee ſeparated. Wherefore I ſummon'd my Brethren the Prebendaries together into Our Chapter-Houſe; vvhere I propounded to them, the Aſſiſting of the King in ſo ſad an Exigent vvith their Purſes, as vvell as their Prayers, vvith vvhich motion all preſent complied, giving readily their Conſent vvith their voices, as all abſent (ſaving one) did by their letters: vvhich occaſion'd an Act of Chapter to the Effect follovving, tovvit, that the Deane should advance an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound &amp; Every Prebend fifty for his Majeſties Service tovvards the raiſing of Horſe &amp; Men, if occaſion should require, &amp; to bee diſpoſed of, to the aforeſaid Ends &amp; Purpoſes, in ſuch manner as our Bp. should appoint.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:110636:45"/>
And this I did, not thinking it any very conſiderable Service to the King to give him 700 (to vvhich ſumme it vvould amount) but that this Act of ours might bee an Occaſion of ſetting the vvheele a going (and at that time t'vvas not too late) through the Kingdom. Conceiving it no ſin (in ſuch an Extraordinary Juncture) to lead the van in Point of Loyalty to my Prince; ſince the Dioceſse &amp; Archdeaconry of Durham in Particular (none can deny) had been all along during the Time of Bishop Conſins &amp; ever ſince a notable Example to the vvhole Nation of Conformity to the Lavves, &amp; dutyfull regard to his Majeſties Honour and Intreſt.</p>
                  <p>In the next place Remembring that I bore another Eccleſiaſtick Office &amp; Dignity in the Church of Durham about the beginning of Nov., I ſummond all the Clergy of my Archdeaconry together, (vvho met on the 15.) labouring in the Abſence of my Superiour, the Bp. (vvho vvas gone up to London) to give them right mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in point of Church of England Loyalty &amp; Religion; laying before them the Indiſpenſable Neceſſity of their perſonall Aſſiſtance of their Soveraign, as far as any vvere Obliged, and Exerting their zeale to ſecure their Flocks that they might not be ſeduced from their Allegiance, by the Canting Sophiſtry, &amp; Diſtinctions of the Age.</p>
                  <p>And tho the zeale I there Evidenced in my Viſitaction Speech, hath had ſince as formely small effect (as is too viſible by the Clergyes generall Compliance vvith their nevv Gevernours &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp; renouncing their old) yet it vvill ſerve at all times to proclame, that their Archdeacon did on that Occaſion (as hee had done before) faithfully deliver his ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly Beleiving it might bee ſome Service to his Majeſtie, for both Clergy &amp; Layity to shevv their ABHORRENCE of that unnaturall Invaſion vvhich vvas then ffeared, I moved firſt my Brethren of the Chapter, &amp; aftervvards my Brethren of the Bench, to Joyne vvith mee in an Addreſſe of that Nature to his Majeſtie, but the firſt Refuſing, and the laſt (all but tvvo) vvaving the ſame, I thought my ſelfe (the moſt publick perſon in the Bishops Abſence) obliged to give A demonſtraction of my ovvne Loyalty vvhich I vvas not afraid to do, (tho the Prince of Orange vvas at that tyme advanced as far as Salisbury) and accordingly on Nov. 27. ſent to his Majeſtie by the Poſt an Aſſurance thereof in an

                  <p>Moreover Conſidering my ſelfe once more in the Capacity of a Civill Magiſtrate, as vvell as Eccleſiaſticall, I did a fevv dayes after deſire my Brethren Juſtices &amp; Deputy Lieutenants, to give mee a Meeting, to conſult about Serving his Majeſtie to the Utmoſt of our Povvers (Hearing as yet nothing from our Bishop) and more particularly hovv to defend our ſelves againſt the Lords &amp; Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, vvho had Seized on Yorke for the Prince of Orange, &amp; vvere ſome of them, advancing northvvards to ſécure Durham and Nevvcaſtle. But this honeſt Zeale of mine, vvas by their shunning this Opportunity of Meeting likevviſe renderd fruitleſs, and the Lord Lumly on Wensday the fifth of Dec: Surprized us, &amp; enterd Durham (whiles J vvas preaching in the. Pulpit of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall, in my Courſe, it being the firſt Wensday in Advent) with 50 Horſe, or thereabouts, &amp; ſundry Gentry of that, &amp; the County of Yorkshire, immediately afters his Arrivall Sending one Capt Ireton vvith ten Troopers up to my Door, to ſeize on my Armes, &amp; Horſes, vvhich I refuſing to deliver, or Wait on his Lordhip, hee in his Lords name confined mee to my Houſe during his ſtay in that Citty.</p>
                  <p>On Thursday follovving the Lord Lumly vvithout any Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition read the Prince of Oranges declaration at the Caſtle in the Preſence of moſt of the Deputy Lieutenants, Juſtices, &amp; Gentry vvho flock'd into his Lordship; and by their Compliance encouraged him to ſend to the Magiſtrates of Nevvcaſtle to demand Reception there, but being refuſed Admittance, the Saturday after, haſtily &amp; vvith ſome precipitation, returned, hee and his Company, to Yorke, after having read Publickly at the Market Croſſe the Prince of Oranges declaration, attended on by a great Number of Gentry &amp; the Country Troop; but I thanke God there were no horſes nor men of mine (tho the Deane at other times ſent four) to encreaſe the number, &amp; honour that Cerimony; vvhich hinderd ſeverall of the Clergy, at that tyme; to ſend in theirs to the leſſenning of the Appearance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:110636:46"/>
Hereupon I did Judge it meet the next day after being ſunday, to Preach againe, tho I had done it lately in my ovvne Proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in the Cathedrall Pulpit, à ſeaſonable Loyall Sermon (ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to my paſt life and Actions in that Country) to perſvvade the members of that Church, &amp; all the Auditory to ſtand firme to their Allegiance, in that day of Temptation &amp; never to Joyne in the leaſt vvayes vvith that Horrid Rebellion vvhich vvas at that tyme Set on foot in the Nation. Which Sermons I have Printed to Juſtifye mee to all the vvorld (if the publication of theſe do not do it) from being acceſſary to the Defection, vvhich then began, (to the Intollerable vexation of my mind) in that Conformable County; vvhich had till the Summer paſt, by it's forvvard Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience &amp; Dutifull Reſpects ſtuck ſo cloſe to the Crovvne, that his late Majeſtie vvas vvont to ſtile it his Loyall County of Durham.</p>
                  <p>Thus was God pleaſed to aſſiſt a Poor vveak inconſiderable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (Exalted beyond his merit to a high Station) of the Church of England, vvith fidelity &amp; Courage, to maintaine his Poſt againſt the Abettors of that unnaturall Invaſion, vvhich it vvas Eaſy to foreſee vvould bee (as it hath been) attended on by an intollerable Uſurpation of the Crovvne, &amp; violation of the Lavves, and finally, if God should not of his Mercy, by ſome kind of miracle, Prevent, by the utter Ruine of the Church of England; and conſequently of thoſe vvho had at firſt invited the ſvvord into the Land, &amp; betook themſelves to a deſperate Remedy, a thouſand times vvorſe than the Diſeaſe Complained off.</p>

Which Opportunity I made vſe off, and

was after many Tempeſts &amp; a tedious voyage by reaſon of contrary winds, at laſt, ſafely Landed at Honfleur, over againſt Haver de Grace, By the mouth of the River SEINE, on the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of march ſtilo novo, and the very day after his Majeſties departure from Breſt for Ireland; which miſſing of the King was a great disappointment &amp; mortification to mee.</p>
                  <p>Being ſomewhat indiſpoſed after my Long &amp; troubleſome voyage (tho I was never ſick at ſea) &amp; in ſome danger as I thought of an ague, I reſted a whole week in that Place, where I found all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more than ordinarily civill to mee, vpon their being ſatisfied that it was my Loyalty had brought mee there, &amp; that I was fled to the King; tho I owned my ſelfe to bee not only a Proteſtant, &amp; an Eccleſiaſtick, but an Englihman; which is now thought impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent &amp; a shame to confeſſe ones ſelfe, vnleſſe hee carryes with him vndeniable Teſtimonies of his late fidelity to his Prince. After I had paid my Reſpects to the Governour the Marquis of Beuron, &amp; returned the compliments I had received, on the 25.

I confeſſe I have not any great Reaſon, during my Indiſpoſition to make this citty the Place of my Reſidence, for the ſake of the air, which I beleive not very good &amp; Propet for a Conſumptive Body.

But the Other ſatisfactions I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, in an able Phyſitian, privy to my infirmity of Body &amp; a kind Faithfull Freind in adverſity, not to bee found in our Age every day nor in every Place, do make amends abundantly for any defects of the clime, and are not to bee contemned by A Perſon in my circumſtances, driven very bare out of his native Country for his fidelity to his Prince.</p>
                  <p>Aſſoon as I had fixed my Reſolution of ſtaying awhile here at Roüen, I did preſume to informe his Majeſtie, by a Packet I ſent into Ireland to my Lord Melford, of my Arrivall in France, &amp; the manner of my eſcape, with an Aſſurance of my unalterable Loyalty, and that I should eſpouſe his ſervice with the ſame zeale during his Exile &amp; adverſity, as when hee was on the Throne.</p>

                  <p>And here I do in the firſt place, declare with all ſincerity, that I am reſolued, by Gods Grace, to live &amp; dye a true ſon of the Church of England, Whereof King Charles was, King Iames 2.

And I do openly affirme to all the World, that however her children (or rather thoſe who have pretended to bee ſoe) have behaved themſelves, Either heretofore, or of late, to the ſcandall of the world &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of her Conſtitution, I am aſſured she will bee found, upon thorough and ſerious Examination, A Church which doth not Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance Rebellion, or, indeed, any ſin, or wickedneſſe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
                  <p>I have given no juſt reaſon, I thanke God, to any to thinke mee of another Opinion. And if ſome men have been ſoe uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable as to Cenſure mee for ever deviating from her, it hath been only for ſuch Carriage of mine, as may beſt demonſtrate that I am, A right Genuine, &amp; thorough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>paced (tho very feeble) Member of Her: I meane for my Exact Conformity to, &amp; conſtant Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of, the Excellent Rules of her Incomparable Liturgy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any variation; and my Conſtant zeale in aſſerting the Kings Prerogative, and her Excellent Doctrine of non-Reſiſtance &amp; Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Authority, in both which perohance I have been thought ſometimes a litle ſingular. But if I have been ſoe, I am ſorry for it, I meane, that I should want company in ſo laudable &amp; Chriſtian a Cauſe &amp; Practice; For I muſt ſtill affirme that the firſt is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable Duty of Every Church man, and beſt meanes to preſerve her, &amp; the laſt (which way ſoever it fled at the Prince of Oranges Invading England) the very Flour and Glory of our Ch: which

neither loſſe of Eſtate, nor life, shall (by the aſſiſtance of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty) cauſe mee to Renounce.</p>
                  <p>I do therefore humbly intreat your ſelfe and all my Relations, no wiſe to ſuſpect mee, as if Wavering from my Obedience to my Mother (the Church) for my immoveable Adherence to the cauſe &amp; intereſt of the Father of our Country, and my innate Abhorrence of Diſputing, Conteſting, or rudely Capitulating with my Prince, even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then when hee commanded things very contrary to my ſentiments, which I did Judge not only inexpedient, but prejudiciall to the Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing condition of our Church.</p>
                  <p>Had I fail'd as too many did in that Iuncture, or in paying the very ſame duties ef Allegiance &amp; Honour, to my Preſent Souerai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gne, When hee came to the Crowne, as I had performed to the late King, his Royall Brother &amp; my Gratious Maſter of Bleſſed memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (becauſe his preſent Majeſtie declared himſelfe of the R.

But God having enabled mee to Reſiſt this Temptation (which hath ſo mightily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the Nation) I would not have you Feare that I shall bee Ouerthrowne by any other.</p>
                  <p>I am I confeſſe, fled out of the Nation to aſſert the Cauſe of a R. Cath. Prince, &amp; I live at preſent in à R. Cath. Country.

                  <p>But I shall give you noe more Trouble, by way of Information concerning my ſelfe. I shall rather crave liberty to convey to my Younger Relations (ſince they are numerous) by your favour and meanes (iſ you pleaſe) ſome wholeſome Advice for their Edification,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:110636:53"/>
to eſtablish thoſe who are not Tainted, and to reſtore thoſe who are, with the falſe Notions &amp; Maximes of the Times.</p>
                  <p>My Elders I shall no wiſe diſturb at preſent with my remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſe. But I humbly conceive it a kind of Duty to take a litle Paine ſometimes with the Others. My Father's &amp; Mother's Dedication of one of their ſons to the Church (and it falling to the lot of mee the vnworthieſt of them) doth in ſome ſort conſtitute mee A Preiſt to the whole Family; tho not to vndertake the Charge of all their Soules (that would bee a Task not only difficult but impoſſible for mee to diſcharge and I do not deſire it) yet to make to them now &amp; then ſome ſpirituall applications, as I do at Preſent, by your permiſion, in this letter, &amp; did likewiſe 5. yeares ſince, in ſome familiar ones to a Nephew in the Univerſity of Oxford (which I printed) is a good act of Chriſtian Religion &amp; Fraternall Charity.</p>
                  <p>I shall then humbly beg leave, in this paper, to deſire all thoſe, who have any wayes warp'd from that ſtrict Duty &amp; Reſpect which hath been ever paid by their Anceſtors to the Crown, to conſider their great obligations aboue others to bee Faithfull to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, taking more than ordinary care leaſt they Staine the honour of an Antient Houſe. And shall not, at preſent, inſiſt on any Duty paid directly to God; that was my buiſneſſe in part of my fore mention'd Addreſse; But the Duties of Subjection, &amp; Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance of Lawfull Princes, whom ſubjects are bound to Obey, what ever bee their Opinions or Practices, are ſo vilely Run dnwne in England, and ſo univerſally put out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that it is a peice of ſeaſonable charity to Revive their Reputation.</p>
                  <p>I thinke I may truly ſay without vanity or oftentation, that every one of us have been, through the mercy of God, trained up in as a deep a ſence of that profound Reſpect &amp; Submiſſion which is due from ſubjects to their Supreme, as any family in the Nation, having beeu in an extraordinary manner Bleſt with Loyall &amp; Religious Parents &amp; Progenitors; who have given the beſt evidence of their ſincere &amp; hearty dutifulneſs to their Soveraignes in ſealing it with their Bloud.

                     </gap>here hath never A Blemish of Disloyalty, Bleſſed be God, been fix'd on the Family of the Granvilles, or on the meaneſt Branch thereof. And that there should any Perſon now lye under that cenſure, is to mee an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable mortification, &amp; the Heavieſt part of my Affliction, amidſt my ſufferings for my fidelity to the Crowne. But ſince the Torrent hath Overborne ſome of ours as well as too many of every Antient, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable &amp; Loyall Houſe in the Nation, I cannot ſatisfie my ſelfe to ſit ſtill, and not put to my helping Hand to ſave them: By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring them, among other things, to beware how they ſwallow not only new Oathes, but new Conceited Querks and Diſtinctions of thoſe Temporiſing Common Lawyers, who have, out of ſordid Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, or Feare; by an unintelligible unheard off ſort of Abdication, Coyned purely for the ſervice of an Uſurper, deformed the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy &amp; Church of England: Making a ſtrange kind of Monſter of the Fayreſt and Beſt of the Reformed Churches; in placing two heads on one Body, ſuch as are there the moſt unlikely of any in the world to agree, A Popish &amp; a Presbiterian one.</p>
                  <p>I never did immagine that I was, or ever should become a Pillar of the Church, [Tho you all know, that I did in a time of Adverſity &amp; Rebellion, when there was small Hopes of Being Deane of Durham, Devote my ſelfe thereto honeſtly with Good will to Gods ſervice &amp; without Deſigne.] Much leſſe do I fancy my ſelfe A Perſon of ſomuch Might or Skill, as to bee able to ſtem ſuch a Tide, as hath Broken in upon us, &amp; Beaten down the High &amp; Rocky Cliffes of England, as if they had been only muddy Bankes or the wooden Fences of a Low-Country. But on the other ſide, I have not ſoe meane thoughts of the Grace &amp; Power of God Almighty, who hath manifeſted his ſtrength in my Weakneſſe, in upholding &amp; keeping mee ſteddy, [during the late Terrible Shock which like an Earth Quake made the Foundations of the Kingdom to Tremble, and overthrew Divers ſupporters of Church &amp; State] as to deſpaire of all ſucceſſe In my Attempt to fortifie at leaſt ſome, if I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not regaine Others, or any, of my Kinred to whom I write. Who ought not to Conceit themſelves ſo able Divines, as to thinke they are, in ſpirituall matters, above my Counſell &amp; advice.</p>
                  <p>To accomplish this Good worke, whereon I invoke the Aſſiſtance of that Spirit whoſe Power no Creature is able to Reſiſt, I shall lay before their Eyes ſome of the Good old Church of England-Divinity,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:110636:54"/>
which hath been infuſed into mee, as well as their Fathers in our Youthes, by thoſe Right Orthodox &amp; Loyall Doctors of the old Stamp under whoſe Conduct wee have had the felicity to bee trained up. And remembring &amp; well conſidering the words of our Saviour Chriſt, that a Prophet hath allwayes leaſt honour in his own Country, &amp; among his own Kin, I shall keep ſtrickly &amp; faithfully not only to the Senſe, but often in proſecuting this Point, uſe the very words of A Famous Divine, of Authority aboue any mans Contempt, <note place="margin">Dr. Hen. Hamond.</note>being juſtly, had in houour &amp; veneration, of the whole Nation, as well as our own Family.</p>
                  <p>IN the firſt place, then, I here take liberty to put your and mine owne Relations in mind of ſome ſeaſonable Truths, well Calculated for the meridian of an Antient Loyall Family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; the moſt effectuall Preſervative which I know off, to ſecure their Innocency in a wavering, Corrupt, ſeditious Age, and Country, tinctur'd all over with Schiſme &amp; Rebellion. To wit.</p>
                  <p>That our Bleſſed ſaviour Chriſt &amp; his diſciples were, of all the Doctors who ever were in the world, the moſt carefull to preſerve the Doctrine &amp; Practice of Allegiance, and entire Submiſſion &amp; Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Supreme Powers, which were deputed by God as his Vicegerents to Governe the world; even then, at that very time, when they lived under Heathen Emperours, who where not only Great Oppoſers of Chriſtianity, but Cruell Mercileſſe &amp; Bloudy Perſecutors.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore it will bee worthy of Obſervation, that Chriſt Jeſus, tho hee were as God, the King of all Kings, &amp; might have changed &amp; diſpoſed of their Dominions, as hee pleaſed, yet did not thinke fit to make any Alteration in the Government hee found on Earth when hee was born; but on the Contrary, Judged it meet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue &amp; ſettle all in that Courſe, where in it had been formerly placed by God himſelfe, living in a moſt Exemplary manner in ſubjection to the knowne Lawes, paying Tribuute to Caeſar; Nay shewing ſo great Concerne that the Supreme Powers should receive their Due, that hee thought fit rather to work a miracle, than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate deficient in Paying Tribute.</p>
                  <p>Whereto if wee add our Lords Refuſall to accept of the Judiciall Cognizance of an Offence, when hee was put upon it, as hee did of A Crowne when it was offer'd him by the People, there will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare ſtrong matter of Conviction, &amp; proof of the Inviolableneſſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:110636:55"/>
of the Rights of Government, which it is not lawfull for any perſon on earth to uſurp or meddle with, without a Juſt Call. So far was our Humble &amp; Righteous Lord, the Capt: of our Salvation, from retrenching any of the Magiſtrates former Rights, that hee added to MOSES in this matter, enjoyning greater Awe &amp; Reverence to be given to the Civill Power.</p>
                  <p>Wherein wee may take further notice, that Chriſt Jeſus hee was ſo extraordinarily Carefull &amp; Tender: That where as MOSES among the Egiptians, when hee was but a Private man, did take upon him to exerciſe an Act of Judicature on the Egyptian which wronged the Iſraelite Exod. 2. 12. Chriſt would not do any ſuch thing, leaving the woman taken in adultery, and all other offenders, to the ordinary legall Courſe; and would not upon any <hi>Invitation,</hi> or <hi>Importunity, Vſurp Authority,</hi> or take upon him any thing in that matter.</p>
                  <p>This without other Inlargement may Abundantly Evince, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to the Doctrine and Practice of Chriſt, and Conſequently how unchriſtian and ungodly are the Doctrines of thoſe Ambitious Men who make Chriſtianity a Ground, or Excuſe, for moving Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, &amp; Raiſing Rebellion, thereby diſquieting States, &amp; shaking if not diſsolving Kingdomes.

                     </gap>ious colours of Preſervation of Religion, Libertyes, or Lawes.</p>
                  <p>Whereof wee have now a late, &amp; perhaps more Notable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance than ever was in the World: An Attempt ſo Abhorred &amp; Unnaturall: A I act every wayes ſo unjuſtifiable; &amp; an Impiety ſo Daring, that it muſt neceſſarily, in the Concluſion, pull down Heavy wrath, if not Speedy Vengeance, both on the <hi>Contriver</hi> &amp; the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; Inviter</hi> &amp; the <hi>Invited,</hi> or on their Poſterity. If an extaor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary deep Humiliation before God, &amp; a ſincere Repentance, ſome what anſwerable to the Greatneſſ of the Provocation, do not in due ſeaſon appeaſe his Indignation.</p>
                  <p>Of which Heinous Guilt it concerns every one, who hath been unfortunately dipt therein (as every Complier with, as well as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter of, the new Government in England certainly is) with greateſt ſpeed, &amp; care to purge himſelfe. And I do hope &amp; Pray that all thoſe, to whom I do preſume here in this paper to Addreſſ my ſelfe, will take theſe things into timely &amp; deep Conſideration: washing off thoſe Staines of Disloyalty, that may have involved any in the

Guilt of an Unparalled Uſurpation, wihch I am afraid expoſes poor England to God Almightyes Impending Judgements more than all the former ſins of out ſelves or Fore-Fathers.</p>
                  <p>That I have, for my own particular, practiſed the very ſame Loyalty &amp; honeſt zeale in reference to the Service of my Soveraigne (tho A Roman Catholick,) that I did to his Royall Brother; And have not, that I can diſcover upon the moſt diligent ſearch, willfully &amp; knowingly, made one Falſe Step towards the late Irregular &amp; Injuſtifiable Method of Preſervation of our Religion &amp; Lawes, by the Ungodly Practiſes &amp; meanes of INVASION &amp; USURPATION (which hath in good truth layen both a Gaſping) is a Felicity which doth not only wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupport, but ſometimes almoſt transport mee, amidſt my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Exerciſes of Patience. And will make mee rellish the worſt Air, or Uſage, that I can meet with abroad, where there are no Fogs, nor Fumes, raiſed by Rebellion, better than the beſt Air or Proferment in England, or any other Country where there Are. And here I should beg pardon, for this preſent Trouble &amp; Conclude, having been I feare too tedious, but that I ſtand obliged, leaſt I preach in vaine, to answer one Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which it is eaſy to fore-see will be made againſt my Doctrine, and may carry more Appearance of Reaſon therewith than any Other.</p>
                  <p>To wit.</p>
                  <p>Chriſts Example pretended for ſubmiſsion to the Prevailing Povver; ſince his acknovvledging Allegiance to bee due to Tiberius Caeſar; vvhoſe Predeceſſors had ſo lately changed the Government of Rome by the Senate, did by that Act of his give liberty to vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lavvfully to yeild our Allegiance to any vnjuſt prevailing Povver, vvhat ever it bee.</p>
                  <p>This difficulty being ſolved by the Forementioned learncd Doctor of our owne Church &amp; Nation, of undeniable Authority &amp; an Eminent Confeſſour in the Great Rebellion, I'le give the Answer in his owne very words without the leaſt variation. Which is ſo ſubſtantiall an one, that it is ſeaſonable at this inſtant to be expoſed to view. And if there were no other Deſigne in my writing would juſtify the Publication of this letter.</p>
                  <p>In short his words are theſe. <q>The ſtate of the Government of Rome, at that time when Chriſt Jeſus lived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt bee conſidered diſtinctly what it was. It is true indeed that Julius Caeſar had (not many yeares before) wreſted the Power out of the Senates hands, and Changed the Government violently: but before this time of Tiberius,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110636:56"/>
whereof wee ſpeake, the buiſneſſe was ſo accorded betwen the Senate &amp; the Emperours, that the Emperour now Reigned unqueſtionably without any Competition of the Senate: In him the Power was quietly ſeated, the money ſuperſcribed with his Image, and Edicts ſent out in his name, and hee looked on by all (with out any Rivall) as inferiour to God only. In which caſe of his acknowledged Power, Chriſt being borne in his Dominious, thinkes not fit to make a Queſtion of his Right, where there was none made by the Romans, or to diſpute Caeſars Title (However acquired by violence at firſt) when they from whom it was taken did acquieſce, &amp; diſputed it not. Which Caſe how different it is from other forcible Uſurpations (where the legall Soveraigne doth ſtill Claime his Right to his Kingdomes, and to the Allegiance of his Subjects, no way acquitting them from their Oathes, or laying down his Pretenſion, tho hee be for the preſent Ouerpowred) is eaſily diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible to any who have the Courage &amp; Fidelity to conſider it, &amp; is not by his own Intreſts bribed, or frighted from the performance of his Chriſtian Duty. It being withall moſt certaine, that it belongs not to the conveniences or advantages of ſubjects to determine, or prevaile any thing in the Buiſneſſe of Princes Rights.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, one of the moſt formidable Objections &amp; Arguments for ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to an unlawfull prevailing Power, being thus effectually anſwered, I shall not thinke it paine-worthy, in a letter, to multiply other of leſſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, which by conſequence may more eaſily be blowne away.</p>
                  <p>And indeed I ſuppoſe it needleſſe, at this Time of Day, to fall to ſtrong reaſonings to evince the unſincerity of the Pretenſions of the Contrivers, &amp; Promoters, of this late unhappy Change of Government in Church &amp; State; they themſelves having deſtroyed all the Plauſibility of their own Profeſſions &amp; Declarations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt.</hi> The Prince of Orange diſowned that hee came to Conquer, or meddle with the Crowne, and yet moſt willingly accepted thereof at the very firſt offer of the People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly.</hi> The Exerciſe of the Kings Prerogative in diſpenſing with ſome Lawes, on Extraordinary Emergencyes, was thought a Burden Intollerable; But it hath been no Crime ſince in the Subject to diſpenſe with all; They having got (as they thinke) what they have long Contended for, the Supremacy in their own hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The Introducing of Arbitrary Power was the Dread of moſt men, &amp; now they are contented to enjoy nothing elſe.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly.</hi> It was Judged unpardonable Tyranny in our Soveraigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to touch the meaneſt of his ſubjects in Point of Property; but it is a laudable vertue in the Subject, to uſurp upon, nay diſpoſe of the Crowne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly.</hi> The English were Overwhelmed with Jealouſies of introducing Popery &amp; promoting the Intreſt of France. And all the while have gone the direct way to bring the worſt of their Feares on themſelves, by Driving the King &amp; Prince out of the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixtly.</hi> In a word. Sundry other Things, which were deemed nnſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in a lawfull Prince of Gods Ordaining, are now Practiſed without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt by an Uſurper, &amp; King of the Peoples making.</p>

                  <p>I shall conclude with A Memorable Saying of our Royall Martyr King Charles the 1. on his Obſervation of a like ſpirit of Deluſion which in his dayes poſſeſſed the generality of the People of the ſame King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, in Dethroning, nay Murthering, their Lawfull King, &amp; one of the Beſt of Princes, at his owne doores.</p>

                  <p>THat the Printing of this letter with the following Addreſs &amp; Queres, may not appear to your ſelfe, as I fore-ſee they will to all Zealous Contrivers &amp; Supporters of the Uſutpation in England, an act of not only deplorable Folly, but downe right Frenzy, I humbly Crave your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to inſert a few lines by way of Poſtſcript.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant, but that this attempt may render me abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capàble of all the favour you have shew'd me, ſince my Flight into France, in your voluntary kind interpoſition to ſecure my Revenu; &amp; that it muſt alſo expoſe me for a ſubject of Common Talk &amp; Cenſure thoughout the Nation. But ſince an un blemis'd Loyalty is infinitely mote valuable than the Poſſeſſions of this world, &amp; that, I was perſvaded that the Courſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I did, by Gods grace, Steer, was the moſt effectual way to ſecure that, the very Reputation whereof I eſteem far beyond the Rents I had at Durham, Eaſington, &amp; Sedgefeild; nay moreover ſince that my paſt Life, &amp; laſt Deportment in England, had not been all of a piece, if I had not done as I did; You will not, I truſt, condemn my Cariage, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever contrary to the Maxims &amp; Temper of the Reigning Generation, as unworthy of your Houſe &amp; Family.</p>
                  <p>What I have done, I have perform'd, thanks be to the Almighty, <hi>in the Integrity of my Heart &amp; Innocency of my hands,</hi> &amp; the ſence &amp; Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here of (the Iſſue of things exery day more &amp; more convincing me that I was in the Right) doth afford unſpeakable Comfort to my ſoule.</p>
                  <p>My Feeding of ſome Friends, in my voyage from Scotland hither, with Expectation of an Inter-view in Kent, &amp; talk of a Paſsport (the fitſt of which I did not intend, &amp; the laſt, if I could get away without it, I did not deſire) is a crime I do aſsure my ſelfe of Gods pardon for, &amp; of thoſe friends likewiſe whom I deluded &amp; diſapointed, when God shall be pleas'd to ſend us a happy meeting.</p>
                  <p>As for that more unpardonable ſin where with ſome do reproach me, &amp; whereof I cannot ſo well clear my ſelfe before the World (but is the only one, thanks be to God, that the World can accuſe me of) I me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

frugall &amp; crafty than my ſelfe have done in leſs time, with a ſmaller Eſtate or Revenu, I am like to do a ſad Pennance for it here abroad in a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Kingdome. And the Friends &amp; Relations I leave at home, will not, I hope, add affliction to affliction (if they will not help me with their Purſes) by loading me with their Cenſures; eſpecially conſidering two laſt Acts of mine to demonſtrate the ſincerity of my Repentance for it: Firſt that I did voluntarily diminish my Revenu very conſiderably, by Rent-Charges to ſatisfy my own juſt Debts; Secondly that I look'd on my long Neglect to practize Frugality as ſo great a ſin, that I did as voluntarily put my ſelfe into a kind of white sheet to atone fot the ſame, by confeſſing it to God &amp; the world, in a ſmall Peice I printed in the year 85.</p>
                  <p>This is my Comfort, that no perſon in England is like to looſe by me, unleſs by his own proper Choice, &amp; if one man doth ſo, he muſt thank himſelfe rather than blame me. If I ſuffer Deprivation to his loſs, he muſt quarrell with God &amp; the King, whoſe Commands have unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably oblig'd me to hold faſt my Religion &amp; Loyalty. And if the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing of both, or either of them, was in my Judgement too dear a purchace of my Revenu for my ſelfe, no one could reaſonably expect that I should undergo it for an other.</p>
                  <p>Hoping that theſe few Hints may give ſome ſatisfaction to all, but the Malitious Authors of our preſent Miſery, I shall not enlarge this Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript farther, than to acknowledge with all thankfullneſs the kindneſs which you have shew'd me in procuring A Diſpenſation for mee (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I have contradicted your Example) which I eſteem thegreater Obligation, at thoſe friends hands who were inſtrumentall therein, ſince they did it without my Privity or Motion.</p>

I conceive it therefore my duty to informe your Lordship, not only where, but what I am, in this age of mutability, which hath produced, I think, almoſt all kind of changes, among men of every Quality, Degree, &amp; Calling, but that which Doctour B. speaks of, in his letters concerning his travells into Italy; I mean the change of ſex.</p>
                  <p>I need not, my Lord, give You any particular account of my behaviour, or uſage, in England, after your Lordship was call'd up to London about Michaelmaſs laſt, or of the manner of my Eſcape, ſince your Lordship was certified, by letters from my ſelfe, in the months of Oct: and Nov: laſt, of moſt matters of moment relating to the Church and County of Durham (tho I had the honour &amp; ſatisfaction of receiving an answer to few of them) and may come to the knowledge of other things, by the relation of my deportment, which I have publish'd in my printed letter to my Brother the Earle of Bathe; whereto I crave leave to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110636:60"/>
refert your Lordship, &amp; all who are inquiſitive after me.</p>
                  <p>I shall only embrace this occaſion ſolemnely, &amp; publickly, to aſsure your Lordship, in generall, that I did faithfully, and with as much punctuallity as I was able, diſcharge thoſe Truſts which were committed to me, in every one of the places, and offices, which I had the honour to beare under your Lordship; &amp; maintain'd my Poſte in your Abſence, not withſtanding mighty diſcouragements, till it was not poſſible for me any longer to ſtrive againſt that Torrent, which had hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all matters, in that &amp; other parts of the Nation, into great diſorder &amp; confuſion.</p>
                  <p>When I ſaw there was no poſsible means left for me, but to ſink, by endeavouring to oppoſe what was irreſiſtable; or ſwimme down the ſtream (which no argument not example of the age could, I thank God, prevaile with me to do.) I was under a neceſsity to turne aſide, and withdraw my ſelfe, beholding matters a while at a diſtance; rather than in my own ſtation &amp; place of acting; ſince I carried about whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h me an unalterable loyall heart, which would not ſuffer me to runn (as moſt did) with the multitude; &amp; on the other ſide wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both ſtrength of mine own, &amp; the aſſiſtance of others, effectually to oppoſe that unruly &amp; many headed monſter. But did not reſolve to leave the Kingdome, &amp; commit my Flock &amp; Family alone to Almighty God's protection &amp; care, (as I afterwards did) till I had a powerfull example, which a duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſubject ought to be proud to follow, and a Precedent which may ſet me above the cenſures of any perſon in the three Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>When my Soveraine was forc'd from his own pallace, nay driven out of the Realme, it was time for thoſe who were firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolv'd to adhere to, &amp; ſuffer with Him, to yeild to that force &amp; neceſſity, which A mighty Potentate, by complying with, proclaim'd to be invincible. Having then the honour to be one of that number (&amp; glorying that I am ſo) it would have been a prepoſterous courſe for me (who never play'd my game ſo as to ſave my ſtake) to have ſtay'd at home, or in England, when I was no longer capable to ſerve Him, in thoſe offices wherein I was plac'd; and while I had no other
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:110636:60"/>
proſpect, but that of a priſon, without doing what was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to do, I mean bow down to Baal, or in plain English, ſubmit to an Uſurper.</p>
                  <p>This occaſion'd my Flight firſt to Carlisle, &amp; from thence upon it's declaring for the P. of Orange; &amp; change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, to Edingburgh, &amp; from that citty, upon intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of an Imbargo, into France, (as is ſet forth more at large in the former letter to my Brother) to have the honour &amp; ſatisfaction, which is no ſmall conſolation to a loyall Subject in Banishment, of doing homage to the Royall Family, &amp; viewing our hopefull young Prince, who will live, I truſt in God, to conſtreine his Enemies to confeſs (what they were, I doubt not, alwayes perſwaded of in their hearts) that he is the legitimate ſon of King Iames the 2: and one of the greateſt bleſsings, which God ever beſtow'd on the English Nation.</p>
                  <p>As for my part (how great a parodox soever it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to ſome) I am fully convinced of the truth thereof, as I alwayes was of Gods wonderfull Goodneſs &amp; Providence, in bringing his Father, our Gracious Soveraine, through all his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, to the Crown. And I fear, that our abhorr'd Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude towards God for two ſuch ineſtimable bleſsings, as the ſecurity of the ſucceſſion by an Heire Male, &amp; thoſe Halcyon dayes, which we for two years enjoy'd (and might have enjoy'd longer had it not been our own faults) under a Gracious Prince of a condeſcending race, have above other ſins pull'd down God's judgements, &amp; contributed towards the miſerry we now groan under, &amp; the greater miſery which hangs over our heads, &amp; out of which we can never be deliver'd, but by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary aſsiſtance of the ſame mercifull &amp; gracious God and King, whom we have above meaſure provoked and incens'd.</p>
                  <p>I have never been asham'd, I thank God, to owne ſuch ſentiments, as theſe, amidſt all the deluſions, which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of men of a contrary opinion have layen under, &amp; the greateſt Obloquy &amp; Contempt, which by them hath been caſt on every one, who ſtuck cloſe to his Majeſty (as I thank God I have done to the utmoſt of my power) in aſserting his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. But I need not affirme this to your Lordship, or any within your Dioceſse, having ſufficiciently proclaim'd my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110636:61"/>
concerning theſe matters, in the pulpit, both in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall &amp; other Churches, after his Majeſty's happy acceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to the Imperial Crown, &amp; the Birth of the Prince of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</p>
                  <p>Towards the Filling up the meaſure of that Iniquity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our juſt God would no longer diſpenſe, &amp; whereto <hi>our Kings, our Princes, &amp; our Prophets, nay all the people in the land,</hi> (to ſpeak in the Evangelical Prophets phraſe,) <hi>have contributed more or leſs,</hi> I know, that I my ſelfe [a wretched miſerable ſinner] have ſadly help'd in every one of my capacities, &amp; heartily beg pardon of God through JESUS-CHRIST for my share of the guilt. But it is to me an unſpeakable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that neither my Enemies, nor my own Conſcience, can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me of thoſe ſins, which do ſeem to be the more immediate ingredients of God's wrath, &amp; which certainly more than others have provoked him, in <hi>ſuch Manner,</hi> &amp; by <hi>ſuch Inſtruments,</hi> to punish Us.</p>
                  <p>For I have heartily, from the bottome of my ſoule, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyc'd at our Gracious Soverain's mounting the Throne, at Gods bleſsing him &amp; us with a hopefull Prince. I have been all along, without murmuring, contented with his Government. I have had allwayes more jealouſy of the ſubject, than of my Soveraigne. I have thought our ſelves (as it hath proved) nearer a Rebellion, than the Introducing of Popery. And laſtly I am not, no not in the thoughts of my heart, guilty, in the leaſtwiſe, of that <hi>Perfidiousneſs, &amp; Ingratitude,</hi> to my <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> or <hi>Injuſtice &amp; Vnnaturalneſs</hi> to my <hi>Fellovv-Subjects,</hi> of calling in <hi>Forreigne aſsiſtance</hi> for our <hi>Preſervation.</hi> Or if I had, it should have been any Nation in the world rather than our Neighbours of Holland, being not ignorant of their dealings with the English both at Amboina &amp; Bantam.</p>
                  <p>Tis highly probable, my Lord, that theſe very things which I here alledge for my juſtification, &amp; wherein I ſo much glory, will be received with deriſion, and objected againſt me as my crimes, &amp; that mine &amp; other men's forwardneſs to <hi>obey, &amp; comply vvith,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> has contributed to his Fall. This is a fate, which I am ſure it will not be poſsible for me to avoid, ſince that, before I left the Nation, I had this lay'd to my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110636:61"/>
charge, by ſome, who to juſtify their own ſawning on the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile, out of Fear or Intreſt, began to lay all the guilt of the King &amp; Kingdome's overthrow to the door of the King &amp; his moſt obedient ſubjects; as in <hi>Oates's &amp; Tong's plot,</hi> ſome brought in our late gracious Soveraigne as concern'd in a deſigne againſt his own Life.</p>
                  <p>But I would crave leave, here, to know who are the Objectors. If they are ſuch as have renounced their Allegiance to their lawfull Soveraigne, I may ſave the labour to anſwer them; they being not qualified to cenſure &amp; accuſe me, for helping to what they were well pleas'd with, &amp; deſir'd should be brought to paſs.</p>
                  <p>If they be ſuch as will not, at laſt, ſubmit to the change of Government, &amp; take new oaths, tho they have been too far concern'd in, &amp; have too much contributed to, the ſetting up an uſurp'd power (by a greater Complaiſance with the Prince of Orange, than I have been guilty of towards my Soveraigne) I reply, that the <hi>Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance</hi> which we have alwayes, till of late, been fond of, ſet forth at large in our <hi>Church-Homilies,</hi> doth juſtify my behaviour; whereof any one may be ſoon convinced that will be pleas'd to take the paines (which I have lately done) of ſeriously peruſing, ſtudying, &amp; analizing the Homilies published by authority, Concerning <hi>Obedience,</hi> &amp; againſt <hi>vvillfull Diſobedience</hi> or <hi>Rebellion;</hi> From whence, no more than from the Holy ſcripture, can I learn any Medium betwixt <hi>Reſiſtance &amp; Compliance.</hi> He that doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with Expreſs &amp; Poſitive commands of his Soveraigne, when he beleives thoſe commands lawfull, doth in ſome ſort reſiſt Him; that ſaying of our Lord, in this caſe, being certainly applicable, <hi>He that is not for me is againſt me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe, &amp; like cenſures, will not, my Lord, in any great meaſure afflict me. It hath been my fate to be, from my Youth, inur'd to ſuch, &amp; greater, exerciſes of patience. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I might be induced, rather to ſuſpect my Loyalty and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to my Soveraigne, If I should now eſcape Scot-free &amp; not be pelted at by thoſe, who out of the ſame mouth can blow hot &amp; cold, obey a lawfull Prince, &amp; obey an Uſurper; whoſe unjuſtifyable proceedings (bleſsed be God) my ſoule doth deteſt &amp;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110636:62"/>
abhorr, being founded in that Laodicean temper, loathſome to God &amp; Goodmen, which I have labour'd ever ſince I have born any publick office in Church or State, as far as it was poſsible for me, to oppoſe.</p>
                  <p>Your Lordship, I am ſure, (which is my comfort) will be none of thoſe, who shall load me with reproaches, for my dutifull Complyances whith his Majeſty, ſince your example, (which did out run others) as well as your advice, did power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully invite me thereto. And ſince your Lordship hath been ſo kind as to atteſt, with your mouth to his Majeſty, that I was never backward to concurr with You, in any thing which was for the King's ſervice. Wherefore I shall ſpend no more ink to diſturb your Lordship with inlarging on ſo unneceſsary a Topick. But I shall take care to ſtrive (by God's grace) to make good the Character, which your Lordship was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pleas'd to give of me laſt year to the King, you was not, my Lord, any wayes deceiv'd in your atteſtation, neither shall his Majeſty (I truſt in God) in his expectations from me.</p>
                  <p>The remaining paper then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Lord, will be more ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantly imploy'd in laying, before your Lordship &amp; the World, the Reaſons, why I have not govern'd my ſelfe by your Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hips example ſince October laſt, as I did before, &amp; cannot be prevail'd on now to comply with the People's, as I did with the Lord's Annointed my Leige &amp; Dread Soveraigne.</p>
                  <p>It was, I know, ſadly bewailable for perſons in ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſtations, &amp; ſo nearly related, as the Bishop &amp; Dean of Dutham, to draw two wayes, as we did (I muſt confeſs) after your Lordship was pleas'd to preſent a paper of Advice to his Majeſty, to comply with the demands of the Multitude.</p>
                  <p>And it was the more to be lamented, that ſuch diviſion should happen, in a juncture of affairs, &amp; Concuſsion of the Church &amp; State, that requir'd the Uniting of all perſons in every body Eccleſiaſtick &amp; Civil (all which ſtrength was little enough) to uphold our Soveraign Lord's Crown &amp; Dignity; which we, both, were ſtricktly by our repeated oathes (and poſsibly more than all others by particular obligations, having receiv'd our preferments by his favour) ingag'd to maintaine, &amp; which were more dangerously than ever ſtruck at by Enemies at home &amp; abroad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:110636:62"/>
I was aſtonish'd, my Lord at ſo ſuddaine &amp; unexpected, a change, &amp; was, out of reſpect to your Lordship, one of the laſt that, in the Citty &amp; Church of Durham, gave credit to the reports (wherein your honour was concern'd) which buſied for a while the mouth of almoſt every perſon in the County.</p>
                  <p>That, that very method which we were affraid, nay well aſsur'd of, before parting, was likely to deſtroy our preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment &amp; Governours (things portending as badly as in forty one) should ſo immediately (according to your own expreſsion) <hi>become the only, &amp; moſt aſsur'd, means of the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings perſon, &amp; eſtablishment of his Government in Church and State,</hi> gave me occaſion beyond all meaſure to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire. And what should move your Lordship, of all men in the Nation, in an unusuall way, to adviſe his Majeſty ſo to do, is not yet diſcover'd by me, thô it often imployes my thoughts.</p>
                  <p>This change of Meaſures in your Lordship my Dioceſan, whoſe Counſell, Example, and aſſiſtance, I did more than ever need and expect, at ſuch a deſperate Criſis, did wonderfully weaken mee in the diſcharge of all Duties incumbent on mee, either as a Church-man or Juſtice of the Peace, and did put mee under an unavoidable neceſſity of abating in my zeale to attempt ſundry things, and ingage in ſeverall Deſigns, which could not be proſecuted, much leſs accomplish'd, without the concurrence of my Bishop and Lord Lieutenant.</p>
                  <p>This did likewiſe incapacitate me to cenſure, or ſo much as curb thoſe inſolent Young Clergy-men, who before your Departure were arriv'd to ſuch a pitch of blodneſs, as to expoſe by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent inſinuations in the Congregation, not only their Dean, but Bishop, for Obedience to the King. And which impotency of mine was, the very Sunday after, made conſpicuous, by an other indiſcreet Sermon preach'd in the Cathedrall pulpit, which I was forc'd to paſs by without ſo much as admonition (only denying the Preacher the cuſtomary reſpects of an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to my table) for fear of a ſecond affront. Since inſtead of aſsiſtance from thoſe, who were ſworne to give me that, &amp; much more, I met with reproaches, &amp; was told in the publick diſcharge of the Deans office, that <hi>I vvas vvell enough Serv'd in that my Bishop had left me in the Lurch.</hi>

I had no small difficulty to bear up againſt &amp; repell thoſe Arguments, which were brought, the laſt year, out of the other Province, from the example of great &amp; venerable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, which my intirely devoted heart to honour and obey my King, would not permit me to immitate, tho modeſty would not allow me openly to condemn. But when thoſe, who labour'd to shake me off from my foundation of firm Loyalty, &amp; to betray my Innocence, by perswading me to enter into the Herd, diſcernd mee void of my laſt ſupport, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of the example of my own Bishop &amp; Father in God, they attackt me (your Lordship my imagine) with too great ſtrength and rudeneſs, for a ſingle Dean, without Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Superiour, or Concurrence of Inferiour Brethren, any longer to withſtand or oppoſe, with any conſiderable effect.</p>
                  <p>Tho God Almighty (prais'd be his holy Name) endow'd me, in that day of Triall, with ſo much courage, as to attempt to do it, in ſuch manner, as may hereafter prove to Edification; never changing my Note nor Meaſures (when all began to dance after an outlandish Pipe) as long as I ſtay'd on the Place. Witneſs my Sermons I preach'd on the 5. &amp; 9. of December<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> two dayes before I fled, &amp; the Sunday after the Generality of the Citty &amp; Country had, with open Armes &amp; Mouths, receiv'd a Diſcontented Lord, who the week before ſeiz'd on the Town for the P. of Orange<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; prophan'd both your Caſtle, &amp; the Markett Croſs, with the reading of a Treaſonnable Declaration, as is related more at large in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going letter.</p>
                  <p>I could not accord, I muſt confeſs, with ſuch Example of your Lordship, nor with the Example of others, in being ſilent, or ſitting ſtill, in a time of <hi>imminent Danger, VVarr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; Tumult,</hi> when good Nature, as well as good Conſcience, dictated to all faithfull Clergy men &amp; Chriſtians, not only <hi>to liſt up their voices like a Trumpett,</hi> but to employ all their hands to have reſtrain'd the unruly multitude, which had got the Bitt in their Teeth, &amp; were runing madly to a Change of Government, and Depoſition of their King; &amp; in that towards their own Deſtruction; ſince the Monarchy, as well as our Church, was like to receive (as it hath done) an incureable

blow, by an other Diſgrace &amp; Banishment of a lawfull Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigne of the ſame Stock &amp; Race, which had been once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore barbarously treated beyond expreſsion, &amp; in ſuch degree, that the English Nation, for a while, became an object of Contempt &amp; Indignation among the very Turks &amp; Pagans.</p>
                  <p>However matters might appear to your Lordship, &amp; other Prelates above at London, (as I ought in duty to conclude, by their &amp; your Actings, that they did otherwiſe than to me below) I could not diſcover, when my eyes were moſt open, &amp; clear'd by ſerious &amp; fervent Devotion, that any thing or courſe tended more to the preſervation of the King's Crown, &amp; ſecurity of our Church under Him, than our unfeign'd ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion to our ſupreme Moderatour &amp; Governour, &amp; our vigorous &amp; conſtant oppoſition of ſeditious Incendiaries &amp; Male-contents, who any wiſe Irritated, or Inflam'd the People, or did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifully capitulate with the King, being agitated (as was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent) by an humour of Popularity, &amp; that Republican ſpirit which was gone forth into the Nation, which ought to have been withſtood ſomuch the more, by how much it had gotten ſtrength, &amp; numbers, to terrify ſome of our greateſt Leaders in our very Sion, as well as our Jeruſalem; who put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a moſt dangerous Poſte [the head of the Multitude] not out of diſaffection to the King, I am perswaded, ſo much as out of fear of that ungovernable Beaſt, who will make leſs ſcruple to pull off the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Would God, that all thoſe, whom I dare not deny to be, as they think themſelves, very much wiſer men (tho they did approach as much towards rudeneſs in withsſtanding, as I did towards Flattery in complying with the King) had not too late diſcern'd the pernitious fatallneſs of the contrary Errour, in endeavouring to bring Gods Vice gerent to Terms, whereby the Soveraignty of our Defender of the faith, was ſo weaken'd,

                  <p>Tho the bodily Infirmities I now feele, as well as the greater ones I have ſtruggled with ſince I left Durham, [in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in a letter from Edingburgh] have been, and are, ſufficient to excuſe my Abſence, and may juſtify me in the eyes of God &amp; Man, for leaving, for ſome time, ſo cold and moiſt an air, as the North of England, and repairing into a Clime more warme and benigne, Yet I, who have been, all my dayes, a Lover of Plain-dealing, think not fit to conceal, any longer, the more ſubſtantial reaſons, which did at firſt hurry me away from You, and do ſtill detain me abroad.</p>
                  <p>Till I was well got out of the reach of thoſe New Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, whom I could neither owne, nor obey, and from whom, for that very cauſe, had hopes of ſmall favour, I was, as well as my Betters, neceſſitated to uſe, the moſt plauſible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I could with Innocence, for a Voyage into France, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out declaring the bottome of my deſigne. And Providence, at that time, furnishing me with one very Authentick, and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough [to witt, upon the returne of a dangerous Cough to go once more into a Country, from which I had receiv'd formerly conſiderable advantage, in point of Health,] I should have been much to blame, if I had not made uſe thereof, as I did, in order to my Eſcape.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:110636:66"/>
On this account (in my letter to You, &amp; diſcourſe with thoſe I mett in my journey) I inſiſted on little elſe, than what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to my then growing Indiſpoſition, which was come to a great height; neither did I (God be thank'd) meet, or converſe with any ſo unreaſonable, or inquiſitive, as to demand ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger motives, than the recovery and preſervation of my health, (the next valuable Bleſſing to the Salvation of my Soule,) to authoriſe my deſigne of haſtning into this Kingdome: famous for it's Soveraigne &amp; Beneficial air for all Conſumptive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; &amp; the virtue whereof, tho I am not got into the moſt ſalutiferous Region, I now already, in a very great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure perceive.</p>
                  <p>But tho all I alledge be very true and real, yet I dare not deny that other and greater matters (ſet forth in a precedent letter) did firſt put it into my thoughts, and incline me to quitt my Station, and without which, had the danger of my life been never ſo great, I muſt confeſs, that, I think, I had never more thus left my Charges, after ſo conſiderable an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence heretofore (to recover my health) from my Offices &amp; Cures.</p>
                  <p>In plain English then, I declare to all the World, that the true Cauſe of my ſuddain flight was, that I carried about me a Conſcience more untractable, and leſs pliable to an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, than moſt I left behind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, as proceſs of time hath made too apparent. My Conſcience (ſuch as it was) did oblige me, to the utmoſt of my Strength, to oppoſe all uſurp'd power (as I did to the laſt, wittneſs all the Congregation preſent in the Quire the Sunday before my departure) and then, I need not tell You, it was <hi>not fitt</hi> for me to ſtay there, any longer. I might uſe the word <hi>impoſsible</hi> rather than <hi>unfitt,</hi> ſince I could not with good Conſcience ſtay. <hi>Id tantum poſsumus</hi> (ſayes the Civillian) <hi>quod jure poſsumus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot deny that every one of You, and all thoſe Clergy in the Nation, which were ſatisfied and reſolv'd, to <hi>Submitt;</hi> that is to ſay renounce your Allegiance to your Lawfull Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aigne, and ſwear new to thoſe, who have ungodlily, and unjuſtly, depos'd him, have done politickly enough to remaine at home, ſit ſtill, &amp; hold your Tongues; at a time, when
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:110636:66"/>
the Right Church-of-England-Religion, (according to the beſt notion I have of it) nay Chriſtianity in generall, required all faithfull Preachers <hi>to lift up their voices like a Trumpet,</hi> to oppoſe the madneſs of the People, &amp; ſtop them in their Carreer to Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>But I, your unworthy Dean, who, without doubt or ſcruple, beleived it, at that time, as I do at preſent, a peice of deteſtable Rebellion to joyne with any, in a Conſpiracy againſt our Kings Crown, as well as Life, (and deſire to be torne with wild Horſes rather than ſo to do,) did as politickly, (and I am ſure more honeſtly) in withdrawing.</p>
                  <p>But I deſire You to remember, that I did not ſtir from my Poſte, till the Citty of Durham was polluted by the Reading of a Declaration, which by a late Proclamation of the King's was pronounced treaſonable; &amp; that there werè not four pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Magiſtrates, nor one Miniſter in the Town, had the Courage any wayes to oppoſe it, or declare their diſsent thereto: a v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Nay I deſire you moreover to conſider, that I did not <hi>runn avvay</hi> &amp; forſake my flocks, as ſome may be apt to object, when I ſaw the Wolfe coming, but after I ſaw him come, &amp; with open mouth ready to devoure, &amp; had my ſelfe in ſome ſort taſted his Fierceneſs.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech You therefore ſo take notice, that it was not till the 11. of December, at night, that I left Durham; a day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Sacred Majeſty was driven from Whitehall. By which time, the Wicked Contrivers of this ſad Revolution had accomplish'd what they had been long endeavouring, ſtript the King of all his Supports, put him under a neceſſity, as well as his moſt faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to fly into an other Nation, &amp; shewn their Good Will towards the Diſſolution of the Government.</p>
                  <p>And farther, and above all this, tho I could not ſtay lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Durham, without being defiled by concurring, or confined for

                  <p>Theſe two particulars granted, I leave all men to judge, whether it was an unwiſe act of mine, all things conſider'd, to withdraw <hi>vvhen, &amp; in ſuch manner,</hi> as I did.

The horrid Rebellion of thoſe dayes was leſs odious than the preſent one; which is accompanied with the higheſt Aggravations; leſs odious I ſay, or at leaſt leſs unnaturall, (than that under which the beſt Subjects &amp; Chriſtians in England at preſent groan) in ſundry reſpects, had not the former been deeply dyed in the blood of King Charles the Martyr. And yet all the Religion, &amp; great oſtentation of Purity of the Goſpell, wherewith it was introduced, &amp; at laſt, after a floud of Loyall blood, ſubmitted to, by an infatuated Generation, ended at length in down right Enthuſiaſme; which, by breaking of Fences, &amp; tearing up Foundations, let in a Deluge of all kind of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs. The Priviledges &amp; Properties, as well as the Liberty of the Subject, were got into the hands of ſuch miſerable Keepers, as kept them all to themſelves: in ſuch ſort, as ſcarce any Perſon.

                  <p>And indeed I cannot thoroughly reflect on that Church &amp; Citty, wherein I have (by God's permiſsion &amp; the Kings kindneſs) had the honour, for the laſt 27. years, to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified, without melting into Tears.

                  <p>It was one of the moſt painfull mortifications I ever met with, the weeke before my Departure, to diſcerne my ſelfe deſerted by all the Citty-Clergy in my honeſt zeal for the righteous Cauſe of my Soveraigne; In ſuch ſort, as not to diſcover, then on the place, any one Eccleſiaſtick, neither in the Cathedrall, nor any Parochial Church, or Chappell, with in the Precincts of that Citty, who had the courage, at that juncture, to own openly, either in the Pulpit, or in his Converſation, his oppreſs'd Prince's Intereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Honour, by shewing juſt Indignation againſt that Treaſonable Attempt, which was then inſolently made againſt his Crowne &amp; Dignity, in reading publickly, &amp; with great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, the <note n="*" place="margin">Prince of Orange's Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Rebellious paper mention'd in this &amp; former letters; Tho every man, who was not a mere Ideote, muſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that that very Act countenanced was in effect the pulling up the ſluce, &amp; letting in a Stream of Rebellion to overflow the whole County.</p>
                  <p>This was, I declare, to me a mighty exerciſe of Patience, &amp; did among other Preſsures, which poſsibly contributed much to my crazy condition laſt Winter, heavily afflict me.

                  <p>To demonſtrate undeniably to your ſelves, &amp; all that hear'd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:110636:72"/>
me that day, that I was not, among all my weakneſses, afraid or ashamed to owne my paſt life &amp; Doctrine, &amp; to compleat the Office of a Viſitor, as honeſtly &amp; heartily as I began, I choſe, you may remember, to lay before you the cheife heads of all the Good Counſell &amp; Advice, which I had given you at the former Conventions of the Clergy of my Jurisdiction, for four years together; even the four laſt extraordinary years, that is to ſay, ever ſince his gratious Majeſtie, our Liege Lord &amp; Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igne King Iames the 2:, mounted his Throne; tho I had too much reaſon, then to apprehend, by your long neglect thereof, &amp; running counter to the principles &amp; practice of your Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, it would badly ſuite with your palates, which at that time, to my greife, appear'd, &amp; ſince, without all diſpute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are found, not only vitiated, but poiſon'd, by the Leaven &amp; Magick of the Age.</p>
                  <p>It was ever my hopes, that his Majeſtie's <hi>Loyall County of Durham</hi> (the appellation which my gracious Maſter King Charles the 2: was wont, as I have often minded You, to afford Us) would have reſiſted longer than any Dioceſs in England, by vertue of the Good Government which was very ſeaſonably, &amp; more effectually than elſe where, therein ſet on foot at his joyfull Reſtauration.</p>
                  <p>How little prevalent, &amp; unſucceſsfull ſoever my poor &amp; weak endeavours prov'd towards your eſtablishment, I could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the Clergy of the Bishoprick of Durham, could have ſo ſoon forgotten (much leſs have fruſtrated) the precepts, &amp; Example, given them, by ſo great a <note n="*" place="margin">Bishop Coſins.</note>Confeſſor, and ſtout Champion of the old orthodox Church of England, as had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily reviv'd good order, &amp; conformity to the Churche's Rules among them.</p>
                  <p>But ſince we find, by ſad experience, that it is ſo, &amp; that even the very <hi>Leaders</hi> have apoſtatiz'd, from their Duty to God and the King, It becomes me (who dare not follow their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) to do all that I can, to prevent the People of my Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaconry, from being ſeduced thereby.</p>
                  <p>You know, I have labour'd faithfully, &amp; with zeale more than ordinary, to aſsert the King's cauſe from the yeare 1678 (through all the Combuſtions occaſion'd by an Infamous Impoſtor,) home <hi>to the</hi> Dutch Invaſion, &amp; at that very time, even on the 15 of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110636:72"/>
Nov. 1688, brought all the wholeſome advice which I had given at ſeverall Viſitations, to your view in one Addreſs, (as before mention'd,) which I have printed for your farther edification, &amp; my own juſtification. And in the next place, I knew of nothing better that I could do, than to preach to you by my example, in leaving my Station, &amp; my Revenue, (when I could not be permitted longer to discharge a good conſcience,) rather than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve my ſelfe, in the guilt of an uſurpation. Which act of mine, how grealy ſoever it may have been cenſur'd, I eſteem as the beſt ſermon I ever preach'd in my life, the reflection on which affords much comfort to my ſoule; ſince thereby I clear'd my ſelfe from the guilt of renouncing my Allegiance, as the generality have done, which will prove an eternall blot to the Nation, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Clergy of the Church of England.</p>
                  <p>Tis too late, now to give you Cautions againſt Perjury, or to ſett before your eyes, how much more heinous it is in a Prieſt, than in a Lay man, becauſe the greateſt part of you allready have swallow'd a new oath to an Uſurper. And to informe you in the obligation that lyes on you, to repent of, rather than keep the oath you have taken, is to conclude you (what I ought not to do) not only bad Chriſtians, but very weak Divines.</p>
                  <p>There is no man that underſtands any thing of Religion, but knows that a rash oath only obliges to Repentance; whereof that there might be ſome MEET AND WORTHY FRUITS brought forth among the Clergy of my Jurisdiction, would prove to me great matter of Conſolation; &amp; if it were done <hi>very ſpeedily,</hi> it would be a great extenuation of their crime, &amp; afford good ground to hope, they were overborne with the Boiſterouſneſs of a Violent Sorme, rather than did willfully plunge themſelves, in ſo horrid a guilt.</p>
                  <p>Let not the fear of looſing your poſſeſſions, (which I thank God has not prevail'd on me) tempt you to lye, one moment, under ſo inſupportable a load. The enjoyments of your Livings will be ſadly purchas'd, by the increaſe of ſo enormous an Impiety. And there will be a lamentable Precedent left to your flocks, if You, the Paſtours, have not ſufficient ſincerity to make a ſpeedy Confeſsion of your ſin, &amp; courage enough publickly to owne the ſame by <hi>giving glory to God</hi> &amp; taking shame unto yourſelves. There
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110636:73"/>
can be no more effectuall way to redeem your own honour than by reſtoring Gods. Nothing contributed ſo much to the glory of St. Auguſtin as his <hi>Confeſsions, &amp; Retractations,</hi> &amp; conſequently nothing can be more to your's, than to betake your ſelves to this Eſsential part of Repentance, I mean the <hi>Confeſsion</hi> of your Crime, whereby you have ſcandaliz'd your flocks.</p>
                  <p>You that have taken an unlawfull oath to ſave your Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, have thereby put your ſelves under a greater neceſsity of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with them, or retaining your guilt. For nothing lefs, than ſo, ſeems to be a ſufficient evidence of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> your ſincerity. God hath ſo ordered it, by his divine providence, that a ſinner alwayes miſses of his aim. Thoſe that betake themſelves to unlawfull courſes, to ſave their lives or eſtates, muſt neceſſarily forſake them, &amp; enter on ſuch as are diametrically contrary to the former, or looſe their ſoules, which are infinitely more valuable than both. Repentance ought to be eſteem'd by every ordinary Chriſtian a <hi>Returning from ſin,</hi> yea ſuch a Returning as requires the treading out the very ſtepps, which the ſinner made in order to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it. And ſurely, then, what ſoever is binding in the Diſciple, muſt be much more obligatory in the ſpirituall Guide.</p>
                  <p>But I shall not dive too far into particulars, &amp; chalk out the exact method, &amp; <hi>manner hovv</hi> you shall make reparation, for the wrong which You have done, by ſubmitting to an Uſurper, both to the King &amp; Church of England. I have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, that all of you know your duty well enough, &amp; many I am ſure, better than I can inſtruct you; ſince the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of <hi>the King, Paſsive-obedtence &amp; Non-reſiſtance</hi> were preach'd up with more zeal, by you in the Bishoprick of Durham, than they were by others in any Dioceſs in England. Where Conformity to the orders of the Church, &amp; Execution of other Laws of the Land, were ſo well practis'd (tho not as they ought to have been) that the BISHOPRICK which anciently was ſtil'd the <hi>Land of Preiſts,</hi> was generaly reputed the <hi>Seat of thorough-Conformiſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You on the place of acting, muſt ſee, more clearly than I can, at this diſtance, (tho your eyes have been in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure blinded by the ſmoak of a Rebellion) the fitteſt manner &amp; opportunities of making ſatisfaction for your <hi>egregious Apoſtacy.</hi>

I shall therefore, rather than preſcribe the means, mind you of your indiſpenſable obligation to do the thing, &amp; ſo redeem your honour, &amp; redreſs the ſcandall you have given, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of your own ſin, &amp; the unſpeakable greife of my ſoule; who did faithfully labour to make every one committed to my charge, ſuch as God hath given me grace to approve my ſelfe; even an unalterable Loyall Subject to King Iames the ſecond, as well as ſo legitimate a ſon of the Church of England, as can never be perſwaded, that it can be for her Intreſt to contradict her Doctrine; Which, as I have hitherto profeſt, &amp; held faſt amidſt all the blaſts of Temptation, (from what ever point of the Compaſs they have blowne) I am reſolv'd by the Divine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to practiſe unto the end; in ſpight of the moſt prevalent examples, or malicious cenſures, uſed now as arguments, or engins, to overthrow mee.</p>
                  <p>That ſuch a Generall neglect of <hi>Church-Order</hi> among the Clergy, through the Nation, (as I long, and loudly complain'd of, and warn'd you againſt,) should be attended on by ſo fatall an Yſſue, as an <hi>Vniverſall Defection,</hi> should not be a thing perfectly new to You, to whom I addreſs my ſelfe, ſince you, yourſelves, can be my wittneſses, that I have often faithfully foretold, that an Univerſall Semi-conformity would end in as Univerſall Semi-Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance: &amp; would God we had not found, by lamentable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that it had done much more, by producing that degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate offspring, who have not only imbrew'd their hands, in ſo horrid a crime, as the <hi>dethroning</hi> their <hi>lavvfull Soveraigne,</hi> but like Vipers have, in a manner, eaten out their very <hi>Mother's Bovvells.</hi>

                  <p>Amidſt all the mortifications &amp; exerciſes of Patience, which have been occaſion'd to me, by the late Revolution of affairs in Church &amp; State, &amp; more particularly by the Defection of the Clergy of my own Jurisdiction, nothing has created ſo much diſquiet, &amp; ſo laſting a diſturbance to my mind, as that there should happen any ſcandalous failure in either of you, my more peculiar Deputies, &amp; fellow Labourers in the Goſpell of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Tho the members of that Community whereof I am Head, together with the Clergy of my Archdeaconry, began to take different meaſures from mee, which gave mee too juſt grounds to fear that they would, (as they afterwards did,) <hi>Bovv dovvn to Baal,</hi> in shaking off their Allegiance to their Leige Lord and Soveraigne, &amp; ſubmit to an Uſurper, yet I did comfort my ſelfe with ſtrong hopes, that you, my immediate Supporters,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:110636:76"/>
would ſtick by me, &amp; endeavour to the uttermoſt of your powers to uphold me (againſt the violence of that ſtorme which threatned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) notwithſtanding our different ſentiments, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions touching ſome matters in relation to the tranſactions of the year paſt. But, after all thoſe my Expectations, that one of my <hi>Crutches</hi> (give me leave ſo to terme you ſince I did ſo eſteem you) should break, in a time of Danger &amp; Difficulty, is to me great ground of greife &amp; trouble.</p>
                  <p>That about the begining of the year 1688, I &amp; you should ſometimes differ in our opinion of things, (when there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bean unhappy Diviſion among the Clergy, not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the very Fathers of the Church of England,) afforded no great matter of wonder or admiration, But in the month of December following, when all eyes were (or ought to be) open'd, by a <hi>real unnaturall Invaſion,</hi> &amp; ſaw all the haſte imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable made violently to uſurp the Crown, by the Dethroning of a Lawfull &amp; gracious Prince, ſtrikes me with great aſtonishment; eſpecially conſidering my earneſt &amp; unwearied endeavours, by the utmoſt condeſcention &amp; reaſonings, to informe you of the ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes carried on (which I had the good luck you muſt now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to foreſee better than your ſelves) againſt the Church as well as King of England; that one of you, I ſay, (God be prais'd it is not both) with whom I had taken ſo much pains to keep ſteddy, should after ſo plain a Diſcovery of the bottome of ill men's intrieges, to involve the Nation in that deplorable miſery under which it doth at preſent groane, should, I ſay, not only totter, but at laſt fall into ſo abhorr'd a Crime as Perjury, doth pierce my very ſoule to think on't; ſince by ſuch ill example there is an irreparable injury done to my Flock, &amp; to the young Clergy of my Jurisdiction, like to be influenc'd by the Example of the Archdeacon's Curate, who till this late Epidemick Apoſtacy had been very exemplary in keeping up good order &amp; Diſcipline, according to the good old right principles of thoſe venerable <note n="*" place="margin">Bp. Gunning Bp. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins.</note>Prelates, under whom, by God's Providence, I had my education.</p>
                  <p>I cannot reflect on ſo unpardonable a <hi>Breach of Truſt,</hi> tho never ſo much varnish'd over, with the falſe paint now vented in the Kingdome, without ſore indignation; nor ceaſe to charge the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:110636:76"/>
guilt of ſo great a ſin upon you, my Repreſentative in my Parish of Sedgefield, (to whom I now ſingly ſpeak) who have committed the ſame with many high Aggravations, as the following particulars will make appeare.</p>
                  <p>Firſt you being a Perſon, that was happyly train'd up not only in a [hitherto ever] <note n="*" place="margin">Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nvval.</note>

                     <hi>Family</hi> whoſe Loyalty till the fatall month of Nov. 1688 was never ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish'd with the leaſt ſtaine.</p>
                  <p>In the next place after a loyall Education in the Univerſity, &amp; the happyneſs to eſcape, by God's bleſsing, thoſe dangerous rocks, on which youth there moſt commonly ſplit, (to witt: Corruption in principles or moralls,) were ſeaſonably tranſplanted into the Curacy of a very conſiderable Parish in Worſtershier, where the Rector kept up exactly the Order of the Church of England; the ſtrickt practice whereof (however things have fallen out) was the moſt likely means to have kept Clergy-men ſteddy, in ſuch a day of tryall &amp; temptation as our preſent miſerable generation have liv'd to ſee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly were, with much affection &amp; honeſt intention, ſingl'd out, &amp; pitcht on, by me (I having a great opinion of your Loyalty) to be my Co-adjutour, in <note n="*" place="margin">Sedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</note>one of the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Country Parishes of England, the burthen of which truſt, as well as my great concern for the ſpirituall wellfare of that my flock, you ought to have learn'd, from the extraordinary zealous applications, which I us'd at firſt coming to ſet you, &amp; all along after to keep you, right, in my honeſt <hi>Particular</hi> notions of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the orders of the Church, &amp; of ſubjection to all ſorts of lawfull Authority. Which notions I am not ashamed to ſtile now particular, ſince the iſsuë of things proclaimes them to be right, as well as the oppoſers of them notoriouſly in the wrong, &amp; muſt be ſo acknowledg'd by all perſons, who are not unhappyly beſmear'd with the preſent [religious] Rebellion of England, or blinded by the miſt, or fumes of an unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Uſurpation.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly had more reaſon than others to have reſiſted thoſe temptations, which overthrew the generality of the Clergy of the Dioceſs, ſince you had in one perſon your Rector's
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:110636:77"/>
Dean's, &amp; Archdeacon's continuall example, in your eye, to the very laſt minute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to uphold you. Nay, moreover, had a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick letter written joyntly to your ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; your) Brother (directed to the Curates of Eaſington &amp; Sedgefield from the Deanery, the very night of my Departure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which carrying with it my laſt &amp; beſt advice &amp; ſentiments, immediately before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I lanch'd forth into a kind of ſea of trouble, likely to attend that perſecuted righteous Cauſe, whereto I was reſolv'd to adhere, ought to have had as much force at Sedgefield, as it had at Eaſington, in inſpiring one, as it did the other to withſtand the Shock, which hath furiouſly overturn'd ſo many of the elder &amp; ſtronger Clergy, both in the Cathedrall &amp; Dioceſs, &amp; ſcar'd them out of their Allegiance unto their Lawfull Prince, into ſubmiſsion to a Forrain Uſurper.</p>
                  <p>The laſt words of a Dying man are uſually very powerfull with all his Relations. And ſurely the laſt exhortations of a Departing Viſitor, in ſuch a manner, &amp; for ſuch a cauſe, should have had the like effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If my late example, as well as zeal, expreſs'd in my addreſs to the Clergy in my concluſive Viſitation [in the Church of St. Mary-le-Bow Nov. the 15 1688]<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proved unſucceſsfull, &amp; ineffectuall to perſwade the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Parishes of my Jurisdiction, to eſpouſe the Cauſe of an oppreſs'd Prince &amp; imitate an honeſt Leader, &amp; faithfull Servant to the Crown, who was reſolv'd to ſacrifice all rather than deſert his Soveraigne in miſery, Yet it ought not to be ſo contemptible with either of you, my own Cutates, as to be rejected; but should have ſtopp'd you in your Carreer, had you been bent to run, with never ſo much eagerneſs, into ſlavery under a Belgick yoke; nay ought to have been eſteem'd ſo forcible to ſuch immediate Dependants, as you, to whom I now ſpeak, that it should have been hardly poſsible for either of you to reſiſt it. And that either of you should, &amp; date thus to rebuke me by your practice, &amp; abandon all hopes &amp; expectations of kindneſs from me, by betraying me (it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no milder expreſsion) I look on as a high act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, &amp; receive with all thoſe reſentmens of Diſpleaſure that are allowable in a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>I did not expect that both, or either of you, should have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:110636:77"/>
immitated me, ſo far then as to have deſerted your Stations (tho I am perſwaded that my doing ſo was the beſt &amp; wiſeſt action of my whole life) but if both of you, (rather than renounce your ſworn fidelity to King Iames, &amp; ſwear Allegiance to an ambitious Prince, his ſon in law &amp; Nephew, who had by fraud &amp; force depos'd his Uncle, nay Father) had been forced ſo to do, &amp; deſert the Nation, (as I did,) as well a my Floks committed to your Care, it would have been a thing very edifying, &amp; gratefull unto me, &amp; oblig'd mee to have taken care of you, &amp; allow'd you, a share of whatſoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had to ſupport me; not ſuffering you to want bread as long as I had it, which yee had no reaſon to ſuſpect that God's Providence, &amp; a gracious Maſter's kindneſs would deny me in the deepeſt adverſity abroad.</p>
                  <p>I am ſure that yee two, who have not only been long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in my houſe &amp; family, but often admitted into my cloſet, &amp; ſometimes into my very boſome, ought to have conceiv'd ſuch an opinion; &amp; should have taken it for granted, by great experience of me, without any farther Declaration. Tho you had not ſuch particular &amp; poſitive aſſurances thereof, as I ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably gave a certaine Divine (I much valued) to deliver him out of thoſe temptations, whereinto hee (being unhappily Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed in another Region<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) did however willfully run him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to the Injury of his Conſcience, and dishonour of himſelfe &amp; freinds.</p>

Which Paper only contains ſome floating thoughts of my brain, but relating to mattets of ſo great importance, as did, according to its title, portend very fatally to the Government &amp; Church of England. And it being the only sheet of ſome hundreds, (penn'd in ſuch manner &amp; much to the ſame purpoſe,) that I did by great accident bring away with me, I shall here, to this my letter, annex a printed Coppy thereof; which will, at leaſt, demonſtrate, to all who shall ſeriously conſider it, that I gave a better gueſs, how things would go, than any of my Cenſurers or Oppoſers, who thought them ſelves greater Politicians, but have ſo much faild in their Politicks, that they (as well as others) are by this time, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, convinced how their zeale, which run ſo Counter to mine, was very prepoſterous: viz, That the irregular &amp; unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble method they took, to be deliver'd from Popery and Arbitrary Power, hath brought the whole Kingdome, abſolutely under the one, and in greater danger, than ever it was, of the other.</p>
                  <p>And that I may do all that in me lyes to clear my ſelfe, both in the ſight of God &amp; man, from being the leaſt ways acceſsary to the horrid guilt, many, who have depended on me in my parishes, or elſe where, have contracted, by forsaking our

                  <p>If the publication of ſuch papers, as were never deſign'd for the preſs, ſeem to ſavour any thing of vanity, &amp; cauſe to beleive, that I glory in having been more regular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; conſtant, in my duty, than the generality of my Brethren, let them <hi>give a Looſer leave to ſpeake,</hi> and deſire them to remember, &amp; conſider, that the Apoſtle St. Paul himſelfe was compell'd to boaſt, in a leſs day of temptation than the fifth of November 1688, which did, in a manner, blow up the foundations of three Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs that I do glory with the B.

I do bleſs &amp; praiſe God's holy name, &amp; will do it, by his aſsiſtance, for ever &amp; ever, that he did endow me with reſolution to ſtick cloſe to all the Churches Rules &amp; Orders, (whereto I gave my aſsent &amp; conſent at my firſt entrance into the miniſterial function in the year 1661) without governing my ſelfe by example, of any Clergy, high or low, in the citty or in the country: Living
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:110636:79"/>
by the example of thoſe who contradicted their excellent Rule, being a ſort of <hi>Complaiſance</hi> which, I bleſs God's holy name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have never been guilty of, tho it has been, God know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s, too frequent among my Brethren, and prov'd fatall to the poor church of England.</p>
                  <p>To take no comfort &amp; ſatisfaction in my owne innocency, (which God has in a manner miraculouſly preſerv'd, when he has ſuffer'd ſuch a multitude of abler Divines to faile, who were furnish'd with greater qualifications to have <hi>borne vvittneſs to his truth,)</hi> I should look on as an act of <hi>meaneſs of ſpirit,</hi> ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more of <hi>ſpirituall ingratitude</hi> than <hi>true humility,</hi> who deſire rather to be really thankfull &amp; humble than appear either.</p>
                  <p>Let my cenſurers be contented with my revenue, which I have left to their mercy, (chooſing to do ſo rather than betray my conſcience,) without depriving me of that precious ointment, &amp; more valuable treaſure, a <hi>good name,</hi> which I shall, in ſpight of all my enemys, endeavour, by the aid of Gods holy ſpirit, to ſecure my title to, in approving my ſelfe, to the very end, as I have hitherto as much as in me lay, a Genuine ſon of the Church, &amp; Loyall ſubject to the Crown of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
                  <p>If the preſent Generation, who favour none with their good opinion but thoſe who concurr to the ſupport of the preſent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick in England, will not allow me the aforeſaid ſatisfaction, but load me with obloquy or contempt, (&amp; one of theſe Fates I expect from the North where ſo few have followed my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,) there remains, yet, one thing, that I am ſure they are not able to deprive me of; I mean the internall Peace and Quiet of my conſcience, which I have enjoy'd ſince I was driven from my Station (to Heavens eternall praiſe I ſpeak it) in a more plentifull meaſure than ever I did heretofore, when I was in the actuall poſseſsion of ſome of the beſt preferments, of their kind, in England. This ſupports me under my preſent preſsures, and will be continued unto me, I truſt in God, while I continue, as I pray I may, faithfull to my mother the Church, &amp; unalterably obedient to the father of my Country.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe things I require you, to aſsure the flocks I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your charge (whom I do not faile to commend unto

                     <hi>Example</hi> is often more prevalent than precept. Whether the wiſe God will render mine ſo unto my people, He alone knows, &amp; it depends on his good pleaſure.

                  <p>I recommend you both, with all my sheep, to Almighty God's mercy &amp; direction, praying with all fervency to our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father in the Churche's Littany [part of my dayly devotions as I ſuppoſe it likewiſe is of the ſmall number of Othodox Clergy men in the nation] <hi>That it may pleaſe God to ſtrengthen ſuch as do ſtand, to comfort &amp; helpe the vveak-hearted, to raiſe up them that fall, &amp; finally to beat dovvn Satan under our feet.</hi> Applying it more eſpecially to the caſe of you my Subſtitutes, who are unhappyly divided, to my unſpeakable trouble, in your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples &amp; practices, which renders this my preſent way of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, very difficult to me, ſince it is not eaſy in one joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>addreſs, at the ſame time, to praiſe &amp; diſpraiſe (according to the deſigne of this paper) you to whom I write.</p>

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:110636:84"/>
printed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; the penning of the fore-going letters hee hath publish'd, in his own name, did, by reflection, caſt on many conſiderable [Spirituall &amp; Temporall] Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of the Uſurped Authority in Churc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; State, was an Underaking too mighty for him, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver delighted to expoſe or reproach his Superiours in any manner; nor should have dared thus to have done it, at this time, had not too many of them, manefeſtly departed from and contradicted the very Doctrine of the Church of England, which they, as well as hee, had ſworne to maintaine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He long expected that ſome eminent perſon in England, better qualified, would have ſaved him the labour of ſuch an application, as he hath here in print made to the people under his authority, by publishing, ere this, ſome ſubſtantiall work that should have ſtrenuously aſſerted the Cauſe of King James the 2, &amp; that Church of England whereof he is ſupreme Governour, by unmasking the wickedneſs, injuſtice, and ingratitude, nay unnaturallneſs of Dethro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their lawfull Soveraign, and under a religious pretence uſurp his Crowne; The afore-ſaid Perſon not ſticking, to ſet his name thereto, tho it might have coſt him his life, to proclaime undeniably to the World, that what hee writ hee beleived to be ſuch truth of God, as hee did dare ſeale with his Bloud. Which desireable peice of Charity to the ſoules of the poor people, who were unhappily drawn into Perjury, by the powerfull Example of their leaders, the authour hath not yet diſcover'd to be done by any, tho he thinks ought to have been performed long ago (what ever had been the iſſue) to have given right meaſures to the People of the Land, while they were <hi>ſtaggerring,</hi> &amp; not quite fallen into the abominable ſins of Perjury, and Renouncing their Allegiance. Which Chriſtian work, if it had been acted, in due ſeaſon, would, among other good effects, have edified alſo the Dean's Flocks, and render'd unneceſſary what hee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath ſaid
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:110636:85"/>
to keep thoſe ſteddy who ſtand, &amp; to reſtore thoſe who are fallen, for want of timely under-propping. The authour's earneſt longing, and waiting with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have ſeen ſuch deſireable fruit of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive zeale, did detaine him a while from plunging himſelfe over head &amp; ears, (tho hee made many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſo to do) into that Deluge which did over-spred the land; thinking himſelfe a bad swinmer in ſuch Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled waters; &amp; moreover (like Elihu Job. 32. 4.) being very unwilling to ſpeake out thus boldly, &amp; shame the ſilence of his Elders, till hee had given them all ſufficient opportunity to ſpeak and write; Tho his boldneſs &amp; zeale (as may be obſerv'd, by the way, &amp; is before noted,) was not levell'd, directly, to any but thoſe under his own Charge &amp; Care (or nearly related to him) to whom ſuch a hearty application, and ſuch plain Reproofs, even in the very language of the letters, became ſo neceſſary, that hee could not, in good Conſcience, have wav'd them. And therefore he conceiv's that people have the leſſe reaſon to be diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed thereby.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, after the authour had made a conſiderable progreſs in printing the letters and other diſcourſes he was forced to undertake a hazardous Journey into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland Feb. 1689 (whereby hee got a ſmall ſuply of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to ſubſiſt a while abroad without defiling himſelfe with any Oath of fidelity to the Prince of Orange,) tho with much trouble and Danger, occaſion'd him by an impertinent and malitious Poſtmaſter, who diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd him in Canterbury. Which voyage made it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to lay aſide, till his returne, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of publishing the papers he had penn'd at his firſt Coming over, unleſs he would willfully, and unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably, have run his neck into a halter. Which, all know, was the Fate lately of a <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. Ashton.</note>right honeſt and loyall man.</p>
                  <p>THIRDLY, all ſorts of Readers may hereby be informed, that theſe papers are, at this time, the more hastily published without polishing, becauſe the authour, hath had this ſummer after a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110636:85"/>
long intervall, ſome returne of thoſe infirmities that he brought out of England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being ſeaſonable memento's of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of his condition, and uncertainty of his life, have cauſed him, without any more ado, or longer delay, thus plainly and honeſtly to <hi>deliver his ſoule:</hi> the comfort of which doth to him abundantly ballance the uneaſineſs of any obloquy, which may accrew from the provoked friends of the new government in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, where he deſires to appeare no more, (unleſs it pleaſe God to reſtore his Soveraign,) as all may be perſwaded eaſily to beleive, by his preſent manner of proceeding.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. All thoſe who shall blame the Dean's undertaking, may, in a word, ſatisfy themſelves, that hee had never thus expoſed himſelfe to their cenſure, if hee had beleived that a a Dignified Divine in his circumſtances (being the onely one here abroad out of the Reach of England, and whoſe Conſcience would not permit him to ſwallow any new diſpenſatory oathes, or diſtinctions) could without the juſt cenſure of all right Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>of England-men, and loyall ſubjects to King James 2., have remained ſilent. Since hee hath not now thoſe prudentiall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, that others have, to ſtop his mouth, or ſtay his pen: His own perſon being ſecure &amp; his Revenue loſt. Whereas ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Divines &amp; men in England (where hee hopes there be many that <hi>never bovved the knee to Baal,</hi> tho hee be ignorant who they are) cannot attempt what hee does, without the hazard of their lives, or ruine of their familyes. And therefore conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that a weak and bad performance, as this, of ſo good &amp; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall a deſigne (the more incumbent on him) would be better than none at all, and be gratiously accepted, through JESUS-CHRIST, by that ALMIGHTY GOD who can make the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enterpriſes in his name, ſucceſsefull to accomplish his will.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, &amp; laſtly, the Dean's innate indignation to many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, &amp; late prepoſterous unaccountable procedures in the Subjects of England: to wit, <hi>Firſt</hi> the <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> or rather <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity,</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> (who did with zeale more than enough, &amp; ſometimes too bitterly, inveigh againſt nonconformiſts) which ingendred that Brood which are the authours of our Miſery: <hi>Secondly</hi> their <hi>Forvvardneſs</hi> to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> throughout the Nation, with the <hi>Church-Diſcipline,</hi> as they pleas'd, where &amp; when, there appear'd no

neceſſity; nay with the very <hi>Rubricks</hi> of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> whereto they had all, ſince the late review, given a ſolemne <hi>Aſsent &amp; Conſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        </gap>s</hi> (whoſe duty and intreſt it was, as well as of the Eccleſiaſticks, to joyne in the ſupport of the crown of their Soveraign, the Fountaine whence all their Law did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed) in endeavouring induſtriouſly by all manner of quirks, to diminish the King's Prerogative &amp; Authority, even coining wicked diſtinctions, &amp; taking up obſolete lawes to dethrone him (when there were enough of ſuch which they would not willingly have reviv'd againſt the People or themſelves) nay flying to the Reign of an Uſurper for Acts of Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iament to juſtify and colour over their fullſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; as if a Diſpenſing power in the People was like to be found more tollerable than in the King, or that ſuch a kind of ſupremacy as the multitude contended for, (and which muſt be either in Prince, or ſubject) is leſs liable to Tyranny, and other abuſes, when it is in the ſubject, than in the Soveraign.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, and the like, perverſions of Law and Religion, did cauſe, (the authour profeſseth &amp; is deſirous to proclaime) ſo much diſguſt in his Soule, as hurried him over all the difficulties and dangers that he met with, in his way to this publication, in ſuch a degree, that the conſideration of his book's reflecting on the new Government (which was deſigned to edify the people within his own province) hath push'd him on, inſtead of deterring him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſend it forth into the light (committing it and his reputation to the mercy of a Gratious God) amidſt a crooked and perverſe Generation, which hee is willing may learne thus much by his boldneſs, (or fool-hardineſs as it will be poſſibly termed,) to wit, that God hath given him (among a multitude of infirmities,) the Grace not to be afraid or asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to <hi>do his duty</hi> or <hi>diſcharge his offices faithfully,</hi> who ever may be rebuked by the doing thereof; and that hee is ſure, hee had done neither, if hee had not, as hee hath done, deliver'd his ſoule, without mincing, in ſuch plaine and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble language, at ſuch a juncture, as to allot, every thing its right epithet &amp; appellation; giving the very names of REBELLION
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:110636:86"/>
&amp; USURPATION to what, hee was perſwaded in his conſcience, deſerv'd ſuch denominations; and that are ſo, [even REBEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LION &amp; USURPATION,] if ever there were ſuch things in the World. Yea ſuch a REBELLION &amp; USURPATION that no good Chriſtian can, hee is alſo ſatisfied in his Conſcience, joyne in the firſt, or uphold the later, and conſequently, that no body can receive the communion, without injury to his ſoule, in the uſe of thoſe prayers, which pray for the maintaining of both; ſince hee that receives the bleſſed Supper of the Lord, in the office of any Church, ſets his ſeale to all the corruptions that are crept into that Church, and doth, in a higher manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, profane Gods ſacred name, by uſing that holy ordinance to ſo impious an end (as to beg of God, by vertue of his ſaviours body and blood, the diſtruction of his lawfull Prince) than hee that barely ſwears allegiance to an Uſurper, Which, yet by the way, who ever does, (let him underſtand) doth in a manner, Abjure his lawfull Soveraign.</p>
                  <p>Which is a Caſe of Conſcience that the Authour will, in Gods name, now venture here publickly to decide (as hee hath long ſince don to ſome in private) and put his name to the deciſion, what ever comes of it, ſince no body elſe hath done ſo, for the ſake of thoſe many thousands of ſoules, under his authority, in the Jurisdictons belonging to the Archdeacon &amp; Deane of Durham; whereof none can deny but that hee hath a Call from God to take care. And conſequently to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this difficult province, ſince no body elſe do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Who, if they are not ſatisfied with his Judgement in this particular (which, as poor as they may eſteeme it, will yet hee truſts, in reference here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, be found Orthodox) ought to conſult, as it concernes them, ſome abler Caſuiſt: without being ſcared, (as heretofore in ſome other caſes,) with frightfull conſequences, adminiſtred by the Univerſality of the DEFECTION &amp; ſuch like conſiderations; to wit, <hi>Empty Churches &amp; thin Altars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if it be a wholeſom truth which is recomended, by the Authour, to their thoughts, it cannot, he is ſure, in the concluſion, produce ill effects to be repented of. And he begs pardon, if he cannot prevaile with himſelfe to judge, the laſt recited effects to be ill, as matters go, &amp; things ſtand. For hee makes no doubt, but that the Churches in England muſt become Empty, &amp; the Altars thin &amp;c. before his Soveraign is like to return to White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</p>
