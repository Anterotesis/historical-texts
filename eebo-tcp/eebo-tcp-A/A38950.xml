         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of our ſad Counties miſery, <hi>viz.</hi> our ſinfull
ſecurity, in too much reſting upon our owne
ſtrength on the one ſide, and our wofull and
ruine-threatning diviſions on the other, had
long portended, and Gods Miniſters had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
warned us of that ſad calamity, which
then we feared not, nor beleeved, but now
ſmart under. It pleaſed the juſt and wiſe
hand of heaven, at laſt, to awake our dead
ſpirits by that ſad Alarme of War, and to
cauſe that black cloud which hung over our heads to be diſſolved, and firſt
to be powred down in a bitter ſhower of blood upon that Spectacle of
ſorrow and amazement, poor ſighing, and ſolitary <hi>Bolton:</hi> That <hi>England</hi>
may ſee and be aſhamed that ſhe hath not long ſince ſpewed out ſuch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
as are bred in her own bowels; and that all may take it to heart, that
there hath been no more zeale in us for the Cauſe, Servants, Goſpel, and

On <hi>Tueſday May</hi> 28. this ſad Town being almoſt deſtitute of men,

               </gap>d for our help had come in time, there had been a good account
rendred of that Townes preſervation, and the enemies diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but that God, which intended not our deliverance, uſed not the
meanes; yet in all there was about 2000. Souldiers, and 500. Clubmen;
a company ſufficient if the ſecurity of the inhabitants had not hindred
their better fortifying of the ſame: about two of the clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone,
the enemy was diſcovered about a mile off, and they made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches
to the Town on the More, South Weſt from the Town, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
was gueſſed, and by themſelves after confeſſed to be about 12000. they
appeared at firſt like a wood or cloud, and preſently were caſt into ſeverall
bodies, divers Scouts approched to diſcover the way for their entrance
with moſt advantage.</p>
            <p>Our Commanders were very couragious, and our Souldiers very hardy,
and both reſolved to ſtand to it, and in the firſt encounter gave them about
halfe an houres ſharpe entertainment, were cloſe in diſcharge as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
confeſſed after, and repulſed them bravely to the enemies great loſſe,
and diſcouragement, and in their retreat, cut them down before them in
great abundance, and they fell like leaves from the Tree, in a Winters
morning.</p>
            <p>Then was a breathing, or rather a new preparative for a freſh encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which was gallantly performed on both ſides, wherein the worthy
Colonell <hi>Rigby,</hi> and his Commanders Captain <hi>Willougby,</hi> Captain <hi>Bootle,</hi>
and the reſt, did notable ſervice: But alas, what could naked men do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
horſe, in an unfortified place, beſides it is conceived that a Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was their convoy to bring them on through a place called the private
Aker, sfor a great reward, and then when once the horſe was got into the
Town, there could be no reſiſtance almoſt made, but every man left to ſhift
for himſelfe.</p>
            <p>At their entrance, before, behinde, to the right, and left, nothing heard,
but kill dead, kill dead was the word, in the Town killing all before them
without any reſpect, without the Town by their horſemen, purſuing the
poore amazed people, killing, ſtripping, and ſpoiling all they could meet
with, nothing regarding the dolefull cries of women or children, but ſome
they ſlaſhed as they were calling for quarter, others when they had given
quarter, many hailed out of their houſes to have their brains daſht
out in the ſtreets, thoſe that were not dead in the ſtreets already, piſtoled
ſlaſhed, brained, or troden under their horſes feet, with many inſolent blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous

oathes curſes and challenges to heaven it ſelfe (no doubt) haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the filling up of their cup, and bringing that ſwift deſtruction upon
them, which they ſhortly after taſted of, (and bleſſed, bleſſed ever be the
great and juſt God for it) with many taunts, and cruell mockings, as ſee
what your prayers are come too? where is all your dayes of humiliation?
we haue humbled you now; O that we had that old Rogue <hi>Horrocks</hi> that
preaches in his gray cloake; but I forbeare many ſad things, which might
be inſerted, the uſage of children crying for their Fathers, of women cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out for their husbands, ſome of them brought on purpoſe to be ſlaine
before their wives faces; the rending, tearing, and turning of people na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
the robbing, and ſpoiling of all the people of all things that they could
carry: All which this Authour being an eye witneſſe of, and a ſharer in
who though quarter was given him by a Souldier that found him out, in
hopes of getting his money; yet had like to have been ſeverall times killed
after for his money, which others had gotten before, and doubtleſſe had
been ſlaine if a Commander had not appointed to carry him to the Prince,
yet he that carried him, forced him to go and to borrow twenty ſhillings
more, elſe he would leave him in the ſtreets againe, and that was preſent
death.</p>

partly in obſcure places, and a great many of note by them lie buried in
the Chancell of the Church: Of their and our ſide, it is conceived there
was ſlain about 1200. or 1500. in all. Only this one thing more they may
