            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE ENGLISH READER, Of whatſoever Party or Perſwaſion.</head>
            <p>THE Degeneracy of the Chriſtian World in all its Sects and Parties, from the <hi>true Spirit of Chriſtianity</hi> and the primitive Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, is the general obſervation of all Men; and the Regret of thoſe who are truly ſober and ſerious. And as the Corruption of the beſt things is always the moſt vile and abominable, witneſs Devils and Men; ſo that of the Chriſtians is a By-word and a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal among the Jews, Turks and Heathens; and they may riſe up in Judgment at the laſt Day, and condemn us, we being ſunk farther below the common Principles of Human Nature, as well as Religion, than themſelves. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vertues of Juſtice, Temperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are baniſhed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Minds and Converſation of Chriſtians, than they are from among the Turks and Heathens; and we are ſo far removed from the Spirit, Life, and Doctrin of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that ours may be truly term'd <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He denied himſelf in all things; and we deny our ſelves in nothing: He never did his own Will, but the Will of Him that ſent him; and we ever do our own, and not the Will of God: He was perfectly dead to the Honours and Riches, and Pleaſures, and Learning of this World; and we only live to them: He had a toilſom and laborious Life, far from Eaſe, and full of Croſſes, of Contempt, Reproaches, and Contradictions from Men; and we ſtill
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:104476:3"/>
ſeek our Eaſe where we can have it, will force others to bear the Croſs rather than take it up our ſelves, and would rather be contemned by God, than even for Righteouſneſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake endure Reproaches and Contempt from Men: He was meek and lowly in Heart, and with great meekneſs ſuffer'd the Contradiction of Men; and Pride and Haughtineſs is the Spirit we are acted by, even when we moſt diſclaim it, and we cannot bear with Contradictions from any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inward Reſentment and Diſpleaſure: Whatever he did was always accompanied with Righteouſneſs, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Truth; and whatever we do has one or all of the contrary Qualities, Injuſtice, Malice or Hypocriſie: In ſhort, Charity was the living Principle of his Heart and Life, and all his Actions were continual Streamings and Effects of the Love of God and of all Men; and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love, even to a Contempt of God and Hatred of Men, when they ſhock us in any thing, is the ſecret Spring by which we are always acted. The Lives of Chriſtians are as flat a Contradiction to his Commands as to his Life and Spirit: He bids us <hi>ſeek the loweſt Place;</hi> and we are never at reſt, but climb as high as others will let us: He bids us, <hi>take the Beam out of our own Eyes,</hi> and we are ſtill ſpying the Motes in our Neighbours: He would <hi>not have us lay up for our ſelves Treaſures upon Earth;</hi> and all our Care is about earthly things: He would have us, <hi>ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and the Righteouſneſs thereof;</hi> and that is the laſt and leaſt of our Endeavours, except in Word only: He bids us, <hi>deny our ſelves and take up our Croſs daily;</hi> and in every thing we ſeek our ſelves, and rather than take up the Croſs, will ſtick at no Injuſtice to avoid it: He commands us <hi>to love one another;</hi> and for a Trifle we bite and devour one another.</p>
            <p>Now one would think ſtrange how the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity can reconcile their Practice with the Hopes of Heaven, while their Lives are ſo contrary to the Goſpel. But, as the comparing the Lives and Temper of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World at preſent, with the Life and Doctrin of Jeſus Chriſt, does plainly ſhew their Contrariety to his: So if we ſhall enquire into the ſeveral ſorts of Corruption and Degeneracy of the Age wherein he lived, recorded in the Goſpel, and which he did chiefly ſet himſelf againſt, and upon what Grounds they nevertheleſs did preſume of God's Favour, and of being his Children, and ſhall compare them with ours; we ſtill find the ſame Leaven ſpreads ſtill;
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:104476:3"/>
and tho we have other Names, yet we have ſtill the ſame Corruptions and the ſame Spirit. It is not in one Age or one party that theſe Corruptions do prevail, but more or leſs in all Ages and among all Parties; and tho' Names and Faces change, yet in every Age Men's Natures and Diſpoſitions are for the main the ſame. It was not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful therefore that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould appear in every Age to make known their Vices and Corruptions; the Reproof of the Age wherein he liv'd, is the Reproof of all, and what he ſaid to the ſeveral Sects among the Jews, he ſays to us, and we may read our Faults and Judgment in theirs.</p>
            <p>There are three ſorts of Perſons eſpecially ſpoken of in the Goſpel, <hi>the Publicans and Sinners, the Sadducees,</hi> and <hi>the Scribes and Phariſees. The firſt</hi> were groſs and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinners, known for ſuch by all, their Company avoided for that Reaſon, and they ſelf-condemn'd, as acting againſt the Light and Checks of their own Conſciences. <hi>The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> were the Wits and Sparks, and mighty Men of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that Age. They could not believe a Reſurrection, nor the being of Angels and Spirits, theſe ſeem'd not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with their Reaſon, nor with the Ideas they had of this preſent World, and therefore they deny'd them; even as if blind Men ſhould deny the being of Light and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, becauſe they cannot feel them with their Hands, nor touch them as they do other Bodies, with the End of their Staff. <hi>The third</hi> were the moſt Religious People of the Age, wherein they liv'd; they were had in great Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration by all; they were not guilty of the ſcandalous Vices of the Publicans, they abhorr'd them ſo much that <hi>they would not eat with them;</hi> they read and ſtudied the Scriptures much; they were much in Devotion, and <hi>made long Prayers,</hi> they were exact Obſervers of the Sabbath-day, would reprove a Man that came <hi>to be heal'd, or that pluck'd an Ear of Corn on it;</hi> they were very exact and ſcrupulous in little things, ſo afraid of breaking the Command of Paying Tithes of all their Increaſe, that they would not omit even their <hi>Mint, Aniſe</hi> and <hi>Cummin:</hi> But, in the mean time they deſpis'd the <hi>weighty Matters of the Law, Righteouſneſs, Mercy and the Love of God;</hi> they were <hi>Proud, and covetous, and wordly-minded; they did all to be ſeen of Men; they ſought the Praiſe of Men more than that of God; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd Widows Houſes,</hi> but had ſtill a Religious Pretence for it; they would learn People <hi>to deſpiſe their Parents;</hi> but
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:104476:4"/>
it was on the account of <hi>Corban;</hi> they would hate and perſecute others even to Death, but it was to <hi>do God Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;</hi> they were mighty zealous to propagate their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and <hi>would compaſs Sea and Land to gain Proſelytes,</hi> but then our Saviour tells us, <hi>They were twofold more the Child of the Devil than themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, it is obſervable, That our Saviour's Reproofs are levell'd moſtly againſt theſe two laſt ſort of Perſons: The former he treats with ſuch Pity and Compaſſion, that his Enemies tax him for a <hi>Friend of Publicans and Sinners.</hi> He tells them, <hi>There is joy in Heaven over one Sinner that repents, more than ninety and nine juſt Perſons, that need no Repentance:</hi> And that <hi>he came not to call the Righteous but Sinners to Repentance.</hi> But for the other two, he warns his Diſciples to <hi>beware of the Leaven of the Phariſees and of the Sadducees.</hi> He calls them a <hi>Generation of Vipers, whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sepulchres, fair and beautiful without, but within full of Corruption and Rottenneſs;</hi> he terms them <hi>the Children of the Devil,</hi> and asks, <hi>How they can eſcape the Damnation of Hell?</hi> To judge according to Appearance one would think they deſerv'd a milder Treatment, and that the other ought to have been moſt Laſht; and this is the Courſe and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the World: But that which ſeems Righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men is an Abomination in the Sight of God.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour's Conduct in this, we may be ſure, was the effect of Divine Equity and Wiſdom. The <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners</hi> were not only look'd on as ſuch by all others, but alſo were ſelf-condemn'd; they knew they were doing what they ought not to have done, their Conſcience could not but often ſmite them, and the Divine Grace exciting them, and outward Afflictions chaſtiſing them might one time or other bring them to Repentance; and the Senſe of the greatneſs of their Sins might awaken in them an anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Senſe of the Divine Goodneſs; ſo that where Sin had abounded Grace ſhould ſo much the more abound, and they who ſaw there was ſo much forgiven them, would love much. But the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadducces</hi> were not ſo cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of Conviction; their Sores were skin'd over with a fair Shew of Reaſon and Religion; their Sins were moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spiritual; they had no Remorſe for them; the World and they themſelves did approve them in what they did; they thought they were doing God Service; and they had form'd to themſelves ſuch a Righteouſneſs of their own as made it next to impoſſible to bring them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:104476:4"/>
or to ſeek after the Righteouſneſs of God by Faith.</p>
            <p>There was no ſuch Hazard that ſincere and well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons ſhould be ſeduc'd by open and ſcandalous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Their groſs Sins and the ill Character they went under, were as Beacons to warn others to beware of them. But it was not ſo eaſie to avoid the <hi>Leaven</hi> of one of the other <hi>two;</hi> they compaſs'd Sea and Land to gain Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes; and the ſpecious Reaſons of the one, and the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Piety, Zeal and Devotion of the other, with ſuch a plauſible Repreſentation of Religion, as might encourage them to hope for Heaven, tho' they lov'd the World and follow'd their own Wills here, were Snares which it was not eaſie to eſcape.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners</hi> were more capable of receiving the Truth, they were convinced of all; and even when they were not reſolv'd to follow it, yet the inward Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Conſciences would keep them from malign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or perſecuting the Publiſhers of it: But the other two reſiſted it with all their Force, ſtuck at nothing that might ſuppreſs it, did calumniate and defame it; perſecuted its Author and Followers to the Death, and thought that in all they did God Service.</p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt then foreſeeing the Effects of the Effects of the Malice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Subtilty of the Devil, how forward he would be to ſlip into his Church, to profeſs himſelf his Diſciple, and pervert his Deſign and Doctrin, under Colour of own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and promoting it; and knowing well the Corruption of Men's Hearts, how naturally the Love of themſelves and of the World would make them take up with Shadows of Religion, inſtead of the Life and Subſtance of it; he takes Care not only to ſhew them plainly by his Life and Doctrin, wherein it truly conſiſts; <hi>viz.</hi> in true CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITY as its End, and in a conſtant denial of our ſelves, as to our own Wills, and as to the Honours, Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Pleaſures of this World, as the effectual and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Means of attaining to this End: But he alſo lets them ſee the falſe Religion that Self-love takes up with, and the main Branches into which it divides itſelf, in the different Pictures of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees,</hi> the one making an Idol of their corrupt Reaſon, and worſhipping it for their God; and the other <hi>teaching for Doctrins the Commandments of Men,</hi> making the <hi>Commandments of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Traditions of their Elders,</hi> being more zealous for theſe than the plain and ſimple Word of God; and both of them eſtabliſhing a Righteouſneſs of their own, a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs founded on Self-love, Self-will, and the Love of Temporal Things, and making void the Righteouſneſs of God, being void of Charity, and the Love of things Eternal.</p>
            <p>And that the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt had need of ſuch Warnings, the fatal Experience of all following Ages has but too evidently teſtified; and, as it ſeems in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Days, in the laſt Age of the Jewiſh State, theſe Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions among them were come to their heighth; ſo in this laſt Age of the degenerate Chriſtian State, this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Leaven ſeems to have ſpread through all Parties, and leaven'd the whole Lump.</p>
            <p>The World is now full of thoſe who ſet up for great Maſters of Reaſon, and meaſure every divine Truth by Mathematical Principles and Demonſtrations, and what will not bear that Teſt is ridicul'd by them, and tho' a Truth be never ſo plainly reveal'd in the Holy Scriptures, yet if it do not ſuit their way of Reaſoning, and if they think it lies fair to be pelted by their Witticiſms, they are ſure to treat it in Deriſion, and to ſtart Queſtions about it, as their Predeceſſors did to our Saviour about the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, of the Woman who had been married to ſeven Husbands, that were Brethren, <hi>viz. Whoſe Wife ſhe ſhould be of the ſeven at the Reſurrection?</hi> And tho' they meet daily with as inexplicable Difficulties in the viſible World, in Bodies, the being of which they cannot deny; and if they had liv'd all their Days in an Iſland among People where the manner of the Propagation of Men and Beaſts was never heard of, when they had been told of it, would have thought it as ridiculous and impoſſible a thing as any Truth deliver'd in the Holy Scriptures; and tho' they have liv'd to ſee the Principles of the greateſt Philoſophers, who thought they eſtabliſh'd all things by unerring Rules of Aequations, hiſs'd out of Doors; yet this will not keep them from making Idols of their own Ideas, and worſhipping their own Reaſon, and Chriſt and his Sacred Doctrin muſt be deſpis'd if he will not fall down before it and worſhip it: And how ſtrangely this Spirit ſpreads now in the World, he that runs may read.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:104476:5"/>There is no Deluſion more dangerous, and which leads to more irrecoverable Blindneſs than this of making our wretched Reaſon and the Ideas it forms to it ſelf the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Standard of Truth. The Eyes of our Mind are like thoſe of our Body, we may turn them to any Side we pleaſe, but can diſcern nothing aright, unleſs the Light ſhine upon them, and let them ſee the Objects round about them. So our Minds may form to themſelves many Ideas and Imaginations, but none of them conformable to the nature of things, without a ſuitable Light to diſcover and direct them. In the Material and viſible World, from the general Notions of Matter and Motion, and the Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of variouſly mov'd, and figur'd Bodies, Men form to themſelves ſuch and ſuch Syſtems of the Univerſe; which they ſtrongly fancy to be the true Model of it; but when we come to conſider more nearly the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we find them as far different as Light is from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Our Minds muſt receive due and ſuitable Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Objects themſelves, elſe they can have no right Sentiment of them. A blind Man can never conceive aright what Light and Colours, the Sun and this viſible World are, unleſs his Eyes be open'd and he receive the Light. The Light ſurrounds him, and he comprehends it not; we may by many Words and Similitudes give him ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and dark Notions of the Excellency of Light and Colours, and the Beauty of this viſible World; but one Glance of the Light it ſelf will diſcover more to him than a thouſand Deſcriptions made by us. It is the ſame of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Spiritual Things. The Natural Man perceives not the Things of God, but they are fooliſhneſs to him. No Man knows the Things of God, but by the Spirit of God. A Divine Light and Illumination is neceſſary to make us underſtand and reliſh Divine Things. And if we think to comprehend and judge of them by our Reaſon and Natural Ideas, we do as fooliſhly and unreaſonably as a blind Man that would judge of Light and Colours, by the Ideas he has gathered from his Touch and other Senſes. And as the ſeeing and enjoying the Light, and the receiving the other Impreſſions of this viſible World are quite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing than the Ideas we retain and form of theſe things to our ſelves in the Light's abſence; for theſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Ideas can never enliven, and warm, and chear our Bodies, and make us enjoy all this viſible World, as the other does, no more than the Picture of the Sun can give
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:104476:6"/>
us Light and Heat, as the Sun himſelf does (for theſe are but the Pictures of the Things themſelves): So the true Light and Impreſſion of Divine Things upon the Mind is as far beyond the notional Ideas that we may form of them (even tho' they were the true Pictures of them;) and as a blind Man ought to ſubmit to the Judgment and Conduct of thoſe who enjoy the Light, and of whoſe Sincerity he has no reaſon to doubt, and in the mean Time to ſtrive, if poſſible, to enjoy himſelf; ſo ought we to ſubmit our Underſtanding and our Will to the Divine Revelation of the Will of God made to others, and by them declar'd to us, and in the mean time ſo to yield up our ſelves to God as that the Eyes of our Underſtanding being enlightned we may come to comprehend what the good and acceptable, and perfect Will of God is.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Leaven of the Phariſees</hi> has yet more univerſally overſpread Chriſtendom than that of the <hi>Sadducees.</hi> Upon this is founded the Difference of the ſeveral Sects and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are in the Chriſtian World, and the Hatred and Animoſity wherewith they proſecute one another, one crying, Lo here is Chriſt; another, Lo he is there. The ſame <hi>Leaven</hi> runs through all Parties, tho' it put on different out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Forms, according to the different Intereſts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of the reſpective Parties. Some are very zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for particular Doctrins and Opinions which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain as to their Truth, and of no Neceſſity for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Some ſet up for particular Forms and Rites of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which may be either us'd or let alone, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of Salvation: And others are as zealouſly bent againſt them. Some for ſuch and ſuch Forms of Diſcipline and Government, and others for overturning them. And tho' moſt of the Things, for or againſt which they bend all their Zeal, be of little Moment either for Promoting or Hindrance of Salvation; yet they ſeem to lay the whole Streſs of Religion upon them; and having drawn them up into poſitive or negative Confeſſions of Faith, Creeds, Articles, Canons of Councils, and Acts of General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, they baptize them into the Sacred Names of <hi>The Truths of God, the Cauſe of Jeſus Chriſt, the Interest of his Church, the ſetting the Crown upon Chriſt's Head;</hi> they teach for Doctrins the Commandments of Men, and are more zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for their Forms and Syſtems of Doctrins, drawn up by themſelves or their Predeceſſors, than for the Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Plainneſs of the Holy Scriptures; and tho a Man
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:104476:6"/>
embrace from his Herrt the Divine Writings, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſquare his Life by the Rules ſet down in them, yet if he do not receive their Syſtems, and be not zealous for or againſt ſuch outward Forms and Rites as they embrace or diſlike, he is to them as a Heathen and a Publican. And while they have a Zeal for the outſide of Religion, they neglect Righteouſneſs, Mercy and the Love of God; while they avoid the Scandalous and Carnal Vices that would make them hateful in the World, their Hearts are full of the Spiritual ones, which are as hateful to God. In ſhort, the Apoſtle gives us a plain Character of them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. warning us, <hi>That in the laſt days perilous Times ſhall come; for Men ſhall be Lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, proud, boaſters, blaſphemers, diſobedient to Parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural Affection, Truce-Breakers, falſe Accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, trayterous, heady, high-minded, lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Pleaſures more than lovers of God, having a Form of Godlineſs, but denying the Power thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſtrange to ſee how wilfully Men miſtake the Nature of Chriſtianity, and place it in that which it does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſt, and what it truly is they deſpiſe and trample upon. Chriſtianity may be either conſider'd in its End, or in the Means it directs us to, for the attainment of that End. Its End is CHARITY, to love God with all our Heart and our Neighbour as our ſelves. To love God is to love his Nature, his Righteouſneſs, his Goodneſs, his Truth, and to be transform'd into the ſame Image; to love him with all our Hearts is to love him only for himſelf, and all other things only in and for God, and entirely to depend upon him. To love our Neighbours as our ſelves is to love them as his Images, as being capable to be transform'd into his Nature, and to endeavour to bring them, with our ſelves, to the Love and Enjoyment of God. This is the Eſſence of Religion, and the indiſpenſible Duty that God requires of Man in all Eſtates, whether that of Innocence, or of his Reparation ſince his Fall; and as our Saviour tells us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 40. <hi>On theſe two Commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Had man continued in the Integrity in which he was created, no other Duty had been requir'd of him. But he turning away his Love from God, and ſetting it on himſelf, and on the Creatures, making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his laſt End, and the Creatures his chief Happineſs, Means are propos'd to Man to bring him back to the Love
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:104476:7"/>
of God, and to remove the Hindrances of it; and he having forfeited the Friendſhip and Love of God, Hopes are given him of Recovering his Love and Favour; for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of which the Interceſſion of a Mediator was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, who by his Merits and Favour with God might obtain it; and the main Hindrances of the Love of God being Self-love, and the Love of the Creatures, he is directed to the Uſe of ſuch Means as may effectually mortifie and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due theſe in him; and Man being a wayward Patient, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to take the Phyſick provided for him, as being bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and unpleaſant, the Phyſician takes Man's Nature on him, and takes the Remedies firſt himſelf, flies the Eaſe, the Honours, the Riches, the Pleaſures, and the Sciences of this World, embraces Poverty, Reproaches, Troubles and Pains, and denies himſelf and his own Will in every thing, that he might do the Will of him that ſent him. So the eſſentially neceſſary and effectual means to recover the Love of God, is Faith in God through Jeſus Chriſt, with unfeign'd Repentance, a conſtant denial of our ſelves, and forſaking of every thing that hinders us to love God; and for this End the taking up our Croſs daily, and following of Chriſt. The Holy Scriptures are the Sacred Records wherein God's Love to Mankind, the Life and Doctrin of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Precepts he has given for the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of our corrupt Nature, and returning to the Love of God, are plainly manifeſted to us; and, in this reſpect they are neceſſary to make us wiſe unto Salvation, as the written Counſels of a Phyſician, would be for the Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his Patient's Health. Sermons, religious Offices, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, ſacred Aſſemblies, Paſtors, Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are more remote means for bringing Men to Salvation, and, if rightly us'd may be very helpful to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in the Practice of the neceſſary and effectual means for returning to an entire Dependance upon God: But if the firſt be wholly neglected, and theſe be reſted on, and if we think we are religious becauſe zealous about theſe things, and in the mean time are ſtill Lovers of our own ſelves, ſelf-will'd, ſelf-conceited, worldly-minded, envious, malicious, our Actions void of Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> our Religion is the Leaven of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> it is but a Form of Godlineſs, we are alienated from the Life of God, it is a Righteouſneſs of our own, and we are as mad and fooliſh as ſick Men would be, who ſhould run about among Apothecaries and Surgeons, and
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:104476:7"/>
be very greedy to hear the Receipts of Cures for their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, dayly read and explain'd to them, ſhould fight and quarrel, and hate, and deſtroy one another, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending which were the beſt Explanations of the Receipts, and which Company of Apothecaries and Surgeons, had the beſt Form of Government; and, in the mean time, both Directors and Patients were ſick unto Death, yet neither would apply themſelves to take thoſe Remedies which by all were granted to be neceſſary and effectual for their Recovery, and without which they muſt inevitably periſh.</p>
            <p>Now the Writings of the Author of this following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, containing ſuch bright Illuſtrations of the Truths of God, reveal'd in the Holy Scriptures, and diſcovering ſo plainly in what manner they are perverted by the falſe Gloſſes of the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity in their reſpective Parties, I hope it will be no ill ſervice done to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and to this Iſland in particular, to make them more generally known to this part of the World; of which Deſign this is an Eſſay.</p>
            <p>The Author was a Virgin call'd <hi>Antonia Bourignon,</hi> born in the Town of <hi>Liſle,</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> in the Year 1616. the Daughter of a rich Man there, and Baptiz'd and Bred up by her Parents in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Being taught to read in her Childhood, and having read the Goſpels, and being told of the Life of Jeſus Chriſt, how poor, and mean, and deſpis'd, and ſelf-denied he was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſeeing all People live very unlike to him, in Eaſe and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and Pleaſures, and Honours, ſhe ask'd her Parents, <hi>Where are the Chriſtians? Let us go to the Country where the Chriſtians live?</hi> And tho' her Parents derided her for this, yet this Impreſſion ever remain'd with her; and it was her conſtant Theme to let the World ſee what a true Chriſtian is, and that none ſuch are to be found.</p>
            <p>From her very Childhood ſhe had inward Converſation with God, and gave her ſelf to Prayer and Divine Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but this Retirement being look'd on, by the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of her elder Siſter, to her Companions, as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Stupidity and Sottiſhneſs, and ſhe deſpis'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to avoid this, ſhe applied her ſelf to take part in their Recreations and Divertiſements, and ſhe quickly
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:104476:8"/>
gain'd their Eſteem and Favour above her Siſter, but loſt her Converſation with God.</p>
            <p>Yet he did not ceaſe now and then to awaken her, even in the midſt of her Divertiſements; but Company and theſe Amuſements ſtill got the Aſcendent. Then God tried her with more ſevere means, filling her Mind with fearful Ideas of Death, Judgment and Hell, whereby ſhe came to her ſelf again, and ſaw the Vanity of all earthly things, which would end at Death, and leave the Soul empty of true Good, and full of real Evils. This made her abhor her preſent Life, all worldly Advantages, the Body, and the Caring for it. And becauſe the Sollicitations of earthly things were apt to return again, ſhe took Care to have this deeply engraven upon her Spirit; ſhe went oft to Charnel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, to view the Bones of the Dead, ſaying, <hi>See what thou art within a little while? thou ſhalt be like this, and yet more horrible.</hi> She handled them to overcome her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Horror for them, and to make the Thoughts of Death familiar to her. For ſix Months ſhe begg'd no other thing of God but the Remembrance of Death, and obtain'd it. It was about the fifteenth or ſixteenth Year of her Age that theſe Combats began with her, and towards the eighteenth that ſhe came to a full Reſolution of yielding up her Will wholly to God, and of abandoning the World.</p>
            <p>For ſeven Years after the Tears and Sorrows of her Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence did continue, which ſhe accompanied with great Auſterity and Mortification, wearing a Shirt of Horſe-hair next her Body Night and Day, ſleeping only on a Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and that no longer than three Hours each Night, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the reſt on her Knees in Prayers, giving the Sheets of her Bed and her other Linnen to the Poor, and ſtill bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them back to be waſh'd with thoſe of the Family, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Knowledge of the Servants. She eat no more than what might preſerve her Life, and would mingle Earth and Aſhes with what ſhe did eat, to avoid the Pleaſure that might tempt her. Her Penitence and Mortifications were not the effects of a Melancholy Humor, nor did they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, ſhe being of a moſt chearful Diſpoſition, even till Death. But ſhe puniſh'd herſelf, with an inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, out of a Principle of Juſtice, being convinc'd there was nothing more juſt, than to regrate the Sin of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceas'd to love ſo lovely a God. God has no need of our Mortifications, but our Fleſh and Corruption have
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:104476:8"/>
great need of them. <hi>Timothy</hi> was ſo ſenſible of this, that he ſtood in need of a Caution from the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to look alſo to his Health. No doubt there may ſometimes be Exceſs in theſe Mortifications, of which <hi>M. Bourignon</hi> was ſo ſenſible, that ſhe could never adviſe any Body in this to follow her Example, but to reſign themſelves to God, and to take up chearfully the daily Croſſes and Mortifications which his Providence ſhall appoint for them. This ſo few are unwilling to do, that undoubtedly God loves more the readineſs of thoſe who mortifie themſelves too much, than the Sloth of thoſe who do it too little, or not at all. She would have continued this Auſterity ſtill, if at the Age of twenty five Years God had not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to leave off all this, and to lead an ordinary Life.</p>
            <p>When ſhe remembred how ſhe had loſt God, whom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhe enjoy'd; ſhe would paſs whole Nights in cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>My God! my God! where art thou? my God! what ſhall I do? what muſt I do to find thee again? what would'ſt thou have me to do to be well-pleaſing in thy Sight? what ſhall I do to fulfil thy Will?</hi> After much Time, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prayers, Watchings and Tears, God was pleas'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to manifeſt himſelf to her anew. And the firſt Anſwer ſhe receiv'd to the Petition ſhe had ſo often made, was this Divine Doctrin, which contains the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Goſpel: <hi>Forſake all Earthly Things: Free thy ſelf from the Love of the Creatures: Deny thy ſelf.</hi> This was about the twentieth Year of her Age. Theſe were the Words which ſtuck ever with her, and upon theſe ſhe laid the Foundations of a Chriſtian Life.</p>
            <p>She forſook all earthly things for the Love of God, and to give her ſelf wholly to him, and yielded up her ſelf entirely to his Conduct, doing nothing without his Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. She thought to have met with true Chriſtians in the Monaſteries, and was reſolv'd to have ſhut up her ſelf into one of them: But there ſhe found them as full of the Love of the World, and of Self-love, as elſwhere. God made known to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Society of Chriſtians, which ſhe had been ſeeking for in vain, was to be re-eſtabliſh'd in the World by her means. This ſeem'd impoſſible to her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of her Sex, her Weakneſs, her Ignorance, her Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and having never read nor been taught by any what the Goſpel-Life was. And having laid this before God, ſhe had this Anſwer. <hi>Behold theſe Trees in the Church-yard; they ſeem dry Wood, without Leaves or Fruit, or any Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi>
               <pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:104476:9"/>
               <hi>nevertheleſs, when the Seaſon comes, they ſhall bring forth Leaves, Flowers and in abundance, without any Body's touching them: So ſhall it be of my Work.</hi> The manner how ſhe was train'd up by God for this is remarkable. That ſhe might acquire Divine Light, ſhe was not ſent to Study, nor Reading, nor Speculations, nor to fill her Head with the Knowledge of Spiritual Things: But ſhe reſign'd her ſelf in Simplicity to God, avoiding Sin, needleſs Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and the Activity of her own Reaſon; without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to know more than what was needful for her to know in the moment in which ſhe was, referring all the reſt to God, who gave her Knowledge and Light according to the Occaſions wherein ſhe needed them, whether for her own Conduct, or that of others, for the Diſcovery of Truth, or the Refutation of Error.</p>
            <p>When ſhe had learn'd from God his Deſigns in general, ſhe did not immediately, with haſte and precipitation ſet about the Execution of them, as many raſh Perſons would have done with much Zeal: She had ſtill this Rule, That it was not enough that God inſpir'd good Deſigns, but we muſt alſo wait upon him till he open the Way, and direct all our Steps in the Execution of them; that the Spirit of God acts leiſurely, yea ſlowly, but ſteadily, and what he produces in ſo leiſurely and imperceptible a manner, has afterwards a laſting and ſolid Subſiſtence: Whereas the Spirit of the Devil moves all at firſt, makes a great Noiſe and a great deal ado, but in proceſs of time all ſlackens and vaniſhes into Smoak and Nothing. She mov'd always by this Rule.</p>
            <p>She made ſeveral Attempts to bring others to lead a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian Life; Some Nuns were enclin'd to follow her Directions; ſome Biſhops and Prieſts were convinc'd of the total Degeneracy of Chriſtendom, and that the Spring of all the Corruption was in the Clergy; but Human Reſpects and Worldly Conſiderations kept them from proſecuting what their Inward Convictions prompted them to. She was prevail'd with to take the Charge of an Hoſpital of young Maids, and to educate them in the Fear of God, and the Spirit of the Goſpel: But after nine Years Labour, tho' to outward Appearance they ſeem'd moſt modeſt and vertuous, yet, to her great Grief, ſhe found them in Heart to be led captive by the Devil, at his Will. She was afterwards mov'd by God to ſet down in Writing the Divine Truths communicated to
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:104476:9"/>
her; and having ask'd of God, If ſhe ſhould keep theſe Writings ſecret or publiſh them? He ſaid to her, <hi>Yes, puhliſh them; for by them the Goſpel ſhall be preach'd thro' all the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The writing of this Treatiſe, <hi>The Light of the World,</hi> was occaſion'd by <hi>M. Chriſtian de Cort,</hi> Superior of the Fathers of the Oratory at <hi>Mechlin</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> a Man full of Zeal for God and Charity for his Neighbour, and void of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeking. He no ſooner diſcover'd that God had hid in her the Treaſures of his Divine Wiſdom, than he took all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to be inſtructed by her in the Truth; and when alone, ſet down in Writing the Sum of what had paſt in their Converſation, but this briefly and without Order. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with his Reſolution to publiſh this to the World, thinking himſelf oblig'd in Conſcience to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others, as by theſe Divine Truths he was undeceiv'd himſelf. But when ſhe had ſeen his Papers, and read a little of them, ſhe told him, they would be uſeful for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but not for others, becauſe they often anſwer'd the Thoughts of his own Mind, which no Body perceiv'd but himſelf; and being ſollicited by him to compoſe this Work anew, returning him his Papers, ſhe her ſelf wrote by way of Conference, the things which God brought into her Memory, in the ſame manner as they are now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in the three parts of <hi>The Light of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She went to <hi>Holland</hi> at the Sollicitation of <hi>M. de Cort,</hi> in order to the Printing of this Book. To this ſhe had ſome Repugnance at firſt, having never been formerly in any Place without the Dependance of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and being made believe that all the Hereticks, as they call'd them, were monſtrous and Infectious. But having recommended this Affair to God, ſhe was told, <hi>That theſe common Differences of Religion do not bring Salvation, but the Love of God only and Vertue, which we ought to love in all Perſons who aſpire to it, without regarding the outward Religion they profeſs; that ſhe ought to do good to all, and communicate to all the Light of the Divine Truth, of what Religion ſoever they be.</hi> This wrought in her Soul ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect an Impartiality, that ſhe never afterwards enquir'd of what Religion one was, provided only he lov'd to put in practice the Doctrin of Jeſus Chriſt, and to recover the Love of God.</p>
            <p>This impartiality of Spirit, and her equal Concern for the good of all, and the Freedom ſhe took to manifeſt the
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:104476:10"/>
Corruption of all Parties, and how far they were from the Spirit of true Chriſtianity, made her to be hated and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on all ſides. The Jeſuits, the Janſeniſts, the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran and Calviniſt Miniſters, the Anabaptiſts, the Quakers, the Labadiſts, did reſpectively proſecute her, either with their Tongue or Pen, or by exciting the Civil Power, where ſhe ſtaid, or animating the Fury of the Rabble againſt her. They made her paſs for a Viſionariſt, a Perſon of a wicked Life, ſuſpected of Sorcery, a Blaſphemer, the worſt of Hereticks, one who did propagate the moſt damnable Opinions; but Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children. The Innocence and Purity of her Life, and the perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of it to the Chriſtian Doctrin of her Writings was made appear by Evidences beyond all Exception. The publick Confeſſion which ſhe made of her Faith, and the Agreement of her Writings therewith ſhew the Falſhood of their Calumnies as to her Doctrin; and the Writings pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd againſt her gave her occaſion the more to clear and manifeſt the Truth; ſo that what they were apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt in ſome of her Writings ſhe more fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd in others; as appears, for Inſtance, in her Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement againſt the Quakers, where ſhe ſpeaks more expresſly of the Reſpect due to Paſtors, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
            <p>She deplor'd greatly the unhappy Schiſms which have divided Chriſtendom into ſo many Factions, diſapprov'd all that ſavours of the Spirit of a Party, of Diſputes and Partialities; proteſted a thouſand times againſt the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a new one, but aim'd to perſwade all to obſerve the Doctrin of Jeſus Chriſt, without changing from one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to another; ſo that ſhe even diſſwaded ſome Proteſtants of her Acquaintance from turning over to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they had been ſollicited by others, but to obey the Doctrin of Jeſus Chriſt in the Communion wherein they were, ſuch Changes being but the effect of Vanity. She ſaid, the Difference of Sects and Parties among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans was founded upon their Neglect of the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, and their Zeal for ſome of the Acceſſories and Externals of it; and comparing the firſt to a Sword, and the other to its Sheath, the great Debate among the reſpective Parties was, which had the beſt Sheath, and in the mean time the Devil robb'd us of the Sword.</p>

               <item>1. <hi>Do all in good order, and in ſeaſon; for I am a God of order: And Diſorder comes from the Devil, and from Sin.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Never be eager in Temporal Affairs; but apply your mind to do well what you do, in quietneſs; for the wandring of the mind, and diſquiet ſpoils all.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>Take care of making a good uſe of every thing, that nothing be ſpoil'd or loſt; for what is loſt by your negligence, will be required of you; and what you have no need of, may be uſeful for another.</hi>
               </item>

               </item>
               <item>6. <hi>Apply your mind to look well to every thing, that nothing periſh thro' your negligence; and what you obſerve to be amiſs, help it as ſoon as you can, by repairing as much as is poſſible for you all the faults that you have committed.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>They who were with her to whom ſhe had recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Rules, being unwilling to be ſo exact in the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt matters which while they were converſant in the World ſeem'd to them of no moment, and ſhe having ask'd Counſel of God thereupon: ſhe had this Anſwer: <hi>All that Men have to do in this World are but trifles and of little moment, and if they will not obey me in ſo ſmall and eaſie matters, how will they do in great and difficult ones? Not that I have need of them for my ſelf; nothing can profit or hurt me: But you have great need to obſerve exactly all theſe things that I teach you: For being made up of a Soul and Body, both which have need of entertainment, if you do not carefully or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Temporal things, your Body will fall into a thouſand ſorts of Miſeries, Anxieties, Maladies, Diſquiets, Confuſion, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Want: which at laſt will become unſupportable to you: And all this, becauſe of your little foreſight, your diſorder</hi>

               <hi>or negligence. Therefore I inſtruct you how you ought to carry on all things, even to the leaſt of your Actions, that you may be happy even in this miſerable Life. Not that I have need that you be Rich or Poor, in Health or Sickneſs, in good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or in Confuſion, neat or unclean outwardly: all this does not touch me nor offend me, ſo long as your Souls abide in my Love, and in the keeping of my Commandments.

            </p>
            <p>But the full ſtory of her Life is to be had in the Account of it written by her ſelf, and the continuation of it by the <hi>R. P. P.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know People will be poſſeſt with many prejudices, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Writings of this Perſon. The plain repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſhe gives of the Goſpel Life and Spirit, and the contrariety of the lives of Chriſtians thereunto, of the univerſal Corruption of all parties, and their taking up with the ſhadow inſtead of the ſubſtance of Religion, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke many to diſparage and diſcredit them by all means; and the Craftſmen that live by thoſe Silver Shrines, will ſtir up the multitude againſt them; and from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of her Perſon, and the ſingularity of ſome of her Sentiments they will take occaſion to fill Peoples minds with prejudices, ſo as not once to allow her a fair hearing. I ſhall not offer to remove the particular exceptions which may be made againſt them. I ſhall only take the freedom to ſay ſomething as to three or four general Prejudcies, which are moſt obvious.</p>
            <p>They are ready to except againſt her for pretending to Divine inſpiration, and that the Doctrin ſhe declareth is immediately and inwardly communicated to her by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. That God may immediately inſpire Souls with his Divine Light and Truth, cannot be denied: That he has tied himſelf never to do it after the Apoſtle's days, and the Conſignation of the Goſpel in writiting cannot be made evident: That there are many falſe pretenders to Divine inſpiration, and who thus highly take the name of God in vain, is but too evident, eſpecially in the Age wherein we live: That we ought not to believe every Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God or not. The Spirit of God has already warn'd us, that the ſureſt Teſt wherby to try them is the conformity of the Doctrin with the Word of God and the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt (which is ſufficiently confirmed already) and its tendency is to take
<pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:104476:11"/>
us off from all Earthly things and from our ſelves, and to bring us to God, and the entire correſpondence of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Life and Spirit therewith in all things, will I think be readily granted by many. Now <hi>M. A. B.</hi> deſires to be put to this fair Tryal, if her Doctrin be not the ſame with the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and if the conſtant tract of her Life and Spirit be not anſwerable thereunto, and the Fruits and Gifts of the Spirit (which he ever brings along with him wherever he reſides) were not to be ſeen in her. It is juſt then to give her a fair hearing: And if you peruſe her Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings impartially, it is like you will meet with many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Characters that are not ordinarily to be found in many Writings. A clear and diſtinct account of the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Truths of Chriſtianity, with a conſtant urging of them as the one thing neceſſary, and diſtinguiſhing them from the acceſſory Truths which are not neceſſary to Salvation: An unimitable ſimplicity of expreſſion, which a Child may underſtand with as ſingular a ſublimity of thoughts; a convincing power and force going along with them; a plain unfolding in a few Lines the difficulties about which the Learned write many Volumes; a conſtant harmony and uniformity of ſentiments in the Writings of a courſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years (from about the 23d to the 65th year of her Age in which ſhe died;) with an evidence and clearneſs to the conviction of our natural Reaſon; and all this by one who never read any Books, never converſed with the Learned to be inſtructed by them, never premeditated what ſhe wrote, never blotted out nor mended what was once written; but being attentive unto the love of God in the calm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward recollection of her Spirit, wrote as faſt as her hand could guide the Pen; and when ſome writings were laid by unfiniſhed for ſome years, return'd to them and finiſh'd them after the ſame manner, without reading any more of what had been written than ſome few of the immediately foregoing Lines to make a due Connexion: And innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable inſtances more. But above all the exact and conſtant purity of her Life, being a perfect pattern and living ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar of the Spirit and Doctrin of the Goſpel are things that deſerve conſideration. If there were a Race and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of People born blind, who had never ſeen the light, but knew their Houſes, their Furniture, their Fields, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only by the touch. If ſome ſtrangers ſhould come in among them pretending to ſee the Light, they would not readily take it on their word, having no Idea of any ſuch thing:
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:104476:12"/>
But if thoſe ſtrangers at their very firſt entry, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their Houſes, (where they had never formerly been) their Diſhes, their Seats, their Bulk, Places and Shape, and going out ſhould tell them on a ſudden the Neighbouring Hills, Vallies, Rivers and Villages, their ſituation and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which the Inhabitants themſelves could not learn but by long uſe, and by going from place to place, and feeling them with their hands or ſtaff; they would certainly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that theſe were endued with ſome more ready and perfect faculty and mean of knowing all theſe things than ever they experienc'd. So for thoſe who pretend to Divine Inſpiration and to be led by the Spirit of God, and give no evidence for it but their bare aſſertion, indulging their corrupt Nature, and being as much Lovers of their own ſelves and of Earthly things as others, there is no reaſon to take it on their word, but rather to look on them as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers. But if any profeſſing an inward illumination from God and a lively ſenſe of Divine things, ſhould deſpiſe the Eaſe, the Honours, the Wealth and Pleaſures of this World, oppoſe conſtantly the deſires of corrupt Nature, deny their own Will, mortify their outward ſenſes, have their minds ever turned towards God, being always reſign'd to his Will; and withall without Study, Reading, Learning or Meditation, ſhould give a more clear, full, plain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant repreſentation of Divine Truths even to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of our natural reaſon, than we are able to do after much Study, Learning and Converſation; we have reaſon to think that ſuch are endued with a more clear, effcttual and enlightning ſenſe and knowledge of the Divine Truths, than our notional knowledge can pretend to. It is by this Teſt that M. <hi>A. B.</hi> deſires to be Tryed.</p>
            <p>It being objected to her that ſince ſhe declared only the Truths contain'd in the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, there was no need of any new Revelation of them, they being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd already. To this ſhe replyed that as the Law of God of old was ſo corrupted by the gloſſes of the Scribes and Phariſees that they had made the Commandments of God of no effect thereby, and therefore God was pleaſed to reſcue his Law from their corruptions by the Divine Explanations of it in the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; ſo the Doctrin of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is ſo corrupted by the gloſſes of men and theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd by the Learning and Wiſdom of the World that men do not think themſelves obliged to obey the Goſpel according to the Letter, and therefore God has thought
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:104476:12"/>
fit by the Divine ſimplicity of his Light thro' the Organ of a ſilly Maid to reſcue it from their corrupt gloſſes and to confound their Learning even to their own Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>They pretend to expoſe her alſo for advancing new Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and Doctrins and thereby giving occaſion to more Diſputes and Controverſies inſtead of leſſening them. But never any did more abhor the Spirit of Diſpute and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie than ſhe; and her propoſing of theſe particular ſentiments are far from giving occaſion to them; for as ſhe makes a clear difference between the eſſential and the acceſſory Truths of Chriſtianity, ſo ſhe propoſes theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents only as acceſſorie ones, which may be helpful to ſome to make them the more admire and love God and deſpiſe this preſent World, but not as neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by all, and ſhe has often ſaid that People need not believe them, and that for this they will neither be more nor leſs pleaſing to God; that they even ought to abſtain from inquiring about them out of a Spirit of curioſity, for ſuch inquiries would beget diſtraction, preſumption and pride of heart; that they ought to ſtudy only Jeſus Chriſt crucified, to imitate him, and to deny themſelves without which the Devil and ſin would mingle themſelves in all their enquiries. And upon this head ſhe refuſed often to explain her ſelf upon theſe Subjects: Saying; <hi>wherefore ſerves it to diſtract your ſelves unprofitably, to neglect the main thing? Endeavour to deny your ſelves and to imitate Jeſus Chriſt, and you ſhall know one day what there is of theſe things; otherwiſe you ſhall deprive your ſelves of them and Damn your ſelves by your own curioſity and preſumption. Speak no more to me of them; but hold to the one neceſſary, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and fundamental thing Jeſus Chriſt Crucified, out of whom S.</hi> Paul <hi>would know nothing beſide.</hi> Beſides it is very obſervable, that theſe ſentiments are not only very agreable to the Holy Scriptures, but do alſo explain a thouſand paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of them and the whole Syſtem of the Works of God in ſuch a clear manner as could not be hitherto comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Many are ready alſo to pick out ſome paſſages of her Writings which ſeparately ſeem harſh, and from them take occaſion to accuſe her of Heterodoxy and of denying the eſſential myſteries of the Chriſtian Faith, and particularly that of the ſacred Trinity. There are no Writings which by this meaſure may not be repreſented as full of Heterodoxies.
<pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:104476:13"/>
This uſage ſhe proteſts againſt her ſelf and diſires they may not treat her Writings as they do the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſingle out and expoſe ſome paſſages without compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the whole tenour of the reſt: And for the <hi>miſtery of the Sacred Trinity,</hi> ſhe not only declares her belief of it in expreſs terms, owns it in her confeſſion of Faith, but having us'd many ſimilitudes to illuſtrate it as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Schoolmen have done, ſhe declares in the 24th. C. of the firſt Part of the <hi>Light of the World, that this unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, moſt real, moſt beautiful, moſt good, moſt great, moſt glorious miſtery is above all that we can make or ſay of it, that nothing is able to expreſs it, and that all that can be ſaid of it, detracts from it inſtead of coming near it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſhe ſays in the 2. Conf. of the 2. Part of the ſame Book, ought not to be underſtood, as if ſhe deſpis'd Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in it ſelf, or condemned the right uſe of Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm. She wrote ſo favourably and with ſo much reſpect of the Sacraments, that the Quakers thought her guilty of a Criminal exceſs, as it appears by the Apologetical Treatiſe ſhe publiſh'd in Anſwer to their Accuſations. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the high eſteem ſhe expreſſed for the right uſe of the Sacraments, ſhe was no leſs zealous in condemning the abuſe of them, eſpecially when it appeared to be univerſal. And it is in my opinion a general and uncontroverted Rule that when ill-diſpoſed Perſons make uſe of the moſt ſacred things out of a principle of Self-love to flatter and encreaſe their own and other Mens corruptions, their practice and proceedings in this caſe can only proceed from a Wicked and Deprav'd Spirit. Now in thoſe places where M. <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignon</hi> diſapproves the Baptiſm of Infants before they have attained the uſe of their reaſon, and aſcribes it to an ill principle, it appears manifeſtly from the Text it ſelf, that ſhe ſpeaks only of the preſent uſe or rather abuſe of it among wicked and ill-diſpoſed Chriſtians. She ſpeaks plainly (p. 15. &amp; 16.) of the Baptiſm of Infants, <hi>whoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have not Faith themſelves, and cannot teach them to follow the Doctrin of Jeſus, ſince they themſelves will not do it. On the contrary, they teach them to follow the World and its Pomps;</hi> and that <hi>the Godfathers and Godmothers, never think more on what they have promis'd in the Childs name; far leſs do they acquaint him with it when he is grown up, to the end the Child may remember the promiſe which he made at Baptiſm.</hi> She ſpeaks <hi>of Chriſtians in parade and not in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for they have no ſooner renounc'd in Baptiſm the World</hi>
               <pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:104476:13"/>
               <hi>and its Pomps, than they think of nothing but to follow and to love it.</hi> And nevertheleſs (p. 17.) <hi>when they are outwardly Baptiz'd, they believe they are ſufficiently aſſur'd of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and every body thinks himſelf a good Chriſtian, if ſo be, he have been outwardly Baptiz'd.</hi> This is her true meaning in theſe paſſages, and it is with reſpect to thoſe, who are in that ſtate or diſpoſition, and are habitually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to act after that manner, that ſhe affirms it would be more expedient to put off Baptiſm till they be of Age and in a good diſpoſition of mind, without which it would have been better for them that they had never been Baptiz'd. Agreeably to this, the Holy Scriptures intimate clearly, that it's the Devil who intices men to make uſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, while they are in an ill diſpoſition of mind, and that their haſt and precipitancy in this caſe proceeds from the inſtigation of Satan and is an abomination to God, as it appears by the 1. and 66. Chap. of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us plainly, that it was by the inſtigation of the Devil that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> deſir'd to be Baptiz'd, while he was in the bonds of iniquity. And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that thoſe who receive the Lord's Supper unworthily, eat and drink their own condemnation, does he not clearly give us to underſtand, that its the enemy of our Salvation who incites men to make a bad and raſh uſe of Sacred things, to the deſtruction of their Souls? M. <hi>Bourignon</hi> has made it appear in ſo many paſſages of her Works, that ſhe ſpeaks only againſt thoſe, who make uſe of the Sacraments while they continue and proceed in a corrupt ſtate, that it would be tedious to inſert in this place: See the 28, 29, 30 and 31. <hi>Numb.</hi> of the 1ſt p. of <hi>Antichriſt Reveal'd,</hi> and the 1ſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the 3 p. of the <hi>Tomb of falſe Divinty,</hi> where ſhe is ſo far from condemning true Chriſtians for Conſecrating their little Children to God in Baptiſm, that ſhe declares expreſly that <hi>Infant Baptiſm would be of good uſe, if Parents would take care to educate their Children in the true faith, and put them in mind after they are of Age, of the promiſe they made in their name at Baptiſm, namely that they ſhould be Chriſts Diſciples, and renounce the Devil, the World, and all its Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</hi> And tho' ſhe believ'd (according to the opinion of ſeveral Learned Men) that adult Perſons were only Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd in the primitive Church, and preferr'd that cuſtom as being leſs ſubject to abuſes, yet ſhe did not think, that this rule or practice was then ſo generally receiv'd, but that it might admit of juſt exceptions. And therefore in an
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:104476:14"/>
other part of her Writings, after ſhe has declar'd, ſpeaking to an Anabaptiſt, <hi>that we muſt not amuſe our ſelves with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting about the external forms of Baptiſm, while the Soul is not willing to die to the corruptions of the fleſh, that it might live again to the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> She adds, <hi>That ſince the Scripture informs us that in the days of the Apoſtles whole Families were Baptiz'd at once, it is probable that there were young Children as well as old Perſons in them.</hi> In ſhort, Theſe things may be done either out of a good or bad Principle; but uſually, and at preſent generally, theſe things were done out of a bad Principle; and this is what ſhe reproves and condemns with ſo much reaſon and juſtice.</p>
            <p>As for that Queſtion, whether we ought to condemn the Repitition of Baptiſm, when it was not duly perform'd at firſt. If that Repitition may ſerve to promote a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to God and his love, it's plain it cannot be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd, but by a Spirit that prefers external things before God and his love, which cannot be aſcrib'd to the Spirit of God. Thus the Scripture furniſheth us with inſtances of this Repitition of Baptiſm, when it may ſerve as a mean to receive the Spirit of God. See <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 2, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Some will be apt to take up a prejudice againſt her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſome places ſhe ſpeaks with ſome ſharpneſs againſt the Proteſtants, the Reformation made by them, and the firſt Reformers. But they who conſider with what ſeverity ſhe treats the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in whoſe communion ſhe was, looking on her as the great Whore that ſits on many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, how plainly ſhe repreſents the corruption of all Parties, and how ready every ſide is to be wedded to the little intereſt of their riſpective Parties, will rather admire and love the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality and Ingenuity of her Spirit than be prejudic'd againſt her upon that head. God dwells not in Temples made with mens hands, and the human and political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Churches, with their reſpective Acts, Articles, Covenants, and Schemes of Government have hitherto prov'd but the occaſion of mutual hatred and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not being Cemented with CHARITY, <hi>of all theſe buildings one ſtone is not like to be left upon another that ſhall not be thrown down.</hi> When the Temple was built, all the ſtones were hewn and ſquar'd in the Wilderneſs, and there was neither Hammer, nor Ax, nor any Tool of Iron heard in the Houſe, while it was in Building. And that God may thus rear up the living Temple of his Church will be the prayer of all ſerious Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:104476:14"/>But for a full ſatisfaction to the exceptions that may be made againſt her, I refer to her own Writings and to the Apologetical Preface written by the <hi>R. P. P.</hi> and prefixt to her Life.</p>
            <p>In the mean time as her Writings ſeem deſign'd for the common good of all Mankind, and for reviving the true Spirit of Chriſtianity in the World, ſo I heartily wiſh they may be made univerſally uſeful, and that the communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the World in their reſpective Languages may have its due effect. That the Heathen may ſee how by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they are alienated from the life of God, and how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous God is that all men ſhould be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the Truth: That the <hi>Mahomitans</hi> may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and embrace the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, whom they Honour for a great Prophet, and againſt whoſe Religion the greateſt prejudice is the ill repreſentation made of it by the Lives and Practices of thoſe who profeſs it: That the Jews may be convinc'd that Jeſus is the true Meſſiah whom they look for, who is to come again in Glory upon Earth, and who having kept them for ſo many Ages ſcatter'd among other Nations in a ſtate of contempt and reproach, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by preparing them for a more exalted ſtate when they ſhall be graffed in again, and made the head who are now the tail: That the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity may learn what it is indeed, and how far they are from it, and that their eyes being open they may ſee they are greater Idolaters than the Heathens, while theſe thro' ignorance and in the ſimplicity of their hearts bow their bodies before the Sun or their Idols; but thoſe in the midſt of light, with the bent of their hearts, their Love, their Affections, and endeavours do Worſhip Gold and Silver, and Meat and Drink, and Cloaths, and Men, and Honours, and their own Wills and Paſſions; that while they profeſs to abhor Idols they may ceaſe to be the greateſt Idolaters themſelves: That the ſeveral parties of Chriſtendom may be convinced that they have loſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity and are fighting for its ſhadow, and while its Eſſence is Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth, the Devil has ſhed among them his contrary Antichriſtian Qualities of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Malice, and Hypocriſy, under an outward cover of Maſſes, Prayers, Preachings, Communions, Sacraments, Sabbaths, Holy-Days, Faſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which when the eſſence of Chriſtianity is gone, are an abomination unto God: That the Learned may learn not to be puff'd up with their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and become ſo humble as to be willing to learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

In one Word, that all may be brought to deny themſelves and to follow Jeſus Chriſt in the true Love of God and of one another; and that the Judgments of God being now abroad upon the Earth, the Inhabitants of the World may learn Righteouſneſs.</p>

            <p>SInce 'tis my earneſt deſire that the peruſal of this Divine Work, of which this is the firſt Part may be profitable and advantageous to you, I cannot forbear wiſhing that you may give no place in your mind to certain prejudices, with which the moſt part of the World ſuffer themſelves to be ſo miſerably deluded, that they would believe themſelves deceived if they did not follow them. Permit me to ſpeak to you a word or two of ſome of thoſe pernicious and deceitful prejudices, which you muſt either baniſh out of your mind or forbear the reading of this Book, as you would not bring upon you your own Condemnation by retaining thoſe things which may cauſe you to make an ill uſe of it.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I adviſe you not to regard the appearance, ſtate, or quality of Perſons, nor any thing that is purely exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and ſo conſequently can neither add nor ſubſtract from the Truth, which has no dependance on things of that Nature. Let the ſpeaker be a Man or a Woman, let inſtructions come from this or that place, let the perſons who are reproved be great or ſmall, Turks or Chriſtians, many or few; you muſt not be ſurpriz'd at any of theſe circumſtances.

to us. <hi>For <note n="a" place="bottom">Gal. 3. 28.</note> in Jeſus Chriſt there is neither Jew nor Greek, Roman, or no Roman, Male nor Female.</hi> It is here a Maid that ſpeaks to you, none of thoſe great Men who are ſo frequently reprov'd. Do not verify by your experience that ſaying of the Scripture, <note n="b" place="bottom">Eccl. 13. 28, 29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>When the rich and mighty ſpeak, all hold their peace, and what he ſays they extol to the heavens; but when the mean man ſpeaks, they ſay, who is this! even tho' he offer wiſe things they would not yield to him.</hi> If there be any valuable prejudice it ſhould certainly be in favour of the meaneſt, weakeſt and moſt contemptible perſons, ſince God himſelf has declared, 'tis his pleaſure to make uſe of them, and Jeſus Chriſt was ſo rejoyced at that choice, that he ſays to his Father, <note n="c" place="bottom">Matt. 11. 25, 26.</note> 
               <hi>I thank thee O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and from the learned, and haſt revealed them unto Babes: even ſo Father, ſince ſo it ſeemed good unto thee!</hi> Is there any thing meaner, weaker and more contemptible in the eſteem of the World, in the matters of Doctrin than a Maid? And can any thing be more proper to verify that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the choice of God?

It is plain that ſuch an extraordinary effect muſt proceed from a cauſe, that is extraordinarily powerful; and that cauſe muſt be God himflef, when the effect is good and uſeful,</p>
            <p>Secondly in Divine things you muſt have no regard to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural qualities of the mind, or rather to the human means by which 'tis cultivated, ſuch as Sciences, Study, Reading; and the like. Divine truth is ſo far from depending on ſuch things, that 'tis rather obſcur'd by them. It may be juſtly reckon'd a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy if ſuch unnatural methods ſhould be attended with ſucceſs, when men endeavour to derive into ill prepared Veſſels by the exerciſe of ther corrupt faculties, things that are altogether independent upon them, and are freely infus'd by a calm inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation into Souls that are at reſt from their own tumults. Truly we might be aſtoniſh'd if the Learned ſhould find ſolid truth by perſuing ſuch methods as would certainly baniſh it out of their minds if they were already poſſeſs'd of it. <hi>Man having</hi>

               <hi>by much reaſoning, the uprightneſs in which God created him.</hi> But when God ſpeaks to us by ſimple and unlearned laiks, we cannot ſuſpect them, as we would ſuſpect the Learned, that they feed us with their ſtudied ſpeculations or the prejudices they have drunk in at Schools and drawn from the works of Men; and repeat to us the ſongs their Teachers have taught them to ſing.</p>
            <p>The Perſon who ſpeaks here is without ſtudy, even without reading and which is more, without meditation: Search a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to find out the ſource of this fountain, and to underſtand well what Maſter could have inſtructed her; it could neither be Man, the Devil nor Nature.</p>
            <p>But the thing which you ought moſt to obſerve, that you have no regard to the conduct of Men. I mean that you do not imagine that the Truth, much leſs Salvation depends upon them, their Opinions, Orders, Directions, Submiſſion, or that it is tied to them by a neceſſary bond, ſince it has no eſſential union but with God alone, and may be forſaken by all men, if they will, as any man may, and too many actually do. This unhappy prejudice has ruined the Chriſtian Church, who imagin'd that ſhe could not poſſibly fall after ſhe had eſtabliſh'd her ſelf upon the authority of certain particular Perſons, human Succeſſions, outward Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and other Circumſtances that are not at all inconſiſtent with the Spirit of Error. It is certain there are few Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and even few Catholicks, who do not ſee that the Church is extreamly fallen away and corrupted. But the Learned have found out a diſtinction to charm this evil. They ſay, that tho' the Church may fall into a moral corruption and be guilty of back ſliding from the practice of a Chriſtian life, ſhe is ſtill infallible and incorruptible in matters of Faith. It is much to be feared, that this diſtinction ſerves rather to flatter the Spirit of pride than promote that of Humility, which is the Spirit of the Goſpel, and that it proceeds rather from human intereſt, which prepoſſeſſes and darkens even the beſt minds, than from an enlightned charity which deſigns to excuſe the evils of the Church as far as Truth permits. May not thoſe who have made this diſtinction perceive they are ſo far from excuſing the Church or leſſening the guilt of her fall, that they render her guilty of the fall of Devils; whereas her Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries pretend only to hold her fallible after a manner confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to human infirmity? It ſeems they contradict themſelves
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:104476:19"/>
in this diſtraction, for can that which has no faith be incorruptible as to faith? and that which is not only deſtitute of the works of Faith, but whoſe works are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and conſequently oppoſite to thoſe of Faith, can that have Faith? <note n="f" place="bottom">Jam. 2. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Shew</hi> me, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Shew me the faith of which thou boaſteſt without thy works, and I will ſhew thee the faith, which I poſſeſs by my works:</hi> Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Man as <note n="g" place="bottom">Jam. 2. 20.</note> vain and empty, who would give way to ſuch thoughts: What then would he have ſaid of thoſe who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that one may be not only deſtitute of works, but that even his works may be evil, and habitually evil, or which is the ſame thing, that his Manners may be corrupted, and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he might be infallibly poſſeſſed with the purity of the true Faith! But it may be they underſtand by Faith, Speculations, Notions, the knowledge of ſpiritual Things; but St. <hi>James</hi> reckons thoſe things when they are alone and barren to be a diobolical Faith, ſince he expreſly aſcribes it <note n="h" place="bottom">Jam. 2. 19.</note> to the Devil. And how can this diminiſh or cover the evil of the Church, that tho' her Manners are corrupted, ſhe has neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs with an infallible certainty the knowledge of Divine things, and the decerning of Truth and Falſhood, of good and evil: This would be rather to make her fall equal to that of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to make her ſin with knowledge in the midſt of her light and againſt it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who aſſert this Opinion, repreſent her without conſcience, render her more odious to God and Men, more deviliſh, and condemn her to a place in Hell far below the Infidels, rather than if they ſhould ſay, that her Morals are or have been Corrupted, for her being miſtaken in her Knowledge, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that to be good and true which is not really ſo; ſince 'tis certainly a leſs evil, and a leſs fall to ſin thro' ignorance and error, than to do it againſt the knowledge of the truth. To pretend to infallibility in the knowledge of the Truth, while at the ſame time it appears by her actions and her own confeſſion that ſhe is corrupted in the practice of a Chriſtian life, would be to make a profeſſion of ſinning againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and renouncing of conſcience; which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done without making ſhipwrack of the faith.</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="bottom">Tim. 1. 9.</note> So that by this excuſe they equally prove that ſhe is fallen into a greater eſtrangment from God than that which they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and that at the ſame time ſhe is deſtitute of true Faith
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:104476:19"/>
and the knowledge of the Truth, and ſeiz'd with a malady of preſumption, which puts me in mind of that for which St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in the Epiſtle which he wrote to her <note n="k" place="bottom">Rom. 9. 20, 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>that ſhe ſhall be cut off,</hi> if ſhe ſuffer her ſelf to be led into it. In the mean time 'tis thro' this prejudice that they ſhut their Ears againſt the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Truth that reproves them, and that they reject the remedies tho' they are not ignorant of their diſeaſe, putting themſelves in a condition, that reſembles the ſtate of <hi>Babylon,</hi> of which the Prophet ſpeaks, <note n="l" place="bottom">Jer. 51. 9.</note> 
               <hi>we would have healed Babylon, but ſhe is not healed; forſake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even unto the skie.</hi> Do not you likewiſe render your ſelf uncurable, dear Reader, by admitting of ſuch prejudices, and ſuffering them to blind you ſo far as to make you reject the Heavenly reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which God offers you at preſent by the hand of a Maid without human inſtruction, and who reproves the abuſes of that Society which they call the Church, how powerfully ſoever they are authoriz'd and favour'd by great Perſons, to whom they are alſo favourable according to the intereſt of this World; which ſhe does not out of a principle of partiality and private malice, as they are ſuppoſed to have done who have left the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince ſhe never withdrew from it, and much leſs did ſhe liſt her ſelf into any other particular Sect, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approv'd them all, and diſcover'd their abuſes in her other Writings with as much freedom as in this ſhe has done thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and in the general of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <p>This is one of her firſt Works, which ſhe wrote at a time when ſhe was not acquainted with thoſe who differ in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. The firſt part which is now communicated, was publiſhed ſome years ago in <hi>Dutch:</hi> Since I have had the happineſs to ſee in Manuſcript the other two Parts, which in my opinion are more admirable than this; I can indeed ſay, that I never met with more extraordinary, more convincing, edifying and moving Truths, than thoſe which are in this Divine piece, particularly in the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parts and eſpecially in the last, to incite us to reſign our ſelves entirly to the guidance and direction of God. I cannot reflect upon the wonders I have ſeen in theſe Treatiſes, without crying out with amaſement, what other Maſter than thou, O
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:104476:20"/>
Holy and Adorable Spirit of my God, could be the Author of this moſt Divine Light! O moſt Holy and Almighty God, there is none but thee that could ſo powerfully draw thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſo holy and pure an end! And the firſt eſſays of ſuch a Maſter by the weakeſt inſtruments are as perfect Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces as the most finiſh'd works of others! for I can truly ſay, that I have felt as much and even more ſtrength and moving force in theſe firſt works, than in her laſt productions. And I cannot comprehend how it is poſſible for any Man to reſiſt ſuch holy Truths, without declaring openly for the Devil, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the defence of Vice and Lying. There are none in my opinion but the Devil, and thoſe who are reſolv'd to be his ſlaves, and the protectors of Sin and Iniquity, that can hate or oppoſe this Light. For as for thoſe who have ſtill ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of good deſires in their hearts whatſoever Errors they maintain, and with whatſoever vices they may be defiled, it is impoſſible for them to hate thoſe Divine Truths, and much leſs the perſon by whom they are communicated to us, or raiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt her. Since they are ſo far from receiving an injury by them, that they have a far opportunity of delivering themſelves from the moſt dangerous Evils and to embrace the advantage of a laſting felicity. There is a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt repreſenting and doing Evil, betwixt admoniſhing one of his ſickneſs and cauſing his diſtemper. Such a warning is rather a means to make him to look out for a remedy, and when at the ſame time the moſt proper remedies are preſented to him, it is the higheſt obligation that can be laid upon him, eſpecially in matters of eternal importance. And yet O blind and perverſe World! it is your uſual cuſtom to wiſh evil to thoſe who would deliver you from your miſery, and to requite their Kindneſs with baſe and cruel perſecutions, as it appears manifeſtly from the fate and experience of the true benefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of Mankind, the Holy Prophet the Son of God himſelf, and all his beloved Diſciples and Meſſengers, who had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign than to procure the Light and Salvation of the World. This Meſſenger of God did often meet with the ſame treatment, as well as the late Mr. <hi>De Cort,</hi> who diſcovering too open a zeal for the publication of this Work, was prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from accompliſhing that deſign by a Death, that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by contrivances no leſs ſecret than criminal; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I may juſtly uſe the words of the Prohpet <hi>Jeremiah, <note n="m" place="bottom">Jer. 7. 19.</note>

            <p>For Sinners cannot endure that a good Perſon ſhould by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the Truth, deprive them of the pretexts, which they uſe to enjoy their darling Sins with peace and ſecurity. And the wiſe are loath to ſee their Wiſdom confounded, when they have once given way in their hearts to that proud conceit of being infallible when they are Aſſembled in a Body. As the Church was heretofore deluded by a Spirit of preſumption in the days of the Prophets, who were perſecuted under pretext that the Prieſts, the Learned, the Doctors and Paſtors, whoſe fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well as the Errors of the whole Church were expos'd by the Prophets, were infalliable in the poſſeſſion and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Law of God, and their Determinations and Counſels concerning Divine things. <hi>Come, ſaid they, and let <note n="n" place="bottom">Jer 1. 8. 19.</note> us deviſe devices againſt Jeremiah, for the land ſhall not periſh from the prieſt, nor counſel from the wiſe, nor the word from the Prophet: come and let us ſmite him with the Tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But God has quite other Deſigns, (the Lord has ſaid accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the declaration of an other Prophet) <note n="o" place="bottom">Iſa. 29. 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear and worſhip of me is nothing but forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and taught by the precept of men: therefore behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work, their wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the underſtanding of their prudent ſhall be hid.</hi> This is an unavoidable judgment, which they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to undergoe, and their reſiſtance will only ſerve to make them be more entirely cruſht by the powerful hand of God.</p>
            <p>This will be to the little ones and to the ſimple matter of joy and gladneſs, and they ſhall ſing praiſes unto the Spirit of God whom Jeſus Chriſt ſhall ſend to poſſeſs the place of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and diabodical Spirit, which he will extripate <note n="p" place="bottom">18. 26.</note>

            <p>If you have a ſincere deſire to be of the Number of theſe little and ſimple ones, you will eaſily perceive by the Divine Light that is communicated to you, that God begins to fulfill his

word as well as the deſire that we profeſs to have in that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Church, <hi>come lovely Spirit, and renew the Earth.</hi> You will afterwards be more fully convinc'd of this Truth by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther works of this nature. This is faithfully and ſincerely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to you according to the Manuſcript of the late Mr. <hi>De Cort,</hi> who nouriſht his Soul with theſe Truths, by which he had been regenerated to God, and incited to renounce the Vanities of this World. I have neither added nor ſubſtracted any thing from it, except ſome words at the top of the Pages, and before the Conferences, to ſerve for an Abridgment of the matter, and a help to the memory of the Reader; I began alſo to quote the paſſages of the Holy Scripture, to ſhew that their is an entire conformity, not only of the Doctrin, Words, and Sentiments, but even of the Life, Conduct, Actions, and other Accidents of this Maid, with thoſe who were heretofore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably enlightn'd and govern'd by the Holy Spirit. But ſince the proſecution of that Deſign would have required a great deal of time, and ſince it may be probably ſuppoſed that moſt Readers will not give themſelves the trouble of ſearching and examining ſo great a number of paſſages; it was thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to illuſtrate the firſt Conference with all the particular Quotations, as a ſample of that abſolute uniformity with the Spirit of God and his direction, which might have been eaſily carried on throughout the whole Work: And in the remaining part of the Book you will only find the moſt neceſſary paſſages cited, or thoſe which have moſt manifeſt relation to the Text.</p>
            <p>God grant, Beloved Reaader that you may reap from this Work an Advantage, which may diſpoſe thy Soul to become a Child of his Grace, and to receive his Holy Spirit. This is the hearty and earneſt deſire of</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE OF <hi>Monſieur de Cort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> TO THE READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Friendly Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Here preſent you with an Account of what befel me in a Voyage I made to a far Country, to come to which I travelled above a Year, accompanied with ſeveral of my own Country-men, who with me were Eye-witneſſes of our meeting by the way with a Pilgrimeſs, who ſpoke to us admirable and amazing Things, that are capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting unto God all thoſe who ſhall read or hear the hidden Secrets of the Righteouſneſs and Mercy of God, and the Blindneſs of Men, and the Power which the Devil at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent has over them.</p>
            <p>The Thing is as profitable as aſtoniſhing; for it has never been conceived or comprehended by any humane Wit. It muſt needs proceed from a divine Underſtanding, and it muſt needs be a Celeſtial or Terreſtrial Angel; for neither Philoſophy nor Theology could ever teach me the Things which this Pilgrimeſs taught me in the ſmall time wherein I travelled with her, but in a way ſo ſimple and ſo unaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that all her Words did pierce my Heart and enlighten my Underſtanding, working in my Soul Joy and Compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xl" facs="tcp:104476:22"/>I was at firſt quite tranſported beſide my ſelf, and I thought all my Underſtanding was renvers'd while I heard her firſt Diſcourſes, being of Opinion that the Words of Jeſus Chriſt were fulfilled, in that he ſays [<hi>I will deſtroy the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, and aboliſh the Prudence of the Prudent</hi>] for of neceſſity all Men, how knowing and learned ſoever they be, muſt be ſtruck dumb and confounded by the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Wiſdom of this Pilgrimeſs; and I took it for a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Mercy of God that he was pleaſed yet to declare his Secrets to any of his Servants, wiſhing for the Memory of an Angel that I might be able to declare all that I heard of this Pilgrimeſs, ſince nothing proceeded from her Mouth which was not profitable, and moſt enlightning, very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and powerful, capable of converting the moſt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Hearts and obſtinate Sinners.</p>
            <p>But I muſt yield to my Weakneſs, not being able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare any other thing but what my Memory ſhall furniſh me with, being helped by ſome Remarks which I made when I had the conveniency of Writing. I entreat the Reader that in this Narrative he may not ſeek for Ornament of Language, nor Philoſophical Diſcourſes, but the naked ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Truth, ſince God makes uſe of weak Things to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the ſtrong.</p>
            <p>I will not at all diſguiſe or adorn her Language, fearing to oppoſe the Deſigns which God has to manifeſt to all the World, that he reveals his Secrets to Babes, and that he reſiſts the mighty and the proud Ones of the Earth, from whom he conceals and hides his Secrets and Wonders.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon we have ground to ſay with S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> [<hi>The Ignorant and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned take Heaven by force, and we with all our Sciences continue drown'd in earthly Affections: Are we aſhamed to follow them becauſe they have out-run us? We ought rather to be aſhamed not to follow them.</hi>] And to add here alſo the Words which the Pilgrims of <hi>Emaus</hi> ſaid one to another, when they remembred what Jeſus Chriſt had ſpoken to them by the way, while he explained to them the Holy Scriptures, to wit [<hi>Was not our Heart on fire, and did it not burn within us when he ſpoke to us in the way, and opened unto us the Holy Scriptures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Pilgrimeſs in ſpeaking to us muſt certainly be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with the ſame Spirit with which our Saviour was; for each of us felt his Heart to burn by her powerful Words, which did gently beget in our Souls a Contempt of created Things, and a Love of Things eternal, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:104476:22"/>
our Underſtandings by Truths ſo clear, that they could not proceed from any other than from the Father of all Lights.</p>
            <p>She told us Things unheard of, ſo marvellous and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, that we often remained quite loſt with admiration, for we had never heard ſuch Things.</p>
            <p>She explained likewiſe the Holy Scriptures ſo perfectly, that none of the holy Fathers have ever ſo done, nor any Body ſince the Creation of the World.</p>
            <p>That which did moſt aſtoniſh us, was, That ſhe told us ſhe had never read nor learn'd them of any Body. She knew alſo the ſecret Thoughts of the Hearts of many: For a proof of which ſhe told us Things ſo particular about our own inward State, that neither Men nor Devils could ever know them.</p>
            <p>Which befel us many times; for ſhe warned us of divers Miſchiefs hid under a Mask of Piety, ſaying [<hi>That we were fallen into the dangerous Times foretold by Jeſus Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many call themſelves Chriſtians and his Diſciples, who nevertheleſs are of the Synagogue of Satan, who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Prieſts of God, the Confeſſors and Guides of Souls, while they adhere unto the Devil by expreſs Covenant: That theſe do ſeduce many by falſe appearances; and that even thoſe who have reſolved to follow God are deceived by theſe falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who deceive even the Elect under a colour of Holineſs and Devotion; that all the World was now full of ſuch Guids.</hi>] Which at firſt did a little ſtumble us, for we could not be enclined to believe that ſo many People in Chriſtendom, even Prieſts and religious Perſons, were bound unto the Devil by expreſs Covenant. We ask'd her for what reaſon we ought to believe a thing ſo abominable? For it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beſt to have a good Opinion of our Neighbour, until the contrary were manifeſt.</p>
            <p>[She ſays, <hi>Gentlemen, it is meet in the general that you entertain in your Minds a pious Belief that every one is better than your ſelves; but if you piouſly believe, in particular, that all the Perſons with whom you converſe are good, you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. It is more needful for you to diſcover the Evil which they have hid within them, than their Good, which will advantage you nothing; but their Evil may greatly hurt you, when it is unknown to you; for you cannot beware of it while you do not know it, or at leaſt are in doubt of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:104476:23"/>
               <hi>It is with this pious Belief that the Good are entrapp'd by Satan, who would never follow the Ill which is manifeſt: But that which is hid under Good is much more dangerous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You are free, Gentlemen, to believe of this what you pleaſe: For my part, I declare only what I learn in my inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have many other Secrets to declare, but methinks you are too ſcrupulous to hear them. I will ſpeak no more than you pleaſe. I know very well how to hold my peace if my Words offend you, or do not at all profit you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nevertheleſs, I tell you in Truth, that if theſe Evils be not made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> manifeſt to the World, all Men are in danger of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For very ſhortly the Plagues of God will fall upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and if Men will not believe that they have thus forſaken God to join themſelves unto the Devil, the moſt perfect will blaſpheme againſt the ſame God who ſhall afflict them with divers Chaſtiſements, ſuch as the like have never yet fallen out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She ſaid as in a Spirit of Fury, <hi>God would be very unjuſt to exerciſe ſo much Rigour againſt the Chriſtians, if they were as good as you believe them, or would think them to be: It were better for us to ſeparate, for your Thoughts are altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from mine. Go, Gentlemen, purſue your way: For my part I love rather to walk alone, and not to ſpeak to you any more, keeping my Secrets for my ſelf; I never ſpoke ſo openly of theſe Things.</hi>] This ſo rough and confident Anſwer did inflame our deſire to ſpeak to her the more, that we might diſcover ſome other Thing; knowing well, that it is againſt the timerouſneſs of the Feminine Sex to do and ſpeak ſo poſitively, to Perſons of Learning and Authority, as all of us were; nevertheleſs, like a ſtrong Woman, who would place her Confidence in God alone, ſhe anſwers us without fear, making appear ſufficiently that ſhe neither deſired our Friendſhip nor our Company, no more than our Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but with a generous Contempt ſhe walked without any humane Reſpect, teſtifying abundantly that ſhe ſought for nothing upon Earth, and that ſhe feared no other Thing but God.</p>
            <p>Which we remarked ſufficiently during the whole time of our Voyage, having never perceived her to baulk a word to pleaſe any Body, keeping always to the ſtrait Truth, as well in ſmall Things as in great. Her Spirit was firm and conſtant, always preſent to it ſelf, we never ſaw her wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring nor diſtracted: She had a Judgment ſo juſt and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:104476:23"/>
that ſhe could not ſuffer the leaſt Injuſtice, tho' it had been in her own favour.</p>
            <p>This ſtreight Judgment was always blind, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting either her Friends or Enemies, her Honour or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, her Eaſe or Trouble, her Hurt or Profit: In fine, we always diſcovered in her a perfect ſtreightneſs on all ſorts of Rencounters, and a Truth ſo firm, that never one Word did contradict another in ſo long a ſpace of time and amidſt ſo many different Diſcourſes and Subjects. She ſpoke very little unask'd; and anſwer'd our Demands ſo effectually, that often we remained mute and without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in very ſublime Things, being oblig'd to acknowledge, that the Wiſdom infuſed by God does far ſurpaſs all the Wiſdom of Men. But it is no wonder that God did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelf to this Soul, for ſhe deſired no other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication nor Contentment, but only what ſhe found with her God: For if we were about to tell her ſome News even of pious Matters, ſhe begg'd we would not ſpeak of them to her, ſaying, that they were nothing but Diſtractions: And when we entred into any ſtrange Towns, where ſhe had never been, ſhe took no notice of any thing in them. For having one Day entred into a Town, and abode there for three Days, after we came out of it, I would needs ſpeak of the fine Church that was there: She ſaid, <hi>Is there a Church there? Truly I did not ſee it.</hi> Thus in whatſoever place ſhe was, ſhe continued always in her Recollection. We ſaw her often in Rencounters, where ſhe met with Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and Contempt; and on other Occaſions where ſhe received Praiſes, ſhe never changed her Countenance, receiving Contempt without Trouble, and Praiſes without pleaſure: She ſhewed ſome Diſcontent when any Gift was offered her, or when we would have rendered her any Service, which ſhe would never accept of, except in caſe of Neceſſity or Sickneſs.</p>
            <p>We perceived her always of a joyful Countenance, but never to delight her ſelf in any earthly: Thing that might give her Joy. In ſhort, we may all truly affirm, that we never obſerved in her any Vice, Sin, or any weakneſs of Spirit, but a perfect and ſolid Vertue, ſurpaſſing natural and humane Strength; which made us ſay, that her Life was altogether miraculous, as if <hi>Adam</hi> had never ſin'd in her.</p>
            <p>This we do not ſpeak lightly, but after much proof and experience by ſo conſtant and familiar a Converſation, of
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:104476:24"/>
ſo long continuance, travelling with her Night and Day, amidſt Eaſe and Trouble, Want and Abundance, and ſo many other Occaſions which are to be met with in Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of obſerving a Perſon exactly in all her Manners, where nothing can remain unknown or counterfeited, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Eye and Judgment of Perſons of Learning and Judgment as this Pilgrimeſs has done, who aſſuredly was ſent to us from God, to manifeſt us his Secrets and his Wonders.</p>
            <p>This is an Inſtance of his great Mercy, that in the midſt of ſo groſs univerſal Darkneſs, as is at preſent in the World, God has vouchſafed yet to ſend us ſuch a Light, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of enlightning the whole World, at leaſt all thoſe who will receive it: For no Body can ſeriouſly read or hear the Diſcourſes of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pilgrimeſs without diſcovering the ſtate of his own Conſcience, and alſo the poor Eſtate into which Chriſtendom has now fallen, the blindneſs of Men, and the hazard of their Salvation.</p>
            <p>She ſhews clearly that we live now in the laſt Times; that this is the Reign of Antichriſt; that he has almoſt full Dominion over all Men; that his Kingdom will very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be at an end.</p>
            <p>She does not draw her Diſcourſes from imaginary Things, nor from fine Speculations invented by Philoſophical or Poetical Reaſonings; but in a Reaſoning ſo firm and conſtant, that ſhe ſeems to poſſeſs in her Nature the Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the Sciences of Men together, with Truths ſo convincing, ſo clear and eloquent, capable of engaging every good Underſtanding to an infallible Belief, though her Stile is always ſimple and ſincere. She ſpoke [<hi>Of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies and Raviſhments</hi> (which the Devout eſteem Vertues) <hi>as great Imperfections and Weakneſſes for Souls eſtabliſh'd in Vertue, which conſiſts only in Righteouſneſs and Truth, and Faith, ſaying, that all the rest were nothing but amuſements, on which a Soul eſtabliſh'd in the Love of God will never reſt.</hi> She told us ſuch high Myſteries of our Faith, as never any has attain'd to ſo clear Underſtanding of them. She ſpoke of Judgment quite after another manner than all the Authors who ever wrote upon this Subject, and yet with ſuch clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that every Mind would be raviſh'd at it with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and aſtoniſhment. She knew Things to come; and did not foretel them but by way of ſuppoſition, or related them as if ſhe had dream'd them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:104476:24"/>We found divers times that ſhe could tell what paſt in her abſence, and how our Souls behav'd themſelves towards God.</p>
            <p>She made no reckoning of all theſe extraordinary Graces; ſaying, <hi>That they gave nothing to the Soul which poſſeſſes them; that neither Miracles nor Gifts of Prophecy were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to our Salvation; that one might have them and yet be damned; that all our Happineſs conſiſts in poſſeſſing in our Souls the Love of God, which is true</hi> Charity; <hi>that other Gifts are accidental; that the Wicked may indeed work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and have the Gifts of Prophecy, when it pleaſes God; that the Devils themſelves do frequently Things altogether mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous, and foretel likewiſe Things to come.</hi> In ſhort, this illuminated Soul deſired nothing but what was ſolid and perfect, rejecting even a great many particularities which are mention'd in the Life of ſome Saints, ſaying, <hi>That either they had Imperfections among their Vertues, or rather that they who wrote their Lives were not endowed with the holy Spirit to diſcern true Vertue from natural Weakneſſes; that God was not viſible to the Eyes of the Body; that our Imagination may frame many Viſions of divers Figures; and that the Devil mingles himſelf always in things ſenſible to our Guſt and to our natural Senſes; that there are great Cheats among Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who make Profeſſion of a ſpiritual Life; that the Devil ſlips in there as an Angel of Light; and that he who does not force himſelf to overcome his natural<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inclinations, can never come to live Chriſtianly; that all that is of Nature, is not of Grace; that to live a Chriſtian one muſt live ſupernaturally; that our Soul is a Spirit; that God does not communicate himſelf unto it but in Spirit and in Truth;</hi>] That there are none but Souls purified from themſelves and from all earthly Objects who hear the Voice of God; that the Cares of ones Health, of his Honour and of his Wealth, are great hindrances to the receiving of divine Notices, which are formed by the ſole motion of the Soul, which receives and underſtands them according as it is ſtript of it ſelf. In ſhort, this divine Soul told us ſo many Secrets of the myſtical and inward Life, that all our Theology was too ſhort and inſufficient to anſwer her to ſo high Queſtions, not only in Matters of Theology, but alſo in all other Matters, according to the various Rencounters and Occurrences which fell out in ſo long a Voyage; ſo that one would have thought that tho' a Man had peruſed all ſorts of Hiſtories, and grown old in the Study of all ſorts of Sciences, he could not know with
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:104476:25"/>
ſuch Underſtanding, all the Things which this Pilgrimeſs told us.</p>
            <p>Which ſhe made very little reckoning of, ſaying, <hi>That all the Sciences which do not ſerve as means to love God, are vain, and frequently the occaſion of our Damnation.</hi> Her Converſation was always ſerious; and when by chance we felt into any unprofitable or indifferent Diſcourſe, ſhe was ſilent, and calmly withdrew, making appear ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently that it was not agreeable to her; and ſometimes ſhe ſaid, [<hi>Diſcourſes which profit nothing, do weary and oppreſs my Spirit. I love my Solitude better, in which it re-inforces it ſelf, and becomes vigorous: And therefore I entreat you let me go alone as long as I profit you in nothing, and you will do me a pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to write in particular the admirable Things which we heard of this Pilgrimeſs: She told us ſo great Marvels concerning the State of the World, the juſt Vengeance that God would take of wicked Chriſtians, and the Mercy which he would ſhew unto the Good, that the like were never heard of; and it would be hard to believe them, if this did not come from the Mouth of a Soul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly illuminated, who ſpoke by the motion of the holy Spirit: So that we may ſay of her Diſcourſes, what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of his Rapture, [<hi>That he had ſeen and heard things which Eyes had not ſeen, nor Ear heard, and that is has not entred into the mind of Man what God has prepared for his Elect.</hi>] What ſhe ſaid was to fall out in the laſt Time, during the Judgment, and after the Judgment, was never before heard of nor conceived. They are Things which do raviſh all Men with Fear, with Joy, and with Aſtoniſhment. For my part I can ſay as to my ſelf, that the meeting with this Pilgrimeſs has withdrawn me from all ſort of Evil, has given me a great deſire of Vertue, and an abſolute reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of embracing an Evangelical Life, having diſcovered ſufficiently by her Diſcourſes, that without this no Body will be ſaved. Her Words have ſo enlightened my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that all the Learning I had acquired ſeems to me as Darkneſs and Ignorance in reſpect of that divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is ſo mercifully poured out upon the Earth by the Organ of a ſilly Maid. I wiſh that every one had ſeen her, and heard her as I have done, and might receive thereby the ſame Operations which my Soul has felt; for I look upon her Acquaintance as a greater favour, than all the Graces and Favours which God has beſtowed on me
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:104476:25"/>
in this World; yea, even than my Creation it ſelf, for that would ſerve me in little ſtead, without the working out of my Salvation, which would have been in great danger, if I had not attain'd to the knowledge of my Self, and of the Deſigns and Marvels of God, which I have learned and diſcovered by the means of this Creature; and ſhe has certainly been ſent me as the only means of the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my Soul, and of all thoſe who will profit by the recital of this Narrative, which I find my ſelf obliged to publiſh for the profit of many. This is the true <hi>Treaſure hid in the Earth.</hi> He who ſhall find it, ought to ſell all that he has to buy this Ground, to the end he may diſcover and find this Treaſure, and take it up with Joy, as the moſt precious Thing of the World. I cannot hinder ſome who wiſh Evil or are Enemies to the Truth, from finding or pretending ſomething that is not agreeable to them, for the Light does always offend Blear-Eyes, who cannot endure the Light, and the Truth which reproves is never agreeable to our Senſes: But I would admoniſh them to beware of reprehending or making themſelves Maſters of the holy Spirit. I behov'd, for ſome time, to ſuſpend my Judgment as to the Belief of ſome Points of Doctrin, for I had learn'd them from my Maſters in another ſenſe; but ſince I have laid aſide all theſe Authors who have written us their Sentiments, and fix'd on the ſacred Text of the holy Scriptures, I have found ſo much Conformity in them, with the Life, Manners and Words of this Pilgrimeſs, that no Doubts could come any longer into my Mind, and I could not, without betraying my Conſcience, give her ſo much as one Contradiction: Since that gives me an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proof, that this Soul is truly poſſeſt by the holy Spirit, who has brought forth in her his Twelve Fruits, his Seven Gifts, and the Eight Beatitudes which Jeſus Chriſt has taught.</p>
            <p>I ſhould believe I committed a great ſin to think that any other Thing might proceed from ſuch a Source than what is Divine; ſo much the rather, that I have always remarked that this Soul did act in nothing naturally, but by ſupernatural Motives, never being moved but by the motion of the holy Spirit: In confirmation of which I would be ready to ſpend the laſt drop of my Blood, to the end that none might reject this Light, <hi>to love rather their Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>

                     </hi> particularly how he inſtructed her immediately from her Infancy; the oppoſition of men; of Chriſtian perfection, and of the deplorable ſtate of Chriſtian.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>AS we advanc'd in our journey, ſtill travelling towards the Sun riſing, being already more than half way, we perceiv'd, at a diſtance, one walking before us; not knowing at firſt who it was, becauſe of the diſtance, we remark'd only that it was a perſon alone, who deſir'd no Company, but retir'd aſide aſſoon as any body approach'd, and hid herſelf, until we mending our pace had come nearer and when we beheld this perſon, we perceived ſhe was a Maid, who appear'd young enough; and tho ſhe was ſimply apparelled, ſhe had notwithſtanding a grave and majeſtick Mien. We ſaw in her face the marks and the joy of a ſerene and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoul. Her gate was always of an equal pace, neither flow nor haſty: her looks gave both joy and fear: ſhe did not refuſe to ſpeak to us in our Language, tho it was not natural to her; and having ask'd her whither ſhe was going? ſhe ſaid,</hi> In Pilgrimage for penitence for her own ſins, and thoſe of others. <hi>And having ask'd her, from whence ſhe came? ſhe ſaid,</hi> From afar: for ſhe had travell'd many years, and was harraſs'd by the way, and diſcolour'd by the Sun.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:104476:31"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>We ask'd, what ſhe deſign'd by ſo long and troubleſome voyages, dangerous for a Maid alone; remonſtrating to her, that there were many other means to do penitence in her own Country without being in danger of hunger, thirſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy rencounters, and many other inconveniencies, which may fall out in travelling alone; and that at leaſt ſhe ought to take ſome Company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which ſhe anſwer'd;</hi> That ſhe was oblig'd to travel alone, for ſhe had found no body that would accompany her; and that many had indeed gone along with her for ſome time, but upon the firſt temptation, hunger, or incommodity, they had ſtaid behind, not knowing how to endure penitence, becauſe they had <note n="a" place="bottom">2 Tim. 4. 10.</note> too much love for themſelves, and too little affection to ſeek God; eſteeming their eaſe more, than the contentment there is in the loving and following of him: for this cauſe they had left her.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Dangers,</hi> God preſerv'd her; <note n="b" place="bottom">Pſ. 34. 20.</note> ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paſt thro many dangers without being hurt; that her confidence was in him alone, who <note n="c" place="bottom">Mat. 28. 18.</note> has all power in heaven and in earth; that he never forſakes them <note n="d" place="bottom">Pſ. 25. 3.</note> who put their confidence in him; that ſhe reckon'd it a happineſs to ſuffer hunger, thirſt, and other troubleſome things <note n="e" place="bottom">2 Cor. 12. 10.</note>; ſince Chriſt had choſen <note n="f" place="bottom">Heb. 12. 2.</note> ſuch ſufferings to give us an example <note n="g" place="bottom">2 Pet. 2. 21.</note>, and to the end we might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; and that ſhe had no other intention in this undertaking but to abandon the world, to deny her ſelf <note n="h" place="bottom">Mat. 16. 24.</note>, and to imitate Jeſus Chriſt; which ſhe could not ſo well do <note n="i" place="bottom">Pſ. 45. 11.</note> in her own Country, ſince the care of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral wealth <note n="k" place="bottom">1 Joh. 2. 15, 16.</note>, the love of friends, and the pleaſures there are in being honour'd and eſteem'd, are all things which withdraw from God, and hinder the reſigning of our ſelves to him; that penitences choſen after our mode <note n="l" place="bottom">Coloſ. 2. 22, 23.</note> are full of ſelf-love; but that <note n="m" place="bottom">1 Pet. 1. 6, 7.</note> thoſe which God permits to befal us are pure; that the length of the way was not troubleſome to her, for ſhe had no deſire of ever ſtaying in one fixt place, becauſe there ſhe found too many diſtractions by the importunity <note n="n" place="bottom">Pſ. 120. 5, 7.</note> of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104476:31"/>
of men, who would have diſturb'd her inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and that ſhe <note n="o" place="bottom">Pſ. 55. 7, 8.</note> deſir'd very much to live unknown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We admir'd all this anſwer, for it ſeem'd not to proceed from human ſence, ſince Nature takes no part in ſo pious a reſolution, and one muſt live ſupernaturally to deſpiſe eaſe, friends, and honours, and to love ſufferings and fatigues, and flee the converſation of men: ſeeing they are all ſociable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, delighting themſelves among their equals, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to converſe with their like. It gave us ſentiments of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, ſaying one to another, what Confuſion ſhall we have in the day of Judgment; when ſimple Girls do ſuch things to pleaſe God, and we, amidſt all our Learning and Studies, are ſo far remov'd from ſuch ſentiments! Truly this Child will condemn us. We reſolv'd to accompany her, and to examine her more narrowly, ſeeing there was ſomething peculiar in her, above the ſpirit and capacity of the female ſex; for her diſcourſes were firm, conſtant, and full of judgment, and of divine wiſdom, tho no ways artificial nor polite, but ſimple and true, and in every thing admirable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We ask'd her, if it was therefore neceſſary that every one ſhould leave their Country to be ſav'd?</hi>

All that comes from him <note n="z" place="bottom">Deut. 32. 4.</note> is moſt good and perfect; he created us <note n="a" place="bottom">Gen. 1. 26, 31.</note> in an altogether holy, and perfect ſtate, with an immortal body, and a divine ſoul, ſubject to none but himſelf, having given us a ſpirit enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd to know him, and a power to rule over all the creatures both terreſtrial and infernal; and if he has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd us to aid and ſuccour one another, this is not that he had created us more infirm than any other living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only to the end <note n="b" place="bottom">1 Cor. 12. 25.</note> he might afford us matter for entertaining mutual Charity and Union together, one aſſiſting his Brother out of love, the other being led to love him by the aſſiſtance and benefits which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from him; and thus perpetually to maintain this love by the aliment of the need that we have of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the end we might continue united <note n="c" place="bottom">Job. 17. 22, 27.</note> together, as Jeſus Chriſt is united to his Father.

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid to me;</hi> Believe me, Sir, there is nothing more true; we actually live in the laſt times; and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſo near, that before three years I believe you will ſee the effects of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I could not be perſwaded to believe this, continuing penſive and ſilent; which ſhe perceiving ſaid,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir, the difficulty you find to believe theſe things, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the univerſal darkneſs that is now upon the earth, by which all the world is blinded, and no body ſees where he goes, no more than they who liv'd during the <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs; <note n="f" place="bottom">Exod. 10. 22. 3.</note> which was ſo great, that none could ſtir out of the place in which they were: this was nothing but the outward figure of the inward darkneſs in which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104476:39"/>
men walk at preſent. We do not perceive, that we are fallen into the laſt times; nevertheleſs we may ſee by the lives of men, now that all the ſigns are fallen out which Jeſus Chriſt has foretold, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="bottom">Math. 24. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>that iniquity ſhall be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, and Charity in many ſhall wax cold;</hi> and ſo of the reſt. Who can doubt, that this is not at preſent, when iniquity is ſo great and ſo univerſal, that there is no more faith, <note n="h" place="bottom">Pſal. 119. 126.</note> nor law among men. <note n="i" place="bottom">Mic. 7. 2-6.</note> People ſtudy nothing but to deceive their Neighbour; the Father cannot truſt his Son, nor the Son his Father; the Brother riſes up againſt the Brother; friendſhip is only feign'd; buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is full of deceit and fraud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We ſee nothing but pride and ambition reigning in the hearts of all men: Judges are without equity; Prieſts without ſincerity; Cloyſters fill'd with avarice, and the devout full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, which has been at all times in ſome particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but is at preſent ſo multiply'd, that it poſſeſſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all men in general; and charity is not only waxt cold, but is altogether frozen, and become dead in the hearts of men: So that theſe ſigns of the laſt times are all fully accompliſht. Read, if you pleaſe, the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> where he ſays, <note n="l" place="bottom">2 Tim. 3. 1. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>that in the laſt times there ſhall come men loving their own ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. You will ſee more clearly than the Sun all the marks and ſigns of the laſt times fulfill'd, and perfectly accompliſht. The life of men is the open book in which theſe truths are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and the holy Scriptures are the equitable Judge which pronounces this ſentence. Read, Sir, with attention, they will deliver you from the difficulty you find in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving this; for tho indeed they do not determine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the day of judgment, yet they will make you ſee ſufficiently, that the cheif ſigns which muſt precede it do already appear.</p>
               <p>That no body will believe this, is a moſt certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it; for Jeſus Chriſt ſays, that <note n="m" place="bottom">Math. 24. 37, 38, 39.</note> 
                  <hi>it ſhall be as in the days of</hi> Noah, <hi>they were eating and drinking, and marrying, and giving in marriage, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Even ſo is it at preſent; they take their recreations and pleaſures, heaping up earthly treaſures, building houſes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104476:39"/>
and temples, as if they were to remain here to eternity; while all muſt very ſhortly periſh. And no body will believe it, according to the prediction of Jeſus Chriſt; when he compares theſe laſt times with thoſe of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal deluge. He ſays in St. <hi>Math.</hi> 24. <hi>it will be as in the days of Noah;</hi> adding, <hi>when you ſhall ſee the abomination of deſolation to be in the holy place, flee away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do you not think, Sir, that this abomination is now in the holy place? if Envy were loſt, it might be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in the Cloiſters; if Avarice were dead, it would be reviv'd by the Prieſts; Vain-glory and Pride is no where ſo prevailing, as among the Clergy: in one word, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and all other ſins, abound in the place which ought to be holy.</p>
               <p>What more ſure marks would you have than thoſe which Jeſus Chriſt himſelf has declar'd to us ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Judgment? if you deſire to ſee the Stars fall from Heaven, the Sun to be darken'd, the Moon not to give her Light; all theſe are nothing but material ſigns, which can do no harm to Souls; but ſerve only for outward evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the wrath of God, and to the end that even inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things may feel the terrors of that great day; as the Rocks did, when they were rent at the death of Jeſus Chriſt. This added nothing to his paſſion, nor render'd thoſe who put him to death more criminal; for they were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but inſenſible rocks, without ſouls or reaſon. Even ſo will it be as to the Stars and the other celeſtial bodies; if they change colour, or ſuffer any other alteration, this will not be hurtful to our ſouls which are ſpiritual, and cannot receive any puniſhment by theſe viſible and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Stars; ſo much the rather that theſe ſigns and Stars cannot be underſtood but ſpiritually. For how could the Stars fall from Heaven, ſince the Mathematicians tell us, that one Star alone is ſeven times greater than all the Earth? ſo great a thing cannot fall into one ſo ſmall, for it would not be capable to contain it. And if we take the myſtical ſenſe, calling by the name of <hi>Stars,</hi> perſons luminous in Doctrine, the Doctors and Guides, Prelates, Biſhops, and all thoſe who are plac'd in Dignities, to whom the name of <hi>Stars</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="bottom">Rev. 1. 20.</note> may be appropriated, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lights of the world, this ſign would alſo have at
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104476:40"/>
preſent its ſenſe accompliſht; for we ſee every day ſuch perſons fall from righteouſneſs and truth, who for ſome worldly intereſt, or humane reſpects, fall from the truth of the Goſpel, which is the true heaven of Souls, and wallow in the earth among its riches and pleaſures as ſecular perſons do. In former times how many of thoſe were ſeen, who had their hearts and ſpirits continually to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven! their lives and manners did enlighten all the world, as the Stars of the Firmament; but at preſent they are fallen into the mire of earthly affections: So that it may be truly ſaid, that the Stars are fallen from Heaven, and that the Sun alſo is become without light. For <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the true Sun of Righteouſneſs, cannot any longer appear openly, it is become <note n="o" place="bottom">R. v. 6. 12.</note> black and hateful to all the world, who deſiring to be flatter'd and prais'd <note n="p" place="bottom">2 Tim. 4. 3.</note>, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear the truth, becauſe it reproves the falſhood which now prevails.</p>
               <p>Theſe two ſigns of the <hi>Sun</hi> and of the <hi>Stars,</hi> appear at preſent in their full accompliſhment in the myſtical and inward ſenſe, which is much more than if they did appear in the literal and material ſenſe, for the reaſons above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned: and if the <hi>Moon</hi> be not as yet without light, it will be ſo very ſhortly in the myſtical and perfect ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moon,</hi> is all tranſitory things, which after the manner of the Moon do encreaſe or diminiſh, according to good or bad fortune. Theſe things will loſe their light ſo ſoon as Wars ſhall have deſtroy'd and ruin'd temporal wealth. Then all that pomp and magnificence which ſhines in the Sanctuary will loſe its ſplendor, and will no longer yeild any thing but <note n="q" place="bottom">Rev. 6. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>blood.</hi> Since for Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they will cut the throats of thoſe who are plac'd in the higheſt dignities; ſo that what ſhines and gliſters to day in the Church, will wholly loſe its luſtre and light; and by this means, this Moon will be darken'd. I entreat you to read attentively the 24th Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> it ſpeaks of the preſent time. All the Parables do the ſame. I wiſh I had time and leiſure to explain them to you; you would ſee as well as I, that the Judgment approaches, for all the forerunning ſigns are already come. People do not perceive them, for want of reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeriouſly enough on the holy Scriptures, or upon the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104476:40"/>
inward life of men now adays: they amuſe themſelves with regarding only their outward piety, imagining that there are yet a great many good men, becauſe they appear ſuch: but before God all are corrupted. They reſemble the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which appear beautiful without, and have nothing within but rottenneſs. This is the true ſymbole of the life of Chriſtians now; which God makes me perceive abundantly by his inward light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This fill'd me with aſtoniſhment; and deſiring to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand her more clearly, I ask'd her whether there were not any good men, or true Chriſtians in our days?</hi>

               <p>You would be aſtoniſht, Sir, to ſee what difference there is between the ſight of God, and that of men <note n="t" place="bottom">Prov. 16. 7. Luk. 16. 15.</note>.

They muſt needs have come from the bottom of Hell. They maintain that it is almoſt lawful to commit all ſorts of ſins without offending God; that one may ſwear falſly without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and ſo of the reſt, which you may better know than I; for I am ſtruck with ſo much horror when I hear ſuch

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, let us ſit down here, I will give you a particular account of the original, progreſs, and end of this calamity.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as the firſt Chriſtians began to grow remiſs, the Devil, like a ſtrange Shepherd, ſlipt into the Sheep told of J. Chriſt, where he led aſtray many of his Sheep, who by little and little forſook their true Shepherd, turning away from Righteouſneſs and Truth to follow Iniquity and Lies. The Evangelical Poverty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd by them; ſufferings are become inſupportable to them; humility is diſdain'd. In fine, they would no longer hear the voice of their lawful Shepherd, whoſe word ſerv'd for the nouriſhment of their ſouls; from that time Antichriſt began his Reign, and has ever ſince augmented his Power. He could not endure, that Jeſus Chriſt had brought the word unto men, by following of which, they might be to all Eternity in the Glory of the bleſſed, from which he had been chac'd and baniſht for all Eternity. Therefore he endeavours to make war againſt this word, that he might efface it out of the memory of men, and might thereby hinder their coming to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven. He did not tempt them by evil deeds, or by wicked actions, but by tricks and ſlights, covering his malice under the cloak of piety and reaſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he incites the wicked, his Adherents, to liſt themſelves into the Chriſtian Life, <note n="c" place="bottom">Math. 13. 24.</note> that Tares might be ſown among the good grain. He thruſts in <note n="d" place="bottom">Act. 20 29, 30, 2 Cor. 11. 13.</note> many falſe brethren among the true, that he might by them do his work covertly, and under a pretext of piety; for otherwiſe he would not have been able to gain any thing upon the hearts of thoſe firſt Chriſtians, who being fill'd with the holy Spirit, and burning with the fire <hi>of the Love of God,</hi> he could not have catcht them with evil things, or ſuch as had an appearance of evil.</p>
               <p>He multiples therefore firſt the number of Chriſtians ſo exceedingly, that every one judg'd, it was impoſſible to live any more in common. He moves by humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the hearts of the moſt perfect to yield to a ſeparation, and to conſent that every one ſhould poſſeſs his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular wealth, without forgetting in the mean time Charity, which every one ſhould preſerve in his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104476:42"/>
heart, to ſupply the neceſſities of their brethren. Thus this old Serpent has always colour'd his inventions with piety and reaſons.</p>
               <p>But no ſooner did every one begin to have <hi>thine and mine,</hi> than the brother is forgotten <note n="e" place="bottom">Rev. 2 4</note>, and inſtead of bringing their portion in common, each one began to cheat, as to his own particular; from hence came an excluſion, and exception of perſons; and inſtead of inviting to their table the poor, <note n="f" place="bottom">Luk. 14. 12, 13</note> as J. Chriſt had taught, that they might have their reward in Heaven; they invited their friends, and thoſe who had the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency to invite them again. By which Charity was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminiſht, and Avarice began to gain upon their hearts, every one ſeeking their own intereſt. Aſſoon as the Devil had this door open, whereby to enter into the Church of J. Chriſt, he began to ſtir up therein debates <note n="g" place="bottom">1 Cor. 6. 1-8.</note> and diſſentions, which were contrary unto the peace which J. Chriſt had always taught, ſaying, <note n="h" place="bottom">Joh. 14. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>I give you my peace, my peace I leave you;</hi> and elſewhere, <note n="i" place="bottom">Joh. 13 34, 35</note> 
                  <hi>Love one another: by this ſhall it be known that you are my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Devil alſo ſtifled theſe Doctrines from the beginning; for one ſaid, <note n="l" place="bottom">1 Cor. 1. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>I am of Paul,</hi> and another, <hi>I am of Apollo;</hi> thus vices encreas'd, and Charity was leſſen'd. Behold from what time began no longer true Chriſtians to be found; in proceſs of time yet leſs: and in the end, which is now, there are none. This would be too long to deduce to you in particular. You may, Sir, conceive the reſt ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I told her; That my conception could not reach ſo far; that ſhe muſt declare to me the whole: ſo much the rather that ſhe had promis'd to do it. That it was neither good nor honeſt to be wanting to her promiſe, ſince I would willingly hear it; and the affair did require it. That the Glory of God, and my own particular ſalvation was concern'd in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Seeing it is ſo, Sir, I will proceed; but be not you weary if the diſcourſe be long: Many things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid in a little time. Be you as attentive to hear, as I ſhall be to declare it. Theſe are excellent Truths, which will open your underſtanding, and that of all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104476:43"/>
perſons capable of reaſon. When therefore thoſe firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians became thus remiſs, and the Devil had made a breach upon the hearts of the moſt part, to oppoſe the Doctrine of J. Chriſt, ſome of thoſe who were not yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together perverted, ſet themſelves to make ſome reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church, leſt it ſhould become more corrupt, for many errors and Sects had crept into it, every one deſiring to believe and practice after his own mode. This gave beginning to all ſorts of Hereſies: for as long as the union of true Chriſtians did laſt, <note n="m" place="bottom">Act 4 32.</note> all were but <hi>one heart, and one will in J. Chriſt;</hi> living all under the Goſpel ſimplicity. But when once they aſſembled learned Men, and introduc'd Schools, there was nothing to be ſeen but diſputes and controverſies. The Sciences have brought in ſo many queſtions little neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it had been more deſirable they had never been introduc'd: for inſtead of putting an end to errors, they have rather raiſed new ones. How many Hereſies have proceeded from the learned of the Church? a <hi>Calvin,</hi> a <hi>Luther</hi> in our time, and ſo many others before.</p>
               <p>Truly, Sir, in thinking to reform the Church by the learned, they have rather deformed it; the doctrine of Jeſus requiring rather humility of heart, than great Philoſophy: for the ſimplicity of the Goſpel has in it more true wiſdom <note n="n" place="bottom">Pſ. 119. 98, 99, 100, 104, 130.</note>, than all the Doctors of the world can acquire in all the Schools of the Univerſities. The Learning of Men has ſtifled the Wiſdom of the holy Spirit; and ſince they have choſen the learned unto the Helm of the Church, they have thruſt the Saints from it: ſeeing none have ſince that been admitted into the Government and Authority of the Church but the great men and the learned: the little ones <note n="o" place="bottom">Math. 4. 25. 1 Pet. 5. 5.</note> to whom Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <hi>he gives his Grace,</hi> have been rejected and render'd uſeleſs. Hereby in proceſs of time there have been ſo few true Chriſtians, the number of which has always diminiſht, according as the learning of men has multiplied.</p>
               <p>For if thoſe learned men had obſerv'd and taught the Doctrine of the Goſpel ſimply as it is ſet down, as the Apoſtles did, the Church had continu'd in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104476:43"/>
the flower of its youth; but ſince they would needs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and varniſh it with humane doctrines, they have quite disfigur'd it. Its beautiful countenance had no need of ornament. Nothing can amend the work of God, but may indeed ſpoil it, as they have done by ſo many various and unprofitable queſtions, as concerning Grace, Free-will, the immaculate Conception of the Virgin, and ſo many other things little neceſſary to our Salvation, with ſo many new ways and devotions to be ſav'd; ſo many caſes about ſins, ſo many circumſtances concerning vertues, which ſerve rather to hinder than advance them. It were better to ſtudy not to ſin, than to know its degrees. It is far better to walk ſuitably to the Grace of God, than to ſtudy to know how he gives it to us; and to have vertue and devotion, than to learn ſo many means to attain to it. There is no doubt but all theſe buildings made with mens hands have ſhaken the Edifice of the Church of Chriſt, which the Spirit of God had built by the miniſtery of the ſame J. Chriſt. Men, who are wholly ignorant, would needs correct and reform the work of God, which was ſo perfect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht; by which they have ruin'd themſelves, and all like unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I entreated, that ſhe would explain her mind a little more at length concerning this queſtion, and tell me in order, if it was not expedient to oppoſe the errors which had crept in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the holy doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt? If it was not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to call the learned, that they might overcome by reaſons and arguments thoſe falſe brethren, who ſet themſelves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to oppoſe that doctrine, to the end they might ſtifle and blaſt it, even in its Cradle?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She anſwers:</hi> Truly, Sir, it had been much better to have oppos'd thoſe errors by deſpiſing them, than by diſputing againſt them; becauſe theſe diſputes have taught many the errors which they would have been ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, who might have continu'd in their evangelical ſimplicity; whereas theſe diſputes have made many grow remiſs by the ſame errors, which being ſpread have cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated weak minds. It had been far better to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and cut off thoſe erroneous perſons, than to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their opinion by diſputes. There was no need to fear, that the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt would have been ſunk by all the errors that could be rais'd up againſt it,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104476:44"/>
ſeeing its Author has promisd <note n="p" place="bottom">Math. 16. 18</note> that it ſhall never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, however it be oppos'd and attack'd; which we ſee by experience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For tho the Devil and his Adherents, have always endeavour'd to obſcure and defile this holy Doctrine, yet it has continu'd in writing pure and entire in our hands to this day, and will continue ſo even to the end of the world. This is the greateſt miracle that God has done upon earth, after men have invented ſo many gloſſes and opinions to contradict it, and the life and manners even of thoſe, who are call'd the People of God, are ſo different from this Doctrine, that yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it ſubſiſts in its integrity, in the hands and power of thoſe who raze out, and efface it by their manners and actions. If it were not upheld by miracles, how often would it have been ſtifled by the wiſdom of the learned, who (if it were in their power) would never ſuffer a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which ſo directly reproves their lives and manners. In which God ſhews his almighty power, that all men who ſhall be born upon the earth, may have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to this fountain of living water, which is the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and that no body may pretend ignorance, under pretext that there are different, or new doctrines and errors; for he who has a deſire to ſearch, has alſo the means to find the real truth, written in the holy Goſpel, or the reſt of the holy Scriptures. It was not therefore neceſſary to maintain it by ſo many diſputes, which Jeſus Chriſt never <note n="q" place="bottom">Math. 12. 19.</note> taught us, either by word, or by deed. Men could not deſtroy that which God would build. It had been more expedient to ſtrengthen and comfort the faithful, than to diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the erroneous who were raiſed up only by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: they would have periſhed of themſelves; for all that is nor built by God, ſhall be deſtroyed. A ſmall number of faithful Believers were far better than ſo great a multitude of Chriſtians in appearance, who do nothing but debate and diſpute without poſſeſſing true living faith. The rotten members corrupt thoſe which are yet ſound. The <note n="r" place="bottom">Jam. 4 7.</note> Devil is never ſooner overcome, than by deſpiſing him, for then he knows not how to take hold of the good; but diſputes and debates furniſh him with diverſe weapons to attack and overcome them <note n="s" place="bottom">Jam. 3. 14. 15, 16.</note>.</p>

                  <hi>I Admired all this ſo powerful diſcourſe, deſiring always to hear more.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, it is very rare to find a learned Saint, or at leaſt one who becomes holy by learning; for all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdom is fooliſhneſs before God. All the Saints are certainly wiſe, but few learned men are Saints: I do not mean, that there have not been ſome Saints who were engag'd in the Government of the Church, as St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and others: but I cannot believe that a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſound, when it hath the Leproſy in any of its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <note n="t" place="bottom">Levit. 13. 2, 3.</note>. The whole body of the Church was ſound, when to be an Apoſtle, or Miniſter of the Church, 'twas only requir'd to embrace an evangelical life; for all the rotten members were cut off from it, or corrected, or indeed they withdrew of themſelves, not being able to endure ſo great a ſanctity, that reprov'd them in all their manners. St. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="bottom">1 Cor. 5 11.</note> forbids Chriſtians ſo much as to eat with ſinners; behold how he cuts off the rotten mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: and elſewhere it is ſaid, <note n="x" place="bottom">Mat. 18. 17.</note>

                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Math. 27. 5.</note> to go and hang himſelf: and a great many others who withdrawing themſelves, gave occaſion to Jeſus Chriſt to ask the other Diſciples, <note n="b" place="bottom">

                  <hi>If they would go alſo?</hi> to which they reply'd; <hi>and whither ſhall we go Lord? thou haſt the words of eternal life.</hi> Theſe three means were capable of upholding the holy Church in its Integrity and Holineſs, as Jeſus Chriſt had eſtabliſht it; and did himſelf obſerve theſe rules, that is, that the erroneous ſhould be rejected and deſpis'd, or elſe corrected for their errors; or otherwiſe permitted to go out, and withdraw themſelves: but theſe new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors have found out, as a more perfect mean for the upholding of the Church, to admit only the wiſe and learned to the government of it, that the erroneous might be oppos'd, and overcome by diſputes. Is the invention and wiſe foreſight of theſe men, more perfect than the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and doing of God? Can that eternal wiſdom be ignorant, that Learning was neceſſary for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church? Was it neceſſary that men ſhould change, reform, or perfect what Jeſus Chriſt had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht, to wit, that the government of his Church ſhould appertain to thoſe, who have given evidence of the love they bear him? for this cauſe he puts the queſtion to St. <hi>Peter</hi> thrice <note n="c" place="bottom">Joh. 21. 15, 16, 17.</note>, to know if he lov'd him, before he made him head of his Church. On the contrary, men are more inquiſitive to know, if any Miniſter of the Church be great and learned, than if he love God. This is a renverſement of ſpirit which has ſeiz'd upon men, ſince they would needs be govern'd by the wiſe of the world, and they have deſpis'd the holy ſimplicity of the Goſpel. This miſchief could not be brought in by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty; it muſt needs proceed from the malice of the Devil. Man indeed thro frailty, might backſlide, and follow Jeſus Chriſt at a little farther diſtance than he had taught him; but could not arrive to ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of wickedneſs, as directly to oppoſe, and deſpiſe his doctrine and practice.

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> I perceive, Sir, that you take for Antichriſt a humane body, which is to be born by the operation of the Devil. I believe, that this will fall out at the end of the world, yea that he is already born: but I make very ſmall reckoning of this viſible and bodily Antichriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can ſeduce none, but thoſe who deſire to be ſo. He ſhall be known for a wicked one, becauſe he will deal harſhly with thoſe who yield obedience to him; which will occaſion Martyrs, and make many good men to be ſav'd, by the reſiſtance they will make againſt him. Theſe evils are not terrible but to the faint-hearted, who are not train'd up to ſufferings: but I reckon this inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſpiritual Antichriſt, of whom I have ſpoken to you, to be far more pernicious; becauſe he ſeduceth the well-meaning, under the appearance of a falſe good; this is much more to be fear'd.

               <p>
                  <hi>I told her; that I had never heard of this ſpiritual Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; that I would willingly know who he is, and what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is between him who is to come in the fleſh, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the world, and him who crept into the Church from its beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She anſwer'd:</hi> Sir, this Antichriſt is the Devil, who from the creation of the world made war againſt men, that he might make them forſake God, and their own Salvation; for theſe ends he made <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> fall into ſin, he tempted <hi>Cain</hi> to kill his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> and is the Author of all the other evils and ſins which have ſince come upon the earth.

                  <hi>the Old Serpent,</hi> becauſe he has ſhed his infernal venom upon the earth from the beginning of the world. But ſince he knew that God ſo lov'd the world, that he has ſent his Son to inſtruct and ſave it, he has redoubled his rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt men, and by new ſubtilties has endeavour'd to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Salvation, that with himſelf he might draw them into his own miſerable wretched Condemnation. But perceiving, that the word of God was ſent to them from heaven, not by voices, thunders, or burning buſhes, but by a ſenſible and viſible body, which the ſame God had taken for this end, that he might teach them palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by an Organ, like to their humane nature: the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil perceiving, that he could not any longer have ſuch hold of men, becauſe of the vertue of that word which was able to create the univerſe, he deviſeth to appear like the Son of God; and after the manner of apes endeavour to imitate his actions, covering himſelf with Sheeps skins, tho he be the true ravenous Wolf. He ſlipt from the very beginning into the Church which Jeſus Chriſt was going to build, that he might oppoſe and contradict his word under pious pretexts, and covered his malice with hypocriſie, that he might the better contradict and oppoſe the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt; and from thence he has truly born the name of Antichriſt, and there never will be any other Antichriſt, but this ſame Devil, who was formerly call'd the Old Serpent. There is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between him, who ſlipt into the Church in its beginning, and him who ſhall be incarnated towards the

end of the world: for it is always the ſame Devil, who only takes different methods, that he may the better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coy men, according to the various occurrences of time. He began his Reign from the birth of the Holy Church, and has always gradually advanc'd it, by continuing ſtill to oppoſe the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, till he has effac'd it out of the memory, almoſt of all men, which we may perceive in this age, wherein the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt is no more in uſe, than if it had never been brought into the world, which makes me believe, that he is now born<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince he has full dominion over the hearts of men, who inſtead of perſevering in the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, have inſenſibly follow'd the Doctrine of this Devil, and of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> are become <hi>Antichriſtians:</hi> for who does not ſee at preſent, that Wars, Diſcords, and Diſſentions, reign among Chriſtians, inſtead of the <hi>Peace</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, I cannot doubt that this Antichriſt in the fleſh is born already, for the wickedneſs of the world is riſen to the higheſt degree that it can come to, and the Devil has gain'd an inward dominion over the hearts of all men: not that wickedneſs is manifeſtly at the higheſt degree in the judgment of men, for it will appear more clearly when they ſhall commit all ſort of ſins publickly, without being afraid of any; the evil will ſeem then greater, but it will be leſs in the ſight of God, for it will then be no more accompanied and diſguiſed with Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, as it is at preſent: The Devil having gain'd the hearts of ill men, will remain no longer conceal'd. He is deſirous to reign publickly and openly aſſoon as he can for his greater Glory. As long as there were here and there ſome good Souls, he kept himſelf hid, to the end he might gain them: but at preſent he can ſo well diſguiſe his malice, that all ſerve him, the wicked with good will as his hired Servants, and the good ſerve him by conſtraint as his Slaves. From hence I infer, that the time of his Reign is come, and that he will appear very ſhortly viſibly in the fleſh.</p>

Thoſe are eſteem'd good men who do often frequent the Churches and Sacraments, and are preſent at the publick Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and they who do ſo, believe themſelves to be good men, and to live well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but believe me, Sir, if this be not done in the true Spirit of Chriſtianity, theſe are all but

                  <hi>I Deſir'd to be ſatisfy'd concerning all theſe points of good works which I had obſerv'd to be yet in uſe among thoſe who profeſs to be good men, to ſee whither the Devil would produce ſuch operations in his Adherents. I ask'd her firſt, If it was not a good work to go often to the Church, or to its Solemnities?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She anſwer'd:</hi> It is very good to go to Church to hear the Word of God, ſince Jeſus Chriſt himſelf went thither to teach it; for there is diſtributed (or at leaſt ought to be) that word which gives food or nouriſhment to the ſouls of the faithful. But I pray you, Sir, ſays ſhe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect a little ſeriouſly with me on the way of going to Church, and of teaching the Word of God there which is now obſerv'd, and ſee if you will not be oblig'd to confeſs,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104476:48"/>
that by what is now done in Churches, the Devil receives much more honour than God: therefore he incites his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents to go thither often, and the Miniſters to perform the Solemnities there frequently. They go to Church out of cuſtom, and being there, they behave themſelves even as they do in profane places. The Solemnities there are ſo vain, that they ſerve rather to ſatisfie the ſenſes than to move devotion. Among a thouſand perſons who follow Proceſſions, you will ſcarce find one who has his heart lifted up to God!</p>
               <p>Sermons are made more out of vanity, and heard more out of curioſity, than to profit by them. Behold the Theater of the World at preſent, judge now, whither all theſe things can paſs for good works in the ſight of God, and if the Devil has not ground to excite them to theſe actions, from whence he derives ſo much his advantages. When once he could perſwade men, that a Chriſtian Life conſiſts in outward actions, he perverted all the good; ſo that they do rather follow him than Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe theſe viſible and outward things make a ſtronger impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the natural ſenſes, than thoſe ſpiritual things which Jeſus Chriſt has taught and commanded us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I felt in my ſoul that this was true; but deſiring to learn more, I ſaid to her; that for thoſe who apply themſelves to their Neighbours, as to viſit the poor and the ſick, to own the quarrel of the good, to quiet and appeaſe ſtrife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; that theſe works could not come from the ſuggeſtion of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She reply'd:</hi> All theſe things are good, if they were done in the ſpirit of Charity, and purely for the Love of God; but that this was ſo rare, that ſhe had not as yet found ſo much as one perſon in the world, who perform'd theſe works purely for God: That there was thro all a mixture either of vain-glory, or of ſelf-ſatisfaction, or of reſpect to the creatures, whereby the Devil could lay hold on them, and draw his advantages from them, tho the things were good in themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he might indeed incite them to viſit the poor and the ſick, out of ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſatisfaction; and alſo to aſſiſt the good, and to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify quarrels and contentions; all this may be by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of the Devil: who ſeeing a perſon deſirous to pleaſe God, he will endeavour to divert him by good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal actions, which he will cauſe him to multiply in ſuch ſort, as that they ſhall leave him neither leiſure, nor
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104476:49"/>
reſt, and recollection to think on the inward life which a true Chriſtian ought to put in practice. The Devil will have profit enough by diverting thus a ſoul from its own Salvation, in permitting them to do good to others as to the body or temporal things, which uſually bring no glory to God, but ſerve for humane conveniencies; and thus he gains all the good, who not being aware of all his arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, ſuffer themſelves to be led by this Enemy at his pleaſure, (without knowing him) under the colour of a ſeeming good; for otherwiſe he could not deceive them, nor gain them to himſelf; as he has done all the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I trembled to hear ſuch ſevere diſcourſe; which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſeem'd to me to be true, for my underſtanding was open'd by her words. I took the boldneſs to ask her, how it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that God ſhould give ſo much power to the Devil; and how his Goodneſs could permit the good to be thus ſeduc'd and deceiv'd by this Enemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She reſolutely ſaid:</hi> Sir, it is not God who gives this power to the Devil, but our ſins themſelves make him ſo powerful. The Devil is as a chain'd Dog, who can go no farther than we lengthen the chain to him, and <note n="r" place="bottom">Jam. 4. 7.</note> cannot bite us if we do not approach him. <note n="s" place="bottom">Luke 10. 18, 19, 20.</note> God has given us power over the Devil, and has not given the Devil power over us; for he can never do an evil thing, and it would be a great evil, if he had given the Devil power to hurt men. He will permit him indeed (that we may be tried and purg'd) to tempt and wound our body; but he can never take hold of our ſoul without our conſent. 'Tis very ill done to utter this Calumny of God, that he permits the Devil to hinder our Salvation. This is for want of light; for the Devil cannot ſeduce us if we continue faithful to God. We are his Children, and the Devil is his Enemy: if he has ſeduc'd all Chriſtians, as I was ſaying, it is thro their fault. They are not ignorant that theſe changes and innovations cannot come from God, who never changes; and tho theſe deceits of the Devil are done under a pretext of good, yet they may abundantly ſee, that they are not conformable to what Jeſus Chriſt has taught us. It is therefore our own fault, when the Devil deceives us, ſince we do not perſevere in the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, which is always to be found,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104476:49"/>
if we had a ſincere deſire to ſearch after it. Does God act againſt his goodneſs when he permits us to fall into the error which we will needs follow? it would be rather againſt his Juſtice if he ſhould hinder us from it, after that he has given us a free will, and a free choice.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>To which ſhe reply'd:</hi> This is very ill ſaid, Sir. It is an ill explain'd phraſe, for God <note n="z" place="bottom">Pſ. 138 8. Wiſd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11. 24, 25, 26.</note> never forſakes the work of his own hands: we appertain to him in all reſpects, becauſe he created us, he maintains us, and we have no good thing but what we have receiv'd from him; and if he forſook us, we ſhould fall into the <hi>Nothing</hi> from whence he has taken us. A Father, or a Mother, who have debauch'd Children, cannot forſake them, nor hinder them from being theirs: but they may let them wander after their own wills, when they will not follow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of their Father, nor yield obedience to him. They ceaſe not notwithſtanding to be their Children, which would appear evidently, if they ſhould repent of their debauchery, and return to a ſubmiſſion to their Father.

God is infinitely more good <note n="b" place="bottom">Mat 7. 11.</note> than thoſe evil na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Fathers: How then could he forſake his Children whom he has ſo much lov'd? People deceive themſelves in many things, Sir, concerning the works of God.

Thus they look upon God as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſubject to diverſe paſſions of love and hatred, of good or ill will. Truly, Sir, I bewail ſo great a blindneſs among men.

things wnich are moſt agreeable to you, for it ſeems to me you have ſome intereſt in this diſpute. But ſince I have promis'd to anſwer all your queſtions, I ſhall do it truly and in ſimplicity, according to my meaſure of light, without reſpect of perſons, confiding in your goodneſs, that you will pardon the freedom which I muſt uſe in this diſcourſe. As to the firſt Queſtion, <hi>Whether the opinion of St.</hi> Auguſtin <hi>and his Followers, is better than that of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries in this matter?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hold (comparing the one with the other) that that of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is the better, or to ſpeak more properly, the leſs dangerous, becauſe the deſign of it ſeems to be, to perſwade us, that all grace comes immediately from God, that we may preſume nothing of our ſelves; whereas the contrary opinion rather incites man to attribute grace to himſelf, as if it depended on his own will, which would not excite in us ſo much humility as the firſt perſwaſion, which for this reaſon is leſs dangerous. But I believe the minds of neither of theſe Doctors were ſufficiently purifyd to perceive clearly the truth of this queſtion; and that their Underſtandings were not free of the Ideas of their acquired Learning for receiving of this Light of Grace, which is not receiv'd but by the ſame Grace, which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeured when our own ſenſe is in the leaſt mixt with it. It is neceſſary <note n="g" place="bottom">Pſ. 4. 5.</note> that all the faculties of our ſoul ſhould be ſtill that we may receive the pure light of the holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>And to anſwer, as <hi>to what I believe concerning Grace;</hi> I will tell you, Sir, it comes immediately from God <note n="h" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 6.</note>, without any merit or co-operation of ours; for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not merit nor co-operate before we have a being. <hi>Nothing</hi> is not capable of being able to deſire or co-operate with Grace: It muſt needs be given us thro the ſole mercy of God, as it was in creating us, and drawing us out of Nothing. It was his will and pleaſure to create us after his own Image and Likeneſs, and to make us Deities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon him, that <note n="i" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 31.</note> 
                  <hi>he might take his delight with us.</hi> The Center <note n="l" place="bottom">4. 23. 23. 26.</note> of our Soul being the place of his Reſidence. He has adorned <note n="m" place="bottom">2 Pet. 1. 3, 4.</note> us with all the Graces that might make us love him; and whereas Love cannot
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104476:51"/>
be perfect and accompliſht, unleſs the beloved give their free conſent to the Lover; therefore he <note n="n" place="bottom">Eccleſ. 15. 14-17.</note> created us altogether free to conſent to that Love, for he would not have our conſent thro <note n="o" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 3. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29 1. <hi>Jer</hi> 30. 21. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 67.</note> force nor out of neceſſity, but thro a pure deſire of good will on his ſide.

But inſtead of applying ſo many graces ſo freely beſtow'd upon us, to love him, we have made uſe of them to offend him. Nevertheleſs, this was not capable of making God change the Love which he bare to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or to take from them the Graces which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready beſtow'd upon them. He continues unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his benefits, and could not repent <note n="q" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 29.</note> of having adorn'd man with ſo many Graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he continues to give, even after his ſin. Seeing they were not beſtow'd on him for his merits, neither are they taken away from him for his demerits; for God has no need of man: <note n="r" place="bottom">Job 35. 5, 6.</note> if he be righteous or wicked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is for himſelf: but God reſpecting always himſelf, imparts ſtill the influences of grace to the wicked <note n="s" place="bottom">Math. 5. 44, 45.</note>, as the Sun ſends his Beams on the Dunghil, as well as on the Diamond: theſe different ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects not being able to alter or change him. Even ſo man receives always grace from God on his part, <note n="t" place="bottom">2 Cor. 6. 1.</note> but it is not always operative becauſe of the hinderances which ſin raiſes againſt it; for if God did not continually give his grace to man he could not ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p>We ſee by experience, that the wicked has all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for his life, as well as the righteous, tho the one employs them to bleſs God, and the other to curſe him. The Sun ſhines upon the wicked, as well as upon the good, without exception of perſons.</p>
               <p>The grace of God is given to every one, tho they uſe it differently. Nevertheleſs, we cannot attribute to God, the <note n="u" place="bottom">Iſ. 5. 3, 4.</note> want of his grace, but to our own wickedneſs, which oppoſes it. Grace <note n="x" place="bottom">Eph. 2. 8, 9.</note> therefore comes immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God, and nothing comes from man but ſin only,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104476:52"/>
which <note n="y" place="bottom">Iſ. 59. 1, 2.</note> hinders the operation of this grace, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him unable to co-operate with it, not being able to enjoy grace and ſin both together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her: If ſinners might recover Grace as oft as they pleas'd; and if there needed nothing but their will to forſake their ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> No, Sir, Grace is not in their power, and they cannot recover it <note n="z" place="bottom">Prov. 1. 26, 28. Heb. 12. 17.</note> according to their pleaſure. It is called <hi>GRACE,</hi> becauſe it is a thing freely given: it is not a debt or obligation, which may be conſtrain'd, for it comes of the ſole mercy of God, and not of our deſires, or merits. Neither does it depend upon the will <note n="a" place="bottom">Rom 9. 16.</note> of a ſinner to leave his ſin.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Said to her: Since the mercy of God is ſo great, how did you declare to me heretofore, that you deſpaired of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of almoſt all the world?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> It is true, Sir, I am yet of the ſame opinion, and I cannot ſee how one ſoul can enter into Paradice, after the manner they live at preſent. I ſee that its gate is ſhut, and that no body enters in any longer by it, for Jeſus Chriſt ſays <note n="i" place="bottom">Joh. 14. 6.</note> that he is the way; and I do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any body that goes or walks in him, or even that ſeeks him. Since learned men have taught another way of Salvation than he, every one <note n="l" place="bottom">2 Pet. 2. 1, 2.</note> follows them, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they do well in believing them, becauſe they make themſelves be called the Church, which if it were true, they could not teach otherwiſe than Jeſus Chriſt has done, ſince he and his Church <note n="m" place="bottom">Coloſ. 1. 24.</note> are the ſame thing. As Jeſus Chriſt is no other but the Word of God, even ſo the Church is no other but the ſame <note n="n" place="bottom">2 Cor. 3. 3.</note> Word: It was ſent from Heaven <note n="o" place="bottom">Joh. 6. 33, 35.</note> covered and wrapt up in the humane body, which is called Jeſus Chriſt, which God form'd for theſe ends, that he might convey this word, which is his Spouſe, into the bodies of all Chriſtians, and that all might be <note n="p" place="bottom">17. 17, 21.</note> but one with Jeſus Chriſt, as he is one with his Father. There is nothing but this word <note n="q" place="bottom">15 3. 1 Pet. 1 23</note> that can make the Church, which is not tied to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> or that of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but only to ſouls which poſſeſs this Doctrine. Theſe only are the Church. Neither office, nor habit, nor dignity, make the Church, but the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus Chriſt only <note n="r" place="bottom">Joh. 8 31.</note>; out of which there can be no Salvation: for it is the only one, ſent from God, and will abide always without any change or mutation <note n="s" place="bottom">Math. 24 35.</note>. Let all the men of the world ſtudy to invent as many

reaſons, means, and controverſies as they will, they can never change or alter the Doctrine of Jeſus <note n="t" place="bottom">Gal. 1. 8, 9.</note> Chriſt, it will always be ſuch, as it was in the beginning, and ſhall be even to the end, without any change or mutation whatſoever. It is an error to believe, and damnation to follow any other thing, how good and holy ſoever it doth appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her; That it was true there was no Salvation out of the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, but there were yet many ſouls in the world who would follow it, and that thoſe who would contradict it are call'd Hereticks, and are cut off from the Church; but for the Pope, the Cardinals, Biſhops, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, all the reſt of the Clergy of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, they believed that they had the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Keys of Paradice, and the Way of Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> There is yet ſome light in your Soul, Sir, ſince you know that there is no Salvation out of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus Chriſt: but to ſay, that there are yet in the world Souls, who deſire to follow it, I have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd the contrary, having travell'd in diverſe Countries, and as it were by the permiſſion of God, I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with different perſons, who were eſteem'd holy and vertuous, but I never obſerv'd any who follow'd truly the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. Every one abounded in his own ſenſe, and were wedded to their particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, without an entire dependance on the will of God, or the denial of their own will, <note n="u" place="bottom">Luke 14. 26, 27.</note> which is the foundation of a Chriſtian Life; from which the heads of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church are far removed, ſince they forbid Chriſtians to read the words of Jeſus Chriſt, which is <note n="x" place="bottom">Amos 8. 11, 12.</note> the nouriſhment of Souls. They cannot open Paradice by any other mean, nor promiſe Salvation to any (except in words) but by obſervance of the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. Mens blindneſs is ſo great in this point, that it can no longer be ſeen where the true Church it at preſent, becauſe they place faith in words, hope in preſumption, and charity in gold and ſilver: and they make of the Church of God which is ſpiritual, a Church of wood, of ſtone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of mettals, which are material; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, they believe that they are in the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that they follow the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt!
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104476:53"/>
which is the greateſt error that ever was in the world; and therefore I fear there ſhall be ſo few Souls at preſent ſaved, becauſe few, or none, follow in deed, this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and there is nothing more true than that without doing this, we cannot be ſaved, as you alſo acknowledge. One muſt have very little judgment, if he do not perceive, that in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the Cardinals, Biſhops, Paſtors, Monks, and religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and all the Clergy in general, do not live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, nor in the primitive ſpirit of Chriſtianity. <note n="y" place="bottom">Math. 5. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>If the Salt have loſt its ſavour, wherewith ſhall the fleſh be ſalted?</hi> that is the common people cannot be preſerved ſound, when their Heads and Governours are fallen away and corrupted. <note n="z" place="bottom">Jer. 23. 15.</note> This is the cauſe and the origine of all the corruption of the world, and that its evil is remedileſs: when a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is poyſon'd, it cannot cure the Diſeaſe, but rather make it worſe, as we ſee the world is declining daily, yea every moment, to the worſe. Thoſe who are cut off from the ſaid Church, and whom they call Hereticks, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do ſo great miſchief to the true Church, as theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do who call themſelves the Fathers and Doctors of the Church, tho they are fallen away from the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt: ſince no well-meaning perſons will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Hereticks; they rather have an abhorrence of them: but even well-diſpoſed perſons, leaning to the direction of thoſe who are intruſted with the ſpiritual government of the people, do inſenſibly commit infinite evils, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the direction of theſe Doctors, while they do not lead them according to the words of Jeſus Chriſt; for their own doctrines cannot but poyſon the moſt pious Souls. This is a Leproſy which has infected the whole Church of God, which is tranſmitted from one to another, ſo far as that there are no longer any ſound members to be found. I bewail only thoſe who deſire to follow the truth, for they know not where to find it; for it is not no longer where it ought to be. He who believes the contrary, is deceiv'd; and he who ſays it, deceives others. Jeſus Chriſt is the Truth alone <note n="a" place="bottom">Joh. 14. 6.</note>.</p>

                  <p>Of Remiſſion of Sins: of Confeſſion, and how it is abuſed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Ask'd her; if ſhe did not believe in the Remiſſion of ſins; ſince ſhe maintained ſo confidently, that few, or none, will be ſaved, and that Paradice is ſhut?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She anſwer'd:</hi> Yes, Sir, I believe in the Remiſſion of ſins. In that conſiſts my joy, and my hope. I have even told you before, that aſſoon as the ſinner knocks, God opens to him. He needs but turn to him, to obtain the pardon of his ſins, <note n="b" place="bottom">Iſ. 1. 16, 17, 18.</note> how great and numerous ſoever they may have been. It is not for want of mercy in God, that I deſpair of the Salvation of men, but becauſe they will not be converted, becauſe the moſt part do not, or will not know their ſins. I have more hopes of the converſion of groſs ſinners, than of perſons who make a profeſſion of vertue; becauſe of the preſumption of their Salvation, grounded upon their own Righteouſneſs, they cannot be ſo readily converted, as a ſinner who knows his evil life; he is more ready to repent of it, than they who believe that they live well, tho it be not true. It is of theſe that Jeſus Chriſt ſays, that he <note n="c" place="bottom">Math. 9. 13.</note> came not to call the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous but ſinners to repentance. So many Souls will be miſtaken at death, who think they are certain of their Salvation, whereas they are very far from it, taking falſe vertue for the true. It is in this that Jeſus Chriſt ſays, that <note n="d" place="bottom">Luk. 16. 15. Joh. 16. 8.</note> he will judge of Righteouſneſs. He cannot judge nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Righteouſneſs, which is truly ſuch before him; but he ſpeaks of our Righteouſneſs which is righteous in our judgment, and in that of men. Such Righteouſneſs will be condemn'd of God, becauſe they were not righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before his piercing eyes, as they appear'd unto the eyes of men, and to our own. Behold why I ſaid that Paradice is ſhut, becauſe I cannot diſcern at preſent, true Righteouſneſs in the vertuous.</p>

                  <hi>I ask her: Whether ſins were pardon'd by the Sacrament of Pennance, which is the Confeſſion of ſins to the Prieſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, there are ſo many abuſes committed by this Sacrament, that I believe more ſins are committed by it than pardoned; for people believe, that to obtain the pardon of their ſins it is enough that they declare them to the Prieſt, and upon this perſwaſion they take little care to amend them: neither alſo can they have great contrition for a thing which is ſo eaſily effac'd, by the ſmall confuſion that they have in declaring their ſins to the Prieſt.

               <p>It was a great unhappineſs did then befal the world, Sir, when the Church taught, that to live well and to be ſaved a man muſt confeſs often. The Catechiſms which they teach the Children of Chriſtians, are ſtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Every body teaches the doing of what is ordain'd by the Church in this caſe. I would willingly ask, if this be not to teach indirectly, that a man muſt in frequently, when they teach, that he muſt confeſs often, ſince Confeſſion does always ſuppoſe ſin? He cannot confeſs frequently without ſinning frequently; for they who have not ſinn'd, have nothing to confeſs, nor can they do it frequently without an expreſs commiſſion of ſins, that they may have matter of confeſſing frequently. I believe Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors have invented theſe multitudes of Confeſſions, that thereby they may draw the people to themſelves, inſtead of leading them to Chriſt. A true Shepherd-takes more pains to cure his Seeep, and does not neglect its Scab, that he may be oblig'd to take it often in his lap, as theſe ſtrange
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104476:55"/>
Shepherds do, who love rather to draw to themſelves ſouls continually laden with ſins, than to ſend them to God by the ſpirit of true repentance. This is an error which was introduc'd into the Church by the cunning of that pernicious Antichriſt, that he might withdraw the ſouls of ſinners from Chriſt, who calls them, ſaying, <note n="e" place="bottom">Math. 11. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt;</hi> and to lead them to men who ſlatter and keep them in their ſins, under a falſe promiſe of their Salvation; for there is none but God only <note n="f" place="bottom">Iſa, 43. 25.</note> who can pardon ſin; and men, who pretend to be in Gods ſtead, and do not obſerve his word, are Seducers, ſince his word only can pardon ſins. It is true it was transferred to men with the ſame vertue which it had in the body of Jeſus Chriſt; but this was only as long as they ſhould continue to perſevere faithfully in that word, and no otherwiſe. The <note n="h" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5. 19, 20.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did all their works by vertue of this word, and not by their own authority. Theſe Confeſſors do the quite contrary, remitting ſins according to their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and will; and inſtead of ſaying to ſinners, <note n="i" place="bottom">Joh. 5. 14. 8. 11.</note> go, and ſin no more, as Jeſus Chriſt did to the perſons whoſe ſins he pardon'd, as to the Paralitick, and to the Woman taken in Adultery; theſe Confeſſors ſay, come again to Confeſſion, and <note n="l" place="bottom">2 Pet. 2. 19.</note> we will ſtill abſolve you.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <note n="m" place="bottom">Math. 5. 23, 24.</note> If thou haſt a quarrel with thy Brother, leave thy Offering, and go be reconcil'd with thy Brother; and theſe Confeſſors with a word ſend them quickly to the Altar without Reconciliation, Do they not act directly in oppoſition to Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her, that I had never ſearcht ſo deep in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but that I would willingly know, if it be not of Confeſſion that Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks, when he ſays,</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="bottom">Math. 5. 23, 24.</note>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She reply'd:</hi> Sir, take heed; this light is not from men. I never ſpoke ſo openly to any body; but I ſee plainly that you will profit by it. To give a ſolution to your firſt<note place="bottom">(<hi>g</hi>) <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 7.</note>

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:104476:55"/>
queſtion, Whether Jeſus Chriſt did not ſpeak touching Confeſſion, <hi>all that you ſhall do on earth, I will do in heaven?</hi> this is certainly as to the remitting and retaining of ſins; but it is not after the manner that men under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, for God never gave this authority to men in themſelves, but to his Church, which is nothing elſe but his word; and therefore this authority does reſide always where this word reſides. <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo many other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who wrought ſo many Wonders in the world, perform'd them by vertue of this word, and not by their own authority and power. They went always to God, to know what they ought to do; and they wrought according to his will, in no ways according to their own: for man has nothing of himſelf but an impotence inſtead of power; but the word of God has power in all places where it reſides, even tho it ſhould reſide in a wicked ſoul. Therefore ſometimes, even the beaſts have wrought miracles. By vertue of this word, the heavens and the earth <note n="p" place="bottom">Heb. 1. 3.</note> do ſubſiſt. It has the ſame vertue to remit and retain ſins in the bodies of Confeſſors, that it had in the natural and humane body of Jeſus Chriſt; for it is always the ſame which proceeds from Almighty God. The only difficulty that I find is to know, whether it can ſtill reſide in the Confeſſors at preſent, who do not follow the rules of this holy doctrine. God has indeed promis'd to pardon ſins to penitent ſinners; and theſe Confeſſors do pardon them to ſinners perſevering and continuing in their ſins; ſo that if it were true that theſe Confeſſors could pardon ſins according to their own fancy, a man would only need to be in favour with ſome of them, to be aſſured of his Salvation. It would be in vain therefore, for Jeſus Chriſt to have ſuffered and endured ſo much to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Every one might indeed live as he pleas'd, as they do now, without caring much for God, ſince he might obtain Salvation by the means of a man who would call himſelf the Saviour and Forgiven of ſinners. I think a man muſt be deprived of all judgment not to diſcover this deceit, whereas at the ſame time ſo many perſons live and die in this blindneſs.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104476:56"/>
This is a groſſer darkneſs than that of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the ſecond point: whether it be in Confeſſion that we muſt forgive ſeventy ſeven times? That cannot be authoriz'd by this paſſage; ſince we find no where that Jeſus Chriſt did forgive ſins more than once to thoſe to whom he pardon'd. And if a ſinner were truly penitent, he would be careful not to fall again ſo often; but if he be not penitent, he is not capable of obtaining pardon ſo much as once; for Abſolution does always ſuppoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, otherwiſe it would not be available. St. <hi>Peter</hi> asks, how often he ſhall pardon his brother who offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him? but Penitents have not offended their Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors when they go to Confeſſion: theſe ſo numerous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons reſpect the indulgence that we owe to our Chriſtian brethren, that we may leave vengeance to God alone, but they do not at all regard ſacramental Confeſſion.</p>

will of the Son. All theſe things are found united in the Church: for God having a deſign to make man after his likeneſs, he transferr'd to him his own qualities: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gives to his Church the power to pardon ſins; goodneſs by the communication of his word, and his wiſdom by the underſtanding of that word. Jeſus Chriſt who took human fleſh has brought us the word of God, which has taught us his wiſdom, and ſhewn us his love, even as by our word we expreſs what is in our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the affections of our heart; which God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did to us, when he ſent us his word upon earth, by the organ of the humanity of Jeſus Chriſt. He made this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance with men, that he might have them after his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Therefore he has call'd them his Spouſe and his Church, which is altogether divine and ſpiritual. But men would indeed diſguiſe it, and render it material, ſenſual, and carnal, in giving the name of <hi>Church</hi> to men who do not poſſeſs this word, without which they cannot be the Church, nor have the power, the wiſdom, nor the love which God gave to his lawful Spouſe: Therefore they may greatly err and fail, in appointing, and approving of rules for Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>And whereas you ask, Whether all theſe outward De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, which are now in uſe in Chriſtendom, be good and ſaving: I doubt it very much; for Jeſus Chriſt taught not ſuch varieties of devotion, as we ſee now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days; but he taught ſolid and inward vertues, <note n="y" place="bottom">Math. 23. 23. 1 Cor. 13. 13.</note> as Faith, Hope, and Charity: Faith to believe in an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, of whom we hold all things; Hope to hope in him only, without putting our confidence in any other thing; and Charity to love him alone, without placing our affection on any created thing, whether in heaven or in earth.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the inſtructions of Jeſus Chriſt: but thoſe at preſent who are call'd <hi>Church-men,</hi> teach no other thing but to reſort to Churches, to frequent the Sacraments, and to ſay a great many vocal prayers by rote and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: With theſe outward things they make men believe, that they are true Chriſtians, which cannot be, ſince Chriſtianity conſiſts in a ſpiritual <note n="z" place="bottom">Gal. 6. 15.</note> and inward life, for it is divine, and not humane. If theſe outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions

had been means proper for us to become good Chriſtians; we may be perſwaded that Jeſus Chriſt would have taught us them; for he had more wiſdom to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee our need and weakneſs, than theſe guides of ſouls can have; and likewiſe more love to take care, that nothing ſhould be wanting to us for the time to come. He left only his word to ſerve for the nouriſhment of our ſouls, ſaying, that <note n="a" place="bottom">Joh. 6. 68 &amp; 50.</note> it is the bread come down from heaven, and that whoſoever ſhall eat it ſhall not die; whereas theſe perſons give us only the Euchariſt for nouriſhment; in which the promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt cannot be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht, for the hoſt does not deſcend from heaven as his word does; and they who eat it, do not all live for ever. For we ſee abominable ſouls, even Sorcerers, do commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate frequently, and thereafter die in their ſins. We ſee alſo Bigots communicate very often, who never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to true faith, nor the knowledge of the truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they cannot live for evel.

The ignorance is very groſs, for every one who would enter into himſelf, might well perceive in the bottom of his ſoul, that he does not love God with all his heart, nor his neighbour as himſelf; which are the chief Commands of God, without the keeping of which one cannot be ſaved. But men ſuffer themſelves to be amus'd with little Rattles, even as they quiet Children, which cannot at all cure the evil that preſſes them, but only diverts their minds a little, that they may not think upon, nor be attentive to their pains. Theſe little outward Devotions are the Rattles which thoſe Guides ſound in our ears <note n="i" place="bottom">2 Tim. 4. 3.</note>, not to cure the wounds which the neglect of this Command of God has caus'd in our ſoul, but rather to amuſe our attention, that it may not diſcover thoſe eternal truths. They breed up our ſouls with affections to their perſons, <note n="l" place="bottom">Jude 16.</note> under a pretext that they ſtand in Gods ſtead. They perſwade us, that we ſhall always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace by confeſſing frequently, as if grace were given by the help of ſins: for confeſſion can bring no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grace than pardon of ſins; and to receive this grace frequently, there is need of ſinning frequently.

Chriſt ſays, <note n="m" place="bottom">Luke 18. 1. 21. 36.</note> that one ought always to pray, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ceaſe. One had need therefore to abide night and day in the Church to fulfil this direction. Theſe are all errors and inventions of men; for a Chriſtian is oblig'd to pray always, at all times, and <note n="n" place="bottom">1 Tim. 2. 8.</note> in all places, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fainting; not only when they are in the Church, as theſe Guides perſwade them, who are no leſs miſtaken in prefixing a certain number of Offices, Prayers, and Beads, and other trifles which they call Prayers, tho they do not know what Prayer is; for it conſiſts in an elevation <note n="o" place="bottom">Pſal. 143. 8.</note> of the ſpirit to God; which may be done while we walk, <note n="p" place="bottom">1 Theſ. 5. 17, 18.</note> and work, eat and drink, and even while one is at reſt: for our ſpirit ought to be continually elevated unto God, in acknowledgment of the continual favours which we receive from him: yea, <note n="q" place="bottom">Cant. 5. 2.</note> even in ſleeping our will ought to bleſs him always: this is the continual prayer which God demands of us. But we do the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for inſtead of having our ſpirit elevated to God continually, we employ it in earthly cares and ſolicitudes about our wealth, our family, our buſineſs, or houſhold affairs: So that even in the little time that we are at Church, ſaying our <hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> our Spirit <note n="r" place="bottom">Iſay. 29. 13.</note> runs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſtray, and is not elevated unto God for one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a day, yea, it may be has never been ſo for our whole life: and we think we have prayed to God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we go to Church, or ſay Prayers by muttering over our Beads. Theſe are all new Doctrines, which neither Jeſus Chriſt nor his Apoſtles ever taught, which do often deprive us of the attention we ought to have to true pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. I will not blame the going to Church to pray to God. This is very good, when we find in the Church more means, and a greater facility of elevating the ſpirit unto God, than in the Houſe, or elſewhere: but I blame all thoſe novelties which divert us from God, by amuſing us with things that ſtrike upon our ſenſes; for which I can ſee no remedy, ſince theſe evils proceed from thoſe who ought to redreſs them. If I ſpoke to theſe Guides of the Church, and told them theſe truths, 'tis to be fear'd they would ſtone me; for they will not be reproved in their actions, far leſs in their authority; and tho they ſhould

So much are they pre-occupy'd with lies and deluſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her; That this proceeded from ignorance: that ſhe ought to declare in particular, wherein true faith does conſiſt; that without doubt many would yet open their eyes, and would embrace it; there being many who deſire not to be damn'd, of whom I was one.</hi>
               </p>

                  <note n="c" place="bottom">Hoſ. 4. 1. Luk. 18. 8.</note> There is no longer Faith, Sir, among the People of God: It has been baniſh'd from them ſince men placed their faith and confidence upon one another; from that time God has been forgotten. Men have made it be believ'd that they would ſave one another, tho' theſe Saviours cannot ſave themſelves, nor make one hair of their heads. Nevertheleſs, by their Perſwaſions, they have made almoſt all the World to become Idolatrous.

The greateſt of all is, that men do not perceive it, for they are become inſenſible through ſo long a cuſtom. I believe, indeed, there are yet many perſons who would not be Damn'd, but what means is there to ſave them when they will not believe that they have abandon'd their true Faith?

                  <p>Of true Faith, according to the tenour of the Creed: Of the knowledge of God, and of our ſelves, by the conſideration of his Works.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Told her, That I did not believe that I had true Faith, and that ſhe had ſufficiently made appear to me, that I could not be right, therefore I deſired to underſtand of her wherein true Faith does conſiſt, tho' it were but upon my own account, for I deſired to profit in it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, let us examine a little together our <hi>Creed,</hi> and ſee if there be ſo much as one Article of it obſerved, even by the moſt perfect Chriſtians now-a-days. If we believ'd that <hi>God is Almighty, that he created the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> 
                  <note n="d" place="bottom">Mal. 1. 6.</note> could we live without loving and fearing him, as we do? Could we alſo attribute to our ſelves the earthly good things which all the World ſeeks after and loves, ſince they are all created by God, and do all appertain to him in Property, which we do daily uſurp? In the ſecond place: If we did believe <hi>in Jeſus Chriſt the only Son of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God, who was conceived of the Holy Ghoſt, born of the Virgin Mary,</hi> could we reject his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, <note n="e" place="bottom">Luk. 6. 46.</note> ſince he is the Son of God, the Fountain of all Wiſdom? Could we follow a Carnal Church, ſeeing ſhe is altogether Spiritual, engendred in the Body of Jeſus Chriſt by the operation of the holy Spirit? Could we alſo live in Luxury, when God choſe a Virgin for his own Mother? Would we not endeavour to love Virginity, ſince God has ſo much eſteem'd it?</p>
               <p>Moreover, if we believ'd <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, has ſuffer'd even ſo far as to be Crucified, Dead and Buried,</hi> could we live ſo ſoftly ſeeking all eaſes to our Body, not willing to ſuffer any thing that is painful, nor affronts, nor tribulations, when we believ'd that the Son of God has indeed ſuffer'd for us, even to a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Death, yea, was buried as a corruptible Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Would we not imitate, or follow him, at ſome diſtance, in caſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104476:62"/>
we had the faith that we profeſs? Moreover, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd <hi>that he is riſen from Death to Life, that he is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into Heaven,</hi>

Would not this withdraw our affections from the Earth, through the hope of aſcending unto Heaven with Jeſus Chriſt? Were it poſſible that we would build Houſes, and make ſo many other ſettlements as we do on Earth, as if it were our abiding City? And if we did believe that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>will come from Heaven to judge the quick and the dead,</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="bottom">Luk 12. 35, 43.</note> were it poſſible that we would live in ſo great a neglect of our Salvation, with ſo little care of making ready our Accompts, to render them to that great Judge who will demand of us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all our Thoughts, Words and Deeds? Would we not rather lay aſide all our worldly Affairs, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on this which is the moſt important to us, yet, on the contrary, is often the leaſt of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ares? And did we believe likewiſe, <hi>that there is a holy Spirit, and a holy Church,</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="bottom">R<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>m. 8. 9, 10, 11.</note> is it poſſible that we would be ſo little Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, ſo Natural and Earthly, ſo wedded to our Senſes, in which we live ſometimes more brutiſhly than the Beaſts themſelves, whereas our Souls ought to be wholly Spiritual and Holy, ſince we have a Holy Spirit and a Holy Church? And did we believe the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> is it poſſible that every one ſhould be ſo much wedded to his own Intereſt and Wealth? If Prayers and good Works ought to be all common amongſt Chriſtian Brethren, <note n="i" place="bottom">1 Joh. 3. 17.</note> how much more ought temporal Wealth to be for the ſuccour of our Neighbour, which is very far from Mens diſpoſitions now, who ſtudy nothing but to keep up and increaſe their own Wealth, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other thing but <hi>mine</hi> and <hi>thine,</hi> both in Spirituals and Temporals? And did we believe <hi>in the remiſſion of Sins,</hi> how would we be penitent and contrite to obtain the pardon of them, inſtead of continuing in them through hardneſs of heart, as we ſee the moſt part of men do, who finiſh their Lives in black thoughts and deſpair, inſtead of having immediate recourſe to mercy,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104476:62"/>
according to their belief! For he who has promiſed the remiſſion of Sins, has not promiſed them time to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in them. If this belief were real, they would not perſevere in them for one day, for they are not certain of living ſo long. And did we believe in the <hi>Reſurrection of the Fleſh,</hi> how could we love and eſteem our fleſh in a condition ſo miſerable as that of this mortal Life? We would greatly contemn it in the hope we had of its Reſurrection, (<hi>l</hi>) in which it ſhould live moſt happy, delivered from ſo many miſeries, calamities, and maladies, under which it groans during its exile in this miſerable World, which, ſetting aſide the hopes of its Reſurrection, muſt rather be called Death than Life; the belief of this Article would give a diſguſt of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of this preſent Life, and make us aſpire towards that to come. And did we believe in <hi>Life eternal,</hi> what would we not do to obtain it? <note n="m" place="bottom">Heb. 11. 8.</note> We would volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily forſake Father, Mother, and all our Goods, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this eternal Life, for it deſerves more than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Worlds, which cannot laſt but for a ſmall time in reſpect of Eternity, whereas we ſee the moſt part of men ſo in love with this miſerable Life, that they would fain abide here for an Eternity, though it be filled with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and calamities.</p>
               <p>Do you not ſee, Sir, that there is no <note n="n" place="bottom">Luk. 18. 8.</note> more faith in the Houſe of God? That no body lives conformably to his belief? That they place faith only in Words, as I have told you formerly? They ſay over, it may be, every day, their Creed, and yet they do not obſerve ſo much as one Article of it. Theſe are nothing but words that vaniſh into Air; and nevertheleſs, they would take it very ill to make appear to them that they have not true faith, tho' it be always operative, and never idle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> True faith works <note n="o" place="bottom">Gal. 5. 6.</note> always the vertues of which I told you, in the Souls which poſſeſs it; and if theſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not ſeen, it may indeed truly be ſaid, that theſe Souls have not faith, for it can never be any where without operating its vertues, no more than the Sun can be without giving his beams. Conſider it well, Sir, and you will find my ſaying true, and you will condemn your ſelf.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I told her, I perceived clearly that People lived in a diſtraction of ſpirit, and that few perſons knew themſelves: That it was no wonder they knew not God, ſince they did not know themſelves; and that truly we were deceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She replied,</hi> Sir, he who knows God will always know himſelf; and he who knows himſelf will aſſuredly know God, for the one is linked unto the other; a ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of ſpirit may teach us this. We ſpeak of God (ſays ſhe) as if he were ſome Phantom; of Paradiſe as an imaginary thing; and of our ſelves as a temporal and tranſient thing. Where is the man living who can comprehend what God is, and in what place he abides? It is true we have need of ſome words to ſignify what we would ſay, therefore we ſay that God is in Paradiſe as in the place of his abode: But we muſt not be ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as to believe that God has any particular abode, for there is nothing which can contain him, being greater than all things. We ſay that he is in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and nevertheleſs the Heavens are but his Creatures, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being able to contain him. We ſay that he is on the right hand of his Father, whither he is aſcended. Theſe are all words to ſignify in our Gibberiſh our little conceptions, but <note n="p" place="bottom">Job 36. 26-37. 23. 1 Tim. 6. 16.</note> we can never attain to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what God is, or Paradiſe, or even our own Souls; for this cauſe we make often wrong judgments, and the Learned fill our minds in this, as in other things, with the Idea's of their Imaginations, which are of little uſe for our Salvation, and far leſs for the Glory of God, for frequently we give attributes to him which do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diminiſh it, to ſpeak after our faſhion. <note n="q" place="bottom">Jer. 9. 24.</note> It is enough for our Salvation and his Glory, that we know that there is one God, and that he is the fountain of all Wiſdom, the accompliſhment of all Power, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of all Goodneſs, who never had beginning, and ſhall never have end; that he is an inviſible and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Spirit, and that he has given us an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to comprehend all theſe Divine Attributes, <note n="r" place="bottom">Act. 14. 17. Rom. 1. 19, 20.</note> through the operations which they produce in our minds. We may firſt know that there is a God, becauſe we feel in our ſelves that we have a dependance upon
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104476:63"/>
ſomething which we cannot comprehend, ſince all thoſe things which we ſee in Heaven and in Earth are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of having created us, nor of maintaining us: for all men, and all the ſtars, with all that is created in heaven and in earth, cannot add one hair unto our head, nor give us one moment of life. We muſt conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there is a God above all things, who has created all, who upholds and governs all, by a ſupream power, ſince nothing can have given being unto its ſelf, there muſt have been of neceſſity ſome author of all things, who has given them all a being and beginning. No body can be ignorant of this truth, tho they had nothing but a Pagan light. And to perceive that he is the fountain of all wiſdom, we need but conſider this beautiful univerſe, how marvellouſly well done it is. What artifice could keep the Globe of the Earth among the Waters? What can give ſplendour to the Sun? Beauty to the Moon? Lights to the Stars? Who can make a tree, a fruit, a flower, a plant of ſo many different herbs? Who can have made the birds of the air, the beaſts of the earth and of the ſea, in ſo many different kinds? And above all, who could have formed the body of man ſo wonderfully ſhap'd, with ſo many different members? How many veins, muſcles, and tendons, do concur to tye up this tender fleſh! What maſter could ever make ſuch a maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece! muſt not this proceed from the fountain of all wiſdom, from which all the wiſdom of men is derived, which we admire without knowing the author of it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by the operations which we experience in our ſelve.</p>
               <p>Who can be ignorant of his infinite wiſdom, while he looks upon the Creation, and the upholding of this great Univerſe? Who does not feel that he has not in himſelf any power, if it be not given from a ſupream power which we do not know? Who can be ignorant of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Goodneſs, while he receives every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the effects of it? All that man has, he holds it of the Goodneſs of God: for he could not have merited any thing before that God of his Goodneſs alone did create him. We perceive evidently that he is an Inviſible and Incomprehenſible ſpirit, for none ever ſaw God, or can comprehend what he is. He can never have had begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, having given beginning to all things. How can that end which is eternally incomprehenſible? our ſoul cannot
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104476:64"/>
even comprehend itſelf; nevertheleſs we may well judge that it is immortal: for the Wiſdom of God could never have created it to live for ſo ſmall a time as we are upon earth. He would have done a thing which was not good, <note n="s" place="bottom">Deut. 32. 4.</note> which cannot be: for our ſoul is always in bondage, <note n="t" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5. 4.</note> ſo long as it animates this our miſerable body. God ſhould not be juſt <note n="u" place="bottom">Job 10. 3, 8.</note>, if he gave it not another time to rejoyce with him; elſe the end of its creation ſhould be miſerable. It muſt needs be for accompliſhing the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs of God, that it live a bleſſed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; ſo that even he could not have created our body to live only this ſo miſerable ſhort life: by far greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon our ſoul, which he created after his own image, and according to his own likeneſs, could not be created to be only a Priſoner in our body, where it cannot act but by its co-operation with it; no more can God act in us, but by <note n="x" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5.</note> the co-operation of our ſoul, becauſe there is an indiſſoluble union in reſpect of the one and of the other. For God is united with our ſoul, as our body is alſo united with the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I admir'd theſe marvellous and unheard of diſcourſes; and that I might underſtand more, I told her, I had never ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently underſtood, how the knowledge of God was unſeparable from the knowledge of our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid to me,</hi> Sir, this is very eaſie to comprehend, if you will ſeriouſly reflect upon it; for no body can know that God is the fountain of all wiſdom, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving at the ſame time that we can have nothing but ignorance only; as experience makes ſufficiently appear, that no body has wiſdom at his wiſh, that <note n="y" place="bottom">Wiſd. 8. 21.</note> it muſt be derived from that ſupream fountain, whoſe works being conſidered, it muſt be preſently known and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, that all our wiſdom, how great ſoever we may have imagin'd it, being compar'd with the wiſdom of God, is nothing but pure ignorance, and this not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known, we will think that our wiſdom is great: As a perſon is always the moſt beautiful, and the moſt perfect, when ſhe is alone; but approaching others who have more perfection than ſhe, this makes her know what ſhe is truly. Even ſo when we know the perfections
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104476:64"/>
of God, we know our own imperfections. If we know his almighty power, we ſhall preſently perceive our own weakneſs; or the perfection of his goodneſs, we ſhall diſcover how far ours is from it. For this cauſe I have ſaid, that we cannot know God, without knowing our ſelves; neither can we know our ſelves, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God: for he who knows that he is but a pure <hi>nothing,</hi> he muſt confeſs that there is ſomething above him, from whom he has receiv'd what he is; becauſe a <hi>Nothing</hi> cannot do any thing, nor give any thing to its ſelf. Every one knows well, that there has been a time in which he was not; and when he is made, he does not know how, nor from whence he is taken, which obliges him to acknowledge a God, the Author of all things: and even tho he went not out of himſelf, he muſt know God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All theſe truths ſeem'd to me ſo clear, that I knew not how they could be call'd in queſtion; tho in the mean time we ſee no body attains to this knowledge of God, or of himſelf; that it muſt needs be acknowledged, that we were fallen into a total forgetfulneſs of God, and ignorance of our ſelves, and that we were aſſuredly deceiv'd and ſeduc'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid to me,</hi> Sir, the deceit is ſo great, that no body can comprehend it. We run, as it were, blindfold to damnation without perceiving it; and whereas thoſe who guide us, ought to ſet us again into the right way, <note n="z" place="bottom">Iſa. 3. 12.</note> they are the very perſons who deceive us, becauſe they themſelves are deceived by Satan. Wherefore there is nothing to be hop'd for but a total ruine, <note n="a" place="bottom">Rev. 18. 21.</note> which will be irreparable, ſeeing that it is eternal. We are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enough to avoid the perils of the body, but we are too little careful to avoid the perils of the ſoul, which are without compariſon much more conſiderable. Man having forſaken his God, from whom can he expect Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? When we leave God, aſſuredly he leaves us: <note n="b" place="bottom">Pſ. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ſeparation. It is fit to underſtand, how we can truly ſay, that <hi>God leaves us or forſakes us;</hi> becauſe many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it amiſs, in attributing to God the cauſe of this forſaking. It may be ſaid, that God has forſaken us now, becauſe this is true; but we ought always to underſtand in what manner he leaves us: for otherwiſe we blaſpheme againſt God, not by words but intention, in conceiving that God does of himſelf forſake us.</p>

She ſaid:</hi> By the ſtraying of our ſpirit, which has left off to entertain it ſelf with the conſideration of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels of God. Our ſoul was created to love him, and to bleſs him continually; in which conſiſts the continual prayer which Jeſus Chriſt <note n="d" place="bottom">Luk. 18. 1. 21. 36. 1 Theſ. 5. 13.</note> has recommended to us ſince he became man: for we have no other thing to do in this world but this continual prayer; God having given us all the reſt.

                  <note n="e" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 1, &amp;c.</note> The Devil, who is nam'd the Serpent, made it his buſineſs to entertain them, to the end he might diſtract them from the Communion which they ought to have with God.

only) towards the fruits of the earth, which were given her only for uſe, and not to place her affection upon them; from hence he likewiſe incited her to deſire know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil, withdrawing the attention which ſhe had to God, to apply it unto curioſity, and a deſire to be great and wiſe. Lo this was the cauſe why we did abandon God, and loſe the knowledge of our ſelves.

And when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil propoſes to our thoughts any thing which ſeems to be either pleaſant or profitable to our nature, who does not preſently follow it without reſtraint and without fear? and inſtead of fixing upon the conſideration of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works of God, we are continually buſied in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our pleaſures in the creatures, in ſelf-complacency, or in the deſires and coveting of earthly goods: which things do entirely <note n="h" place="bottom">Math. 6. 21.</note> withdraw us from the total atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we ought to have upon God alone, for whom we are created, and not for theſe things which are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to us, and which God created for our <note n="i" place="bottom">Pſ. 8. 7.</note> footſtools, as the earth and metals: and we will needs carry them upon our ſhoulders, yea even upon our head, and in our heart! The Devil repreſents to us that theſe earthly

pleaſures are delightful; that theſe beauties are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that with Money we may do and know every thing: and we believe this deceiver, and follow his counſels, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the whole time of our life in ſeeking our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and contentments, and in heaping together earthly goods, which is the cauſe that we are diverted from God; for our ſpirit and underſtanding cannot attend upon two things ſo diſtant from one another, as is God and the creatures. We abandon the <hi>All</hi> to ſeek the <hi>Nothing,</hi> as did our firſt Parents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve <hi>were expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to eat of the fruit of a tree; and that we are not thus expreſly forbidden by God to love the creatures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She reply'd:</hi> He has not only once thus forbidden us, but many times, in different times and ages. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition which God gave unto our firſt Parents, Sir, was directed unto all men who were to come of <hi>Adam,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he held in his power the free will of all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Therefore God ſpoke to all men, when he ſpoke to our firſt Father. The Prohibition which he gave him (<hi>m</hi>) not to eat of the fruit of a tree, was nothing but an outward ſign of the dependance which he ow'd unto God; even as a Superior reſerves to himſelf ſome yearly rent in the Donation which he makes of his Lands or Mannors, to the end that always theſe goods or lands, may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd yearly to acknowledge the Superiour upon whom they depend. God had beſtow'd on man all this beautiful world which we behold, with all that is in it; but he would have him ſtill to acknowledge the dependance that he had upon his God and Lord, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this might oblige them to love ſuch a Benefactor, who had given them all theſe created things, which they might enjoy, provided always they did acknowledge and love the God who had ſo freely beſtow'd them.</p>
               <p>He forbad them to eat of one Tree only, permitting them to eat of all the reſt, to ſhew that he permitted man to enjoy all the fruits of the earth, provided he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve always the obligation that he has to God. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires for a Teſtimony of this, that he abſtain from eating of this forbidden fruit, to the end he might never forget the love, and the obedience which he ow'd unto the<note place="bottom">(<hi>l) Math.</hi> 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Lord, from whom he had receiv'd all things. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition is no other thing but a Command to love him, which being done, man might do all that he deſird. This Commandment was alſo given unto man, when God requir'd Sacrifices from him; not that God had need of beaſts, or other things; but he demands this outward teſtimony in confirmation of the inward acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and love which they bear unto God the giver of all things. The Law he gave to <hi>Moſes</hi> contain'd alſo no other thing but this love <note n="n" place="bottom">Deut. 10. 12.</note> and gratitude which we owe unto our God. Tho theſe Commandments are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ten, yet they are all comprehended in that of loving and acknowledging God; for all the reſt are but prohibitions not to do the things which would hinder this love and gratitude, becauſe he who takes the name of God in vain, or he who ſteals, or covets his Neighbors goods, or commits Fornication, and ſo of the reſt, does not love nor acknowledge God. <note n="o" place="bottom">Joh. 3. 11.</note> And to make this love and acknowledgment eaſie to him, God forbids him to commit theſe things, as being contrary to this love. But as to the ſumm of theſe Commandments it conſiſts in one only, to wit, in the love and acknowledgment of God; when he commands to keep holy the Feaſts, and to honour Father and Mother; all this depends upon the love of God, which we ought to teſtify alſo outwardly in ſanctifying the days which are dedicated unto him. The honour which we owe to Fathers and Mothers ſignifies only an acknewledgment that we owe unto our Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, of whom God is the principal, yea even <note n="p" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 17.</note> the giver of all things; but becauſe our Parents do us good in nouriſhing, helping, caring for us, and teaching us during our weakneſs, he commands us to honour them as little Gods, for the ſmall good things which they do us, to the end that by this outward acknowledgment, we may be mindful of our acknowledgments which we owe <note n="q" place="bottom">Mal. 1. 6.</note> to God, in proportion to the benefits which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him. Behold how God has many times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden us not to love the creatures, ſince by ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ways he commands us to love him to the excluſion of all things. Which Jeſus Chriſt himſelf has well expreſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104476:67"/>
to us, when he ſays, that we muſt <note n="r" place="bottom">Math. 22. 37,</note> 
                  <hi>love God with all our heart, with all our ſtrength, and with all our thoughts.</hi> There could not be more expreſs terms to ſhew, that our heart is created for God only, and for nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I receiv'd ſuch light by theſe reaſonings, that it was my delight to hear them: And to make her ſpeak the more, I ſaid to her, that there were ſome Authors who maintain'd, that it was impoſſible to love God with all our hearts, and to keep his Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She was mov'd with anger; ſaying:</hi> What injury do they to God by ſuch ſentiments! I ſwear to you, Sir, theſe perſons know neither God nor themſelves; when they aſſert ſuch things. They are inſupportable to me. What well diſpos'd Soul could ſuffer, that they ſhould ſay of God, that he has given <note n="s" place="bottom">Deut. 30. 11, 12, 13.</note> Commandments to man, which it is impoſſible for him to obſerve. This is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make him paſs for a Tyrant, and alſo for an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. For to lay on a heavier burthen than our ſhoulders could bear would be a Cruelty; and to damn men for not having done that which was impoſſible for them, a Tyranny. Could God give inſupportable Laws without being unjuſt? Could he overcharge men without cruelty? He who made men, could he be ignorant of their ſtrength and capacity, that he did not give them laws according to their weakneſs or infirmities? What Blaſphemies do they commit, againſt the ſupream Wiſdom which knows all things! What injury to that ſtraight Righteouſneſs. What contempt to make him ignorant of the ſtrength and capacity of men! He who knows <note n="t" place="bottom">Pſal. 94. 9, 10, 11.</note> the moſt ſecret thoughts of the heart, and all things paſt and to come, as well as the preſent. O ingrate creature! If thou kneweſt thy ſelf, thou would'ſt perceive but too much, that thou art capable <note n="u" place="bottom">Deut. 30. 11-16.</note> of loving God with all thy heart! For there is nothing more natural to man than love; and there is nothing which does more oblige to love, than the benefits receiv'd without having merited them. What is wanting to you therefore to be able to love with all your heart? Is there any thing more lovely than he, all-beautiful, all-good, all-wife, all-perfect; in ſhort, <note n="x" place="bottom">Cant. 5. 16.</note> the accompliſhment of all perfections! Our
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104476:67"/>
heart, which cannot live without love, could it find any object more lovely, or any greater ſubject of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment for ſo many benefits received from him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That it was truth; and that no objects could be found ſo worthy of our affection as God is; but the evil came from this, that we did not ſee nor feel God, as we do the creatures, which are material and ſenſible to our ſenſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid to me:</hi> It is true, Sir, God being a pure Spirit, is not viſible nor ſenſible to our natural ſenſes. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, he is more viſible and ſenſible to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <note n="y" place="bottom">Rom. 1. 20.</note> by his works, than are all the creatures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and he does us alſo much more good, than all that is created in heaven and in earth. For this cauſe we ought to love him alone more than all other things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; for if our underſtanding would apply its ſelf to the conſideration of the wonderful works of God, it would find more ground to love God than any thing, how lovely ſoever it might be, even according to the natural ſenſes. All the miſchief proceeds from this, that our ſenſes are diſtracted from the works of God, and that we apply them to know, and to love, earthly objects which are below us, and unworthy of being lov'd by us; for they can give us no other thing, but divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mind, and amuſement of our ſenſes, without any profit, ſince all is but vanity, paſſing away in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without leaving any thing in our ſouls, but vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and regrets at death. Behold the height of all the happineſs we can ever hope for, in loving any creatures whatſoever. A mans mind muſt be infatuated if he do not find in the works of God, and in his operations which we experience in our ſelves, all ſorts of occaſions to love and to follow him. For who can conſider the beauty of the Sun, and of the Stars of Heaven, the good and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the Flowers, and Fruits of the Earth, without being raviſh'd with admiration, in conſidering what beauty and goodneſs he muſt have, who gives them to all theſe things! We amuſe our ſelves ſometimes in lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtone, a flower, or a humane creature for its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and we do not raiſe our underſtandings to love the fountain, and the giver of all theſe beauties, which is God! moſt durably beautiful, who cannot fade, as do
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104476:68"/>
all theſe other beauties, which are nothing but phantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and changeable. If God had not the perfection of all beauties, how could he give it to ſo many diverſe things; for one can never give that which he himſelf has not? Who can ſay therefore, that we do not ſee nor feel God as we do the creatures? ſince he ſhews himſelf, <note n="z" place="bottom">Act. 17. 24-29.</note> and lets himſelf be felt by his operations, which are ſenſible to our ſenſes. Who can ſay, that he does not continually perceive God operating in him, and doing him infinite good? That we have <note n="a" place="bottom">Job 10. 8-12.</note> a being, is by the good will of God. That we ſee, or ſpeak, or hear, are the gifts of God. That we reaſon with our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; that we enjoy our five natural Senſes: theſe are all gifts of God which no body can give unto himſelf, and which cannot be acquired by Gold, and Silver, or Freinds, let them be who they will. The daily food of our body, does it not all come from God? For what man can make a grain of Corn or a Strawberry to grow? All theſe things, with a thouſand others; do they not afford us ſenſible enough ſubjects to know and to love God? Can we ſay in truth that we do not ſee him, nor feel him, ſince he makes himſelf to be ſeen and felt every moment, by ſo many benefits which our Soul and our Body do receive in ſo great abundance, which cannot come from any other, but from God himſelf? It would be more true to ſay, that we could not love the creatures, than that we cannot love God; for they can give us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and God gives us all that we ſee by our natural ſenſes; and that this impoſſibility of loving God, and of fulfilling his Commandments, is apply'd to a contrary ſenſe; and that <note n="b" place="bottom">Pſ. 73. 25.</note> it is more impoſſible to love the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with all our heart, becauſe they can never fill our ſoul, for it is ſpiritual, and they are material, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no congruity in them to be loved with all our heart, which cannot be filled but with God alone.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That God has never given to Man but one only eſſential Command, which is that of his LOVE, which is moſt eaſie and moſt agreeable, and the Love of all other things most vain.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Said unto her; That ſhe confounded the Ten Commands of God into one, and that they who ſay, it is impoſſible to keep his Commands, ſpeak of all, not only of the firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She reply'd:</hi> Sir, the firſt is the only Commandment to which God would have us ſubjected. He has never laid any other burthen upon our ſhoulders, but this gentle Yoke of <hi>LOVE.</hi> All the other Laws and Commands are occaſioned by our ſins, and are ordain'd by God, for no other end, but that we may know them, and beware of them. He perceiv'd that men from the beginning of the world, began to appropriate to themſelves Beaſts, and other earthly goods, as things depending upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which led to a forgetfulneſs of, and an ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to God. Therefore he appointed the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of Beaſts, and the other Firſt Fruits; that by theſe outward ſigns they might always preſerve in their heart the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that all which they poſſeſt came from God. It was his will alſo, that they ſhould build him a rich <hi>Temple</hi> for the ſame reaſon, that all men might always acknowledge <note n="c" place="bottom">1 Chron. 29. 11-16.</note> that all their treaſures, riches, and magnificences came from God, and did belong to him. Therefore he requires, that they build him a magnificent Temple. Not that God has need of Temples, of Riches, or Treaſures, being <hi>All</hi> in himſelf. But he requires, that man retain this acknowledgment of God, that by the remembrance of ſo many benefits, he may be oblig'd to love him, and to fulfil this firſt Commandment. That he gave to <hi>Moſes</hi> ten Commands written in ſtone, was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104476:69"/>
                  <note n="d" place="bottom">1 Tim. 1. 9.</note> when men began to multiply their wickedneſs, giving themſelves to ſwear, rob, bear falſe witneſs, commit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and the reſt; the goodneſs of God forbids all theſe things, fearing leſt the ignorance of theſe evil deeds might be the cauſe of their damnation. <note n="e" place="bottom">Rom. 13. 20.</note> By theſe Commands he ſhews them their ſins, forbidding them to commit them any longer, becauſe all theſe things were hinderances of loving God, as he had commanded them. The Law <note n="f" place="bottom">Gen. 17. 10-13.</note> of <hi>Circumciſion</hi> aim'd alſo at the ſame, to make man acknowledge that he held his life of God; and for an outward ſign of this acknowledgment, he requir'd that he ſhould ſhed of his blood. Not that he had need either of the blood of men or beaſts; but it is his will, that all things ſhould acknowledge that they receiv'd all their being from God, that this acknowledgment might oblige them always to love their Creator. Even <note n="g" place="bottom">1 Joh. 4. 5-19.</note> the <hi>Evangelical Law</hi> conſiſts in no other thing, but in this firſt Command of loving God with all our heart. The counſel of poverty, chaſtity, and the reſt of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical counſels, are given us only for means to attain to this <hi>LOVE,</hi> becauſe he who loves riches, luxury, himſelf, or other things, <note n="h" place="bottom">1 Joh. 2. 15.</note> cannot love God with all his heart, nor fulfil this firſt Commaadment. By which you may perceive evidently, Sir, that all the Commands of God are comprehended in the firſt, and that all the reſt are only prohibitions to do what would hinder this love; that God has never given us any other Law, but that of loving him; and that the pity which he has to ſee us periſh, made him give all thoſe prohibitions contain'd in his Commandments. Can this be evil, or impoſſible to be obſerved, as you have affirm'd to me? Is it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be in the world without killing, robbing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting adultery, and the reſt? It is rather impoſſible for him who has common ſenſe to do this, for all theſe evil things are repugnant to good ſenſe, and the love of God delights, comforts, and edifies. How then ſhould it be impoſſible to do a thing ſo good, and to omit things ſo evil; <note n="i" place="bottom">Deut. 30. 19, 20.</note> this is moſt good, uſeful, and reaſonable, moſt eaſie even to our natural inclination, which cannot be without loving ſomething, and cannot find an object
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104476:69"/>
more good, more wiſe, more powerful, and more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be lov'd than God, and from which we can derive greater advantages both temporal and eternal than from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I told her: That ſhe rendered the love of God eaſie and agreeable; that no man could have any thing to ſay againſt truths ſo clear and ſolid; but I would gladly know from whence it comes, that we find them ſo difficult, and the love of the creatures ſo eaſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, it proceeds from this, that we keep our mind diſtracted and diverted from God, and that we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it only to the view of the creatures; <note n="l" place="bottom">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> by this means our underſtanding is filled with theſe earthly objects, which darken our reaſon, and render it uncapable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning aright the things which we ſee and feel. For if our reaſon were not darkned, it were impoſſible that we could love the creatures in themſelves, becauſe they are ſo frail, ſo impotent, and of ſo ſhort continuance; which are all qualities very little lovely in reſpect of the Creator of them, who by his works makes appear unto us his omnipotence, his ſtability, and conſtancy, and his eternal duration. The creatures themſelves do diſcover to us this truth: when we behold the Sun continue his carreer ſince the beginning of the world, the day ſtill to ſucceed the night, the fountains to give their waters without ceaſing, the earth to bring forth its fruit conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, the air its birds, the ſea its fiſhes, nature its beaſts, and men. What mighty arm muſt it be that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all theſe things! What power that upholds and maintains them! What immobility that makes them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways perſiſt in an equal pace! Is there any reaſon, how little ſoever it be, that is not led to love a God, ſo love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he renders himſelf by the ſole government of his creatures?</p>
               <p>How much more muſt he be ſo in himſelf? and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs we turn away our underſtanding from theſe conſiderations to turn it towards the creature, which is ſo frail of its ſelf, that it merits no other thing but <note n="m" place="bottom">Eccl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. 1.</note> to be deſpis'd by us. For what can there be of lovely in the creatures, of what kind ſoever they may be? when we conſider them only in themſelves they are pure <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:104476:70"/>
which have neither ſtrength, nor beauty, nor goodneſs, nor perfections, nor duration. All that is beautiful and good in them comes from God; and all ſorts of evil come from themſelves. If God did not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Sun and all the Stars, in the bounds and limits wherein he has plac'd them, they would aſſuredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all the earth. The creatures may greatly hurt us, and no ways benefit us. We are hurtful to our ſelves, and if we had not ſtray'd from ſenſe, and loſt our reaſon, it were impoſſible that we would be led to love the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and not to love the Creator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I told her: That there were creatures ſo lovely, that one muſt be inſenſible not to love them, and that we cannot hate, or deſpiſe, that which does ſo ſtrongly tickle our ſenſes as a moſt fair humane creature would do, and likewiſe ſo many other different beanties which God has created.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I perceive well that you are yet earthly, and that your underſtanding is not as yet raiſed from all things to the Lord, ſince you do not well comprehend my ſaying. I do not mean, but that we may love all the beauties and goodneſs in the world; for God has created them all for men <note n="n" place="bottom">1 Cor. 3. 22.</note>, eſpecially for his elect, who may uſe and enjoy them at their wiſh, provided they take them in God who is their fountain: but I blame only the love which is carry'd to the creatures for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for elſe we muſt love the beauties and goodneſs of the creatures if we love God, becauſe we cannot ſee the beauty and goodneſs of God but by his creatures: He, being an inviſible and incomprehenſible ſpirit <note n="o" place="bottom">Wiſd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. 3, 4, 5.</note>, renders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> himſelf viſible and comprehenſible in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; ſo that he who ſees a fair or good thing, ſees God, for there is nothing beautiful and good but he alone. He is all beauty and all goodneſs; and nothing can be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and good without deriving it from God. But all that is blameable herein, is that our underſtanding is not apply'd to the conſideration of the beauties of God, in conſidering theſe earthly beauties. We do not raiſe our mind higher than theſe material beauties, which do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe us to the love of the earth, in diverting us from that which we ought to have for God alone. For example; if you regrrd the beauty of a flower, and love it becauſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104476:70"/>
it tickles your Curioſity, you commit a Folly, becauſe there is nothing lovely in this Flower but the Art of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who made it: For it it can give you no other but a vain Contentment to the Sight or Smell, which are things that paſs in a Moment; for if you wait but one Day, you will ſee what you lov'd turned to Dung, and its ſweet Smell chang'd into Stink. I have ſeen Flowers bought for three thouſand Florins, with a too vehement Ray of the Sun, has withered in one Day, or, a little Rain, rotted in the ſame Time: And, which is more, an Earth-worm has kill'd its Root in one Night,</p>
               <p>Do you not ſee Objects not very lovely, to be lov'd by reaſonable Creatures, capable of loving a God? Muſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not a Man be come to the higheſt degree of Folly, to ſet his Affections on things ſo frail, as to be in one Day reduc'd into the Dung-Hill? All the Creatures are no other thing in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> themſelves: He who ſets his Affections on the Beaſts, ſees them dye, to his Regret: He who places them in Riches, ſees them periſh by a renverſe of Fortune: He who places them in Honours, ſees them periſh by ſome Diſgrace. If he place them in Sciences, and in Learning, all this periſhes by a ſmall Defluxion falling upon the Brain. Let him place his Affection on any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Beauty, it paſſes as quickly as a Flower, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Corruption. Even ſo are the Pleaſures of the Mouth and of the Body, which afford nothing but great Putrefaction. In ſhort, if we love our ſelves, in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, we render our ſelves miſerable, for we cannot be reduc'd to a greater Slavery than to be ſubject to our Paſſions; which are ſometimes ſo inſolent that they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt perfect Men miſerable. By which we ſee, that all that is not <hi>God</hi> is nothing but Miſery and <note n="p" place="bottom">Eccl. 1. 14.</note> Vexation of Spirit; and that there is no Happineſs in the Love of all theſe Creatures, when they are not regarded in their Fountain, which is God; whom if we did regard, all theſe Creatures would not be capable of gaining our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For it is impoſſible to love them without being diſtracted and turned away from God: For if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Qualities of God, and compared them with thoſe of the Creatures, we would ſee that thoſe are but Dung compared with Gold: Beſides, that all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104476:71"/>
together cannot ſave us <note n="q" place="bottom">Deut. 32. 39.</note> nor give us ſo much as one Moment of Life. We paſs ſometimes our whole Life in ſtudying to render our ſelves accompliſh'd among Men, and they have no Power <note n="r" place="bottom">Iſa. 33. 22.</note> to make us happy, even in this World; for their Friendſhip is changeable and their Fortune unconſtant. Their Fidelity does often depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Complaiſance; a ſmall Word ill plac'd will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them your Enemies: And tho' it were real and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, death can rob you of it in a Moment, and you will never find them any more in your Need. Do you not ſee that all things are frail, upon which there is no leaning? no Ground to let our ſelves be charm'd or our Senſes tickl'd, if there were not a Diſorder of Spirit and a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of God! And if this were remov'd it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to love the Creatures in themſelves, and to ceaſe to love God, even tho he had never commanded us. Even Natural Inſtinct <note n="s" place="bottom">Iſa. 1. 11, 23.</note> leads us to his Love, by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his wonderful Works and of his Benefits which we receive every Moment: There needed no other Love to oblige us to love him with all our Heart, and with all our Strength.</p>

                  <hi>I Perceiv'd most clearly that all this was true, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that all Men were very far from ſuch Sentiments; that every one of them ſpent their Life in the Affairs and Buſineſs of the World, and thought not themſelves obliged to keep Communion in Spirit with God, fearing that this might</hi>

                  <hi>I ask'd her, Whether every one was oblig'd to keep continual Communion with God? If this was not the particular Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Monks; the Religious or other Perſons, who make Profeſſion of a Spiritual Life, tending to Perfection?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, all Chriſtians <note n="t" place="bottom">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> are Religious, for there can be no other Religion but a Chriſtian Life. Every one, who would be ſav'd, is obliged to entertain his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit continually with God; therefore Jeſus Chriſt ſays <note n="u" place="bottom">Luke 18. 1.</note>, That we ought always to pray and never faint. He ſpeaks to Perſons of all Conditions; not to the Religious only, for there were none in his Time who did wear diſguiſed Habits, as they do now, but all Chriſtians were religious, as they are yet at preſent. Neither the Habit nor the Cloyſter do make Religion, but <note n="x" place="bottom">1 Cor. 7. 9.</note> the Obſervance of the Evangelical Counſels. We are greatly miſtaken if we think that God has a Regard to the States and Conditions <note n="y" place="bottom">Col 3. 2.</note> of Perſons: He regards not whether we be Religious or Married; but whether we obſerve his Commandments and his Doctrine. Every one is free to chuſe what State he will; provided that in it he obſerve the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. There is not any State, nor any Condition that can exempt a Perſon from keeping continual Communion with God: For he invites us to this, and we are created for no other Thing. All other Affairs or Buſineſſes are but accidental and of ſmall importance; whether they ſucceed or miſcarry, it matters little; becauſe all their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes cannot ſerve us but for this ſhort Life, which ſtands not in need of much, if we would content our ſelves with what is neceſſary only: In which we would be more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than all the Kings of the Earth; for all that we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs beyond this Neceſſity is Affliction and Vexation of Spirit. God created us to love him only; and that <note n="z" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 31.</note> he might take his Delight with us, and we with him. This is the only End of our Creation. He had no need of us, but he would create us to take his Pleaſure with us. This is that which we do leaſt of all think of or apply our ſelves unto. It ſeems we would change the Deſigns that God has concerning us, while we will not follow his Ordinance

of Praying always. One thinks he is born to be a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, an Advocote, a Prieſt, a Monk, a Merchant, or for any other State, Office or Benefice, to which he is advanc'd, and they preſs hard to perfect themſelves, to increaſe and proſper in it, as if they were created to do this. And, when they are arriv'd at the higheſt of their Pretenſions, Death <note n="a" place="bottom">Pſal. 146. 4.</note> comes, which conſumes all.

Behold the End of all the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and Affairs of the World, for the Advancement of which we neglect Communion with God, tho' this would advance them more if we were habituated to this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which would perfect all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That Men were very blind, in not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeriouſly theſe Truths; and that ſhe ought to pray to God that he would take from them the Vail which hindred them from ſeeing their ſo great Miſery, and that they might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Obligation they have to pray always, which they were very far from doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which ſhe replyed:</hi> Men, Sir, are as far from Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they are far from this Knowledge: For Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid nothing in vain. To be ſaved we ought <note n="c" place="bottom">Luke 18. 1.</note> aſſuredly to pray always; for as ſoon as we ſhall ceaſe to have our Spirit lifted up to God, we ſhall fall into many Evils, from which we can very hardly recover our ſelves, becauſe Sin blinds the Soul, and <note n="d" place="bottom">Eph. 4. 18, 19.</note> renders it often inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of its Evils. If this were not true, how could it be that one ſhould ſee every Day his Brother or his Neighbour die leaving behind him all upon the Earth, without carrying away any thing; and that he ſhould not thereby diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his own Folly and his Blindneſs, in labouring with ſo much Care to heap up earthly Goods, which at Death ſerve for nothing? What, tho' I pray, Sir, God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver force their Wills; he ſends them occaſions enough to

open their Eyes. But as <note n="e" place="bottom">1 Joh. 2. 15.</note> long as they ſhall continue to have their Affections ſet on earthly Goods, they cannot love God; one of theſe Affections muſt go out to let the other in: They can never dwell both together. And for my part I can never pray for an unjuſt thing. God makes no body blind; but their Sins, and the little deſire they have to ſeek God has clos'd their Eyes. He well deſerves to be ſought, and Men do not deſerve that God ſhould ſeek them. There are a great many Perſons who ſay, <note n="f" place="bottom">Tit, 2.</note> That they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to love God, but they deſire not to quit their earthly Affections.

                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That all her Sentiments were very far from the Sentiments of Men, who believed that they might love God, while they loved themſelves, or ſome other thing, not vitiouſly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She replied to me:</hi> All Men now are poſſeſs'd with the Spirit of Error and of Ignorance: For to believe that we may love God and our ſelves or other Creatures, <note n="h" place="bottom">Luke 14. 26.</note> is a great Error and a falſe Perſuaſion; for there is no relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between God and the Creature, that they could dwell together in the ſame Place. Our Soul was created Divine and Spiritual, to the End God may rule there; and if we debaſe it by the Love of Material and Human Things, it is rendred uncapable of Divine things; for that which is Carnal <note n="i" place="bottom">Gal. 5. 17.</note> cannot be Spiritual; and as Cold and Heat cannot abide together, ſo Spiritual Things cannot dwell with Natural, the one does always chaſe away the other, a Contrary its Contrary. Men <note n="l" place="bottom">Eccl. 3. 18. 2 Pet. 10. 12.</note> live now as carnally as the Beaſts, being ſenſible of nothing but according to our brutiſh Senſes: And yet we would perſuade our ſelves that we are Chriſtians. In which we are greatly deceiv'd, for the Life of a Chriſtian is a Spiritual Life <note n="m" place="bottom">Phil. 3. 20.</note>, not a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. The Beaſts are not created but for the Nature of Men; but theſe are created for God, who is a Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104476:73"/>
We may ſufficiently perceive this, by conſidering the Courſe of our Life, which is nothing but Pains, Labours, Vexations and Miſeries. Could it be poſſible that God ſhould have created us for Ends ſo miſerable as what we poſſeſs in this World? This truly would be a miſerable End. God can never do ſuch an Evil: For no Evils can proceed from him <note n="n" place="bottom">Wiſd. 1. 13, 14.</note>, but all ſorts of Good. The End of our Creation muſt be Divine and Spiritual, or elſe Man would have Reaſon to curſe the Day of his Birth, which makes way for a miſerable Life; wherein thoſe who are eſteemed the moſt Happy are moſt to be bewailed. We will eſteem that Man happy who is a King, a Prince, or a Lord; and they are all more miſerable than a poor Peaſant, who has no other Cares but to maintain his Family and his Perſon; whereas theſe others are oblig'd to maintain their Train, their Subjects, their Offices, their Honours, which they are ſometimes oblig'd to defend at the Peril of their Lives: Whereas a poor Fellow will accompliſh the Courſe of his Life in Quietneſs, notwithſtanding of the Affronts which he receives. A rich Man is likewiſe eſteem'd happy for his Riches; but what Labours does he not undergo to acquire them? <note n="o" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7.</note> Or what Cares or Diſquiets to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them? It is altogether a Trade to have Riches. A Man needs no other Work for all his Life-Time but to keep them well. We will eſteem a Perſon happy, who is raiſed to an Eſtate, Honour and Dignities: Nevertheleſs there is nothing more miſerable, he being ſubject to all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns his Office, not having ſometimes the Leiſure to attend upon himſelf. How Circumſpect muſt he be, that he diſpleaſe not the Great, and that he may ſatisfie every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? which is indeed very difficult. What Care muſt he take to provide for all that maintain him in Honour, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſt he fall into any Diſgrace or Contempt? How muſt he bear with the Envious and with Slanderers? In ſhort, Sir, all theſe things which are call'd <hi>Happineſs</hi> in this World, are nothing but phantaſtical and imaginary Goods, and real Evils. They are ſo many Rattles which the Devil ſhakes, that he may divert the Attention we ought to have upon God, and he makes us forget the End for which we are created, by all theſe Trifles, which are nothing but real Amuſements of Children, and they make us
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104476:73"/>
periſh through Ignorance, rendring us uncapable of loving God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her; Whether then all States, Riches and Honours, in which God or Nature has placed Men, ought to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd? And if we could not love God with any of theſe things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She replyed:</hi> They <note n="p" place="bottom">Luke 14. 33.</note> muſt be certainly left, Sir, before God can be lov'd: Not that all theſe things are evil in themſelves; but becauſe of the Infirmity of our Nature, which has not found the Art of poſſeſſing them in God; and while we poſſeſs them in themſelves, they are aſſuredly evil and hurtful to our Soul, hindring it from Communion with God, and from attaining to the End for which it was created. It is juſt the ſame as if a Traveller, inſtead of advancing on his Way, to arrive at the Place which he aims at, would needs ſtop in all the Gardens through which he muſt paſs, to gather and eat the Fruits which he found in them; or to paſs his Time in Smelling all the Flowers which he ſaw there: We would reckon ſuch a Perſon a Fool, as in effect he would be; becauſe theſe Amuſements and his Loſs of Time would deprive him of the Happineſs of arriving at the Place he deſign'd for; and Night ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by the Way, would put him in hazzard of being pillag'd by the Robbers or devour'd by Wild-Beaſts, or at leaſt incommoded as to his Reſt, which he would be oblig'd to take on the hard Earth, with many Inconveniencies and Miſeries. All theſe Evils and Dangers would befal him becauſe of the Folly he had committed, in ſtopping among theſe Flowers and Fruits. If he had only look'd on them at a diſtance, ſmell'd them as he paſt along, or pull'd an Apple for his Thirſt, this had not retarded his Journey; but might have made it more Light by the Smell of the Flowers, and the Refreſhment of the Apple. Even ſo is it as to Wealth, Honours and Riches; <note n="q" place="bottom">1 Pet. 2. 11.</note> We being all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers and Pilgrims in this Life, which ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd but to a Day, becauſe of its ſhort Continuance. We travel towards Eternity; but in our way we muſt paſs through the Garden of this World, wherein we perceive Fruits and Flowers which tickle our Senſes. On one Side we ſee the Riches which our Parents have left us, or the Honour to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we have ſucceeded, with ſome Place or
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104476:74"/>
Dignity: Theſe are the pleaſant Fruits preſented to our Eyes. On the other ſide we perceive the Odour of Wine and of exquiſite Meats, rich Moveables, beautiful Faces: Theſe are as ſo many divers Flowers and Fruits, which charm our Smell; but if we ſtop to taſte and handle them, we hinder our Journey to Eternity, and we put our ſelves in Hazzard of being ſurpriz'd by Death, and devour'd by the Devil, who is always watching to catch us in this Strait. Muſt not one be very ill adviſed to amuſe himſelf with theſe <hi>Nothings,</hi> and loſe thoſe things of ſo great Value? We may indeed look upon all theſe earthly things at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, even with Contentment, and taſte them according as we have need of them, for they are created for us, while we receive them with Thankſgiving; but we ought never to faſten our Affections on them, elſe we ſhall never arrive at the <hi>LOVE OF GOD;</hi> For our heart cannot be divided between two ſo different Objects. He will <note n="r" place="bottom">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 3. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 26. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 10.</note> have all our Heart or none of it: And it can never be fill'd nor fully ſatisfied but with him alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That there muſt always be in the World Perſons plac'd in States and Dignities, tho' it were but to keep the People in good Diſcipline: That all the World could not abandon their Offices, and that I my ſelf was charg'd with one troubleſom enough: That I thought I held it of God, for that I did not ſeek for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I bewail you, with all thoſe who are at preſent in Charge: For it is very hard for them to keep themſelves right in it. I cannot believe that God will place therein any of his Friends, becauſe nothing is done any longer for his Glory; and the Evil is ſo far advanc'd that it cannot be reſiſted any longer; ſo prevalent is it, that the Good are obliged to give Place, and yield to it by Force: So that a good Man, now in Office, muſt ruin himſelf or give way to Evil: For he is too weak to reſiſt the Force of the Wicked, who are ſo numerous. Therefore I ſaid, heretofore, that the Good ſerve the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as his Slaves, becauſe they are oblig'd to acquieſce to Evil, through Force. In which, nevertheleſs, they do not ceaſe to ſin, by one of the nine Ways, by which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it on another; and theſe Sins are imputed to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they tolerate <note n="s" place="bottom">Ezek. 33. 8.</note> the Evil. It is not enough that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104476:74"/>
they cannot hinder it: For in not hindring it, if they could, they would commit likewiſe another of the ſaid Sins, which are committed in another, there being nine ways by which the Sins of another are laid to our Charge. At leaſt, thoſe who are now in Offices do commit that of Tolerating Evil, and cannot eſcape to do this if they do not abandon their Offices, wherereby they would ſhew that they love God more than their Offices, and that it was he who had plac'd them in them; but to believe that God has created or call'd us to any State, theſe are but Fopperies: Becauſe he has created us for no other thing but to love him, as I have ſo often repeated. States are our own Choice. God forces no Body to be a Pope, Biſhop, Prebend, Paſtor or Prieſt, nor yet to be an Attorney, Advocate, Counſellor, Preſident, Governour, or of any other ſuch Office and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice whatſoever. Every one is diligent enough to ſeek for them. It is not as in the former Times, when a S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and ſo others, did hide themſelves, that they might not be Biſhops, or receive other Dignities: Theſe were not in the Darkneſs and Ignorance in which we live at preſent, while we prefer Honours and Wealth to our Salvation, and that with ſo fine Pretences, that all the World judges we do very right in continuing in States, Offices and Benefices, believing the World would be much worſe if all theſe good Men ſhould abandon their Stations. And for my part, I believe it would be much better: Becauſe they would have more Leiſure to attend upon their own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Perverſneſs of the Wicked would diſcover it ſelf ſooner: Which remaining hid for a longer Time, does more Harm; becauſe an Evil known is eaſier avoided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: It was very evident that God had call'd ſome to Employments: He ſaid to</hi> Peter, <hi>That</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="bottom">Matth. 16. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>he was the Rock upon which he would build his Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> 'Tis true, Sir, S. <hi>Peter</hi> was call'd to the Building of the Church by Jeſus Chriſt: but he would have firſt a Teſtimony of him, to know if he lov'd him. He ask'd him <note n="u" place="bottom">Joh. 21. 15, 16, 17.</note> three times: The firſt to know if it was true that he lov'd him in the Sight of God; the ſecond, if he lov'd him by the Teſtimony of his own Conſcience; and the third, if he lov'd him by the Teſtimony of Men? to teach us that theſe Conditions are needful to be capable of Ruling well; to wit, the Teſtimony of God, that he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104476:75"/>
ſay of us, as he ſaid of his Servant <hi>Job,</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="bottom">Job 1. 8.</note> That we are his Servants; our own Teſtimony <note n="y" place="bottom">Job 27. 6. 1 Cor. 4. 4.</note> to ſearch if our Conſcience reprove us in nothing; and that of our Neighbour <note n="z" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5. 11.</note> if our Actions are ſuch as may make them judge that we truly love God. Theſe are the Conditions whereby to judge if God calls us to the Government of his Flock: In confirmation of which he gives all the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces requiſite to govern well, according to his Spirit. But when we perceive that we have neither the Love of God as to his Regard of us, nor as to a Teſtimony in our own Conſcience, nor yet in our Works, for the Edification of our Neighbour, we ought never to preſume that we are call'd of God for any State or Office. It is rather to be believed that we are puſh'd to it of our ſelves through Preſumption; and when we do not govern by the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of God <note n="a" place="bottom">Jer. 23. 21, 22.</note> we fall from one Fault into another, without knowing it. Our Natural Inſtinct makes us to govern all by Human Principles. That of the Devil makes us to act according to his Principles. And thus we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit threefold Evils when we do not govern purely by the Principles of Jeſus Chriſt. It were better to be Paſtors of Sheep than of Souls, and to be Subjects than Lords; for he who is in Imployments, Offices or Benefices, will not only render an account of his own Soul, but <note n="b" place="bottom">Heb. 13. 17.</note> alſo of thoſe whom he has under his Charge. A Pilgrim is well pleaſed to have no Burthens. He travels the more lightly when he has nothing but his own Body to bear, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhes his Journey the ſooner. Even ſo it is as to the preſent Times, in which nothing can be done any longer for the Glory of God. It were better for a Man to work out his own Salvation, than to charge himſelf with Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Benefices, which, if we remark narrowly, are ſought for, either for our Honour, or our Pleaſure, or our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, all which are vain and earthly Ends, unworthy of a true Chriſtian, who ought only <note n="c" place="bottom">Matth. 6. 33.</note> to ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven, ſince Jeſus Chriſt has promiſed to give him the reſt, which is but a contemptible thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That I was wholly prepar'd to quit all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Benefices, if I knew that it were the Will of God: That I would deſire rather to ſave my ſelf, than to poſſeſs all the Wealth in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:104476:75"/>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> This is a good Deſign, Sir; but if you wait till an Angel from Heaven come to tell you that this is the Will of God, you will never do it; for God has no Will to make you leave it more than he had any to make you undertake it. It concerns every one to examine what Mean will be moſt proper for him to facilitate his Salvation. One may ſufficiently perceive in his Conſcience, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting any Body, whether Offices, Eſtates and Benefices have been to us the means of more Union with God than if we had not poſſeſs'd them; and if they have made us draw others to the ſame Union. If we do not find this, it is to be feared that our Offices and Benefices have not been ſought for or poſſeſt for the Love of God, but for ſome Human Accommodation, which reſpects nothing but the Earth. This being diſcover'd, it is in your Will to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, if now you deſire to labour for Heaven, or rather for the Earth.</p>

                  <hi>I ſaid to her, That I would not pretend any longer to any thing upon Earth; that I was very ſorry that I had had ſome Pretenſions thereto, but that I durst not quickly abandon all, without the Advice of ſome learn'd Perſon, fearing that I might do evil.</hi>

                  <hi>She replyed:</hi> Sir, You are yet far from the Kingdom of Heaven, when you will needs adviſe with Men if you ſhall follow Jeſus Chriſt. Has not he ſaid <note n="d" place="bottom">Luke 14 26, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>He who leaves not Father and Mother, and his own ſelf, cannot be his Diſciple?</hi> Now would you go to ask Counſel of any Man, when Jeſus Chriſt has given you his? Where could you find better? Men are all intereſted in their own Judgment, and will never adviſe but what they judge moſt advantagious for Men, they having no Light to perceive any other thing. They are Fleſh, and judge according to the Fleſh. Would you refer what concerns the Salvation and Perfection of your own Soul to their Judgments? You muſt needs periſh with them: For the <note n="e" place="bottom">1 Cor. 3. 19, 20.</note> Wiſdom of Man is fooliſhneſs before God. All the Evils of the World do proceed from this, That Men are govern'd and adviſed by one another. Is it not ſaid ſomewhere, <note n="f" place="bottom">Jer. 17. 5.</note>

                  <hi>Ditch.</hi> For my part, I can ſay in Truth, That I do not remember that I ever committed any Faults, but when I believ'd the Counſel of Men. We ought to go to the Source, Sir, and let alone the Streams. The Goſpel is left us in Writing for our Eternal Rule. If the Apoſtles and other Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt had gone to ask Counſel of Men, they would never have follow'd him: For Men would have call'd it a Folly to abandon all, as they do yet to this Day: For being of the Earth, they reſpect nothing but the Earth, and are blind in the things of the Spirit. We can never do ill to follow the Counſels of the Goſpel, but indeed we may in following the Counſels of Men, how learn'd ſoever: For their Doctrines are of this World <note n="h" place="bottom">Joh. 3. 31.</note>, and that of Jeſus Chriſt is of God.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How to diſcern whether the Motions which do preſs us to leave the Outward Hindrances to Divine Communion, be from God or not. That there are likewiſe Inward Hindrances; and that one ought not to be wedded even to good Means.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Said to her, That I had not Light enough to be ſure of my own Motions, and to diſcern whether they are from God, or from the Devil, or from my ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> That it was good to diſcern them: <note n="i" place="bottom">Matt. 4. 1-10.</note> that the Motions from God do incite always to humble things, which the Devil and Nature do oppoſe, becauſe they are things deſpiſed by Men; and therefore theſe Enemies do abhor them. What comes from God incites to Sufferings and to Patience; the things which come from the Devil and from Nature do incite to ſeek our Eaſe and Pleaſures, without deſiring to ſuffer any thing. The things of God do lead to Poverty and Self-denial; the Devil and the Fleſh
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104476:76"/>
do deſire Riches, and ſeek to be eſteem'd and praiſed: In fine, Sir, ſays ſhe, what comes from God is always conformable to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt: For God cannot be contrary to himſelf. Therefore the Light which you have receiv'd, that moves you not to ſeek any longer for any thing upon Earth, is but too ſufficient to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you that this Motion comes from God; becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil nor Nature would ever rid themſelves of their Pretenſions upon each: For they cannot profit by any other thing: Nature could not ſin any more without aiming at earthly things; and the Devils could have no hold of a Soul which did not aim any longer at any thing upon Earth: We might walk ſurely on ſuch a Reſolution, without waiting for Counſel from Men, who with their Wiſdom do often quench the Lights of the Holy Spirit. It were far better to conſult the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I was conſtrained to yield to ſuch Truths. I ſaid to her, that I would abandon all, and would follow her all the Days of my Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid with Joy:</hi> Sir, How happy will you be to abandon all? Your Soul will be at liberty to fly unto God: Your Spirit will be calm and your Body better diſpoſed. You will experience thereby both Bodily and Spiritual Good: But I intreat you, do not reſolve to follow me always; for, as for my ſelf, I am willing to die alone; and as for your concern, it will be a greater Perfection <note n="l" place="bottom">Pal. 73. 25, 26.</note> that you be diſingaged from all Creatures, to the end you may wait upon God alone. All Company, how perfect ſoever it be, is not God. He requires our Heart ſo pure, that he does not ſuffer that it ſhould be divided. So long as I can be helpful to you, I love indeed to diſcourſe with you: But I wiſh rather that you may ſpeak with God, who is the Fountain of all Light. He can teach you more in one Moment than all the Men of the World would do in a thouſand Years. So ſoon as you ſhall have found his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, you will not be able to take Pleaſure any longer in any other. Speak to him always, Sir, until that he anſwer you. He will do it aſſuredly. According as you ſhall ſeparate your ſelf from the Creatures, accordingly you draw the nearer unto God: There needs but to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>move the Hindrances, and this Divine Sun will ſhine fully
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104476:77"/>
into our Souls, warming them with his Love. He has <note n="m" place="bottom">Luke 15. 20.</note> infinitely more Deſire and Affection to receive us, than we have to ſeek him, even tho' we be great Sinners; he rejects no body, he rather embraces them as the Father did his Prodigal Son. You are his Child, and the Work of his Hands. Go to your Father with great Confidence: He loves you: He ſeeks you and calls you. Do not delay any longer: Go forward, ſeek no longer for any other thing but him alone.</p>

                  <hi>With extream Joy did I hear this Diſcourſe, asking her by what means I might find this Communion with God, and what I ought to do to attain to ſo great a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She replyed:</hi> Sir, There are very few things to be done, but there are many things to be left and parted with. It is a great Point to quit Honours, Offices and Dignities; but theſe are all things without us. There are alſo within us which hinder the Operation of God, ſuch as <note n="n" place="bottom">1 Joh. 15. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>the coveting of all that pleaſes our Eyes, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life.</hi> If we could part with theſe things, we would preſently find God. For, if our Soul had no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances, it would fall into him, even as a Stone caſt from on high falls into its Centre, which is below. <note n="o" place="bottom">Prov. 4. 23.</note> Our Soul has God for its Centre; it can never repoſe it ſelf but in him. Therefore we can find no Reſt nor Satisfaction in the things of this World, which do only pull us out of our Centre, which is God. But if we could part with that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, that Concupiſcence, and that Pride which we have in our Heart, we would find our ſelves ſwallowed up in God, without knowing how. There is no need of doing much to find God, becauſe he offers himſelf <note n="p" place="bottom">Rev. 3. 20.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of himſelf. But we muſt labour to remove the Hindrances which our Vicous Affections do give him. In this the <note n="q" place="bottom">Luke 16. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Kingdom of Heaven ſuffereth Violence,</hi> for we cannot without Violence quit our evil Habits. God, in the mean time, does well deſerve that we ſhould force our ſelves to find him, ſo much the more, that by our Wickedneſs we have ſo baſely forſaken him for things of ſo ſmall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance: For all that can be coveted in this World paſſes away like the Smoak <note n="r" place="bottom">Jam. 4. 14.</note>: And what can the Luſt of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104476:77"/>
Fleſh give us, but Pains and Corruption? The Pride of our Heart is nothing but a meer Blaſt of Wind, which puts nothing within us. And theſe ſo inconſiderable things do nevertheleſs oppoſe themſelves to God, building, as it were a ſtrong Wall <note n="s" place="bottom">Iſ. 59. 2.</note> between our Soul and him, which hinders us from hearing his Voice and his Word. There are no other means but to break it down by Force of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.</p>

                  <hi>I ask'd her,; To what Place I ſhould retire, ſince ſhe would not that I ſhould follow her?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid to me:</hi> Sir, You will be well enough in any Place, provided you be with God. There is no Part nor Place that can ſanctifie you, but rather a Diſingagement from your ſelf. The World is great, and God is every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. It is not meet to affect a particular Place. It were better to roul from one Place to another; ſince we are Pilgrims upon Earth, let us walk always towards our Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, without conſidering in what Place we are lodg'd, for the ſo ſmall Time that our Life is to continue. Jeſus Chriſt had no houſe <note n="t" place="bottom">Luke 9 58.</note> of his own, yea not a Stone whereon to reſt his Head. So much the more as we are diſingag'd, ſo much the more ſhall we be united unto God. And this is the only Reaſon why I do not deſire your Company, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am nothing but a mere Creature, as you are, not a God, from whom you ought to look for all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That her Company had done me great good; That I had reaſon to deſire it as the true mean of attaining to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid to me:</hi> Sir, So long as you reſt upon any Means you will never arrive at the End: Means are good to be made uſe of, as we would make uſe of a Way to travel to ſome Place; but they are not good to be relied upon. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souls are deceived in this, who have ſtopt in the midſt of the Race, and never found God, becauſe they reſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Means: How Holy and Perfect ſoever the Means may be, they are never God, and we ought not <note n="u" place="bottom">1 Cor. 3. 21, 22.</note> to reſt but upon him alone. The Devil has likewiſe ſo many Holds, when he finds us wedded to any thing. He makes <hi>Mercury</hi> of every Wood. But when we are free of Matter and adhere to God only, he cannot take Hold of us on any Side.</p>

                  <p>How we may attain to Perfection and to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, reſigning our ſelves wholly to him, quitting both Human Learning and the being Taught of others for a Time. Chriſtians uncapable of being taught. They will be more deſolate than the Jews.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I Entreated, That, before I parted with her, ſhe would tell me in particular all that I ought to do, to have Communion always with God: That ſhe ought to give me all Saving Inſtructions.</hi>

                  <hi>She ſays:</hi> Sir, God ſufficeth you, and Jeſus Chriſt is your Maſter <note n="x" place="bottom">Matth. 23. 8.</note>; ſeek no other Means. <hi>He is</hi>

                  <hi>the Way, the Truth and the Life.</hi> He has omitted nothing in his Goſpel for the Teaching us all things: His Word is the Bread <note n="z" place="bottom">Joh. 6. 50.</note> which is come down from Heaven, for the Nouriſhment of our Souls. Do not ſeek any other Paſture; becauſe there are now ſo many wild Herbs, which are poyſonous. Feed only upon the Words which give Life <note n="a" place="bottom">8. 51.</note>, and you ſhall never die. If your Soul be entertaining itſelf with God, he will make it ſee all that it ought to do and avoid, more clearly than we perceive ſenſible Objects. Reſign your ſelf to him <note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. 37. 5.</note> and he will always guide you aright. Be not careful any longer for any thing; when you forſake all you ſhall find all. I have thus experienc'd it: According as I diſingag'd my ſelf from earthly things, at the ſame Time God reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd my Soul with Light and with Conſolation. I can give you no other Inſtructions but thoſe which I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd. I doubt not but you know much more than I: but your Wiſdom is Human. When you govern'd, it was but by Human and Natural Principles: All that Wiſdom
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104476:78"/>
muſt now be forſaken, ſince Jeſus Chriſt ſays, That he <note n="c" place="bottom">1 Cor. 1. 19.</note> will deſtroy it; and as a Child you muſt embrace the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Simplicity, for he ſays, <note n="d" place="bottom">Matth. 18. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>If we be not converted, and become as little Children, we ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Leave therefore all your Studies, Sir, and hear what God will teach you, and follow him.

If you have reſolved to quit your Benefices, quit alſo your Sciences: For they have not made you to know God, nor yet your ſelf. Therefore you have no reaſon to love them; but rather to abandon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her, If I ought not to preach any more, nor to teach any Perſon, ſeeing I might now do it with more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection than I had done it formerly; for I had receiv'd by her Diſcourſe much Light of the Truth, and of Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſays:</hi> Sir, Do not teach any Body until you have found Communion with God: For how can you give to another what you do not poſſeſs your ſelf? You have made ſo many uſeleſs Sermons, and ſo many Teachings without Profit for your ſelf or others: There is Time enough loſt, you ought now to employ it well. You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that you can do it with more Perfection than formerly: Which I doubt very much; for if you think to teach the People the Evangelical Life, and do not obſerve it your ſelf, <hi>this</hi> is <note n="e" place="bottom">Pſal. 50. 16, 17.</note> worſe than to hold your Peace, becauſe every one will have Ground to believe that it is nothing but a Formality, which muſt be obſerv'd in declaring the Goſpel, and that there is no need to put it in Practice, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they who teach it do not practiſe it themſelves. I think in this Caſe it were better to be ignorant of it <note n="f" place="bottom">2 Pet. 2. 21.</note> than not to practiſe it when we know it: At leaſt, it is a leſs Evil never to have underſtood it, than to have known it and not to practiſe it; tho' both are evil, becauſe all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are oblig'd to know the Goſpel, for we cannot without Guilt be ignorant of it; but to hear it ſo often, and for all this not to deſire to follow it, is a double evil, becauſe of the Ingratitudes which are committed in not practiſing what we know by the Grace of God. It is a Grace to be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104476:79"/>
caught, and an Ingratitude not to follow Inſtructions. Therefore you will do nothing but ſpend your ſelf in Teaching, and will not repleniſh others: Beſides, that in Teaching there is always the Hazard of Vain-Glory, becauſe Flattery <note n="g" place="bottom">Prov. 27. 14. 2 Theſſ. 2. 5.</note> is the Ruine of our Souls; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us that we have that which they ſay we have.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid unto her: That infallibly many would put in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the Doctrine of the Goſpel, if they knew it as I do at preſent, becauſe theſe Truths are ſo clear, that of neceſſity one muſt yield to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Do not engage your ſelf to declare the Truths which God now makes known to you: For they will not be well receiv'd by the Learn'd. You ought firſt to have overcome all Human Regards; which you have not yet done. Likewiſe you muſt have the Courage to expoſe your Life for this Truth. For otherwiſe you will be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt without any Profit; becauſe they would outragiouſly perſecute you if you ſhould declare the naked Truth of the State of the Church at preſent; and if you teach, that to be a true Chriſtian, one muſt obſerve the Doctrine of the Goſpel, they will altogether oppoſe you, and will affirm, That all they who are baptiz'd are Chriſtians, however Wicked they be. Thus you will have much to ſuffer, and will profit others nothing: Becauſe all that you might build up by Teaching of the Truth, the Learn'd will deſtroy by their Arguments, and will eaſily diſſuade People from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving you, even rejecting your Doctrine as Evil and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious; for they ſtudy nothing ſo much as to flatter the World <note n="h" place="bottom">2 Tim. 4. 3, 4.</note>, and ſpeak as they are deſirous to hear. They have forgotten that Jeſus Chriſt ſaid by his Apoſtle, That <note n="i" place="bottom">Gal. 1. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>he who would pleaſe men is not the Servant of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There can be no Preaching any longer without Reproof, but what flatters the Ear, and is agreeable to the People; for the Truth which <note n="l" place="bottom">Iſ. 59. 14, 15.</note> reproves is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approven by Men, that I believe, Sir, if you ſhould ſpeak publickly the Truths which I in confidence have told you, they would cut you off from the Church, declaring you an Heretick; yea, they would even purſue you to Death, becauſe they could not approve the Truth without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning themſelves, their Lives being contrary thereto;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104476:79"/>
and no Body hates his own Soul: Therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her: If I ought always to continue idle, without doing any thing, ſeeing I could not Teach nor Preach any more, and that I had no other Employment, for that I had paſſed all my Life-Time in Study, and in the Direction of Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Labour firſt for your own Perfection, until you be entirely united to God, and then you will be capable of other things. If there be no Profit to be reap'd among the Catholicks, you may go among the Heathens, and Hereticks, who will be more diſpoſed to receive the Truth than thoſe who are under the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others ſin through Ignorance, and theſe <hi>Romaniſts</hi> through Malice. Many Heathens would follow the Truth if they knew it, and likewiſe divers Hereticks, becauſe they ſeek and ask it always. Therefore we hear them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute willingly, to ſhew that they are not at Reſt, but ſeek and ask always after the Truth. But <note n="m" place="bottom">Rev. 3. 17. 18. 7.</note> the Catholicks do opinionately preſume of their Salvation, becauſe they eſteem themſelves the People of God, as they are truly, even as the Jews were, who are now abandon'd, but ſhall be converted <note n="n" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25—29. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 1—9.</note> ſo ſoon as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhall be overthrown. Thoſe will be truly capable of receiving the Spirit of Truth, acknowledging their Errors and Ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Labour, in the mean Time, Sir, for your own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and you will very ſhortly ſee that the Harveſt will be ripe, and that there will be need of Workmen. We approach ſo near, that I fear your Soul will not have ſo ſoon acquir'd its own Perfection, as theſe things will come to paſs. Therefore make haſte, fearing to be ſent away as an unprofitable Servant. Occupy the Talent which God has given you, for he will come very ſhortly to demand an account of it. Apply your ſelf to your own Perfection with the ſame Earneſtneſs wherewith you formerly applyed to the Perfection of others, without any Profit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her, If ſhe believ'd that the</hi> Roman <hi>Church would be Deſtroy'd and Ruin'd, and the Chriſtians ſcatter'd as the Jews are at preſent?</hi>

                  <hi>She replyed;</hi> Yes, Sir, and much more, for the Jews have continued conſtantly in the Jewiſh Law; tho' they be bodily ſcatter'd through all the World, they are, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs united in an uniform Faith and Belief, holding ſtill the Law which God had given them: But the Chriſtians <note n="o" place="bottom">Luke 18. 8.</note> have denied their Faith, tho' they be yet united Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily: How would they preſerve it in Time of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when all this Luſtre and this Magnificence of the Church ſhall be deſtroy'd, ſo that there ſhall <note n="p" place="bottom">Matth. 24. 2.</note> not be one Stone upon another in its outward State, no more than there is at preſent in its inward? This muſt needs <note n="q" place="bottom">Rev. 19. 2.</note> come to paſs, Sir, elſe God would not be Juſt, for the Jews might Reproach him with Reaſon, That they never committed ſuch an Infidelity againſt their God as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do. It is very true, they kill'd the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; but that was through <note n="r" place="bottom">Acts 3. 17.</note> Ignorance. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do kill it a thouſand times out of pure Malice. They believe that the ſame Body of Jeſus Chriſt is in the Sacrament of the Altar, and they give it daily unto Whores, Thieves, Murtherers and Sorcerers; and yet they make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they ſhall thereby receive Graces. The Jews ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believ'd that they obtain'd Grace in putting Jeſus Chriſt to death, as theſe Chriſtians do believe in receiving him unworthily: <note n="s" place="bottom">Matth. 27. 23, 24.</note> For <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid that he found no Fault in him, and was in great Fear to condemn him: And the Chriſtians go affrontedly to receive him, with a Soul full of Sins, believing, in the mean Time, that he is oblig'd to impart unto them his Graces, in Recompence of the Affronts which they do him.

               <argument>
                  <p>That all Chriſtians ought to Read the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Whether the Church can Err? Where She is; Where not.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid unto her: That the Jews and the Hereticks would be well-pleaſed to hear ſuch Diſcourſes, for they have ſome ſuch Sentiments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, I do not ſpeak <note n="x" place="bottom">Gal. 1. 10.</note> to pleaſe any Body, and I regard neither Jews, nor Hereticks, nor Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, but the ſtraight Truth, according as the Spirit of God manifeſts it to me. I have never converſed with Hereticks; but I have caſually heard ſome things ſaid of them which are much better than what the Catholicks do: Tho' it were in nothing but this, That they take Pleaſure to read the Holy Scriptures, and carry them everywhere with them, ſtudying them almoſt Day and Night. This is a very laudable <note n="y" place="bottom">Pſ. 1. 2.</note> thing; becauſe we ought always to learn what we ought to practiſe: If we do not learn it we cannot know it <note n="z" place="bottom">John 5. 39, 40.</note>. In the Bible the whole Law of God is contain'd, and alſo the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt; from whence may be deriv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d all the Nouriſhment of our Souls. If the Hereticks do not put it in Practice, they do ill as well as the Catholicks; but they have this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that they know the Truth if they will practiſe it. But the Catholicks are only ſtor'd with Books com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by Men, and depriv'd of that which God hath given us for the Nouriſhment of our Souls: It is juſt the ſame as if we would take from a Child his Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and give him an Image to ſuſtain him. He may look long upon it before his Body receive Nouriſhment and Subſtance from it. It ſeems to me a very ill thing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Chriſtians the Reading of the Bible in the Vulgar
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104476:81"/>
Tongue, ſince <note n="a" place="bottom">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note> it muſt teach us all that we ought to do and forſake, and the Advertiſements which God gives us, by his Holy Prophets, and by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf and his holy Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid unto her, That the Church had forbidden to read the Bible in the Vulgar Language, becauſe of the Abuſes which were thereby committed; for many ignorant Perſons would interpret it amiſs; from whence Hereſies ariſe. Secondly, Becauſe many Bibles were changed, and ſomething taken away or diminiſh'd from the Original.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She replyed:</hi> Truly, Sir, theſe are very weak Reaſons: They forbid to read the Bible in the Vulgar Tongue, leſt the common People do draw Hereſies from it; while the moſt part of Hereſies are introduc'd into the Church by the Learned, Prieſts and Monks, not by Simple Ones, who would never be follow'd in their new Errors; for they would have but ſmall Authority and Learning to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce them. If this Reaſon ought to have place, it would be more expedient to forbid it to the Learned, ſince they have invented all the Hereſies, and not the Vulgar: <note n="b" place="bottom">John 7. 48, 49.</note> Jeſus Chriſt taught the Simple People more than the Learn'd; to ſhew that he found them more capable and ſuſceptible of receiving his Doctrine than the Great and the learned were. And if all Chriſtians ought to practiſe the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, by the ſame Conſequence, they ought to Read and to Learn it. And if they will needs forbid the Reading of it, becauſe of the Abuſes which are committed thereby, they muſt alſo forbid the going to Church and to the Communion, where there are a thouſand times more Abuſes committed, than can be committed by the Reading of the Holy Scriptures, which was not made for the Learn'd, but for <note n="c" place="bottom">1 Cor. 2, 13, 14.</note> Saints, from whom Men will needs take it, ſhewing themſelves more foreſeeing than Jeſus Chriſt, to hinder Abuſes and Errors. If there were in the Church a Prohibition only to read the Bibles which are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of, there would be a Pretext to colour this Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; but ſeeing all are forbidden, it is to forbid what God hath commanded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her; Whether the Church might indeed err in this Prohibition, or in any other thing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:104476:81"/>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> No, Sir, the True Church can never err, becauſe God has promiſed that he will <note n="d" place="bottom">Matth. 16. 18.</note> always main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: But I would willingly know where the Church is at preſent. She can be no where but in the Souls <note n="e" place="bottom">Joh 8. 31.</note> which poſſeſs the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. Behold this is the only Place where the Church reſides. Who will ſhew me theſe Souls? I would gladly know them, I would love and follow them even to Death. I have not yet found this Happineſs. You believe it may be that it is the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe S. <hi>Peter</hi> did reſide there; and for my part, I believe that <hi>Rome</hi> is <note n="f" place="bottom">Rev. 18. 5.</note> the <hi>Babylon of Confuſion;</hi> that the Holy Spirit does no more govern there than you ſee it in your Chapter. You have Judgment enough to diſcern if the Holy Spirit directs all the Reſolutions which are there taken. He does it far leſs in the <hi>Roman</hi> College: For there he has no more Audience; and if he ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there in Form of a Dove (as he did at the Baptiſm of Jeſus Chriſt) all theſe Preſidents would caſt their Caps at him to chace him away; for they have no more to do with his Light, ſince they have made themſelves Gods <note n="g" place="bottom">Rev. 18. 23.</note> upon Earth.</p>
               <p>The Church therefore cannot err, but <note n="h" place="bottom">Jer. 7. 4. Mal. 2. 7, 8.</note> the Men who are call'd <hi>Churchmen</hi> may err, and do truly err in this Prohibition, by which Chriſtians cannot any longer read the Goſpel nor the Bible, in which is contain'd the Law of God.</p>
               <p>How then can they obſerve it, if they may not read it, in order to learn it? This is an Error which no Body is oblig'd to follow, becauſe the true Church cannot thus command it; for it is contrary to the Doctrine of Jeſus, who ſays, <note n="i" place="bottom">Matth. 26. 26, 27, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Take, eat, this is my fleſh; and drink, this is my Blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> And theſe Men will not have us to touch it, but as far as it pleaſes them to give it: Whereas Jeſus Chriſt ſays, Take ye it, and eat ye it. He ſpeaks to every one.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Word of Jeſus Chriſt, which is truely his Fleſh and his Blood. Of the Reading of the Holy Scripture, and of the forbidding it. How the Church cannot fail; and what is the Church, and what not.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That theſe Words were underſtood of the Eucharist, where we drink his Blood and eat his Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She reply'd;</hi> What perfect Senſe can you find wherein to apply theſe Words of the Lord unto the Euchariſt, ſeeing he ſays, That <note n="l" place="bottom">Joh. 6. 54.</note> 
                  <hi>he who eats his fleſh and drinks his blood ſhall live for ever,</hi> and yet ſo many thouſand Perſons, who commonly receive the Euchariſt, do live and die in their Sins? It would follow that the Words of Jeſus Chriſt were not true, when he ſays, <hi>That they ſhall live for ever.</hi> He has ſaid elſwhere, That <note n="m" place="bottom">1 Cor. 6. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>neither Whoremongers nor Drunkards ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelſs we ſee daily ſuch Perſons receive the Euchariſt. Can they live for ever without entring into the Kingdom of Heaven? There would be a great Contradiction in the Words of Jeſus Chriſt. He cannot ſave thoſe whom he condemns, nor ſay to thoſe who ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven that they ſhall live for ever. <note n="n" place="bottom">Joh. 6. 63. 2 Joh. 9.</note> It is aſſuredly his Word which he calls <hi>his Fleſh and his Blood.</hi> For whoſoever ſhall eat it, that is to ſay, incorporate it as the Nouriſhment of his Soul, it muſt needs be that he live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ever <note n="o" place="bottom">Joh. 8. 51.</note>; for this Word gives Life Eternal; and he who feeds upon it as on his daily Bread can never die; this is <hi>the Tree of Life,</hi> ſeeing it gave Life to all things. This Word <note n="p" place="bottom">Joh. 1. 2. Heb. 1. 3.</note> has created Heaven and Earth of nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:104476:82"/>
How ſhould it not give Life unto the Soul which receives it? And if it have the Force to tranſlate Bread into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as they teach, how ſhall it not change our Souls into the Spirit of Life Eternal, if we receive and incorporate it as becomes? Jeſus Chriſt ſaid <note n="q" place="bottom">Luke 8. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe are my Mother, my Siſters and my Brethren, who hear my Word and do it:</hi> To ſhew that he eſteems more the Receiving of his Word than the having contributed to the Formation of his Human Body, it being moſt certain that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was more happy in receiving and doing his Word, than in being his natural Mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That there were many Errors in the Church, if the Senſe that ſhe propoſed ought to be received: That it was very clear and intelligible, but it had never been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood after this manner.</hi>

It is a great Happineſs that it has pleas'd God to let us live even until the Time that he comes to enlighten the World, after that ſo great a number have periſh'd through Ignorance. We have no more deſerv'd it than they. Let us endeavour to apply it rightly unto our Salvation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out letting the occaſion ſlip, which is now ſo freely offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us. How many ſouls are there of ſuch a tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that they dare not reject a Sentiment which comes from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or any Decree of its College, fearing to offend God, becauſe they look upon it and take it for the Holy Church? I knew a Perſon of a very good Life, a Doctor of Theology, who ſaid, That if the <hi>Pope forbad him to read the Goſpel, he durst not read it any longer:</hi> So much was he preoccupied with this Belief, that <hi>Rome</hi> is the Holy Church! Upon this Suppoſition all the moſt pious do follow that which is Evil, without perceiving it, becauſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104476:83"/>
they have taught us that we owe a blind Obedience: As if we were permitted to <note n="s" place="bottom">Exod. 23. 2.</note> follow Evil blindfold; which is a great Error: For we are all oblig'd to diſcern <note n="t" place="bottom">Phil. 1. 10.</note> whether what we follow be good or bad. For Example; This Doctor could not abſtain from Reading of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, without offending God highly, tho' the Pope had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden him to read it, becauſe this Prohibition is contrary unto Jeſus Chriſt, who has brought <note n="u" place="bottom">Job. 6. 32, 33.</note> his Word from Heaven, to be the Rule of our Life, and the Nouriſhment of our Souls; and has ſaid, That <hi>it</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="bottom">Iſ. 59. 21. Matth. 24. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>muſt abide in us for ever.</hi> How could we caſt it behind us becauſe a Pope forbids it, who cannot deſtroy what God has eſtabliſh'd, nor forbid what he has commanded, without being Antichriſt? for all that is againſt Chriſt is aſſuredly Antichriſt. We may indeed believe and follow what the Pope and his Councils do ordain us, when they are things conformable to the Law of God, and the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt; which is no other thing but the Explication of the Law. Tho' this were taught us by the Devil himſelf, we could not do ill to follow it: But the things which are contrary ought never to be blindly follow'd. God has made us Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures, to the End we may diſcern Good and Evil. All the Blindneſs that a true Chriſtian ought to have, is to <note n="y" place="bottom">2 Cor. 10. 5.</note> captivate his Spirit under the incomprehenſible Works of God, not to captivate it to believe that that which is Evil is Good. A man muſt have loſt Senſe and Spirit to abandon himſelf to ſuch a blind Obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which, nevertheleſs the moſt part of pious Chriſtians do, who do yield in all things to the Ordinances of the Pope or of his Council. If this Miſchief be not ſhortly at an End, and if the Truth be not diſcover'd in this Point, all the World will periſh: Becauſe many things will be determin'd which will be againſt God, tho' it were nothing but the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Pope. It contradicts directly the Truth; becauſe no Man can ever be infallible how holy ſoever he may be. <note n="z" place="bottom">Matt. 26. 70.</note> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the firſt Pope, did expreſly deny his Maſter, and did really err <note n="a" place="bottom">Gal. 2. 11.</note> in diſſembling, becauſe of the Jews, for which S. <hi>Paul</hi> reproves him. Can it ever be ſaid, without Blaſphemy, that a Man is Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104476:83"/>
ſecing Infallibility appertains to God alone? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope nor any other can err or fail in following the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt; but in following their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or thoſe like themſelves, they may fail, and err greatly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her: How it was poſſible that God ſhould have left his Church for ſo long a Time in Errors?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, God has not left his Church in Errors, ſhe can never err nor fail; for ſhe is one and the ſame <note n="b" place="bottom">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> thing with God: As the Bridegroom is but one Fleſh with his Spouſe; even ſo the Church is but one Spirit with God: Therefore ſhe can never be left in Errors, not for one Moment. But the Errors which I diſcover to you, Sir, are in Men, not in the Church, for the Church is no where but in the Souls which poſſeſs the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, who have never err'd ſo long as they abide in it. The Church is a Spiritual and Inviſible Spirit, which renders it ſelf viſible by the Human Bodies which this Spirit ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. So long as theſe Bodies are animated and poſſeſt with this Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, they are all Members. which make up this Church: But if this Spirit withdraw himſelf, they are no more but Members of Fleſh, not Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church <note n="c" place="bottom">Rom. 8. 9.</note> Errors therefore are inſinuated into theſe Members of Fleſh, not into the Spirit of God. But whereas theſe Members of Fleſh did poſſeſs formerly the Spirit of the Church, they have retain'd the Name <note n="d" place="bottom">Tit. 1. 16.</note> after having loſt the Spirit; and their Souls being void of Faith <note n="e" place="bottom">Heb. 10 38.</note> God takes no longer Pleaſure in them, but they are abandon'd to the Spirit of Error. Not that God on his part leaves the Church to err; but theſe Men having forſaken their <note n="f" place="bottom">Jer. 2. 13.</note> God, have form'd a Church of Fleſh, which cannot be the true Church, which is a pure Spirit <note n="g" place="bottom">John 4. 23, 24.</note>; as God, who is not viſible but by his Works, ſo the Church is not viſible but by the Bodies of thoſe who poſſeſs this Spirit. It appears ſufficiently that what they now call the Church is not govern'd by Divine Principles, but by Human and Natural.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her: Whether the Pope, the Cardinals, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prelates, Paſtors, Prieſts, Monks and other Perſons, making Profeſſion of the Catholick Faith, were not the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> No, Sir, all theſe Perſons, tho' met and aſſembled in one and the ſame Place, do not make the true Church, ſo long as <note n="h" place="bottom">2 Joh. 9.</note> they do not poſſeſs the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. It is nothing but an Aſſembly of Fleſh, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Corruption. Every one acts there according to his own Senſe. There they propoſe and reſolve according to Human Arguments, not according to the Spirit of God, who is not to be found where things are manag'd only by Civil and Politick Meaſures, which do not regard the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, but human Accommodations. The holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit does not animate ſo vile Subjects. Nevertheleſs, he governs always the true Church, in what Place ſoever it be: <note n="i" place="bottom">Iſ. 59. 21.</note> He never abandons it. But who can diſcover it? It is ſo hid and unknown that no Body diſcerns it. It is a Treaſure hid under the Earth, of which Jeſus Chriſt has ſpoken by Parable, ſaying, That <note n="l" place="bottom">Matth. 13. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is like unto a Treaſure hid in the Earth; and that he who has diſcover'd it muſt ſell all that he has to buy this Ground, that he may find this Treaſure.</hi> There is no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, but in the Church; that is to ſay, There is no Salvation out of the Church; and not knowing where to find it, who can look for Salvation?

The Members, which at preſent they call the <hi>Church,</hi> are cut off from the Root <note n="n" place="bottom">John 15. 4, 16.

                  <hi>She ſaid to me:</hi> Sir, The Church is everywhere, where there are Souls poſſeſſing the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. There are no other Places proper or deſtin'd for the true Church to reſide in.

                  </gap>re. Since Jeſus Chriſt ſays, it muſt be ſought, this is indeed a Sign that it is hid and unknown. And likewiſe all they who ſeek <hi>Rome,</hi> do not for this receive all the reſt in Gift, ſince ſo many things are wanting to them, even after they are <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> Which would not befal a true Chriſtian, who would be content with what were purely neceſſary, with which God would always infallibly provide him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That I was not truly ſatisfied for the Good of my own Soul: That I would willingly know, where I might find the True Church, that I might have Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She replyed:</hi> Sir, <note n="q" place="bottom">Luke 17. 21.</note> The Church is within you. If you ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven only, let Jeſus Chriſt reign in your Soul by his Doctrine, then the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will be in your Soul, God being there. He reigns always where he is. He would reign in all the Souls of Men, if they did not put Hindrances thereto. The Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of our Souls is God, who being Salvation and Life, we ought not to ſeek without us the Church nor the Kingdom of Heaven. For he is not an Earthly and Temporal God, but Celeſtial and Eternal. The Church being the Word of God <note n="r" place="bottom">Joh. 17. 17.</note>, it is in us, ſince he cannot be without his Word, as we are always in the Place where we ſpeak. He is not Earthly; for Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <hi>That</hi> 
                  <note n="s" place="bottom">Joh. 18. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>his Kingdom is not of this World:</hi> It is therefore a heavenly Kingdom which is in us, becauſe God is there, whoſe Kingdom is Celeſtial and Eternal. Where then would you ſeek the Church and the Kingdom of Heaven but in the Centre of your Soul? That is the certain Place of its Reſidence <note n="t" place="bottom">Eph. 3. 16, 17.</note>. We may be deceiv'd in all other things, but not in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Truth. If every one had ſought the Church and the Kingdom of Heaven in the Centre of his Soul, there would not have been ſo many Perſons deceiv'd. Since they have ſought God without themſelves in ſo many divers means, they have gone aſtray from him by the ſame means by which they ought to find him; and whilſt they ſought for the Church in ſo many Maſters, Doctors and Directors, they have ſtray'd from that which is Holy, to follow a Terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Carnal Church. By this the Devil has reaped much, and repleniſh'd his infernal Granaries to our Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104476:85"/>
Therefore I intreat you, Sir, that you would not ſeek for the Church in any other Place but in the Centre of your Soul <note n="u" place="bottom">Matth. 24. 26.</note>: For there is ſo much Deceit under the Mask of Piety, that the moſt knowing are catch'd by it. Many are made Saints who are of the Synagogue of Satan <note n="x" place="bottom">Rev. 3. 9.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That I had not that Method to diſcern and find God in the Centre of my Soul; entreating ſhe would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to me the way how I might find him there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, you will ſee him by the Eyes of Faith. If you believe that God is everywhere, he is alſo truly in your Soul, and even in a ſpecial and particular manner, as a thing which is moſt like to him. He is in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, giving them Being and Subſiſtence, elſe they could not ſubſiſt. He is in the Herbs, Trees and other Plants, in giving them Vegetation. He is in the Animals, giving them Life as he does our Bodies: For if God were not in all theſe things, they would reſolve into the ſame No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, from whence they have been taken; for no created thing can keep ſo much as one Plant of an Herb in Life. It is God that does all. We ſee this with our Natural Eyes; how much more firmly ought we to believe that he is in our Soul, which is Divine and Incomprehenſible? This Quality comes nearer to God than any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: We cannot comprehend what a Soul is, no more than we can comprehend what God is. It has Qualities ſo approaching to him, that it may with Reaſon be call'd a dependent Deity: For we ſee indeed the Works which it operates in our Body; but we cannot ſee what it is but by its Operations, as we cannot know God or perceive what he is but by the Works which he produces to our Knowledge. Our Soul gives Motion to our Body, and Agility to our Underſtanding, makes the Memory to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and moves all the other Powers of the Soul. We feel and ſee that this is done in us; nevertheleſs no Body can comprehend how this is done, but we muſt confeſs that our Soul is a thing incomprehenſible, as well as God; and ſince there cannot be many Gods, we muſt conclude that God is the Centre of Souls, and that they ſpring from him as a Branch from the Root. And as Trees cannot bear Branches without having a Root, ſo the Soul cannot
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104476:86"/>
have a Being if God do not give and produce it. By which you may abundantly perceive, Sir, that of neceſſity God is the Centre of our Soul, and that it cannot move but by him <note n="y" place="bottom">Acts 17. 28.</note>, no more than the Body moves it ſelf but by the Motion of our Soul. This being ſo, we ought therefore to ſeek God where he is, and he being no where ſo expreſsly as in the Centre of our Soul, it is there <note n="z" place="bottom">Iſ. 26. 9.</note> that he muſt be ſought, as in the true Place of his Reſidence. And if you ask me the Method and the Way, to find him in the bottom of your Soul, there is no other, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all the Hindrances, caſting out of your Soul all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affections, that you may have no other but for him. Your Soul will no ſooner be free from all theſe Earthly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, than it will fall into God, as the Stone falls into its Centre. I know no other Method but this Diſingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from our ſelves, and from all other things, to find God, and to become one with him. I have ſometimes ſought him without me, by Actions which did ſeem good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I have ſince remark'd, that thoſe ſerv'd for Diſtractions; and the more I acted outwardly, ſo much the more did I ſtray from my God. Therefore, Sir, become wiſe by my Loſs, and do not loſe your Time in ſeeking means out of your ſelf; for they ſerve us often for Hindrances. Our Soul is his true Temple <note n="a" place="bottom">1 Cor. 3. 16, 17.</note> and the Place of his Reſt. Let us only remove all that is between him and our Soul, and we ſhall ſee him Face to Face, to ſpeak after our manner: That is to ſay, we ſhall ſee him clearly by Faith, and ſhall know him by the Operations which he will make in us, and ſhall taſte him by the Repoſe and Conſolation of our Conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I thought that I underſtood well enough this Truth, and that Faith dictates to us that God is the true Centre of our Soul: But to taſte him, and ſpeak ſenſibly to him, by his Operations and Notices, this was above my Capacity; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating her to tell me how this was done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid to me:</hi> Sir, The Soul is a Spirit, and God is a Spirit, and communicates himſelf in Spirit, not with verbal Words but ſpiritual Motives: Which, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs are more intelligible than the fineſt Eloquence of the World. God communicates himſelf to the Soul, as the Sun to his Rays; and the Soul to its God, as the Rays to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104476:86"/>
the Sun, by the great Unity and Dependence there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Soul. When once it is denuded of its ſelf it has no more need of Sight or Mouth to underſtand God, than we have need of Words to underſtand our own Conceptions. So ſoon as the Soul is diſingag'd from it ſelf it is ſo transform'd into God, that it is entirely ſwallow'd up in him, and becomes one thing with him, having no longer any Will but his, nor Deſires but what he wiſhes; and it does not move it ſelf any longer but by the Motions of God: So that the Soul and God are not any more but one and the ſame thing: And if you do not taſte God, and underſtand not his Will, it is aſſuredly becauſe there is yet ſome Hindrance. Do not afflict your ſelf for this, Sir, but take the Pains to diſingage your Soul as much as is poſſible for you. This is all that you can do. For to be troubled that you do not feel nor underſtand the Motions of God, would be a Preſumption; for if your Soul were capable of it, God would abundantly give it. He wants your Diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, fearing that you would abuſe his Graces in liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet to your ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I was wholly raviſh'd with Pleaſure to hear how God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates himſelf to the Soul: But perceiving that I was yet far from this Happineſs, I ask'd her, By what means I might be diſingag'd from my ſelf, and from every other thing, that my Soul might taſte God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid to me:</hi> It is very eaſie, Sir, to be diſingag'd from every thing, by conſidering what it is. For if we were not diſtracted and wandring in our Mind, it would be impoſſible that we could love our ſelves or other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Things. We cannot do it but through a Diverſion (or ſtraying) of the Mind: For if we ſeriouſly reflect and conſider what we love in loving our ſelves or other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we muſt confeſs that we are Senleſs. For what do we in loving our ſelves? we love a thing very Miſerable, Impotent, Unconſtant and of ſhort continuance, there being no created thing more ſubject to all ſorts of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries than we are in our ſelves, nothing more changing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more weak, nothing more periſhing. Is this capable of our Love? An Abridgment of all ſorts of Miſeries, more infirm than any Animals! and the things which are without us are yet of far leſs conſideration. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> for as ſoon as we have ſwallow'd them they are corrupted and chang'd into Putrefaction. If we love the Pleaſures
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104476:87"/>
of the Sight, this is a thing that paſſes in a Moment, and cannot give Satisfaction. The more we would ſatisfie our Senſes, the more they thirſt; for the <note n="b" place="bottom">Eccl. 1. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Eye is never ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſeeing, no more than the Ear with hearing.</hi> Even ſo of the Luſt of the Fleſh; Theſe are all inſatiable things, of the nature of Salt-Water; the more we drink of it, the more we thirſt. And, as for the Pride of Life, what does it put in us but a Blaſt of Wind? For if a Woman bow, or a Man be diſcovered in our Preſence, what does that give us? Theſe are all but imaginary Goods, which put nothing in him that loves them. If we would ſearch into theſe Truths, it would be very eaſie to ſtrip us of our ſelves, and of all created Things: For they are not at all lovely, but to thoſe who have loſt their Wits. Our Soul is created for things more great. It ought not to debaſe its ſelf to Objects ſo unworthy of its Love. It is very eaſie to forſake our ſelves, and all things, when we enter into the Conſideration of things that are everlaſting. All our Amuſements proceed from this, that we come not to the Knowledge of God and our ſelves: For if we knew God we could not any longer love any other thing <note n="c" place="bottom">Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 4. 7, 8.</note>; and if we knew our ſelves, we would hate our ſelves and all things, becauſe we have nothing in our ſelves which is not <note n="d" place="bottom">Tit. 3. 3.</note> hateful. Thus all the Love which we bear to our ſelves and to other things, proceeds from pure Ignorance and the want of Serious Reflection on our ſelves, and on all created Things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her; How I might make this Serious Reflection and diſcover the Nothingneſs of all created Things: And ſaid, That I muſt acknowledge her Saying was true, that there is nothing worthy of our Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I could not diſcover the cauſe of the Blindneſs of my Mind in this, ſince I had a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to diſcover the Truth, and to be taken up entirely with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, the Fault of your Straying, as that of all the World, proceeds from this, That Men amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſpeculation of viſible and ſenſible things by which they forget the inviſible and ſpiritual: And thus they go on always in a <note n="e" place="bottom">Iſ. 5. 12, 13.</note> Forgetfulneſs of God and of their own Salvation. Men do even ſerve for a Hindrance to one
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104476:87"/>
another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For being all full of theſe Diſtractions and Wandrings of Mind, they ſpeak almoſt of no other thing. One ſpeaks of his Health, another of his Meat, another of that which ſeems fair and good to him: And thus they fill one another's Minds with earthly Idea's, and they neglect the conſideration of heavenly things, upon which alone their Happineſs depends. That Application of Spirit which we give to our ſelves, to others, to our Affairs, Buſineſs or other things, which reſpect only this preſent Life, do rob us of that Time and Attention which appertains to God: For we are not created <note n="f" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15. 19.</note> for this preſent Life, but only <note n="g" place="bottom">Wiſd. 2. 23.</note> to live for ever with God. If we are oblig'd to remain here for ſome ſpace of Time, this is only to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Juſtice of God; who being offended by us, has deſtin'd this ſhort Life for the time of our Penitence: which being finiſh'd, he will pardon us, and reſtore us into our true Country, which is his Preſence. We ought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to aſpire after it, without pleaſing our ſelves in our Exile and Priſon. What Folly, to take Pleaſure in Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings! The Riches, the Honours and the Pleaſures of this World are all troubleſome and painful things, and we reckon them for Happineſs! We glory even in our Chains and Fetters! Our Sin has diſcovered our Nakedneſs, and its Shame has oblig'd us to cover our Body; and this ſame Covering which ought to ſerve us as matter of continual Confuſion, ſerves us, on the contrary, for Vain-Glory, which is altogether fooliſh, ſince our Habits are the Marks of Sin, and we wear them to glory in them.</p>
               <p>If you deſire, Sir, to diſcover theſe Truths, and to be entirely taken up with God, fix your Underſtanding on the Conſideration of all the things which are not God; and you will find them all Vain and Tranſitory, even your Life it ſelf: It paſſes every Moment, and ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be call'd Death than Life, for we die daily: And from thence aſcend to the Conſideration of God and of our Soul, which are things Solid and Eternal. You will by this Mean be oblig'd to love the one and forſake the other. But you can never make theſe ſerious Remarks, if you do not quit the Commerce of Men, and abſtain from all that is unprofitable, and what does not avail for the Glory
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104476:88"/>
of God. By the means of theſe Omiſſions, you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a clear Underſtanding of the Truth, and a continual Communion with God: For the Cauſe of our Blindneſs of Mind proceeds from this, that we divert our ſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with Men, or the other Creatures, who do diſtract us from the Knowledge of God and of our ſelves.

out of him. There is nothing but a Life truly Chriſtian, that is free and pleaſant, for it <note n="i" place="bottom">Rom. 14. 17.</note> flows from God the Fountain of all Joy and Pleaſures. An Human Life is a Life of Conſtraint. The Life of Sinners is a Life of Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. There is none but the Life of a true Chriſtian that is fill'd with Delights. The Human Life muſt force it ſelf, for to maintain it ſelf aright in State and Honour, and conſtrain its Nature and its Inclinations, to yield unto and pleaſe Men, fearing to offend or diſoblige them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are often conſtrained to bow as a Reed under the Power of the Great, or thoſe in Authority, having no more Liberty than the Good or Bad Opinion of Men gives us.</p>
               <p>The Life of a Sinner is <note n="l" place="bottom">Joh. 8. 23. Rom. 6. 16, 18, 22.</note> a real Slavery, for he is tortur'd with his own Paſſions, which do often ſerve as an Executioner both to Body and Soul, deſtroying both the one and the other. What Pain is there in doing Evil? What Diſpleaſures and Remorſe when the Evil is done! How is a Sinner hated by others, and a Burthen to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? He has not ſometimes the Freedom to ſpeak or lift up his Head, for fear his Sin be diſcovered. Is it not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more eaſie to abandon all, and to entertain our ſelves only with God, than to undergo the Yoke of a Human or of a Sinful Life? Seeing he who is reſign'd to God lives as a Child, without Care, who is carried in the Arms of his Father. He fears nothing <note n="m" place="bottom">Pſ. 91.</note> being under the Guard of the Almighty; he deſires nothing more <note n="n" place="bottom">Pſ. 73. 25, 26.</note>, for he has found all.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, Keep your Temporal Goods for your Entertainment: For he who has not wherewith to maintain himſelf now-a-days, when Charity is dead, would have Vexations to ſeek and find it: So much the more that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice requires rather to retain what we have lawfully acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for our own Nouriſhment, than to give it away, and to be oblig'd afterwards to ask of others. This Pretext of Voluntary Poverty hath introduc'd among the Religious great Avarice; for after having abandon'd their own, they ſeek with more Greedineſs the Wealth of Others than ever they did their own. Which obliges them to flatter People, and often to give way to evil, that they may have where withal to live, and they are unſatiable to augment and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it. It is a kind of Robbery to take the Goods of others by way of Alms, when we have the Means to live upon our own. But if you have more than ſuffices for your Entertainment, diſtribute it to Chriſtian Brethren, who have need of it, as the firſt Chriſtians did, ſo that <note n="z" place="bottom">Acts 4. 34.</note> no Body among them had need of any thing, becauſe the Rich did impart to the Poor what was neceſſary for them: There being then no Propoſal of Building ſo many Churches and Monaſteries as at preſent, which are built more for the Commodity and Pleaſures of Monks, than for the Glory of God, which does not conſiſt in material Temples, as it does in the Living Temples of the Souls of true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Theſe are <note n="a" place="bottom">2 Cor. 6. 16.</note> the true Temples of God, where he will reſide to all Eternity: But not in theſe Machines of Stone or Wood, which will periſh very ſhortly with their Builder; who will be oblig'd to ſuffer Poverty by Force, ſince they would not ſuffer it voluntarily, according to the Vows and Promiſes which they make publickly of it. If at preſent you do not find true Chriſtians, to whom to give of your Abundance, keep it, for the Love of God,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104476:90"/>
until you ſhall know them. His Mercy will very ſhortly form a great number of them. For to give to the Wicked is to co-operate to their Vices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having remark'd that ſhe ſpoke of the Deſtruction of Churches and Monaſteries; I ask'd her, If ſhe believ'd that they would be ſhortly ruin'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I believe that God will very ſhortly grant this great Mercy to the World, which is very deſirable, ſeeing that he cannot be known ſo long as this Luſtre of Honour and Riches rules in the Church. She will never be holy till after <note n="b" place="bottom">Rev. 19. 1-9.</note> the Deſtruction of all theſe viſible and magnificent Things, which have chas'd away the Holy Spirit, and have rendred it the <hi>Babylon</hi> of Confuſion. God can never be glorified in the ſame Place where Men do attribute all the Glory to themſelves; and the Church, cannot ſubſiſt but by the Virtue and Holineſs in which its lawful Bridegroom Jeſus Chriſt did eſtabliſh it. If ſhe be joyned and allied with Honour and Riches, ſhe has play'd the Adultreſs, and deſerves to be rejected by her lawful Husband, who has for ſo long a Time born with her Whoredoms, that they are come to a heighth, being become unſupportable to thoſe who have fully diſcover'd them. How much more muſt they be ſo to the clear-ſighted Eyes of her lawful Husband? We ought to wait for, yea <note n="c" place="bottom">Pſal. 137. 7, 8, 9. Rev. 6. 10.</note> to wiſh and deſire thoſe Ruins, which will diſcover where the true Chriſtians are. This Mask of Hypocriſy being taken off, we will ſee them with open Face: Which will be a far leſs Evil; becauſe there will be far leſs of Deceit in it. It is now as in a Comedy, where the Servant acts the Part of a King; and ſo ſoon as it is finiſh'd we will ſee indeed that the King was nothing but the Servant. Thoſe who reign at preſent in the Church, being ſtript of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, it will then appear whether they are Prelates for God, or for Mony and Honour.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her: If there was no way to appeaſe God by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Penances, that this total Ruin of the Church might be prevented, which is repleniſh'd with ſo great a Number of Perſons, as well of Prieſts as Religious, which make ſome ſay, that the Church was never ſo numerous, nor in ſo fine Order as now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She reply'd:</hi> Sir, There were never ſo many Religious, and ſo little of Religion. It is of this great Diverſity that Jeſus Chriſt ſaid <note n="d" place="bottom">Matth. 24. 2.</note>, <hi>Do you ſee all theſe things? I tell you, there ſhall not be be left one Stone upon another, that ſhall not be overthrown.</hi> The Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was only the Figure of the Church, of which Jeſus Chriſt ſpoke in a perfect Senſe, ſaying, That all theſe Orders, all theſe Prieſts, all theſe Religious Perſons and Zealots which compoſe the Church, with all other Chriſtians, ſhould be deſtroy'd after ſuch a manner, that two ſhould not abide together: So that all ſhall be deſtroyed and diſplac'd. Theſe things muſt needs come to paſs, becauſe all ſtudy to be Prieſts and Religious, and no Body to be a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Jeſus Chriſt cannot reign in all theſe things. He muſt needs demoliſh them, and caſt down the mighty from their Seats, and aboliſh the Wiſdom of the Wiſe; and then he ſhall reign. Would you, Sir, Pray, and do Penance, that Jeſus Chriſt may not reign? If his Kingdom be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable <note n="e" place="bottom">Rom. 14. 17.</note> from his Goſpel-Spirit, it muſt be eſtabliſh'd that he may reign there; and it cannot be eſtabliſh'd if Riches, Power and Honours be not baniſh'd out of the Church. For tho indeed he ſhould come bodily into the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104476:91"/>
World, as he did in the time of the Jews, he would not be received by the Church: She would rather Murther him a thouſand times, than either hear or follow him; for ſhe will Rule and not Submit, and will perſevere in the Glory and Wealth of the World, and contempt of the humility and poverty of Spirit, wherein Jeſus Chriſt has placed her. Therefore of neceſſity all theſe Riches, Grandeurs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, muſt be deſtroyed before Jeſus Chriſt can reign in his Church. He has no need of that great number of Prieſts, nor of the multitude of Monks. But he cheriſhes <note n="f" place="bottom">Iſ 66. 1, 2, 5.</note> Souls humbled and deſpiſed for his Word. All that ſplendor and that order which appears beautiful in Men's Eyes, is defective before the Lord, who has choſen Contempt and Reproach for our Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: Seeing the wrath of God was ſo great that it will not be appeaſed, we muſt reſolve to ſuffer; but it was very hard to ſee the total ruin of the Church, in which among others there might be yet a great many good men who would ſuffer innocently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, you do not know God yet, ſince you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that he is angry and will not be appeaſed, and that he does hard things in his univerſal Chaſtiſements; yea, that he ſeems cruel in making the Innocent to ſuffer with the Guilty. Believe me, Sir, all theſe Sentiments are Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which you utter againſt God, without knowing it, for want of not conſidering ſufficiently that God is a Being All-juſt, All-good, and All-powerful. If he be All-juſt, he can never commit Injuſtice; if he be All-good, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do an evil thing; if he be All-powerful, nothing can be wanting to him, nor fail him. How ſay you that his Wrath cannot be appeaſed, ſince an infinite Goodneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have Wrath.? <note n="g" place="bottom">Iſ. 27. 4.</note> And if he could not be appeaſed, he were not Merciful. If he <note n="h" place="bottom">Wiſd. 12. 14.</note> did a hard thing, this would likewiſe offend his Goodneſs. And if he ſhould make the Innocent ſuffer with the Guilty, he would act againſt his Juſtice. All which things can never be done by God. But our narrow mind not comprehending that Almighty Power, Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs, judgeth raſhly of God: We imagin that he is in anger when he does not pardon any more: And if we would fix our minds to conſider the reaſons why he does not Pardon, we would eaſily perceive
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104476:91"/>
that he <note n="i" place="bottom">Jer. 15. 1, 5, 6.</note> cannot in juſtice pardon any longer, becauſe our ſins are very numerous and without repentance: We love them, and we will not part with them. Muſt he then not chaſtiſe them if he love Righteouſneſs? and inſtead of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that they conſtrain God to this chaſtiſement, we ſee nothing but that God is greatly in wrath! as if he were ſubject to vicious Paſſions like to ours. We judge likewiſe that he will not be appeaſed when he chaſtiſeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtanding our Prayers; but we do not ſee that theſe Prayers are not effectual, becauſe they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <note n="m" place="bottom">Iſ. 1. 15.</note> regret and reſolution of amendment. We pray that God may pardon us, and not chaſtiſe us, <note n="n" place="bottom">Jam. 4. 3.</note> that we may the more peaceably continue in our Sins which peace and proſperity do nouriſh. Would God be merciful if he ſhould pardon us, or be appeaſed in ſuch a caſe? He would rather be unmerciful in being appeaſed, and in giving us time and means to ſin the more. Who does not ſee that our judgments are deceived, and that we would by them blame God for our own faults? as when we ſay, that it is a hard thing to have univerſal Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when we believe there are yet many good Men among others who are wicked, and do not perceive that the evil is univerſal when the puniſhments are ſo. The ſacred Hiſtory of the Scripture makes appear to us, <note n="o" place="bottom">Gen. 18. 32.</note> that God would have pardoned all that were in <hi>Sodom,</hi> if there had been but ten Righteous within it. We believe there are a great many good men according to our judgment, whereas it may be before God there are none; and even tho there were divers, yet it is a good thing <note n="p" place="bottom">1 Pet. 1. 6, 7.</note> that the Righteous be tried by Tribulation, for they teſtifie by it the fidelity they have toward God, in continuing conſtantly faithful to him in adverſity, as well as in proſperity; and likewiſe they thereby try themſelves: For many are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved who <note n="q" place="bottom">Mat. 13. 20, 21.</note> thought they were faithful to God in Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and yet Adverſities have made them ſtumble in the midſt of their Race, or they have periſh'd at the firſt eſſay of Temptation. So that God manifeſts always great Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and great Mercy, chiefly in ſending univerſal<note place="bottom">(k) <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 1.</note>

Rods, in chaſtning the Wicked, and in trying the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if there be any, who never ſuffer for the Guilty, but for their own Perfection and Merit. Univerſal Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being much more profitable to the Good than to the Evil, becauſe they purifie them and render them more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, whereas the wicked become worſe by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I was obliged to confeſs, That I had done a great wrong in ſpeaking thus of God, according to my Sentiment. I asked her how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ought to behave my ſelf, that I may not any more fall into the like faults, and that I might make a right judgment of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, never judge according to what you ſee outwardly, but give always time to your Spirit to examin the works of God, and you will diſcover that all that he does and permits is accompanied with <note n="r" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> 45. 5. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 89. 14, 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 17, 18.</note> Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Power, which are his Qualities, without which he does nothing. Men do deceive themſelves, and the moſt wiſe err in this point, when they will cenſure the works of God. In which they are real Ignorants; for if they had any ſmall Light, they would admire and adore them only, without making any judgments of them; for of neceſſity what they make is unjuſt, injurious, or raſh, becauſe no human Spirits are capable of <note n="s" place="bottom">Pſ. 147. 5.

We can only ſee that in them <note n="s" place="bottom">Pſ. 111. 7, 8.</note> there is all ſort of Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs and Power. If we conſider only a grain of Corn, we ſhall find in it theſe three things, Power is in its frame, becauſe no man is able to make a grain of Corn how Great and Learned ſoever he be. We percieve alſo in this grain the goodneſs of God, who gives ſo liberally to the Good and to the Wicked their neceſſary Food. We will there likewiſe find Righteouſneſs, becauſe having made Man ſubject to be nouriſhed with this grain, he provides it for him, even tho he be his Enemy, that he may find no injuſtice in God, to have ſubjected him to a thing which afterwards ſhould be denied him. He wills that we may comprehend aright that all his works are Juſt, and Good, and Powerful, tho we be ignorant how he makes them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Enquiry about the moſt Holy Trinity, and concerning Grace; and that the Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are miſtaken therein, none being Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Said to her: That I had committed a great many faults in this matter; that often I would needs dive into the works of God, even his higheſt Myſteries, ſuch as that of Grace and the Trinity; and that many holy Doctors had paſs'd all their Life in ſuch Studies, to declare how God begets his Word, or how God beſtows Grace differently.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She replied,</hi> Sir, It is very ill done for a ſilly Worm of the Earth to ſeek to comprehend that which a God does. It is enough <note n="u" place="bottom">Mic. 6. 8.</note> always for a Servant to know what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his Maſter in the matter of the duty of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, without its being permitted him to enquire into his moſt ſecret particular Affairs. He has performed his Duty when he has done that which is commanded and ordain'd him by his Maſter. Much more blame worthy is it that a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould inform it ſelf how God begets his Word, or how he diſtributes his Graces unto Men: This is beyond our Duty. We ought to reckon our ſelves very happy to learn that God has ſo much Goodneſs; <note n="x" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.20.-23.  9.1-6.</note> that he always imparts to us Grace ſufficient to enable us to love and ſerve him. Every one may find this in his own Conſcience; and Experience, which is the Miſtreſs of all Scienc, can teſtifie that every one has received Grace from God, even tho he be a great Sinner. What need is there after this to inform our ſelves how God gives theſe Graces? Or if he give more to one than to another? If this be not to ſeek matter to condemn God of Partiality, or to make him have reſpect of Perſons, and ſo to render him leſs Lovely.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:104476:93"/>There is yet leſs ground to inform our ſelves what the Holy Trinity is, for no body is capable of comprehending it, nor yet how the Father <note n="y" place="bottom">Prov. 30. 4.</note> begets the Son; ſo much the rather, that to render unto God agreeable Service, there is no need of knowing any other thing than what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and ordains us. <note n="z" place="bottom">John 14. 21.</note> What is more is unprofitable or evil; for all that we ſhould be able to ſay or know of the Trinity, cannot but greatly leſſen the glory of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is above all that is moſt Beautiful, moſt Good, and moſt Great. There is nothing that can be compared to God; neither are there any words that can give us the leaſt ſignification of the Being of God, who comprehends all things. If God were Man, we would ſay that his Heart is the Father, His Mouth the Son, and his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Holy Spirit; becauſe the Heart of Man is the feat of Love; his Mouth is the Channel by which this love is communicated; and his Underſtanding is the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wherein the Conceptions do grow to make his Love be comprehended. Theſe three things are but one Perſon tho it have theſe three diverſe Operations. The Holy Trinity is but one God, who is all Love, <note n="a" place="bottom">1 Joh. 18. 8.</note> he loves Man incomprehenſibly. We may call this Love <note n="b" place="bottom">1 Joh. 4. 10, 14.</note> the Father. Now, no Being is perfect if it be not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. The Word has communicated unto Man this Love; therefore it may be call'd the Son. <note n="c" place="bottom">Joh. 1 14.</note> And this Word can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be comprehended without Underſtanding, which has likewiſe been given unto Man to comprehend this Love; which underſtanding may be call'd <note n="d" place="bottom">1 Joh. 4. 13. 5. 20.</note> the Holy Spirit. All three together are but that ſole Love, which is God. There is not in the Holy Trinity a Man, a Child, nor a Dove, as they paint it unto us; but theſe are all Figures to make us conceive ſomething of God, who nevertheleſs is unconceivable: And all that they can ſay to us of him are but contempts or reproaches which we commit againſt God; for he is not to be compar'd to any thing. We muſt force our ſelves to love him, not to comprehend him. The Saints themſelves committed great faults while they would needs embark into theſe Studies. I believe the Devil has
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:104476:93"/>
raiſed Diſputes thereupon, to amuſe Men in uſeleſs things, rather than profitable, and to ſeek to comprehend what ought to be adored.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her, if the holy Doctors could indeed have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch faults, ſince we held that they had the Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir, they committed many others through Ignorance: They err'd in many things: The Holy Spirit did not always guide their Pen, nor their Underſtandings: They were always frail Men ſo long as they lived upon Earth. They might always fail and err; for Jeſus Chriſt ſays, that <note n="e" place="bottom">1 Joh. 1. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>He who ſays he is without Sin, is a Liar.</hi> I believe I have alſo told you heretofore Sir, that none is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible but God. Men who have the Holy Spirit, are not always ſo diſengaged from themſelves that the Holy Spirit has that abſolute dominion over them. Their own ſenſe of things gives them frequent hindrances; and as long as they act naturally, they ſtray from the Holy Spirit, and do often commit in theſe wandrings great faults, as <hi>David</hi> did, <note n="f" place="bottom">1 Sam. 11. 16. 4. 19. 29. 24.</note> tho God ſays, that <hi>He was a Man according to his own Heart:</hi> And <hi>Solomon,</hi> who <note n="g" place="bottom">1 <hi>Kings,</hi> ii. 4. ii.</note> had received the Spirit in fulneſs, did notwithſtanding Sin greatly againſt the Faith it ſelf, and againſt the Commandments of God. You muſt not wonder therefore that the Holy Fathers have committed faults in the Church; the Apoſtles themſelves committed them, <note n="h" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> ii. 2 14.</note> though they had viſibly received the Holy Spirit. We muſt never build on a Foundation ſo weak as Men are: They may all err, tho they were Saints, and have erred in many things in upholding the Church: For as ſoon as they perceived that it failed in the Souls of Chriſtians, and that its Honour and Authority was fallen, they would needs redreſs it by worldly Honours and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and even defend it by Diſputes and by Arms; all which things are Buildings made with Mens hands, which ſhall be ruined. <note n="i" place="bottom">Pſ. 127. 1.</note> For that which God has not built, ſhall be Deſtroyed. Jeſus Chriſt knew far better the means that were proper to uphold his Church: He ſaw the time to come as well as the preſent.

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Holy Spirit ſends always new Influences; and that we muſt not bound his Lights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the Interpretation of the Scriptures to that which the Holy Fathers have formerly had.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Could not reſist ſo clear Truths, perceiving well that all Men are Fallible: But becauſe every one had always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Opinions of the Holy Fathers, as things certain, I ſaid to her, that I had ſworn to receive no other Explications of the Holy Scriptures, but thoſe of the Holy Fathers; and that the Church did oblige all Perſons plac'd in Dignities, to do the ſame: So that in all Benefices received, they ſtill take this Oath before they enter in poſſeſſion of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, the Church can oblige no body to reſiſt the Holy Spirit. Your Oath is not obligatory in this caſe. If God favour you, or ſome other Perſon of your Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with any new Light, muſt you reject it to obey Men? Jeſus Chriſt did not forbid this. On the contrary he has ſaid, <note n="m" place="bottom">Joh. 20. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Receive the Holy Spirit:</hi> And <note n="n" place="bottom">14. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>When he ſhall come, he will teach you all things.</hi> He ſpeaks to the Apoſtles, and to all Chriſtians in them. This Holy Spirit is never idle: He operates always new Graces in thoſe who receive him, and gives ſtill more clear Interpretations of the Holy Scriptures <note n="o" place="bottom">Jer. 30. 24. Dan. 12. 9.</note>; according as the end of the World approaches we ſhall every day underſtand them more clearly: We ſee the figure of this in the Sciences of Natural things: There is at preſent more knowledge of them than ever, and Men now do know much more of Natural things, which thoſe who are gone before us were ignorant of, yea, underſtood them in a ſenſe quite contrary to the truth. They taught that the Sun goes round about the Earth: Now they teach that the Earth turns, and that the Sun is fixt; which is more to be believed. And thus
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104476:94"/>
in many Natural things they have diſcovered many Secrets ſince Sciences were encreas'd: The Figure is never ſo accompliſh'd as the thing figured: Wherefore then ſhould the Light of the Holy Spirit, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Holy Scriptures be bounded to what the holy Fathers underſtood of them? Every one of them had Diſcoveries according to his Talent, and no more. I believe Sir, that if you examin them narrowly, you will find that they do not accord in all things; yea, even that they ſometimes contradict one another, which cannot come from God; for there is never any contradiction in him. Each of the Fathers ſaw as far as his view reached, and no more. God does always farther diſcover his Secrets. Can Men cauſe others to ſwear, or can they ſwear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they ſhall not receive any other Diſcoveries, but that which the holy Fathers have received, without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Grace and Light of God? This would be, to ſpeak after our way, to clip the wings of the Holy Spirit, that he might not flie farther than Men had marked out to him. Truly Sir, there are great Errors in all things. It ſeems Men would take from God Power and Authority to attribute it to themſelves, giving him Laws, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Men to obey him. The holy Fathers could not be ſo raſh as to believe that no body could underſtand the Holy Scriptures farther than they, for they affirm that there are depths of hidden Treaſure, which they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. In effect I believe that nothing has been yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <note n="p" place="bottom">1 Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>I ſaid to her, that this Oath was not ordained to oppoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the Holy Spirit, but rather to hinder every one from Interpreting the Scriptures after his own way, from which many Errors might proceed, if there were not an uniform Belief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She replied,</hi> Truly Sir, you cannot cover theſe Evils, for they are too manifeſt. Whether this oppoſition to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit be made directly or indirectly, it is always evil. They may indeed perſwade the People to believe that the Holy Fathers had more light for underſtanding the Holy Scriptures, than Laick Perſons, taken up about the Affairs of the World: But to oblige Prieſts to take Oaths not to receive any other Interpretations than thoſe of the ancient Fathers, is to make them Swear indirectly that they ſhall oppoſe the Holy Spirit; Seeing they would believe they falſified their Oath in receiving a new Light of the Holy Spirit, which the Fathers had not received. If new Light muſt come before the end of the World, and the Prieſts have ſworn not to receive it, Laicks receiving it will be yet leſs approved by that which you call the Church, than the Prieſts, who have the firſt Rank there. To whom then ſhall the Holy Spirit addreſs to ſpread his Light upon the Earth? He muſt of neceſſity beſtow it on the Turks, Jews, or Heathens, ſince thoſe who are called Chriſtians will not, or cannot receive it, for fear of falſifying their Oath. And if God reveal his Secrets to Babes, <note n="s" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mat</hi> ii. 25.</note> as he ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily does; who among the Chriſtians would receive this Revelation?

If the Church were that which Jeſus Chriſt brought from Heaven, it would be always uniform, and guided by the ſame Holy Spirit. There would be no need to fear that every one would Interpret the Holy Scriptures after his own way, for there could not be but one and the ſame Belief: For all would be Saints, and capable of Interpreting the Scriptures; yea, <note n="t" place="bottom">Joel 2 28, 29.</note> even of Prophecying, according as God, who is free, ſhould grant Light to every one; tho Men would indeed Captivate and limit him by their new Laws.</p>

                  <p>How and wherefore the Holy Scripture has not been underſtood in a perfect Senſe, as yet in any thing; which is ſhewn by new Explications, touching the Creation of Man, his Fall, the Coming of Jeſus Chriſt in Diſgrace, and his coming in Glory upon Earth, to reign there for ever. Of the Glorification of the Creatures, both Animate and Inanimate; and what makes Paradiſe and Hell; and that univerſal Plagues and Rods ſhall preceed all theſe things.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>HAving remarked that ſhe ſpake ſo often of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which ſhe ſaid had not been underſtood hitherto in their perfect Senſe; I asked her how ſhe could ſpeak of them, ſince ſhe had told me that for a long time paſt ſhe had not read them, nor made uſe of any Books; and from whence could ſhe know that they were not underſtood in their perfect Senſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, I will tell you, truſting in your Secrecy, that God hath given me the underſtanding of all the Holy Scripture, without having read it; and when by chance, or caſually I hear Sermons or other Conferences to Explain it, I perceive plainly that they do not ſpeak of it in its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Senſe. Sometimes they explain ſomething in part, and at other times in a ſenſe altogether contrary, or ill applied, for what they ſay is repugnant to what I know in my Intercourſe; and the Spirit of God cannot have contrary Senſes; either the one or the other muſt be deceived. As for me, I think my Sentiment is immediately given to me from God, becauſe I never ſtudied nor learned any thing from Men; and this likewiſe cannot come from my Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, becauſe I never give way to Speculation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to know nor learn any thing; for I ſtop my Ears to all that they would teach me, fearing leſt there ſhould
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:104476:96"/>
remain in my Underſtanding any Idea's of the Things which I had read or heard, which would mingle themſelves with the Light which God gives me. I would be very preſumptuous to believe that theſe ſo clear Interpretations come from my ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her, That I remember ſhe had divers times cited ſome Paſſages of Scripture, and even referr'd to the Chapter of the Text, as ſpeaking of the laſt Times, in the 24th Chapter of S.</hi> Matthew, <hi>entreating me to read it: asking her, How ſhe could know this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid to me:</hi> Sir, I have read ſometimes tranſiently the New Teſtament, having obtain'd Permiſſion of a certain Biſhop: But as ſoon as I began to read I perceiv'd in what I read, all my Sentiments explain'd, ſo that if I were to write the Sentiments which I carry within me, I ſhould compoſe a Book like that of the New Teſtament: ſo much do I find them altogether conformable. And it ſeeming to me that it would be uſeleſs to read what I did ſo ſenſibly poſſeſs, I left off to read, except where there was occaſion to ſpeak of the Goſpel, or any other thing contain'd in the ſaid Teſtament, I was then well pleas'd to cite it, that by this mean, my Saying might be more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd by the Holy Scripture, than by my ſimple Word: tho' it be altogether conformable thereunto. And that 24th Chapter of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> is ſo much the more in my Heart that I ſee it treats of the Time in which we are fallen at preſent. I wiſh all the World would read it, that they might apprehend the more the Danger in which we live, without perceiving it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her; I had read that Chapter divers Times, and, nevertheleſs did not comprehend that it ſpoke of this preſent Time: entreating ſhe would explain it to me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I will do it, by the Grace of God: But I muſt have Time to reſt: Let us ſtill go on our Way; and how ſoon I ſhall ſtop, I will give you that Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Writing. <note n="*" place="bottom">See this Explication in the laſt Letter of the Firſt Part, of <hi>La Numiere n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

That will be a ſmall Sample; which will
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104476:96"/>
ſhew what the whole Piece will be. For it ſeems to me, that I will be oblig'd one Day to explain all the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in general; but for this end I will need to keep my ſelf without the Reach of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, becauſe by ſpeaking the Truth of it, I will be liable to their Reproof. Truth does alway ſhock Lying, as Righteouſneſs does Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: I know I cannot but ſpeak the Truth, and alſo that they who do not follow it, do reſiſt it. For this cauſe they kill'd the Holy Prophets and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, becauſe they bear Witneſs to the Truth. I can expect no leſs Recompence from Chriſtians now; for they being without the Truth will ſtrongly reſiſt it; and practiſing Unrighteouſneſs, they will not ſuffer Righteouſneſs in their preſence; becauſe it would reprove them: I can very well hold my Peace, as I have done for ſo many Years by-gone: But when God ſhall will that I ſpeak, I will cry to all the World, <note n="t" place="bottom">Matth. 10. 27, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>without fearing thoſe who can but kill the Body.</hi> Death would be agreeable to me, if with it I could enlighten my Chriſtian Brethren, and draw them out of Error.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That the Church did not put to death the Holy Fathers, who had explain'd the Holy Scriptures: But, on the contrary, had honour'd and eſteem'd them: That neither ought ſhe to be afraid of being ill treated by them: but rather receiv'd and approved in explaining the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid to me:</hi> Sir, You would always excuſe this Church, becauſe you have eſpous'd her, as I have alſo done. It proceeds from this, that you do not yet diſtinguiſh what the true Church is, tho' I have ſo often ſpoke to you of it. The Church, in a perfect and defin'd Senſe, is no other thing but the Souls <note n="u" place="bottom">Joh. 17. 19-, 26.</note> which are united in Heart and Will wholly unto God. Theſe are his only Spouſes. He never had any others, no more under the Old Teſtament than the New, yea from the Beginning of the World, and will never have, even to the End, yea throughout all Eternity. Nothing can be the Church, but that which is united wholly unto God: No more than a Woman can be a Man's Spouſe, if ſhe be not united to him. For if ſhe joyn her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to another ſhe is an Adultreſs; the ſame is it, without Compariſon, in the Alliance which God makes with Souls.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104476:97"/>
If <note n="x" place="bottom">Hoſ. 2. 2.</note> they withdraw from him, and joyn themſelves to any other thing, they are Adultreſſes, and worthy of being divorc'd. If God permit a Man to forſake his Wife for Whoredom, wherefore ſhould not this Law be obſerv'd by himſelf? If <hi>Rome,</hi> with its College, does remain united to God in the Spirit of Truth, ſhe is the Church, and his Spouſe: But if ſhe be ſeparated from that Truth and Righteouſneſs, ſhe is no more but a Civil and Political Aſſembly. Make always this Diſtinction, Sir, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you will be deceiv'd, taking Falſhood for Truth. If there were a thouſand Popes, with as many Counſellors, aſſembled, and if they did not poſſeſs the Spirit of God, they are not the <hi>Church;</hi> but if a ſimple Woman, that ſpins on a Diſtaff, do poſſeſs the Spirit of God, ſhe is the <hi>Church.</hi> The Holy Fathers were not ill treated by <hi>Rome,</hi> in expounding the Holy Scriptures, becauſe there were yet perhaps in their Time, in thoſe Aſſemblies, ſome Souls, which were Churches, and who, by confequence, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Truth: But at preſent this Support is not to be expected, but rather mortal Perſecutions. An evil thing, Sir, ought not to be maintain'd blindly, as if it were good: Therefore God has given you a good Judgment to make this Diſtinction; for if you continue always fix'd in the Reſolution, to take this outward Body of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church for the Holy Church, it is in vain for me to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to you her Evil and the Infidelity ſhe has committed toward her lawful Husband. You would do as he who would permit his Wife to play the Adultreſs, in diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling it without being deſirous to know or diſcover it. The Sin is as great to tolerate it, as to do it. If God permit me to ſpeak the Truth openly to that Church which you eſteem, you would ſee with Regret how ill ſhe would treat me, you could not deliver me from the Peril, to which your pious Belief would expoſe me.</p>

                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That for the Expoſition of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſhe needed offend no Body: That this was but what God had declar'd unto us: That every one ought to deſire to have ſtill a more clear <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of them, yea even the Wicked themſelves, that this ought not to diſpleaſe them. I entreated her to write boldly.</hi>

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> When you ſhall read, Sir, the 24th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I have promiſed you, it may be, you will change your Opinion; for the Word of God <note n="y" place="bottom">Heb. 4. 12.</note> is like to a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged Sword. Truth cuts all that it meets with, in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to it: So that without reſpecting any Body, we cut all ſorts of Errors and Lies, in following only the ſtreight Truth blindly; and without knowing it we do often wound thoſe of whom we are not thinking. If the Word of God were well explain'd, it would offend all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that live now in the World, yea thoſe who are eſteem'd Holy and Perfect. For as we do not ſee ſo many little Atoms flying in the Air when the Sun does not ſhine bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as we do when he ſpreads his Beams clearly; even ſo the Souls which are full of Sins and Imperfections, <note n="z" place="bottom">Rom 7. 9.</note> do not perceive them ſo long as the clear Underſtanding of true Perfection is not given them. They believe that they are very clean; but ſo ſoon as this Divine Light ſhall give its Rays, every one will ſee evidently that he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, that he has no Righteouſneſs, and that he is no true Chriſtian. Therefore the Devil will hinder, as much as he can, this Light from being diſcover'd, and will oppoſe himſelf thereunto, even by thoſe that have moſt Authority; that very few may perceive their Blindneſs: For if theſe Explications were maturely conſider'd by every one, all the World would be converted, for there is nothing more charming than to conſider that which God has done for Man from his Creation, and continued even till now, which is nothing but a continued Courſe of Benefits, all corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding to one another, always in great Perfection. The Creation, the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, the Goſpels, are all the ſame thing, by an excellent Harmony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her; Whether the Ancient Fathers had not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd theſe things aright, and if they had not declar'd this to the World by ſo many Expoſitions and Books which they had written?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, It was not neceſſary that the Ancient Fathers ſhould have the Underſtanding of all things: It was enough that they underſtood that which Men had need of then; but ſince we draw near to the Fulneſs of time, it is expedient for Men now, that they learn that which muſt fall out in their Time. Therefore God now reveals
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104476:98"/>
the Secrets which he would then have to be kept hid. When the Apoſtles ask'd Jeſus Chriſt, when theſe things, which Jeſus Chriſt had told them, ſhould come to paſs? He anſwer'd them, <hi>That</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Act. 1. 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>it was not for them to know the Times, which the Father had in his own power:</hi> To ſhew, that unſeaſonable Light ought not to be deſir'd; and that to him alone appertains the knowing the Time and the Hour of all things. Thus he thought fit to reſerve the Underſtanding of the Scriptures, till the <note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 24. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 4.</note> neceſſary time, which is at preſent. The Holy Fathers could not know then what he would reſerve till now; and all that they declar'd of it by ſo many Expoſitions and Books, was but what they could know by Divine Light, joyn'd to their own Conceptions, which were not always guided by the Holy Spirit: For their Studies and proper Sentiments often hindred this Knowledge, and ſerv'd for Clouds to that Divine Sun, who could not dilate his Beams fully upon their Souls, becauſe they were not entirely free and diſingag'd from their own Idea's and Preoccupations. It is true, they ſaid many things uſeful for that Time, but not ſufficient enough to enlighten thoſe of the preſent Time. All now muſt be known as it is. The Prophets have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed declar'd all that muſt come to paſs, even to the End of the World; but neither they themſelves, nor any others underſtood their Sayings; Jeſus Chriſt himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd what they had ſaid, by <note n="d" place="bottom">Matth. 13. 34, 35.</note> Parables, not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give the Underſtanding of them, but only tell them: That they might adore the Marvels of God, when they ſhould ſee the Things come to paſs, which had been for ſo long a Time foretold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her; If ſhe had received from God thoſe Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, which have been for ſo long time hid from all the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir, I may ſay it with Confuſion, That it hath pleaſed God to communicate his Secrets to me, which he had <note n="e" place="bottom">Matth. 11. 25.</note> hid from the Wiſe and Great of the Earth. If ſuch has been his Will, who can reprove it, or find Fault with that which he finds good? Is not he the abſolute Lord of all things?

for no Body is capable of giving Law to him. He is as Powerful as Juſt and Good. Let us only adore his Deſigns. Tho' I were even the moſt wicked Creature of the World, he might ſerve himſelf of me in what pleaſes him, and damn me in the End if I have merited it. All things being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him, all things muſt obey him, the Infernal Powers as well as the Celeſtial and Terreſtrial. Nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt his almighty Arms. I muſt ſubmit, Sir; if God will declare his Marvels by me, I cannot hinder him. If he will ſpeak by a Stone, or Wood, he ought to be heard with Reſpect. I have not ſought nor ask'd theſe things; they have been pour'd into me inſenſibly: When once I deſired no more to know any thing, I have learn'd all things, even to the greateſt Myſteries of our Faith, and all that ſhall befal Men, even to the End of the World. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has been conceal'd from me. I know the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces of the Works of God, and the Accompliſhment of the Holy Scriptures: The Re-eſtabliſhment of the Holy Church, and the Reign of Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth: The Alliance which he promiſed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the Things which are foretold by the Holy Prophets. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall paſs without having its accompliſh'd Senſe, and its preſent Accompliſhment in the Myſtical, Literal, Divine and Material Senſe. It it an Abyſs <note n="f" place="bottom">Pſal. 92. 5, 6.</note> of Joy to think of it. What Joy to ſee it <note n="g" place="bottom">Rev. 19. 7.</note> brought to paſs! If you ſaw it as I do, Sir, you could no longer love any other thing, no more than all other Men: For no Delights can be imagin'd greater than thoſe which Jeſus Chriſt <note n="h" place="bottom">Iſ. 64. 4. 1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> has promiſed to Men, to Live, to Converſe <note n="i" place="bottom">Rev. 20. 4. 21. 3.</note> and to reign among them, Viſibly and Bodily upon Earth.

But inſtead of doing this, he ſlighted this Dependence, deſiring to ſtand by himſelf, and, as God, to know all things; Which deſtroyed and ruin'd him; for no ſooner did he conceive the Deſire of knowing Good and Evil <note n="o" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 6.</note>, and of equalling himſelf unto God, eating the Apple which God had forbidden him, for an outward Mark of his Ambition, but he preſently perceived the Miſery into which he had reduc'd himſelf, finding himſelf ſtript of all the Graces and Prerogatives into which God had ſo freely plac'd him; and fell into Deriſion with God, becauſe of his Arrogance.

                  <hi>I ſaid unto her; That this had never been underſtood after this manner, and that many Fathers had call'd the fall of</hi> Adam <hi>happy, which had caus'd the Incarnation of the Son of God, without which Fall God would not have become Man.</hi>

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, This is very ill underſtood. The Fault of <hi>Adam</hi> ought rather to be call'd very unhappy, which has caus'd the Sufferings and the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, who would aſſuredly have become Man, not ſuffering, but reigning; not deſpis'd, but honour'd by every one; not poor and vile, but in Riches and in Glory; not in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, but ador'd by all Men living; He would have become Man, to reign, not to ſuffer, for if the deſign'd End of his Incarnation had been Suffering and Death, the Fathers of the Antient Law would not have had Ground to have ſo much deſir'd and aſpir'd after that happy Day, that they might ſee with their Eyes God made Man, who ſhould deliver them from their Captivity. Could they De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their Deliverance at ſo dear a Price as the Paſſion and

their Faults by Deeds more than by Words. For theſe Ends, therefore, he takes a Human Body, like to us, to the End he might walk firſt in the Life, which he would point out unto us; and perceiving that Men were undone by the Wealth and Honours of the World, he takes a poor Mother, who was ſo deſpis'd and abandon'd, that ſhe was oblig'd to bring him forth in a Stable, with all the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience that Poverty brings along with it. And to make appear to Men that Proſperities, the Friendſhips and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes of Men did ſerve for Hindrances of Converſation with God, he leaves his Country to go into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> out of all Acquaintance, being oblig'd to this by the Purſuits and Perſecutions of <hi>Herod.</hi> He <note n="f" place="bottom">Matth. 6. 3.</note> labours for gaining his Bread, that Men might willingly labour for accompliſhing their Penitence. At length he begins to teach by Word, and to ſhew to Men wherein they were wanting, that they might attain to Salvation. He explains to them wherein the Law of God conſiſts, and gives them the Evangelical Counſels for obſerving it aright. He is deſpis'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the Great Men of this World. He is alſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd, Buffeted, held for a Wicked One: To ſhew that the Praiſes of Men are not to be ſought for, but their Reproaches rather to be endur'd for the Love of God. At laſt he is put to Death for the Truth, enduring all with Patience: To teach us to ſuffer patiently, even to Death. And all that he has endur'd has been <note n="g" place="bottom">1 Pet. 2. 21.</note> to give us an Example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her; In caſe Men had not come to ſo great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Evil, whether ſhe believ'd that Jeſus Chriſt would have come ſo ſoon to take Human Fleſh?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She Replied:</hi> No, Sir, he would not have come till the end of the World to judge and condemn Men, in aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil: He would have come in the glory of all his Majeſty, with all his Angels; not in Contempt and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: He would have come to Reign, not to undergo an infamous Death. If you read attentively the Prophets, Sir, you will find that they ſpeak far more of this coming in Glory, than of that in Reproach: For the coming of Jeſus Chriſt in Glory, is as it were THE SUM OF THE DESIGNS WHICH GOD HAS OVER MEN: And the coming in Reproach, is as it were the <hi>Accident</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:104476:101"/>
of the ſaid Deſigns. Therefore there will be much more ſpoken of through all the Holy Scriptures. Read Sir, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively all the ſaid Scriptures from the creation of the World, you will find that they all will aim at this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Jeſus Chriſt on Earth with Men, for this is the end of their Creation. God can never reign fully in Men until the time of this coming in Glory; becauſe that they living yet in the liberty of doing evil, do not yet give full poſſeſſion to God to reign in their Souls; for very often, or at leaſt by accident, Sins do rule there: Which we have ſeen in the greateſt Saints of the World. A <hi>David,</hi> a <hi>Solomon,</hi> all the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, yea, all thoſe who have ſince been eſteemed Saints, have all in general fallen into Treſpaſſes, and have ſtrayed from God for ſome time: By which he could not find in them his perfect reign, as he will do after his glorious Coming: For then all will be <note n="h" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15. 28.</note> Deify'd, Bodies as well as Souls: And there will be an end of all Evil. God will then have his full dominion over all Fleſh; which has never been: For the moſt part of Men in all times have Blaſphemed and Deſpiſed him, tho all were created by him to love him and to adore him. They have yielded their honour and love to the Creatures inſtead of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. Is it not fit, Sir, that theſe things be one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and that God be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth, by his Creatures? <note n="i" place="bottom">Mal. 1. 16.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her, That aſſuredly God would after that manner be adored in Heaven; but that I could not comprehend how he could be ſo here upon Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> I perceive, Sir, that you take for Heaven and Paradiſe, ſome preciſe place, or ſome particular part which ferves for a Reſidence to God: And for my part I cannot believe that there is any thing capable of containing God, for he is greater than all things, and cannot be contain'd by any thing leſs than himſelf. The Heaven is but his Creature, which we ſay is on high, and God has neither high nor low, for he contains all. Heaven and Paradiſe is always in him, for there can be no other but his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and he who is in his Preſence is in Heaven and Paradiſe. For my part, I know no other. They tell us many imaginary things of God and of Paradiſe, which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:104476:102"/>
have very little relation to what they are. It ſeems God is like an earthly King, who is lodged in ſome Palace of Wood or Stone: Theſe are all Speculations of Men, as earthly, as their Affections: For God cannot have any fixt place for his Reſidence, ſeeing he comprehends all things. When I ſay that God will be upon Earth reigning with Men, the Earth will then be Paradiſe; for in all Places where he is, there is always Paradiſe. If God were in Hell, Hell would then be Paradiſe, there being no other but the preſence of God. That makes in all places where it is, Heaven and Paradiſe. When this preſence is in our Soul, our Soul is Heaven. How, can you not comprehend, Sir, that God could be truly adored in Spirit and in Truth, upon Earth, ſeeing he has ſo often promiſed <note n="l" place="bottom">Jer. 32. 40.</note> to make <hi>an Alliance with Men?</hi> Muſt not this Alliance be made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth? God being a pure Spirit, has no need of any Station; but Man having a Body, has need of ſome Place to contain him. The Earth was created <note n="m" place="bottom">Iſa. 45. 18.</note> for this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that it might contain the Bodies of Men. Why then ſhould not God come upon Earth to dwell with them, ſeeing they cannot go where God is, in that purity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Of neceſſity he muſt either come upon Earth, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they could not be entirely united together.</p>
               <p>

For my part, I hope to ſee him and to reign with him Eternally. In this all my hopes and my joy do conſiſt: For this Life is too miſerable to take any contentment in it, without the hope of this time to come. I ſay, it will be very ſhortly, for I ſee the Meaſure full, and Mens ſins are come to the height: They cannot be more numerous: And if there were not ſome ſmall Veil of Human reſpect, they would Murther, Rob, commit Adultery, and do all ſorts of Abomination publickly, as well as they do them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.

If you believe in Life Eternal, which is an Article of our Creed, you believe in the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth. I have alſo told you, that there is no other Paradiſe but the Preſence of God: And whereas Jeſus Chriſt is God, as my word is me, his Body muſt have ſome Station, as alſo all the other Bodies of the bleſſed God, being a pure Spirit, has no need of any Station, nor yet our Soul, which is alſo a Spirit. A Spirit is through all, and comprehends what is at a diſtance, as well as that which is near: As our Thoughts have no need of a way to go to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> They go thither in the twinkling of an eye, for they do not ſtay in any place. Even ſo God has no need of Heaven, nor of Earth to ſtay in, being a pure
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104476:103"/>
Spirit; nor yet our Souls, which are in Paradiſe when they are united unto God: But our Body has need of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and of all the other things which God has created for it; becauſe it is material, it muſt alſo ſtay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on material things, ſuitable unto its nature. Therefore God has created all this World, with all that is in it, that Man may have his full delights as well in his Body as in his Soul: For God makes nothing imperfect; but all his Works ſhall have their compleat Perfections: And reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to create Man a kind of Creature Spiritual and Bodily both together, he gives himſelf to him for to ſatisfie his Soul, which is a Spirit; he will give him likewiſe all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated things to ſatisfie his Body: So that the Soul ſhall take its delights with God, and the Body its delights with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and all the other Creatures: For God has created them for thoſe ends, and for no other thing, that Man might have his full perfect contentment of Body and Mind in that Life Eternal, wherein Jeſus Chriſt will reign always in Body and Soul with the Bodies and Souls of the Bleſſed, who ſhall be united in Spirit unto God, and in Body unto the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. Behold the alliance which God promiſed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he did not ſee <note n="s" place="bottom">See <hi>Heb.</hi> ii. 13.</note> but very far of, and we ſee it now very near. Do you not think, Sir, that this Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt muſt be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, ſeeing that he has taken a Human Body like unto ours? A ſpiritual thing cannot ſupport but that which is ſpiritual: But a material muſt have a ſtay agreeable to its Nature, which is alſo material. Who can or would change that Excellent Order which God has eſtabliſh'd in all his Works ſo juſt and ſo perfect, which alone are worthy of Admiration as the Author is of Adoration? Can you yet doubt, Sir, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall reign upon Earth, ſeeing it is a juſt and neceſſary thing? Would you believe that God ſhould create all this beautiful World only for this miſerable Life of Penitence; and that at the end of it he ſhould aboliſh this great Work of his Hands, or that he ſhould conſume by Fire the whole Univerſe? This would not be a juſt thing that he had made all theſe things only for our Miſeries. This would be as much as to ſay, that God had had little Wiſdom.</p>

                  <hi>I was raviſh'd out of my ſelf, to hear things ſo unheard of, ſo admirable and ſo charming: And that I might understand a little more, I ask'd her, if the Earth and the World would abide for ever?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir, the <note n="t" place="bottom">Eccl. 1. 4. Baruch 3. 32.</note> Earth, and all the reſt that God has created will abide for ever in the State in which he eſtabliſhed them at their Creation; For the whole works of God <note n="u" place="bottom">Pſ. 138. 8. Eccl. 16. 31.</note> are all Everlaſting. Therefore he has created all things with Seeds for to ſpring and to engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Eternally. All which Generations muſt be made for the delight of Man, without Pain or Labour. All things would have brought forth their Kind according to their Species in a good and delightful manner. (<hi>x</hi>) The Sun would have given his light and heat in meaſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Exceſs; the Air without Storms; the Sea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tempeſts: The Fire could not have burn'd us, nor the Water drowned us, nor the Earth brought forth Thorns, nor the Beaſts bitten and poyſon'd us; but all ſort of things would have ſerved us for Delight and Recreation. So many little Beaſts which are upon the Earth, and in the Air, which ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ems uſeleſs to us, were created to the end that even the leaſt of our Senſes might be Recreated. Even the diverſity of Flies, and many other ſorts of Animals, Herbs, Trees and Flowers; all theſe were created not only for the neceſſities of Men, but alſo for their Delights. Which things had nothing but Goodneſs and Perfection, without Sharpneſs, Prickings, or Bitings. How much more ought Man to be Good and Perfect, ſeeing all theſe other things which were ſubjected to him, had ſo much Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Perfection! You might ask me, <hi>from whence it comes that all theſe Creatures are become Evil, ſeeing they were created ſo good and perfect?</hi> I will anſwer you, That <note n="y" place="bottom">Rom. 8. 20. Prov. 8. 31.</note> the ſin of Man has cauſed all theſe Diſorders, and with Juſtice. For all the Creatures of God ought to riſe up againſt Man, and take vengeance of his Ingratitude, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their power, becauſe he had merited that all that was given him for Joy, ſhould ſerve him for Grief: Seeing he who ought to have ſerv'd for a delight (<hi>z</hi>) unto his God, turns away from him to offend him; his Juſtice would require that all the Creatures ſhould do the ſame
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104476:104"/>
toward him, ſince he had done it toward his God, who had infinitely benefitted him more than any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which might well offend Man, and become his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy, when he was become the Enemy of God; who tho he could not render his Creatures Evil, becauſe he is the ſource of all Goodneſs, from whence nothing that is evil can ever proceed; yet he might well permit, that his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhould be exerciſed by thoſe inferior Creatures, when Man had ſo juſtly deſerved it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I asked her, If all thoſe Creatures, Animate and Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate would have an eternal Being?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir: nothing will periſh of all that God hasmade: But the evil that is in all theſe Creatures <note n="a" place="bottom">Rom. 8. 20.</note> ſhall be taken away, becauſe it does not come from him; and all that comes from Men ſhall Periſh. For Example, That the Sun burns us and dazles the eyes which look upon him: This comes from Man, who has diſtempered that excellent Star by his Sin: That the Air is ſtormy; that the Water is troubled; That the Earth brings forth <note n="b" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 17, 18.</note> Thorns and Thiſtles: This is for no other reaſon but to take Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Diſobedience which Man hath committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. The Dog bites; The Wolf devours; the Serpent Poyſons; and all thoſe other Evils which the Beaſts do to Man, this is for no other reaſon, but to render him the Puniſhment that he has merited by his Sin. If the Fire burn him; if the Air infect him; if the Water ſuffocate him, this is but for a juſt Puniſhment. If the Earth doth not bring forth its Fruits without Labour, this is but for a Penance of Man's Sin. In ſhort, all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whatſoever, even to a Flea, are obliged to hurt Man, becauſe of the Diſobedience that he has committed againſt their Creator; and this by Right and Juſtice. But as ſoon as his Penitence ſhall be accompliſhed, and he ſhall obtain the abſolute pardon of his Sin, all ſhall be re-eſtabliſhed in their firſt Eſtate, and ſhall not fall away any more, for the glorious preſence of Jeſus Chriſt will confirm them in Grace, maintaining them in eternal Peace, all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with men; and they ſhall do then what they ſhould have done from the beginning of the Creation, Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God ceaſing. <note n="d" place="bottom">

and eternal delight for all things; God will do the will of Man, who ſhall love him; and Man will do the will of God, upon whom he ſhall depend. All the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will do the will of Man, who ſhall command them. In ſhort, God, Man, and all the Creatures will have but one and the ſame will, without any Rebellion. Will not this then be a Paradiſe of all the univerſal World? They have ſometimes told us extravagant Stories of Paradiſe; but this was but to make us underſtand that it ſhould be filled with all ſort of Contentments; as they ſay to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that there they ſhall eat Sugar with Spoons, becauſe Children have their delight in it: But nothing of all that is told us of it can be true, except what God has reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it at preſent, becauſe the time approaches, and will not be long in coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her: If Men will be confirm'd in Grace, without being able to ſin or fall any more, as they have done once in Adam?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Men, Sir, will not remain without Sin, by conſtraint or neceſſity, becauſe God would have them in a Free State <note n="e" place="bottom">Pſ. 110. 3.</note>, that the love he bears them might be perfect; but they <note n="f" place="bottom">Iſ. 4. 2, 3. and 33. 24.</note> canuot fall nor ſin any longer, for they will be eternally united unto Jeſus Chriſt, beholding God in Spirit, and that glorious Body in Fleſh, who will Govern them, and take his continual Delight with them; which will hinder them from thinking of ſinning, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. It is true, <hi>Adam</hi> did converſe ſometimes with God, but in a manner that was not Humane; and had alſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals: For if he had always continued in Converſation with God, he could not have Fallen: But in diverting himſelf from him to hearken to his Wife and the Serpent, he falls into Diſobedience, through the wandring of his Spirit. Now, in the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, there can be no Straying, he will be always <note n="g" place="bottom">Rev. 22 3, 4.</note> preſent with them; he will repleniſh them with Graces and Joys ſo abundant, that nothing can any more divert them: No body will ſay any longer, <note n="h" place="bottom">Jer. 31. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Know the Lord:</hi> For all ſhall Know him and Love him. The fault of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the hard Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which it occaſion'd, will make them ſee abundantly what it is to forſake God. Likewiſe they ſhall not be any
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104476:105"/>
longer ſubject to Concupicenſe; for they ſhall all be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Body and Spirit, by the glorious Spiritual and Bodily Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt, who having removed all their Sins, will repleniſh them with the Holy Spirit in Fulneſs; ſo that they cannot have any more inclinations to any Evil; ſo much the more, that it ſhall be removed from the whole Earth; and that all that is evil ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That all the Interpreters who ſpeak of Judgment, ſay, That the last Fire muſt conſume all the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Theſe Interpreters could ſee no farther than their Sight reach'd; but hold for certain all that I tell you. Theſe are Divine Truths. <note n="i" place="bottom">Pſ. 102. 26, 27.</note> The World will not be utterly Deſtroyed, but all Evil ſhall be Conſumed. <note n="l" place="bottom">Zach. 13. 8, 9.</note> One part of wicked Men will die by the Sword; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other part by the Peſtilence and Famine, and all thoſe Beauties and Riches which have ſerved as Fewel to ſin, will be all burnt and conſum'd by Fire, which will purge the whole Earth by its heat: And as heretofore the World was once purged by the waters of an univerſal Deluge, even ſo ſhall it be then by Fire. The World did not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by the Waters; but indeed all wicked Men, with all their Wickedneſs and the Subjects of it. The ſame alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether will come to paſs by Fire, which will burn and purge all Iniquity, without ſparing any thing: But nothing will periſh of the Works of God.

               <p>
                  <hi>I asked her, If theſe things would fall out at the day of Judgment, or rather at the coming of Jeſus Chriſt in his Glory?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, We ſpeak of Judgment, as if it would be done in one day, or as ſuddenly as an Enchantment. This will not be done as we think. The Judgment <note n="n" place="bottom">Joh. 12. 31.</note> is already made, I believe I have told you heretofore. The
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:104476:105"/>
irrevocable Sentence is given; there needs no more but to put it in execution. The Unrighteouſneſs of Men has ſo oppoſed the Righteouſneſs of God, that it cannot be any longer without Chaſtiſements, or otherwiſe he would not be Juſt. The Sword of Juſtice muſt needs cut off all that it meets in oppoſition to it: And at this time all oppoſe this Righteouſneſs. Therefore all muſt be cut off. This is the Sentence wich ſhall not be revoked, becauſe Men will not revoke <note n="o" place="bottom">Rev. 9. 20.</note> their Unrighteouſneſs. This Sentence will be put in execution; not in one day, as People imagin, but by little and little, to give time and leiſure to Men to be Converted, if they will ſeriouſly think on it. <note n="p" place="bottom">Wiſd. 12. 9. 2 Pet. 9. 4.</note> Wars are the <hi>beginnings</hi>

All this will prove worſe until the conſummation of all Evil: As the waters of the Deluge always continued, yea, encreaſed untill they had carried away all the People who then lived upon the Earth; ſo ſhall it be of the laſt Plagues, which are already begun, and will continue; yea, and will encreaſe even to the end of the wicked World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I begg'd She would yet tell me one thing upon this Head; Whether Jeſus Chriſt would come upon Earth before theſe Plagues, or in the time of them, or after them?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>She replied:</hi> He will not come before theſe Plagues, Sir, ſince they are already begun; nor in the time of them, for that will be the remnant of the Reign of Anti-chriſt, whom Jeſus Chriſt will overthrow <hi>by the breath of his Mouth:</hi>

                  <hi>I Baptize with Water; but there cometh one after me who ſhall Baptize with the Spirit.</hi> The Water repreſents Penitence, which muſt prepare us to receive the Holy Spirit, which Jeſus Chriſt will bring upon the Earth, to Baptize in Spirit all thoſe who ſhall be waſhed with the water of Penitence. Jeſus Chriſt therefore will come upon Earth in Glory to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of the Plagues, and at the end of the reign of Anti-chriſt; and he will judge the Quick and the Dead, that is, the Good and the Bad, who ſhall then remain <hi>upon the Earth,</hi> and <note n="b" place="bottom">Mat. 25. 32,-41.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>I entreated her to tell me, how Souls ſhall Periſh, ſince ſhe had ſaid heretofore, that never any of the Works of God ſhall periſh. Now, Souls are the Works that he has made, thoſe of the Wicked as well as thoſe of the Good; for Body and Soul are his Workmanſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, The Souls of the Wicked ſhall not periſh, but ſhall only be deprived of all ſort of Good, and ſhall live for ever in all ſort of Evil. It would be a far leſs evil unto them to Periſh and be Annihilated; becauſe thereby their evils would be at an end: But becauſe they are the works of God, they will never end, but will have a miſerable Eternity. Being baniſhed from the preſence of God, they will <note n="c" place="bottom">25. 46.</note> be ſent into the Abyſs of endleſs Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as the Good will be preſerved in the Abyſs of endleſs Happineſs, by the preſence of God, which comprehends all Good: Therefore it cannot be found any where elſe;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:104476:106"/>
for All is in God. And according as they are eſtrang'd from Happineſs; they are plung'd into Evil, being no other thing but the privation of Good. Once contrary from it, is always contrary from it. In like manner Hell is not Sir, what People imagin it to be; there needs no material Fire to burn the Devils, nor the Souls of the Wicked; for they are but Spirits, upon which Matter has no power, as being a far leſs thing. The Hell of Devils and damned Souls, is no other thing but a ſeparation from God, who is all Good; and in the privation of him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts All Evil: For nothing can be Good but the privation of all Evil, and nothing can be Evil but the privation of all Good; which the Devils and damned Souls do poſſeſs, when once they have abandoned God, who alone contains all Good. Wicked Souls who live yet upon Earth, have not altogether abandoned God; for they have yet ſome hope in him, notwithſtanding their Wickedneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not as yet fallen into all ſort of Evils; for they have not forſaken all Good: But <note n="d" place="bottom">4 Eſdr. 9. 9.-12.</note> theſe Souls which have paſt the time of their Saving Penitence, are Deſperate, for they cannot any more approach to any Good, which conſiſts all in God alone, whom they have forſaken of their own will, and conſequently are abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to all ſorts of Evil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid unto her, That I had read ſome Authors of good Note, who affirm, that there is material Fire in the Hell of Devils and damned Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Theſe Authors may indeed have had ſome Light, that there will be material Fire in Hell., <note n="e" place="bottom">Iſ. 13, 21, 22. Rev. 19. 2.</note> as well as things hurtful to Man, even Naturally: But they have confounded one Time with another, not knowing to diſcern the works of God, neither in regard of the joy of Bleſſed Souls, nor of the pains of the Miſerable; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have committed great faults in deſiring to know things before the time that God would reveal them. There will therefore be truly, Sir, material Fire in the Hell of the Devils and the Damned, and likewiſe Darkneſs, Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Thunders and Lightnings; bitings of Beaſts, tempeſts of Water; ſtorms of Wind; gnawings of Worms, prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Flies and Thorns; and all things that are hurtful will be materially in Hell: Even ſo blindneſs of Eyes,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104476:107"/>
deafneſs of Ears, leproſie of Body, with all other ſorts of Maladies and natural Infirmities. But this will be only after the Judgment, when God ſhall take away <note n="f" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Iſ.</hi> ii. 4,-9.</note> all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity from the Earth, and from all the other Elements; when he ſhall take away the Venom from Serpents, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, and other venomous Beaſts; and even Maladies <note n="g" place="bottom">Iſ. 33. 24.</note> and infirmities from the Bodies of Men and Beaſts; yea, weakneſſes and imbecilities from Spirits <note n="h" place="bottom">35. 3. 4. 40. 31. Rev. 21. 4.</note> All this ſhall be reduc'd unto ſome corner of the Earth, all in a Maſs, that theſe Malignities may act together upon the Bodies of the Damned; and that the works of their hands may <note n="i" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Iſ.</hi> 3. ii.</note> be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unto them; For God has never made any of all theſe evils; He created all things Good. Men only by their Wickedneſs have given Malignity unto all Created things, and therefore it ought to appertain to them, and to be rendred them by right of Juſtice; which will come to paſs at the Judgment, when the Bodies of the Wicked ſhall riſe alſo, that none of the works of God may Periſh, and ſhall be ſent into that miſerable Corner with all the Evils, which ſhall be removed from the Bleſſed, and from the whole Earth; from Plants, Beaſts and all the Elements, that all theſe things may ſerve them only for Delight and Pleaſure, without being able to do any more evil, as they were in the beginning of their Creation; and all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignities which they have contracted by the Sins of Men, ſhall be rendred unto their Authors. The Fire of Hell will not be like that which we ſee, becauſe it is now a mixture of the works of God, with the malignity of the works of Men, as all other things are. God has given unto Fire a ſweet and agreeable Light and Heat; and Sin has given it blackneſs and to burn: Theſe two evils ſhall be removed and confin'd to Hell, that it may burn and blacken the Bodies of Men, who have thus ſpoil'd the works of God by their Rebellion. There will not be in Hell Elements, or Beaſts, or other things as God has made them, but only the malignity which every one of all theſe Creatures has contracted by ſins. For Example, the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom will be removed from Serpents and other creeping things, and will be reſerved for Hell: As alſo the fury from Lions and Bulls, that they may converſe with the Bleſſed with Meekneſs and Gentleneſs; and that nothing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104476:107"/>
may be able any longer to give them pain; that Fire may give heat and light without burning; that the Air may ſurround them without being troubled; that the Water may refreſh and recreate them without being moved; that the Lyons, Serpents and all other wild Beaſts may ſport with Men for their Delight and Recreation, and that all things may remain on the Earth to render the Body of Man hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that with his Soul, it may have a perfect eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; ſeeing that the Body has born with the Soul the ſaving Penitence which God had ordain'd it: Whereas, on the contrary, the Bodies of the Wicked have rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Penitence, and deſiring to take their Delights inſtead of Sufferings: To which the miſerable Soul acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcing, they have juſtly merited to ſuffer joyntly in Hell, which will likewiſe be Material and upon Earth, that it may act upon Bodies as well as Souls; which was not neceſſary before the Judgment, ſince that Devils and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Souls had no need of a material Place for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tormented; for all the evil of Souls conſiſts in the privation of the Preſence of God.</p>

                  <hi>I Said to her, That I ſaw evidently we drew near to the end of the World, becauſe God gave theſe Diſcoveries of many things, which never any body had underſtood: That her Light was not Human: And I entreated her for the love of God, to tell me where that little corner of the Earth might be which God would reſerve for his Servants, that I might ſave my ſelf during the Plagues.</hi>

                  <hi>She ſaid to me:</hi> Sir, be not curious to know where this material Place will be, which God will reſerve for his Friends. I my ſelf durſt not ask him, fearing to ſeek my ſelf or my own repoſe. We are yet in the time of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. If we would withdraw that we may not ſuffer,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104476:108"/>
this would be but ſelf-Love. We ſhall be every where in ſecurity, when our Soul ſhall be united with God; and even tho our Body ſhould feel the Plagues, our Soul ſhall be comforted in the midſt of Sorrows; as S. <hi>Lawrence</hi> was in the midſt of burning Coals, and ſo many other holy Martyrs. Let us rather think of converſing always with God, than of putting our Body in a place of Security, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will be always ſecure in converſing with God. If there be a danger which he would not have us ſuffer, he will warn us of it always in time, as he did <hi>Noah, Lot</hi> and ſo many others of Friends. He will not permit any thing to befall us, but that <note n="n" place="bottom">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> in which he would try or purge us. Do not ſo much deſire to know the place where you may retire, as to know the place where God reſides, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him: For in this alone conſiſts all our ſafety, both Bodily and Spiritual. You might indeed withdraw bodily into ſome place of Security, where your Souls not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding would not be ſure of being Saved. And if this were, it would be but a poor Safety; for our Life is ſo miſerable, that to loſe it is more deſirable than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, were it not the fear of not having yet accompliſh'd the Penitence due for our Sins: Otherwiſe Death is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and this Life grievous, were it not that it may have God to converſe with. Without this, there is nothing but Miſeries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I asked her, In what place I might find this continual Converſation with God, that I might be every where in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and not fear Death?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, You muſt not go out of your ſelf; for God is the Centre of your Soul. You muſt not ſeek him among the publick Places of the City, as <note n="o" place="bottom">Cant. 3. 2, 3.</note> the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> did, who was beaten by the Soldiers: But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter into your ſelf, and you will find him. He is no where more particularly than in <note n="p" place="bottom">Eph. 3. 17.</note> the Souls of Men. Theſe are his real <note n="q" place="bottom">2 Cor. 6. 16.</note> living Temples, where <note n="r" place="bottom">Cant. 1. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>he reſts at Noon,</hi> that is in his moſt clear Light. There enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain your Spirit with him, and he will entertain himſelf with you. He is more deſirous to hear us than we are to ſpeak to him; <note n="s" place="bottom">Cant. 2. 14.</note> neither going out nor in, nor any other affairs whatſover, can hinder this inward Converſation: On the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104476:108"/>
contrary, it perfects all things. So ſoon as our Affections are taken off, from all other Objects, and ſet upon God alone, we will find him every where, and he will never ceaſe to give us his Graces, to accompliſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly all our Enterprizes, how little ſo ever they be; for his Spirit was the true Wiſdom, which is not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of any thing; no more of Temporal things than of Spiritual. This Spirit perfects all ſort of things. There is no place or condition be what it will, that can divert us from this Converſation, when our Affections are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried toward it. Make a little Experience of it, Sir, and you will find what I ſay to be true: You could not any longer fear Death, in poſſeſſing the Author of Life: for whether we live or die, we will be always in the Earthly Paradiſe; in which nevertheleſs we may indeed ſin, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, becauſe there are yet in this miſerable Life ſo many things which may divert us from God, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great violence we cannot remain in this Spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: but if Nature muſt do ſo great violence to it ſelf at Death to ſeparate from the Soul, why may it not do a leſs to ſeparate it ſelf from that which <hi>hinders our union with God? It is in this that Jeſus Chriſt ſays,</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="bottom">Mat. 5. 29, 30.</note>

                  <p>How we ought to Pray, and to underſtand the Lord's Prayer in its perfect Senſe? which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the Diſpoſitions and Graces that ſhall be beſtowed on us in the Glorious Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, of which there are here Marvellous things ſpoken.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>I Asked her, How I ought to Pray, to the end I might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this continual Communion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid to me:</hi> Sir, This Converſation is true Prayer, which conſiſts in the <note n="u" place="bottom">Joh. 4. 23.</note> elevation of ones Spirit unto God: And as long as we converſe with God, we are ſtill in Prayer, whether we adore him for his Almighty Power, or bleſs him for his Favours, or beg of him his Light, and that which is neceſſary for us. This is to Pray always as long as our Spirit is elevated unto God. I know no other method of Praying. If you ask of me words for Praying, I will tell you what Jeſus Chriſt told his Diſciples when they intreated him that he would teach them to Pray <note n="x" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> ii. 1. 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 9.</note> as St. <hi>John</hi> did his Diſciples? Say, <hi>Our Father, which art in Heaven; hallowed be thy Name;</hi> and the reſt of the Lord's Prayer; in which is comprehended all that we can ever ask of God, for his Honour and our Salvation. In theſe words are comprehended all the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which we owe to God; all the Thanksgivings which we can render him; and all that we may, or ought to ask of him, for our ſelves, and for all others. This is the Prayer which Jeſus Chriſt himſelf did compoſe, and the only one which he taught his Diſciples, of which we ought to make more reckoning than of all the Prayers in the World. Many Perſons give themſelves to divers Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prayers, compoſed by ſome Saints; or to a number of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104476:109"/>
Beads; ſaying, a great many <hi>Paters</hi> and <hi>Aves</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, ſo that if we ſhould enquire of theſe Petitioners, what they ask'd of God by ſo long Prayers, it may be it would be hard for them to tell, becauſe all paſſes in many words, without much attention. Others who ſeem more Pious, and advanced in Virtue, give themſelves to ſome mental Prayers, and paſs many hours in ſilence on a deſign to pray to God: But at the upſhot of all, there does not proceed any fruits from all theſe Prayers, for we ſee them as imperfect at the end of twenty Years of their Prayers, as the firſt day that they began them. Yea, very often they break their Head, and crack their Brains by the force of multiplied Conceptions; one Petition only of the Lord's Prayer well underſtood, is of more worth than all theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her; That I did not well underſtand the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Lord's Prayer, entreating her, that ſhe would explain them to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She ſaid to me: Sir, you ask a thing which a long time ago I judged neceſſary for all People: For I think no body does yet well underſtand that Prayer. But we will need a little time to reſt to declare it to you in particular. Let us ſit down here, and I will tell it you. Firſt when we ſay, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy Name:</hi> We acknowledge, <hi>That God is our Father,</hi> that it is he who has Created and Formed us. <hi>Who art in the Heavens:</hi> That is, higher than all things. We uſe the word <hi>Heaven</hi> becauſe we know nothing by our Humane Underſtanding, which is higher than the Heavens; and when we would ſay that God is above all things, we ſay, he is in the Heavens; to make our Sentiments in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain manner to be underſtood. And when we ſay, <hi>His Name be Hallowed,</hi> this is to wiſh that all Creatures may adore and bleſs him, which has never yet come to paſs on Earth; where Men themſelves do Blaſpheme his Holy Name on all occaſions, by Word and Deed. God could not have formed this Petition for us, if he were not one day to grant it to us: For he <note n="y" place="bottom">Joh. 16. 23, 24.</note> could not make us ask a thing which he would not give: And whereas all his Works will be perfect, it cannot ſuffice that ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Souls do hallow his Name <note n="z" place="bottom">Pſ. 148. 150.</note>: It muſt be in a
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:104476:110"/>
perfect ſenſe, that all Men in general, with all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do hallow him, which will not be untill Jeſus Chriſt Reign in his Glory upon Earth. Then <note n="a" place="bottom">

                     </gap>ſ. 96 98.</note> all things will hallow the Name of God, but never before.</p>
               <p>And when we ſay: <hi>Thy Kingdom come:</hi> This is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing but to Pray, that we may arrive at that bleſſed Kingdom, wherein Jeſus Chriſt ſhall reign over all the Souls and Bodies of the Bleſſed, and over all Creatures: For we have never had this Happineſs that God ſhould Reign entirely, even in our own Souls: Having always given hindrances thereunto by our corrupt Nature, yea, even in the Souls of the Apoſtles and other Saints <note n="b" place="bottom">Rom. 7. 23.</note>, God has never compleatly reigned, having always there met with ſome hindrances or rebellions of their own Will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his. He can never reign perfectly in us, until he have rooted out all our Evils and Miſeries that we may Reign with him. Which we have never as yet done, tho' we have deſired to be wholly unto God, we have never reigned over all our Paſſions and Affections, ſo as that we might reign fully with God: But we hope that after the Judgment, this Kingdom of God will come unto us. This is the hope of our Prayers, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when we ſay, <hi>Thy will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven,</hi> We beg alſo the ſame Kingdom: For in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate we cannot obtain that the Will of God, be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in us and in others as it is fulfilled in God, who is always without any contradiction. No body can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his own Will to be ſo united unto the Will of God, as that of the Bleſſed who are dead in the Lord: On the contrary, many do directly reſiſt his Will; and the moſt Perfect follow it at ſome diſtance, and not as the Angels and the Bleſſed do in Heaven: For where God is, all his Will is accompliſhed; and where he is not, all is there contradicted. Therefore in this Life we never do the compleat Will of God, as we ſhall do it in the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, where Earth and Heaven will be the ſame thing: Then his Will ſhall be fulfilled in Earth as it is in Heaven; which we muſt always pray for untill we have obtain'd it, as alſo, That <hi>He give us daily Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, what we ſtand in need of daily for the Soul and for the Body. Now likewiſe we cannot obtain theſe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104476:110"/>
two things during this Life: For he who would have bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aliment, ought always to labour, and take pains, and be ſollicitous, both in Body and Mind to obtain his aliment; and when we receive it, it is but in form of a reward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our Cares and Labours: For otherwiſe we muſt dye for want, if we did not labour both in Body and Mind. So that this daily Bread is not given us, but acquired by Cares and Labours: No more than the Food of our Soul which is the Word of God, which ought daily to maintain it. This is not given us daily; for we muſt be at great care to ſearch for it, yea, we know not where to find it. So many Gloſſes, ſo many Explications of this word, that they would indeed make us ſwallow Poyſon for Bread. We muſt indeed watch, and be at pains to find this true Food of our Souls. But in the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt the Word of God will be given us by the mouth of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf <note n="c" place="bottom">Rev. 7. 17.</note> which will nouriſh and fully ſatisfie our Soul: As likewiſe all things neceſſary for the Entertainment of our Body, ſhall be given us without pains, care or labours. The Fruits will grow ſo agreeable and ſubſtantial that it will require no other pains to be ſuſtain'd by them, but the delight of eating them. Our Bodies will have no longer need to be covered or warmed; for all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will of themſelves ſerve them with delight. All this will be daily real gifts; for they will be all freely given us of God without our Care or Labour: Whereas in this World we have nothing, but are as Workmen who receive the Wages of their Labours. So that God cannot have made us ask the things which are impoſſible for us to obtain in this World. Of neceſſity he muſt give us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in which we may obtain in Perfection the effect of our Perfections: For as much as he never gives any thing imperfectly; neither will he have us to put up unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Requeſts, as the ſeven of the Lords Prayer would be: For there is not one of them which can be perfectly given in this World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if God did not forgive us our Offences but in the ſame manner that we forgive thoſe who have offended us,</hi> there would befal us no great Happineſs in Paradiſe, becauſe thoſe whoſe Offences we forgive are not always in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, on the contrary, we withdraw from them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:104476:111"/>
out of Averſion, ſometimes that we may have no more occaſion of being offended by them. If God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us after this manner, we would be of the Damned Souls: For the Hell of our Soul is no other but the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the preſence of God: And as we do not give our Goods nor our Favours to thoſe who have offended us, and we think we do them enough of favour when we do not wiſh them Evil, nor rejoyce in their Miſery; If God, after he has pardon'd us our Sins, ſhould give us no more of his Goods and Graces than we give unto thoſe who have offended us; what Felicity could we hope for after the Pardon of our Sins, but to fall again yet into greater Faults! For his Graces and Benefits are neceſſary for us every moment to preſerve us from Evil. And if he did not give us his Kingdom and his Treaſures, from whom could we expect for Happineſs? For no other but he can give it. By which it appears clearly, that we cannot ask for this World here, <hi>That he forgive us our Offences, as we forgive thoſe who have Offended us,</hi> becauſe we would ask an Evil thing for our ſelves. It muſt needs be that we ask theſe things for the time that we ſhall live with Jeſus Chriſt in his Kingdom, where being united unto his great Mercy, we ſhall pardon our Enemies ſo perfectly, that we ſhall deſire the ſame Happineſs for them which we ſhall receive from God, who will not only pardon us our Sins, but will deal with us as if we had never offended him, giving us his Treaſures and his Glory, which will oblige us to do the ſame with thoſe who ſhall have offended us: For it would be unjuſt for us not to ſhew to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the ſame Mercy which we receive from God. This we cannot do, nor comprehend, during this miſerable Life, where being remov'd from his perfect Mercy, we are as far from the Commiſeration of our Neighbour; and we can no ways beg of God that he deal with us as we deal with our Brethren, without begging our ruin, ſeeing if he ſhould grant us this Requeſt, he would confine us to Hell, which is the privation of the Viſion of God. From whence it appears <note n="d" place="bottom">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 65. 17-24.</note>, <hi>That we look for another Heaven and another Earth,</hi> where God will grant us all the Requeſts that he has made us to ask by this Prayer, ſeeing that not one of them can be granted in this preſent World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:104476:111"/>For if we examine alſo the Sixth, <hi>Lead us not into Temptation:</hi> We will find that the more we Pray, the more we are Tempted: For the Holy Spirit ſays, <note n="e" place="bottom">Eccleſ. 2. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>If you would ſerve God, prepare your Heart for Temptation.</hi> Could Jeſus Chriſt have made us to pray not to be led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, while in the mean time he lets us fall into it the more ſtrongly? This would be unjuſt. He has taught us to ask nothing, but what he will give us in a compleat and perfect ſenſe: But this will be after that we ſhall have accompliſhed this ſhort penitence, and ſhall go to reign with him. Then there will no longer be any thing in us that will lead us into Temptation, for we ſhall be fully ſatisfied with the preſence of God, not being able to love nor deſire any other thing, nor to move but by the motion of the Holy Spirit; who will deifie even our Bodies, which can no longer be led into Temptation, as they will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways during this Life: For the Devil <note n="f" place="bottom">Eph. 6. 12.</note> will never ceaſe to make War againſt us, and more againſt the Good than the Wicked, who are his own without trouble: But for the Good, he muſt win them by the ſtrength of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Therefore we muſt not hope to obtain in this Life the Sixth Petition of this Prayer, <hi>Which is not to be led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Temptation;</hi> no more than the ſeventh and laſt, wherein we pray that God <hi>May deliver us from Evil:</hi> For we ſhall <note n="g" place="bottom">Rom. 7. 24.</note> never be delivered from Evil: Seeing we are ſtill more and more oppreſt with it; and the Juſt themſelves are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without ſuffering of Evils which the Wicked do them in abundance, Deſpiſing, Perſecuting and purſuing them even to Death. If theſe are never delivered from Evil, how much leſs can others be, who are likewiſe charged with the Evils of the Soul beſides thoſe of the Body, which are common to all? Could we always pray to be delivered from Evil, without ever obtaining it? What vain Prayer would this be, to groan under the burthen of all ſorts of Evils, in Body by ſo many kinds of Diſeaſes; and in Spirit by ſo many Infirmities, Weakneſſes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtances; and in Soul by ſo many Sins and Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and with this to pray to be delivered from the Evils which are unſeparable from this Life! It muſt needs be that God would have us to ask at preſent what we ought to obtain afterward.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:104476:112"/>And if this Kingdom of Heaven were nothing but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or imaginary, as they would ſometimes make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, why would Jeſus Chriſt have made us to ask ſo many different things? If Paradiſe were not accompanied with the Earth, and with all the Creatures which we ſee, and with our Body with all its Functions, why muſt we pray to have our daily Bread, when there will be no need of Eating: Why ſhould we pray that the Name of God may be Hallowed, ſeeing all the Bleſſed have always Hallowed it, and will never ceaſe to do it, tho' we ſhould not pray for it? Muſt there not be in this a Senſe which we have not as yet diſcovered, and that this Hallowing of the Name of God ought to be underderſtood, <note n="h" place="bottom">Iſ. 45. 22, 23.</note> that all the Men who are upon Earth may Hallow his Name; for it cannot be done fully by Angels, by the Bleſſed, and by ſome particular Souls living upon Earth? But this Name muſt be Hallowed generally by all Men in Body and in Soul. Which will be when this Kingdom ſhall come, wherein the Will of God ſhall be done upon Earth, as the Angels and the Bleſſed do it in Heaven; and wherein ſhall be given us alſo our daily Bread, that is, every day in particular Graces in abundance for our Souls; and all ſort of delights to ſatisfie our Bodies; wherein we ſhall pardon our Brethren their Sins, as we ſhall ſee that God has pardoned us, in giving us beſides Pardon Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; wherein there ſhall be no Temptations of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, nor of our Nature, for it will not any longer feel any vicious Inclinations; where in ſhort there can never enter any Evil, but all ſort of Happineſs, of Joy, and of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, Perfect and Compleat, Incomprehenſibly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. This is what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw, when he ſaid, <note n="i" place="bottom">1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>That they had never entred into the Mind of Man, the things which God had prepared for his Elect.</hi> All the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures are full of this Kingdom which is to come to us. This is the Feaſt ſignified by the Parable of <note n="l" place="bottom">Math. 22. 2.</note> the King, <hi>Who made a Marriage for his Son.</hi> This Son is Jeſus Chriſt, who is Allied with the Human Creature. His Nativity in Fleſh was but the betrothing, wherein he has indeed promiſed unto Man an Alliance, as he had done before to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which will be accompliſh'd and conſummated only at the coming of Jeſus upon Earth in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104476:112"/>
Glory, when he ſhall be perfectly United to Man, Body and Soul with the Divinity all together. This is that alſo which is ſignified unto us by the Parable <note n="m" place="bottom">Math. 25. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter who went into a far Country, giving Talents to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to every one according to his Ability, and at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, he demanded of each of them an account to give them their Wages.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt having given his Graces and Talents by his Goſpel, has aſcended unto his Father, which is the Long Journey: But he will return in his Glory to demand an account of every one of all the Graces received in this time, and to place his faithful Servants over great things, and make them enter into the Joy of their Lord. This is alſo the Parable <note n="n" place="bottom">Luk. 14. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Of the Maſter who made a Feaſt, and ſent his Servants to call thoſe that were bidden, who all excuſed themſelves: One had bought Oxen, another a Field, another had taken a Wife.</hi> The Birth of Jeſus Chriſt was the time when he came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite Men to the Feaſt which God would make that he might take his delight with Men; and as ſoon as the day ſhall come, that all ſhall be ready upon Earth for receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son of Man in his Glory, thoſe who were invited by his Evangelical Doctrin, will excuſe themſelves. One will ſay, I have been a Merchant, I muſt wait upon my Merchandiſe, I cannot attend it: Another will ſay, I have been a Labourer, I muſt take care of my Labours, I cannot attend it: Another will ſay, I have been Married, I muſt ſatisfie my Wife and Family, I cannot attend it. And when Jeſus Chriſt will ſwear that none of thoſe who were called ſhall taſte of his Banquet: That is, that all they who have received the Goſpel, and have not obeyed it, ſhall never enter into his Kingdom; For no State or Condition ought to hinder the obſerving of the Doctrin of the Goſpel: For Jeſus Chriſt has not brought it from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the Monks or Religious only, ſeeing there were none ſuch then; but he has brought it for all Chriſtians in general, whom he has particularly invited to make this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with them. And they who would not obſerve this Holy Doctrin, ſhall never taſte the Delights of that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Feaſt.

he ſignifies, that it will be only the Little and the Humble who ſhall inherit this Kingdom; and when they ſhall be mortified upon Earth, they will grow ſo ſtrongly, that the Angels of Heaven ſhall come to reſt in their Branches. And when this Kingdom of Heaven is compared <note n="p" place="bottom">Math. 13. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>To a Treaſure hid in the ground, that he,</hi> who has found it ought to ſell <hi>All that he has to buy this ground,</hi> that he may have this Treaſure: That is, that this Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt is hid from the Judgment of the Wiſe, being as it were ſunk in the ground till the time appointed, and then it ſhall be found by the Simple, who labour in this Life to find the Kingdom of Heaven; and when they ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, they will ſell all that they have, that they may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Evangelical Life.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, Sir, time would fail me to relate to you in particular all the Parables, with all the Paſſages of Holy Scripture, which treat of this Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth, becauſe it treats of nothing ſo much as this, as well in the Old as in the New Teſtament. <note n="q" place="bottom">Luk. 1. 68.</note> The Song of <hi>Zaohary</hi> is that he ſaw by a Prophetical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Re-eſtabliſhment of the People of God in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Jeſus Chriſt. The <note n="r" place="bottom">1. 46.</note> Song of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> ſpeaks of no other thing. For what ground would ſhe have had to rejoyce in the Lord, ſince all his Life was a train of Sadneſs and Sorrow? What ground would ſhe have had to Sing his Magnificence, ſince ſhe ſaw him ſo Poor and Deſpiſed in the Stable of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and purſued to Death in his Tender Infancy, as he was all the reſt of his Life? What ground of rejoycing to ſee him Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Accuſed as a Malefactor? <note n="s" place="bottom">Luk. 2. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>The Sword of Sorrow had always pierc'd her Heart,</hi> to ſee her Son, God and Man, Beaten, Torn, and at laſt Hang'd upon a Croſs in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. It muſt needs be that her Joy proceeded from a Prophetick Spirit, in ſeeing that one day he would be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth in Glory, wherein all Generations would call her Bleſſed, which has never been done: For none Praiſe her but a ſmall number of Chriſtians amidſt ſo many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: And that ſometimes in ſuch a manner, that very often inſtead of calling her Bleſſed, they offend her by thoſe Idolatries which they give to her Image; and Jeſus
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104476:113"/>
Chriſt himſelf would not ſuffer that they ſhould call her Bleſſed <note n="t" place="bottom">Luk. 11. 27, 28.</note> for having born him in her Womb, and ſuckled him with her Breaſts. By which it appears, that it is not in this Life, that all Generations call her Bleſſed; that it muſt needs be that She ſaw in her Spirit that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of her Son in Glory, wherein her Joy ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and her Spirit <hi>Shall rejoyce in God her Saviour.</hi> It will be then that he ſhall <hi>Caſt down the Mighty from their Seats, and Exalt the Humble:</hi> Which as yet has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been done: For the Mighty have greatly Exalted themſelves ſince the coming of Jeſus Chriſt; and the Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble have been, as they are yet, deſpiſed and rejected. The Holy Virgin could not lie in her Song called the <hi>Magnificat;</hi> but ſhe ſpoke of the time to come, which ſhe ſaw as preſent in her Spirit: Which made her rejoyce and utter all the things which muſt come to paſs in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Jeſus Chriſt, in which all Generations will call her Bleſſed, and all Souls will Magnifie this Glory; where the Humble will be Exalted, and the Mighty Abaſed, and Humbled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I was quite Tranſported beſide my ſelf to hear things ſo Admirable, which had never been heard of; and I ſaw them ſo clearly in my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, that I could not but ſay within my ſelf: It is ſo, theſe are clear Truths. I nevertheleſs ſaid to her, that many of theſe things are underſtood of the Empyreal Heaven, which is the Divine Place where the Souls of the Bleſſed will live Eternally with God, where the Body and the Soul ſhall have four Qualities, Agility, Splendor, Impaſſibility, Subtility, which being like Spirits, will have no longer need of any thing, but the preſence of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, theſe are Speculations of Men, who not having the gift of Underſtanding, would nevertheleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſomething of what they do not underſtand. If theſe Bodies of the Bleſſed had need of nothing, wherefore ſhould God create ſo many beautiful Creatures to ſerve on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Man's Miſery? For Gold, Silver, Precious Stones, and ſo many other things not very neceſſary for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his Life, would then have been created on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his Miſchief, ſince they did not ſerve but for this Life, where the moſt part of Men do Deſtroy and Damn

themſelves for Mony. Wherefore then would God have created ſo many fine Fruits and other things for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of Man, only for ſo ſhort a time of Penitence as this livfe? Would it have been worth the pains to have made the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, and all the Elements, that they might remain for ſo ſmall a time? Would God amuſe himſelf for a little profit? No, Sir, this will not go as Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple imagin; for all the Works of God are eternal, and will never Periſh; as I have told you heretofore, all things will continue in their kinds eternally <note n="x" place="bottom">Pſ. 119. 89, 90, 91.</note> to ſerve and rejoyce the Body of Man made Bleſſed, after he ſhall have finiſhed his ſhort Penitence. Gold and the other Metals will ſerve to build his Houſes, and the precious Stones to adorn them. They will not be Buildings made by Men's hands, with the ſweat of their Faces, but wrought by the power of God, who has form'd the Body, and will likewiſe form the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode of the ſame Body. And when the Holy Spirit ſpeaks of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="bottom">Rev. 21. 22</note>, that its Gates ſhall be of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, and its Walls of Gold. This is not only in a myſtical and ſpiritual Senſe, but alſo in a material Senſe; as all things muſt be perfect and accompliſh'd in their time, Spiritually, Corporeally, and Materially.

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir: Do you not <hi>ſee in the Goſpel (a) that Jeſus Chriſt ſays a little before his Death, That he will eat no more of the fruit of the Vine, until he ſhall drink it with his Diſciples in the Kingdom of his Father.</hi> This is applied to the Myſtical ſenſe, becauſe they know no other thing: But it will be alſo in a Material ſenſe, that they ſhall drink delicious Wine with Jeſus Chriſt, beſides the Myſtical Wine of the admiration of his Glory, which will inebriate Souls.

When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were brought out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they eat and drank with Delight: Their <note n="e" place="bottom">Deut. 29: 5, 6.</note> Cloaths and Shoes did not wax old, and they increaſed with their Bodies; even their Nails had no need of being cut: So particularly did God provide for their Neceſſities. This nevertheleſs was but the Figure of eternal Life. If he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for them Cloaths, Meat, and all things which were even delicious, without their care or labour, tho they ſtill offended him, how will he not provide the delights of the Bodies of the Bleſſed, who will bleſs him always?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ak'd her: If there would be likewiſe human Propagation in this Kingdom of Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir, there will be <note n="f" place="bottom">Iſ. 65. 23.</note> Propagation eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, but altogether Holy; altogether pure and Deify'd. It will be produced more leiſurely than in this World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God by his Mercy has here abridged our days, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge our Penitence: But that Kingdom being of eternal duration, will give time and leiſure to Propagate ſtayedly, without Pain or Sorrow, or concupiſcible Appetite, but by pure union of Charity in God, which will extend it ſelf to the production of new Creatures, to the glory of their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; which is very reaſonable: For, ſince this World was created, few Men have been brought forth who have glorified their God: On the contrary, in all Times and Ages the Devil has derived his Glory from Men; for <note n="g" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 1,-6.</note> when there were yet but two Perſons upon Earth, they yielded to the Devil, and followed his Suggeſtions, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning their God: And when the World was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh'd, Men gave themſelves to yet greater Evils: For at <note n="h" place="bottom">6. 7.</note> the time of the Deluge, eight Perſons only of all that great Univerſe were found obedient to the Word of God: And in time of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were brought out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to go into the promiſed Land, <note n="i" place="bottom">Numb. 14. 30.</note> two Perſons only did enter into it.

would not have conſum'd them. And when Jeſus Chriſt himſelf came upon Earth, all was corrupted, having <note n="m" place="bottom">Mat. 15. 6.</note> made void the Law of God by the Traditions of Men; as he reproach'd the Jews with it, who were then his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And now, Sir, ſince we have had the Doctrin of the Goſpel, what a ſmall number <note n="n" place="bottom">Iſ. 53. 1.</note> of Perſons do you ſee who have remain'd conſtant in it? And on the contrary, how many wicked Chriſtians are there beſides the Turks, Jews, Heathens, and ſo many other Sects, who are Enemies of God? Should it not be ſaid that God had created the Earth, and ſo many reaſonable Creatures, only for the glory of the Devil and his adherents, if he did not renew the Earth and make it bring forth fruit for his glory? This would be an evil thing, which God can never do. And that the Creation of Men may be good, of neceſſity there muſt be a time in which they may glorifie their God: And if there were no Generation in the Kingdom of God, a very ſmall number would bleſs him; even tho you ſhould ſum up the Prophets, the Apoſtles, and other Saints, this could not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to give glory to God, for the leaſt favour that he had beſtowed upon Men. It muſt needs be that the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bleſſed multiply eternally, as the Generation of the Miſerable does multiply temporally from the beginning of the World; or otherwiſe God would not be juſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That ſome Writers had ſpoken of this reign of Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth, but that the Roman Church had condemn'd it as Hereſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, No body can have ſpoke truly of this Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe it is <note n="o" place="bottom">Mat. 13. 44.</note>

Prophets, of <hi>Abraham, David, Solomon,</hi> the Apoſtles, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who have all largely ſpoken of this Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth, as well by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy as Parables, and other ways, tho the full under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it has been reſerved for the laſt Times <note n="p" place="bottom">Dan. 12. 9. 12.</note>, in which we live at preſent.

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, this proceeds partly from want of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Spirit, and partly becauſe the Devil has bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spirits of all Men, that they may not diſcover the truth of their Happineſs, nor of their Miſery: For if this were known, many Perſons would get out of Darkneſs, and would follow the Light of Truth: Whereas by that infatuation of Spirit, the Good periſh with the Wicked: And thus he gains all to himſelf. To give you a firm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that Jeſus Chriſt will come to reign upon Earth, Sir, apply your mind ſeriouſly to the reading of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: You ſhall find through all that they declare this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious coming, and all that Man ſhall receive thereby. This has been figured from the beginning of the World, and by all that has paſt in it ſince; all has been nothing but the Figures of this glorious Reign of Jeſus Chriſt. You have now a little proſpect of this by what I have declar'd unto you. Search into the matter, you will find the thing more true than all the other myſteries of our Faith: There

is no more obſcurity in it, for the time is come for the underſtanding of it. What the Fathers in paſt times have explain'd with ſo much pains, and ſo imperfectly, will be eaſie to you, and in a perfect ſenſe. No body will be able to doubt or be ignorant of it, who will ſubmit his Spirit unto God with Humility of Heart. All that Jeſus Chriſt and the Apoſtles have ſaid, has been fulfilled but in part: But you will find the accompliſhment and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſenſe in this <note n="p" place="bottom">Luk. 22. 16.</note> glorious Reign of Jeſus Chriſt: By diſcovering aſſuredly that all which they thought fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare cannot be underſtood of any other thing but of this Reign. Remark all the Petitions of the Lord's Prayer, which I have elſewhere explained to you. No body can imagine that all that we ask in that Prayer can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained during this miſerable Life, and it muſt needs be granted, that we pray for another Life, which we do not yet know <note n="q" place="bottom">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2.</note>, and that this Life alſo muſt be material, as well as ſpiritual: For if it were only divine, we would not ask for daily Bread, nor that the will of God ſhould be done there, or that his Name ſhould be Hallowed: For all theſe things are done always in the Empyreal Heaven, where no body has need of material Bread, Spirits being filled with the preſence of God: There is nothing there likewiſe to be forgiven, for no body there offends his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Temptations are baniſh'd from thence, and Evils cannot enter there. The bleſſed Life that we look for, muſt needs be material as well as ſpiritual, in which we ſhall have need of all the things which we ask in the Lord's Prayer, ſince they cannot be obtain'd in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life, and Jeſus Chriſt could not have made us ask for unprofitable things, or for thoſe which he would not give. This could not be done by a God who can do and know all things: For it would be altogether unprofitable to ask what we cannot obtain here, and it would be a ſuperfluous thing to ask that of which we would have no need in the Empyreal Heaven, as they imagine Paradiſe to be; all the other Doctrins of Jeſus Chriſt, are alſo like to the petitions of that Prayer: For when he ſays <note n="r" place="bottom">Math. 6. 33.</note> ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven, and the reſt ſhall be given you, this alſo will not come to paſs in this Life: For the Servants themſelves who ſeek the Kingdom of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:104476:118"/>
have ſuffered many Neceſſities; and <hi>Lazarus</hi> at the the Rich Man's Feet could not obtain a crum of Bread, tho' he did not ceaſe to ask it. If the Promiſe which Jeſus Chriſt has made of giving the reſt to thoſe who ſhall ſeek his Kingdom were to be underſtood of this preſent Life, none if the Friends of God would ſtand in need of any thing, tho' they ſhould not ask of any, it would be needful that God accompliſh what he has promiſed them. And if the Kingdom of Heaven were only ſpiritual, as People do imagine, there would be no need of any reſt (or other things) after having obtain'd this Kingdom, which would ſuffice fully. Do you not ſee, Sir, that this promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his Kingdom upon Earth, where he will give be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Glory, all material things for the delights of our Body? Which he calls, <hi>The Reſt;</hi> and makes us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that we ſhall not need to ſeek and labour to have them, but that he will give them freely as an exceſs of Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And when Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <note n="s" place="bottom">Mark 10. 29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>He, who ſhall leave Father, Mother, Brethren, Siſters, Lands, or any</hi> other thing for his Name, ſhall have a hundred fold in this World, neither can this be underſtood of this preſent Life, for the Apoſtles, and ſo many other Saints, who abandon'd all to follow him, had not an hundred fold in Earth, Mother, Brethren, Siſters, Houſes or Lands, but on the contrary, had need of many things after having abandon'd them. Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, after having abandoned the delights of Heaven, ſays, That <note n="t" place="bottom">Luk. 9. 58.</note> 
                  <hi>he had not</hi> in this Life a ſtone <hi>where to reſt his Head.</hi> How then ſhould his Promiſes be true, that he would render a hundred fold in this Life? Jeſus Chriſt can he lie, and make all who have abandon'd all for his ſake, to be afterward in want of things neceſſary? which would be very far from having the hundred fold of them. We ſee the Wicked have ordinarily more Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Earthly Goods, than the Juſt. Jeſus Chriſt would be a deceiver, to falſifie his Promiſe which he has made unto all thoſe who ſhall forſake all for his ſake. This cannot be thought: But he promiſed to thoſe who ſhall have left Father, Mother, or any other thing for his ſake, that they ſhall poſſeſs Life Eternal, which ſhall be in that World, when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come to dwell with his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104476:118"/>
Creatures; where he ſhall render the hundred-fold of all the things which they ſhall have forſaken for his ſake for one Father they ſhall find an hundred; becauſe all thoſe Bleſſed Ones ſhall have the Hearts of a Father and Mother toward their Neighbour: All ſhall be Brethren and Siſters under the government of one and the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And the Earth being purg'd from all the Wicked, ſhall ſuffice to give unto the Juſt an hundred times as much as they ſhall have abandoned in this miſerable Life. Lo, thus the Promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be accompliſh'd in a perfect ſenſe in his Kingdom, which can in no wiſe be accompliſh'd in a perfect ſenſe elſewhere; no more in the Empireal Heaven, as is imagined, than in this time of Penitence. There would need years of time, to relate unto you, Sir, all the paſſages of Holy Scripture which verifie theſe Truths; for when <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſays of Jeſus Chriſt, <note n="u" place="bottom">Luke 1. 32.</note> that he ſhall <hi>be great, and be called the Son of the moſt High;</hi> he cannot ſpeak of his coming in the Stable of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> for he was but a little Infant, abandoned and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected of Men; where his Grandeur did conſiſt of Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Miſeries: And when <hi>he began to be known and to ſpeak in publick,</hi> they call him <note n="x" place="bottom">Mat. 13. 55.</note> 
                  <hi>the Son of the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and of Mary,</hi> amongſt the <hi>common People: Which</hi> is very far from being <hi>call'd</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="bottom">Luke 1. 32.</note> the <hi>Son of the moſt High;</hi> and how ſhould <note n="z" place="bottom">Luke 1. 69.</note> 
                  <hi>he lift up his Horn,</hi> ſeeing he was wrapt up in Swadling-cloths, and bound with Swathing-bands: And it ſeems he had not ſtrength to reſiſt King <hi>Herod</hi> and the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> who purſued him to death, before whom he fled, inſtead of reſiſting. Do you not ſee, Sir, that nothing has in this World its perfect Senſe? Nevertheleſs, all that is ſpoken by the Holy Spirit, muſt be intirely fulfilled: And if we hope that this accompliſhment ought to come to paſs in this time of Penitence, we deceive our ſelves; for the more it ſhall continue, the more will Men <hi>miſtake the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of God, and the leſs will they call him the <hi>Son of the Moſt High,</hi> and the leſs will he make his ſtrength appear, that he may give place to Man to uſe his Free-will. But as ſoon as the time of the Reign of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come, he will exalt his Horn, to exerciſe his Power, and condemn the Wicked; and he ſhall be known of all Men for the Son
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:104476:119"/>
of the Moſt High: For he will come in Majeſty and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to rule <note n="a" place="bottom">Zach. 14. 5. 9.</note> over all things: Whereas in the Empireal Aether there will be no need of exalting his Horn, and ſhewing his Power, ſeeing all ſubmit to him by Love. It is therefore of the day when he ſhall come to reign upon the Earth, that <hi>Zacharias</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="bottom">Luke 1. 68-79.</note> ſpeaks by his Prophetical Spirit, when he ſaw the Glory <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth:</hi> And when he himſelf ſays, <note n="c" place="bottom">John 12. 22,</note> 
                  <hi>If I be lifted up, I will draw all unto me,</hi> he does not ſpeak but of this Kingdom to come: For he has not drawn all unto him by his death upon the Croſs, becauſe the moſt part of Men has ſince voluntarily yielded themſelves unto the Devil.</p>

and dreaded Death: Whereas, Men at preſent have loſt the fear of God, and fear only Men; and inſtead of dreading the paſſage of Death, they dread only the day in which they muſt loſe their Life, which they love more than God. Every one lyes in a deſperate Eſtate, without knowing it, and far leſs fearing it. God has reaſon to ſay of Chriſtians now, <note n="d" place="bottom">Jer. 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>My People has forſaken me,</hi> becauſe no body knows God any longer. Every one lives as if there were no God, and yet they would have Proſperity and Salvation; as if God were our Servant, obliged to ſerve us by force. We have changed the Order that he gave us, of doing Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence here, and we <note n="f" place="bottom">Iſ. 22. 12, 13.</note> would here take our pleaſures and reſt at eaſe; and inſtead of labouring and ſuffering, we would rule and rejoice. God ordain'd that <note n="g" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 17.</note> the Earth bring forth Thorns and Thiſtles, and we would gather nothing from it but Roſes without Thorns. He ſaid to the Woman <note n="h" place="bottom">3. 16.</note> that ſhe ſhall bring forth her fruit with Sorrow, and ſhe will needs conceive in Delight; in which ſhe would alſo bring forth, if it were in her power. So that no body acquieſces in the Ordinances of God but by force; and inſtead of embracing the Penitence which he ordain'd us, we reſiſt it with all our power; for we ſeek nothing but eaſe and repoſe, in the time in which we ought to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, watch and be at pains. Thus we reſiſt God and all the deſigns that he has about us. This is the moſt aſſured Mark to diſcover that all Men have forſaken God, and that no body fears nor knows him any longer. It is very true, that in all times there have been wicked Perſons, and ſuch as did not know God: But when all in general do forget him, it is to be believed, that we are aſſuredly in the laſt times, and that the Judgment is given out, becauſe the Meaſure is full, and the Evil cannot be greater than generally it is, and without hope of remedy.</p>
               <p>

them. <note n="i" place="bottom">Luke 18. 10.</note> The Example of the <hi>Publican</hi> and the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> who prayed in the Temple, ought to make us fear, that theſe outwardly good Men will be rather Condemned than the ill-Livers outwardly, becauſe they condemn themſelves for Sinners, and ſmite their Breaſts with Humility; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the others rely upon their own Righteouſneſs, and become Impenitent. I do not ſee that either the one or the other are good Men at preſent: For no Sinners ſmite their Breaſts through Penitence, far leſs do we ſee them change their Life, or forſake their Sins: And the Righteous in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, do live and die in the preſumption of their Salvation, not deſiring to change a manner of Life which they eſteem to be good; tho all have abandoned God to follow their Paſſions. If ſome follow them in Wrath, or in Luxury or even in Robbery, they become the enemies of God: But others who are of more mild Complexions, follow their Paſſions in Jealouſie, or in Self-love, or in the eſteem of their own Virtues. Is not all this before God reckoned the ſame evil? Is it not enough that we have forſaken him to cleave to our ſelves, and are become Idolaters of our own Inclinations?

Their RIGHTEOUSNESS is only Human. They would not do wrong to any Body, becauſe Injuſtice and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104476:120"/>
Cheating, is blamable in all Men of Honour; and he who deſires to preſerve his Reputation, will beware of deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or cheating any Body, and you will eſteem ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Juſt, becauſe he renders unto every one what apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to him. Believe me, Sir, this Righteouſneſs is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Moral Virtue, which is recompenced by the good Reputation they acquire among Men. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2, 5.</note> It muſt not at all be expected that God will recompence in the other World what has been done for this. A Man gives ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to every one, that he may have the reputation of being a juſt Man, which being obtain'd, he is fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Even ſo is it of GOODNESS, wherein divers Perſons are Born, their natural temper being enclined to ſweetneſs, renders them lovely to every body: This goodneſs makes them takea ll in good part: Even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vil things they deſire to believe they are good: If the evil of one were told which might grieve them, they would reject this Truth as evil, and would ſay, <hi>I will not believe ill of my Neighbour:</hi> And even tho they knew the evil openly, they are too good to reſiſt it or oppoſe it. This is the diſpoſition of the good Men of the World, who love rather to be deceived with evil, than to believe it, that they may avoid it. All this goodneſs is but natural, and is recompenced with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment they have of being good: They even endure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, without having the force to reſiſt it: And upon this, it will be ſaid of ſuch a Perſon that he is patient and good: Not diſcerning that this Patience and Goodneſs proceeds from an effeminacy of Heart, which makes them preſume upon a falſe goodneſs and patience, which is nothing but Human, Hypocritical and Deceitful. Even ſo is it of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral VERITY, which before God is Falſhood. One will ſay, <hi>I am your Servant;</hi> and he will deny his Brother the leaſt Service! One will ſay, <hi>I am a great Sinner,</hi> while in the mean time he preſumes that he is a good Man! for if he did believe himſelf truly to be a Sinner, he would ſeek the means to be converted. One will ſay, <hi>I am not worthy of drawing near to God,</hi> and he will receive every day the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and will ſay, that it is to receive Grace; which is nothing but a Cloak to the former Lie: For Men experience ſufficiently that they have not received Grace by receiving it ſo often. One will ſay, <hi>I am for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>

                  <hi>of God;</hi> and he is as careful to have Honours and Riches as Secular Perſons! One ſays, that he loves God, and he loves nothing but himſelf. One ſays, <hi>I am retired from the World;</hi> nevertheleſs he has as much affection for it as before, and ſtudies to ſatisfie himſelf. In Short, Sir, there is nothing but Lies and deceit among all Men, even thoſe whom you eſteem to be good Men, they have nothing but apparent Vertues, which are very diſpleaſing to God, and draw down his avenging hand upon our criminal Heads: Becauſe no body fears God any longer, but by word; and they who fear their Damnation, perſwade themſelves, that they fear God, while out of pure ſelf-love they fear the evil due to their Sins, that they may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in them; and they place their Piety in outward De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, with which they do more diſtract their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding from God, than fix it upon him. And <note n="n" place="bottom">Iſ. 29. 13.</note> yet they believe they are Juſt and Pious, fearing God; tho in the mean time they have neither the one nor the other of theſe Virtues. Thus you are deceived with thouſands of others who are in the good Opinion, that there are yet many good Perſons upon Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her: How we might know the true Righteouſneſs nd Virtues of Men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, no body can know it as to others, but they who poſſeſs it themſelves. Therefore I told you, that <note n="o" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. ii.—15.</note> union with God is needful for to know true Virtue. This union makes us partake of the Virtues of God; ſo that he who is in God, partakes of his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> of his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and of his <hi>Truth.</hi> The RIGHTEOUSNESS of God, is always juſt <note n="p" place="bottom">Pſ. 119. 137.</note> doing juſtly to all, as well to our Enemies as to our Friends, not enduring any Injuſtice no more in our ſelves than in others, neither in ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters nor in great- Our Works are always accompanied with this Righteouſneſs, and alſo our Words, our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, our Buſineſs, and even our good Works: Knowing well that without this divine Righteouſneſs, nothing can be good. And even as God never does any thing without this Righteouſneſs; So we do all things righteouſly; ſo much as we draw near to God, we are as much Righteous, and no more: and he who partakes of this divine Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diſcerns and knows very eaſily the Righteouſneſs and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:104476:121"/>
Unrighteouſneſs of others: For if their Righteouſneſs be of God, it will always be conform to that which we partake of the ſame God, and if it be not, it will directly oppoſe it. There are ſome who would believe that one had the art of Divination, when he can diſcover falſe things which appear true to the eyes of Men: But this does not proceed from any Divination, but only from the Righteouſneſs of God: When it refides in a Soul, it perceives immediately that theſe apparent Righteouſneſſes do reſiſt and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto the Righteouſneſs of God. For Example, a Judge will give good Juſtice to a Party, becauſe he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to him by ſome of his Friends. This is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an Human Juſtice, becauſe it has had reſpect to Men: For to be Divine, it ought to have reſpect only to good Right; which is not obſerved in the preſent time, wherein the Proverb ſays, <hi>He who has good Right, has need of good Help.</hi> It is the ſame as to Piety and Devotion: If they go to Church, to the Maſs, and the frequenting of the Sacraments, out of natural cuſtom or inclination, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is good and laudable. This Righteouſneſs is not of God, becauſe it reſpects our ſelves or Men. And if you partake of the GOODNESS of God, Sir, you will do good to all Creatures indifferently, as he does, without wiſhing good to your Friends, and hating your Enemies, or not helping them in their need. But when our good deeds are partial, reſpecting our Kindred, our Allies, our Friends, and Neighbours; then our goodneſs is nothing but Human. This is eaſie to be obſerved by him who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the goodneſs of God, who loves nothing but that wihch is good and conformable to Righteouſneſs and Truth: Whereas Human goodneſs reſpects nothing but that which is ſenſible to Nature, leaving ſometimes Righteouſneſs and Innocence without help, to ſuccour its Friends; yea, even to excuſe or cover their Iniquities. Theſe are all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes without Fruit, having received in this World the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of ſuch good Works. For if we do good to our Friends, they will do the like to us; and ſo we ſhall be payed, without having right to pretend any other recompence therefore in Heaven. Jeſus Chriſt has advertis'd us of this, <note n="q" place="bottom">Luke 14. 12, 13, 14.</note> ſaying, When you make Feaſts, do not call the Rich, leſt they bid you alſo, and thereby you receive no reward.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:104476:122"/>
And if you partake of the TRUTH of God, Sir, you will very eaſily diſcover Lying, becauſe this ſtrait Truth does always oppoſe that which is contrary thereunto. There needs but to walk Strait to overturn that which is Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Spirit of Truth, is incompatible with that of Error. There needs but to ſpeak the Truth ſimply, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Lying. Many Perſons are troubled to underſtand the Truth, who if they were not in Lies, could not be troubled at it, becauſe it is always deſirable and enlightens the Underſtanding. Truth being God, ought to be loved and received by every one, and as much as it is now out of credit, it is ſo much an evidence, that all have abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned God, in abandoning Truth, Righteouſneſs and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There is no other God but he <note n="r" place="bottom">Eph. 5. 9. Pſ. 89. 15.</note> who is the ſource of theſe three Vertues, of which Men now have not retain'd any foot-ſteps, and at preſent thoſe are eſteemed Saints who have but human Righteouſneſs, natural Goodneſs, and political Truth, and yet they will not believe that we are in the laſt Times, and that the World is Judged. What more certain Marks can we have? Outward Signs are a very ſmall matter in reſpect of ſeeing that all Men have Abandon'd their God. Draw near to God, Sir, and <note n="s" place="bottom">Pſ. 36. 10.</note> you will diſcover it as well as I.</p>

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> It is true, Sir, all the Wicked will periſh, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom notwithſtanding there will be yet ſome ſav'd: becauſe they are ſo thro' Ignorance: Theſe indeed will yet receive the Light of Truth, with which they will diſcover the Lyes, which have been taught them: For many have entred into the Spirit of Error, thinking they did well, and if they had been taught there is no Salvation but for thoſe who reſign themſelves wholly to God, and unite their Wills to his, they would aſſuredly force themſelves to find this Unity of their Wills with God, and would have reſign'd themſelves to him far more eaſily than they have done, to follow ſo many different Exerciſes of Devotion. For one has taken the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and goes bare-footed, without wearing Linnen upon his Body: Another that of the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> never
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:104476:122"/>
to eat Fleſh, nor converſe in the World: Others riſe in the Night to pray: Others wear Sackcloth, and exerciſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, making long Prayers and ſinging Pſalms, vowing Obedience, Poverty and Chaſtity, with a great many other Things, painful to the Body and to the Spirit: In which all the People deſire to imitate them according to their Condition: Some will faſt ſometimes a Week, will take Directors to ſubmit their Wills to them, will force themſelves to ſay a great many Chaplets, or other Prayers, and to be in Churches as much as is poſſible for them, with a great many other things which are troubleſome, and oft-times of little profit for the Salvation of their Souls. But if they had been taught. That to be ſaved they muſt reſign themſelves to God, they would more eaſily have found this Reſignation than all thoſe things which are ſuperfluous for many, and would more eaſily have reſign'd their Wills to that of God, than to ſome Man, ſubject to all ſorts of Paſſions. Thoſe, I ſay, having diſcover'd the Truth will be converted by the Plagues, and will endeavour to approach to the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Goodneſs and Truth of God; as much as they are now far from it, thro' Ignorance. No Body muſt any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be flatter'd, Sir. All thoſe who ſhall not have this Righteouſneſs of which I have ſpoken to you, <note n="t" place="bottom">Matth. 5. 20.</note> will not be ſav'd: Neither you nor I, nor any Body, be who they will, can be ſav'd, but by God, therefore Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid, <note n="u" place="bottom">19. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>That with Men it was impoſſible to be ſav'd, but that it was poſſible with God:</hi> To ſhew that upon this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him our Salvation does depend: And that all thoſe means introduc'd by Men are a very ſmall matter, for they can ſerve only to ſome for means to attain to this Union, ſerving for others for great Hindrances: For this Union requires a Recollection of Spirit, and not the Diverſion of it to ſo many different things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her: That no Body doubted that our Salvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon God: That no Body could ſave either himſelf or others: That this Paſſage of the Goſpel was ſo underſtood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, you do not underſtand me well. Our Salvation does not depend upon God, as you believe it, that he ſaves one and damns another without our contributing thereunto. This is an Error which puts the Salvation of the moſt pious in hazard. For God
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:104476:123"/>
will damn no Body without Sin, and likewiſe he will ſave no body unleſs they give themſelves to him <note n="x" place="bottom">John 7. 37.</note> of their own Free-will. And what Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to his Apoſtles. <hi>It is impoſſible as to Men to be ſav'd, but that it is not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God;</hi> is to be underſtood, as long as a Man ſhall live to himſelf, it is impoſſible for him to be ſav'd: But if he come to unite himſelf to God, returning with the Heart to him, he will ſave him. And when you ſay to me, That all the World will periſh if they muſt needs Exerciſe the very ſame Righteouſneſs of which I ſpeak, becauſe Men are very far from it; it is a certain Truth, that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the State in which they are, they will <note n="y" place="bottom">Luke 13. 3.</note> all periſh: For living to themſelves, it is impoſſible as to them: But if they be converted, and return unto God, he will ſave them. No Body can look for Salvation after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that they live at preſent, for they know not God any longer, all having abandon'd him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her; How ſhe perceiv'd that the World is judged, and that the irrevocable Sentence is given?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I perceive this by the Juſtice of God, which cannot ſuffer an Univerſal Evil without an Univerſal Chaſtiſement. When there have been particular Wicked Men, God has condemn'd them in particular: For his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Juſtice never exceeds nor diminiſhes any thing from the Merit or Demerit of Men, doing always juſtly, as well to the Evil as to the good. Now Men having generally all of them abandon'd their God, have, in doing this, given Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the general Deſtruction of the World, which ſhall not be recall'd, becauſe the Will of Man is not inclin'd to return to him; but rather to be the more eſtrang'd from him, if the Plagues ſhould yet be delay'd. Therefore I affirm with Aſſurance, Sir, that the irrevocable Sentence is given to purge the whole World by divers Plagues of <hi>War, Peſtilence</hi> and <hi>Famine,</hi> which are fram'd of the three means which have caus'd Men to abandon God. Three general Sins <note n="z" place="bottom">Ezek 5. 12. 15. 21.</note> will have Three General Plagues. The firſt is, that Men have all abandon'd the Love of their Neighbour, and inſtead of loving him as themſelves, according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God, every one endeavours to make War againſt him by Contempt, Envy and Jealouſie: By Quarrels, Lyes and Cheatings. All theſe things have made Man
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:104476:123"/>
abandon God in his Neighbour, who is his true Image. They ſtudy not only not to love him as themſelves, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to vex him in all things. There is nothing but Wars and Diviſions even among Kinsfolk, yea between the Father and the Son. All theſe Diſcords together, do they not make an Univerſal <hi>War?</hi> We are aſtoniſh'd to ſee the Wars of Provinces and of Kings, without conſidering that every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy does the ſame thing, according to his Power. A Clown will ſometimes fight with his Companion for a Farthing. He does as much Evil, in proportion, as a King, who fights againſt his Equal for a Kingdom; for God regards nothing but the Wickedneſs of the Heart, and not the Worth of the Subject. If he permit Kingdoms to be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywhere in Wars, it is by an exact Juſtice, when all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men are ſo already. Could he deny Kings the ſame Liberty that he permits to all others, ſince they were all equally created with the Diſpoſal of their Free Will, the King as well as the Clown? Would it be juſt that God ſhould take from Kings the Power to make War, and permit it to private Perſons? He would be a partial God, an accepter of Perſons. If we did live in Peace with our Neighbour, God would only puniſh in particular the Kings which make War: But our Domeſtick Wars do merit that we ſhould ſuffer Univerſal Wars; and that by a juſt Judgment. Since we will not continue in Peace with God, with our ſelves and with our Neighbours, it is not at all meet that we ſhould be ſo with Kings: For our Wars have made us abandon the God of Peace, and draw upon our ſelves the Plague of War by our Sin of Diſſenſion.</p>
               <p>The Plague of <hi>Peſtilence</hi> is alſo juſtly prepar'd for us: Becauſe all Men in general have abandon'd their God for the Affection which they bear to this miſerable Life. It is therefore juſt that it be taken away from us, ſince it has ſerv'd us for a mean to abandon our God, who gave it unto us, only that we might love him, and we have loved the Gift more than the Giver; our Life being the Time of Penitence, wherein we ought always to aſpire to that which will be eternal: But, on the contrary, we would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to loſe it <hi>(the Eternal)</hi> provided we might live here always: All Men almoſt are in this Error; by which they draw down the Plague of Peſtilence, to put an End to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſo impious, which have made them abandon their God. This Life muſt needs be taken away from us, ſince it ſerves as a mean to withdraw us from God. The Plague of Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:104476:124"/>
is juſtly ſent upon us to give Death to thoſe who love their Lives more than God. As is alſo that of <hi>Famine,</hi> becauſe ſo many Men have abandon'd their God, for the Pleaſures of the Mouth. How many are there who love <note n="a" place="bottom">Iſ. 5. 11, 12. Phil. 3. 18, 19.</note> Meat and Drink more than Spiritual Delights? Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Mouth and the Belly be ſatisfied, they care very little for God. Is it not fit that they endure Hunger who think of nothing but of filling themſelves? This evil is ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral that in the beſt Aſſemblies of Chriſtians, now-a-days, they ſpeak for the moſt part of Eating and Drinking, to keep themſelves chearful. Is it not fit that this ſhould be chaſtiſed with Juſtice by an univerſal Hunger, ſince this Senſual Appetite has cauſed an univerſal Sin, by almoſt all the Men of the World? From whence I draw the certainty that all are judg'd, and that the Sentence is irrevocable: Becauſe no Body repents of theſe three Sins, which form the laſt Plagues, and God cannot defer longer to ſend them <note n="b" place="bottom">4 Eſd. 15. 16. 14-18.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her; how we could believe that the last Plagues were begun?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Do you not <note n="c" place="bottom">Rom. 1. 28. 2 Theſſ. 2. 11.</note> perceive that we are abandon'd to the Spirit of Error? That Lying prevails, and <note n="d" place="bottom">Jer. 9. 3, 4.</note> that Truth is oppreſt? That Men <note n="e" place="bottom">Jer. 6. 14. 8. 11.

That there is <note n="f" place="bottom">Iſ. 59. 3, 4, 8.</note> no longer Righteouſneſs nor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity or Fidelity among Men? That Evils are conceiv'd without Fear, and brought forth without Reprehenſion? That the Juſt <note n="g" place="bottom">Ez. 13. 19.</note> is puniſh'd as guilty, and the Guilty ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and defended? That there is no longer <note n="h" place="bottom">Jer. 5. 1. 7. 28.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith nor Law among Chriſtians, and that they live in a Neglect of God and of their Salvation? Are not theſe the greateſt Plagues that could ever befal the World? They are more to be dreaded than Fire, Peſtilence, War and bodily Famine, which can but kill Bodies: Whereas theſe Spiritual Plagues kill the Soul, which is an Eternal Spirit. Behold, Sir, with the Eyes of Truth, and you will ſee that all Souls periſh without perceiving it. Which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Puniſhment that God can ever permit to befal Men.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104476:124"/>
Many ſay blindly, <hi>We are at the End of the World, for Wickedneſs abounds in all places: There is no Truſt to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to any: They deceive one another without Faith or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</hi> In ſaying this they ſpeak the Truth, without knowing it, far leſs apprehending it. Many Signs have appear'd <note n="i" place="bottom">Joel 2. 30, 31. 4 Eſd. 5. 1-12.</note> in Heaven, in the Sun, in the Stars, fearful Comets, menacing great Evils, which did affright ſome at firſt, but ſo ſoon as the Devil had Leiſure to make his Adherents ſtudy to find out Reaſons, ſhewing that theſe were but natural things, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in the Air, he made the Fear of thoſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God, ſent as the Forerunners of his Juſtice, to evaniſh out of their Minds. The Sea has yielded blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And as ſoon as this has ceas'd, the Memory of it has been effac'd. Fire has burnt many Cities, and they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently found out ſome Invention to cover all theſe Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which God gives us, ſaying, That theſe are Caſual and Natural Things: As alſo the ſwallowing up of ſeveral Towns and Cities, caus'd by Earthquakes: They attribute all theſe Things to future and to natural Cauſes, ſaying; That theſe Countries, ſituate toward the Sea, are ſubject to Earthquakes. In ſhort, Sir, they make all the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and Warnings of God to evaniſh out of Men's Minds, that no Body may enter into himſelf to be converted unto him through Fear and Trembling. Some Stroaks of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us'd ſometimes to ſhake intire Cities; where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ran to Confeſſion, to prepare themſelves for Death. But now, when they ſee ſo many ſeveral Effects of the Juſtice of God, by Men's being abandon'd to all ſorts of Sins, and alſo by all thoſe outward Sings in Heaven and Earth, which have appear'd in our Time and to our Eyes, no body is converted unto God for this: Far leſs do they Imbrace the Spirit of Penitence. It ſeems they mock at God's Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſaying; <hi>Theſe are Natural Things.</hi> But I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly demand of theſe Ear-flatterers, If God ought not to ſend his Plagues but by ſupernatural Things, and to make Chimera's in the Air? He, who has created all the Elements, muſt not he make Uſe of them <note n="l" place="bottom">Wiſd. 11. 16.</note> to chaſtiſe the Offences which we commit againſt him? Is there not need of Natural Things to make our Body ſuffer, which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Natural? If the Bodies of the damn'd ſhall indeed be puniſh'd with Natural Things, why ſhould not, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104476:125"/>
our Bodies, which are yet living upon Earth? Since they are not ſenſible but of Natural Things, they muſt needs have Subjects conformable to their Nature. The Deluge was made by a Natural Rain: And the laſt Plagues will be made by Peſtilence, War, Famine and Fire, all Natural Things, becauſe the Heaven, the Earth and all the Elements ought to riſe up againſt us, to avenge the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that we do againſt their Creator and ours. If the Fire ſhall kindle by ſome accident, or the Earth quake by the Toſſings of the Sea, and overturn Cities, would <note n="m" place="bottom">Amos 3. 6.</note> this be accidental unto God, who ſays <note n="n" place="bottom">Matth. 10. 30.</note> that, to him, the Hairs of our Heads are numbred? Would he thus let ſuch grievous Accidents fall out Without his Permiſſion? this cannot be true. But the Devil, to divert us from believing that theſe things are <note n="o" place="bottom">Matth 24. 8.</note> the beginnings of the laſt Plagues, makes it be ſaid by his Adherents, that theſe are Natural Things that no Body may turn to Repentance.</p>

                  <hi>I Ask'd her; How God permits that we ſhould be thus aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd to the Spirit of Error?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, <note n="p" place="bottom">Kings 22. 22.</note> God permits it by his Juſtice, becauſe we have left <note n="q" place="bottom">Rom. 1. 28. 2 Theſſ. 2. 10, 11, 12.</note> his Spirit of Truth, to hearken unto and follow <note n="r" place="bottom">Jer. 13. 25. Ezek. 13. 19.</note> Lyes. He compels no Body, leaving every one in the Liberty wherein he created them. If Man therewith will needs abandon his God and adhere unto the Devil <note n="s" place="bottom">Pſ. 81. 12, 13.</note> he lets him, for he will not take away again the Free-Will which he has once given him, which God will never take back again, for he is <note n="t" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 17.</note> unchangeable in all his Doings: And having once found it good that Man ſhould be a kind of Creature altogether free, he cannot afteward find it evil, but will leave him this abſolute Liberty unto all Eternity. If he will uſe it to love God, he will follow the End for which it has been given him; and if he will uſe it to do evil, and to withdraw himſelf from God, he is free: God will not be mov'd for this, remaining always, Juſt, Good and True. Whatever Man does, God remains always what he is in himſelf without being mov'd, and without hindring Man to withdraw himſelf from him, when he will needs do it by his own Free Will. God can loſe nothing, even tho' all the Men of the World would follow the Devil. They only wrong themſelves. God will never take away again the Free Will that he has given them, for their evil Deeds; but permits them ſtill to uſe it, as well to their
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:104476:126"/>
Damnation as to their Salvation. All the other Creatures do the Will of God of Neceſſity, as a Servant does the Will of his Maſter by force, for it is neceſſary to the other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as well animate as inanimate to do the Will of God without their being able to reſiſt it, being bounded, limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and conſtrain'd not to paſs over the Bounds and the Limits wherein God has plac'd them: But Man alone, who participates of the Deity, has the Liberty to reſiſt the Will of God, which he will not oppoſe, for he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent <note n="u" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 29.</note> of the Liberty that he has given unto Man. Thus God permits Man to abandon himſelf unto the Spirit of Error, and to forſake that of Truth: For he would act againſt his Goodneſs, to take back again that great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which he has given unto Man, of his Free Will, with which he ought to rule over the Earth as a little God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent from every other thing which is not God. And if he did not permit Man to follow the Spirit of Error, when he will needs follow it, he would render him a limited and forc'd Creature, as all the reſt, which ſerve the Will of God by Force, as, Servants and Slaves: Which would be contrary to the Deſigns of God, who has choſen our Souls for his Spouſes <note n="x" place="bottom">Cant. 4. 10, 11, 12.

               <p>IT is more than twelve Years ſince I had the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Conferences in this ſecond Part of the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> and thoſe alſo which ſhall follow in the third Part; which you may afterwards ſee, when it ſhall pleaſe God that they be publiſh'd; and I had no Inclinations to make them publick: For all theſe Queſtions were propos'd to me by the deceaſt Mr. <hi>Chriſtian de Cort,</hi> when he was a Prieſt in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, Paſtor of the Church of S. <hi>John</hi> in the City of <hi>Mechlin</hi> in <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> and Superiour of the Congregation of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Oratory in that City; who being deſirous to underſtand the Matters relating to his Religion, propos'd to me divers Theological Queſtions, touching the Faith and Manners of Chriſtians who aſpire to the Perfection of their Souls: To which I anſwered according to the Wiſdom and Experience that God gave me. This the deceaſt <hi>de Cort</hi> having exactly noted and ſet down in Writing, he deſign'd to have printed it in the Year 1667. But it was afterwards delayed by the Advice of many of his Friends; who knowing the Partiality and Jealouſie of many Divines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, were afraid, <q>that the ſaid
<pb facs="tcp:104476:128"/>
                     <hi>de Cort</hi> and I might be put into the Inquiſition for having declar'd too openly the Faults and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are crept into the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; telling us, that this would be inſupportable to many Zealots of that Religion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But the deceaſt <hi>de Cort</hi> being very earneſt to make the plain Truth known to the People, reſolved to go to <hi>Holland,</hi> and to print all theſe Conferences there, judging it very neceſſary that they ſhould be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to ſincere Perſons, who he thought were periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thro' Ignorance, ſaying often <q>I was deceived as to Matters of Faith and Manners: And thro' this Blindneſs I have alſo deceived others, by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Shadows for Subſtances; and I'll never be at reſt till I have communicated to them the Truths of God that you have declared to me:</q> And ſo by his Perſuaſions and many importunate Requeſts, I reſolved to go with him to <hi>Holland</hi> to cauſe him to print all theſe Conferences, that we had had together for a long time. I was much averſe to this; becauſe I had not yet printed any of my Writings; and alſo the Matters contain'd in theſe Conferences would greatly ſhock many who are in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, whom I lov'd tenderly, and deſired not to offend them, eſteeming them my Brethren, and I had never yet convers'd with any, nor had I been in any Place or Country, without the Obedience of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: And I knew not what ſort of People I might meet with elſewhere: For I imagined I ſhould find there People that were monſtrous, or of a different Shape from thoſe of my own Country, where they repreſent to Children thoſe who are not <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> a Wolves
<pb facs="tcp:104476:128"/>
covered with Sheeps Skins, that they may imprint on the tender Hearts of the Children, a mortal Enmity againſt thoſe who in all things have not the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that are profeſs'd in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. This made me afraid to go to <hi>Holland</hi> to cauſe theſe Conferences to be printed.</p>
               <p>But after I had ſeriouſly recommended it to God, I reſolved to go on that Errand: For God made me underſtand, <q>That 'tis not Religion that ſaves the Soul, but the Love of God that begets true Vertue: And that I ought to love all, and to do good to thoſe of every Religion, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Truth of God impartially.</q> And this inward Voice planted in my Soul an Impartiality to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all ſorts of Religions indifferently, without caring to inform my ſelf of what Religion Perſons were, or the Places and Countries to which I was to go, nor with whom I was to ſpeak. This has been my Practice ever ſince, regarding only the Diſpoſition of the Souls with whom I was to treat without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Religion they profeſs'd, or what Party they were of as to outward Worſhip; ſince in Effect in all Kinds of States, Profeſſions and Religions I've met with Perſons diſpoſed to receive the Truth that comes from God: Yea, ſome of thoſe that are without the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, are more ready to receive it, than they who call themſelves <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> tho' this they hold for an Article of Faith, that none can be ſaved out of her Communion.</p>
               <p>This is very ill conceiv'd, ſince God is univerſal, and he's to be found every where by thoſe who ſeek and worſhip him: For he's not fix'd to any material Body.

All Souls who take their Delight in him, are his Spouſes, call them by what Name or Religion you pleaſe: For all theſe different Names or Opinions do not make a Chriſtian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but only the Practice of the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt makes a Chriſtian.

<pb facs="tcp:104476:129"/>
confirms this Truth, That Religion does not ſave a Man; but the Love of God that ſanctiſies him.</p>
               <p>This made me get over all Humane Reſpects and declare the Truth of the things which were ask'd me by ſo many different Conferences, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: For at that time I knew no other Religions; and (with Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) I booked upon all thoſe who died out of the <hi>Roman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> Church as damn'd (as our Divines taught.) So that being ask'd by a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt, I anſwered plainly to all his Queſtions: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which, many took Occaſion to ſay that I had chang'd my Religion, and was become an Enemy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; which is not true, ſince being born in it, I will live and die therein, without changing Name or Religion; but only my Manners and Life: And will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be regenerated in the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, and to follow and imitate him even to Death, letting Ignorant Men ſay and judge of me as they pleaſe. In the mean time I offer this LIGHT OF THE WORLD to all good Souls who ſeek the Truth, and deſire to become true Chriſtians, that they may truly diſcern Reality from Appearance: For this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails now through all the World, among all ſorts of Sects and Religions, where every one cleaves to the Bark, and does not touch the Wood, fancying that Vertue conſiſts in having a fine Religious Name of that of the <hi>Reformed, the Evangelicks, the Catholicks;</hi> Yea, that,
<pb facs="tcp:104476:130"/>
they are perſons guided by the Holy Spirit, of which the <hi>Quakers</hi> boaſt, though all theſe ſorts of Names are falſe, and not at all ſuitable to the Life and Manners of thoſe who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo.</p>
               <p>For if they, who are called Reformed, were truly ſo, we would ſee the Reformation in their Life and Manners: Whereas we find they all live according to Fleſh and Blood; which the Scripture ſays, <note n="f" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15. 50.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> They are neither reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Moveables nor their Apparel, nor in their Eating or Drinking: They ſeek in all the fineſt and the beſt: They labour and trade dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, that they may have wherewith to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves in Pomp, Exceſs or Plenty as much as they can, without bridling their fleſhly Appetites or their Senſualities in any thing; ſtill coveting more, that they may give it as much Satisfaction as they can, that in this World they may have Eaſe, Honours and Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Thus they are called <hi>Reformed,</hi> though in Effect they will not reform themſelves in the leaſt thing for the Kingdom of Heaven. By which we ſee that they who call themſelves <hi>Reformed</hi> bear a falſe Name, that makes them Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and Deceivers of others and of themſelves.</p>
               <p>As thoſe alſo are deceived who call themſelves the <hi>Evangelicks:</hi> For in all their Works and
<pb facs="tcp:104476:130"/>
Practices, there is nothing conformable to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, but all directly oppoſite to it: For they do not obſerve ſo much as one Point of the Evangelical Councils: For inſtead of loving voluntary Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,; they love the Abundance and Riches of this World unſatiably; and they who ought to be the Guides to thoſe Evangelical Perfections, are the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt remov'd from them, abandoning their Flocks and Churches to find others that afford them more temporal Profit: They are far from imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Apoſtles, who ſaid <note n="g" place="bottom">Matth. 10. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>freely I have received, and freely I give thee;</hi> ſince theſe modern <hi>Evangelicks</hi> give at the greateſt Price, and to him that bids moſt. And therefore they do not juſtly bear the Name of <hi>Evangelicks,</hi> ſince they neither teach nor Practiſe ſo much as one Council of the Goſpel, and have nothing but falſe Names and Parades, that they may appear to be in the Sight of Men what they are not at all in the Sight of God.</p>
               <p>No more than thoſe are <hi>Catholicks</hi> who bear the Name, ſince to call one a Catholick, is to ſay, he is a Perſon joyn'd in the Communion of Saints; which theſe are not who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Catholicks,</hi> ſince we perceive not any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in their Lives, but much Vice and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, accompanied with Hypocriſie, and ſeeming Vertue, without any Reality or Sanctification. They boaſt that they are <hi>Abraham's</hi> Children, without doing the Works of <hi>Abraham;</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:104476:131"/>
that they are Chriſtians, without obſerving the Commands of Chriſt: They content themſelves to be called <hi>Catholicks</hi> without conforming their Lives to thoſe who liv'd holily upon the Earth, whoſe Lives and Hiſtories they read without endeavouring to become holy, as they were whoſe Feaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s they ſolemnize, tho' they ſhall never be in their Communion, nor truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, till in their Lives they follow their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and walk in the ſtreight Way that leads to Life. So that this Name of <hi>Catholick,</hi> will condemn them rather than juſtifie them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they preſume to be preferr'd by God to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religions; becauſe they are of the moſt Holy and Perfect Religion, according to the Name of <hi>Catholick,</hi> which they bear. This would really be if their Souls were united to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the Communion of Saints; which only and no other thing, makes a Catholick. By which we ſee that theſe Perſons bear a falſe Name, ſince they preſume of their Salvation, becauſe of the Name <hi>Catholick;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe they are in the true Church, out of which they ſay, there is no Salvation.</p>
               <p>This would be true, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were the only Communion of Saints: But becauſe Souls who are not ſanctified, are not truly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi> neither will they be ſaved for their Religion, ſince no Religion ſaves, unleſs the Heart be truly Religious, or truly <hi>Catholick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which alſo thoſe who are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do greatly deceive themſelves, who through a
<pb facs="tcp:104476:131"/>
fooliſh Imagination, fancy that they are guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Holy Spirit as ſoon as they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to conform themſelves to this Sect, as if it had more Force to ſanctifie Men, than all the other Religions together, even the moſt perfect, none of which can ſave ſo much as one Soul: For there is nothing that ſaves, but the LOVE OF GOD, and not a Religion. Every one ought to hold the Religion that ſerves him as a Mean to attain to this LOVE, without taking his Religion for the End of his Salvation, if they would not be greatly deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Death, thinking to plead their Religion which they imagine to be the beſt, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> believe they have the Holy Spirit, and ſo take the Name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> tho they have him only by Imagination, and falſe Perſuaſions; and the Devil makes them believe they are better than all the reſt of Men; becauſe they have quitted outwardly the groſs Sins of Drunkenneſs, Theft, Lying, and the like, tho' in their Manners they be as vicious as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, preſuming that they have the Holy Spirit, which they have not, living in an Eſteem of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and a Contempt of others, calling themſelves ſpiritual, while they remain carnal, deſpiſing all the Means of Piety and Devotion to adhere to their own Caprices; and they imagine they are illuminated by the Holy Spirit when they are mov'd only by their own diſorderly Paſſions, which do often precipitate them into fruitleſs Sufferings and Perſecutions, with the Scandal of their Neighbour: So that no body has Ground to believe that he ſhall be ſaved for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:104476:132"/>
of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Opinion, no more than the being of any other Sect or Religion, ſince all theſe Names do nothing to the Salvation of Souls: But to be ſav'd of Neceſſity, we muſt be renewed in the Life of God: And the Scripture ſays, <note n="h" place="bottom">1 James 15. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Obedience is better than Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſhews that it's better to be reſigned entirely to the Will of God to be ruled thereby, than to profeſs any Religion how good and holy ſoever we think it to be. Theſe material Bodies do not ſave the Soul, but the Love that it bears to its God will ſave it, and nothing elſe. In which Men deceive themſelves, when they lay the Streſs of their Salvation upon ſome means which they make uſe of to be ſaved. How good ſoever theſe outward things be, they give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Eſſence of the Soul, which is wholly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and ſpiritual, and cannot attain to Salvation, if it be not united to its God, who created it for this End; tho' the Blindneſs that Sin has brought upon Man's Spirit, does not often perſuade him that he ſhall be ſaved by other Means: as by going oft to Church, frequenting the Sacraments, hearing many Preachings or ſpiritual Books, or in being able to diſcourſe of theſe things, in giving to the Poor out of his Abundance, in making long Prayers and ſo many other Actions which they call pious; as if God to ſave us, had need of theſe things! Which is a great Deluſion: For it is only our Infirmity and Weakneſs that has need of theſe outward Things: For it is written, <note n="i" place="bottom">John 4. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>that the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth, and not in the Temple nor on the Mountain;</hi> That is
<pb facs="tcp:104476:132"/>
to ſay, not in material Temples, nor in Mountains of high Speculations; but the Spirit and the Heart muſt be truly poſſeſt with the Love of God, without which no body will be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Not that I would reject or deſpiſe all theſe pious Means or good outward Works (as theſe Reformed do blindly reject all ſorts of good Works as evil) ſince theſe good Works may ſerve as effectual Means to attain to this Love of God, ſeeing the covetous Man mortifies his Avarice by giving his Goods to the Poor; and he who cannot pray to God in his Houſe for the Diſtraction of his Affairs, does well to go to Church, that he may be the more recollected; Or he who feels more Compunction and Piety in his Soul, in frequenting the Sacraments; or has more inward and ſaving Light by going to Sermons or reading the Scripture or ſome other ſpiritual Book, he is oblig'd to uſe all the Means which lead him to the Love of God, without deſpiſing the leaſt Mean that may help his Weakneſs in raiſing him to the Love of God; ſince every one is oblig'd to ſeek the Means of his Perfections: I blame only the Abuſe that is made of theſe things, in taking them for the End of Salvation; whereas they are only Means to aſſiſt Humane Weakneſs, which forgets eaſily Eternal and inviſible things if ſhe be not often put in Remembrance of them by outward things: But I blame thoſe who are ſo ignorant as to believe that they ſhall be ſaved for being of ſome Religion, or for uſing the Sacraments, and doing ſome good Work, ſince theſe things do not ſanctifie us, being of themſelves dead Works which cannot give Life to our divine
<pb facs="tcp:104476:133"/>
Souls; and the Devil himſelf might do all theſe outward things tho' he ſhall never be ſav'd.</p>
               <p>I believe indeed ſome captious Spirits will take Occaſion to ſay that I am not truly Catholick in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Sacraments and other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; but I cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my ſelf from the Calumny of partial Perſons, who love their Darkneſs rather than the Light that I offer them from God, who has given me his Holy Spirit promis'd by Jeſus Chriſt which teaches me all Truth, ſince Jeſus Chriſt himſelf could not avoid the being calumniated, impriſon'd, perſecuted, and at laſt put to Death by means of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts, who ſaid they were in God's ſtead, and ſate in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes's</hi> Chair, as the Prieſts of all Religions ſay now: While in the mean time they outragiouſly perſecute the Truths which I learn immediately from God, without Study, without Meditation, Diſcourſe, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or any other Means, which would rather prove a Hindrance to me, than an Illuſtration of the Light of the Holy Spirit who endites to me all things neceſſary for the Salvation of Souls, and gives me alſo his Gift of Strength to bear joyfully thoſe Perſecutions and Outrages, which theſe more than Phariſaical Prieſts exerciſe againſt me: For they will not ſuffer that the Truth of God ſhould come to light by any but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, tho' they've rendred themſelves moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it, becauſe they will not apply themſelves to the Imitation of Jeſus Chriſt, nor to the Sanctification of their Souls; and if theſe be wanting, they ſhall never underſtand the inward Voice of God. 'Twould be a great Vertue in them, if at leaſt they would ſuffer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb facs="tcp:104476:133"/>
to underſtand it: But they can't attain to this Chriſtian Vertue of rejoycing in the Good of another. They cry out againſt me as the <hi>Jews</hi> cry'd out againſt Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>
                     <note n="l" place="bottom">John 18. 15.</note> Away with him, away with him, Crucifie him.</hi> And I believe if the Prieſts had me in their Power, they would gladly cut me off; and would have done it long 'ere now.</p>
               <p>But God ſav'd me from their Power that I might yet farther declare his Truths to good Souls who ſeek and deſire them, which in Obedience to God I'll do, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the Peril of my Life; ſince Jeſus Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his to teach me the Way of Salvation: And I entreat the Reader to peruſe with Attention this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part</hi> of the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> waiting till the <hi>Third</hi> follows. He ſhall therein find the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Holy Spirit, the Truth of God and the Light of Truth, which muſt teach all Truth: The Truth of the Impartiality of Chriſtian Charity, and of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and particularly the diſcerning of true Vertue from that which is but apparent, and the Errours crept into Holy Things more clearly than they've e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet been diſcover'd in the World.

                  <p>How the Opinions of the Learned are injurious to God, they being ignorant of his Works. Of God's Preſence, and of his Grace. Of the Liberty, Power, and Weakneſs of Man; and of the State of Infants before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of their Reaſon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Said to her, <hi>That never any Body had known ſo much of the Works of God, and that many Diſputes and Queſtions had been raiſed in the Church to diſcover ſuch Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</hi>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104476:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and partial: ſome attribute to him the Cauſe of Mens Damnation; others the Want of their Salvation: every one judges of the Works of God according to his Fancy, Liking, and Inclinations. The Learned do greatly deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, while they will needs comprehend by humane Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his Divine Works. If any ſimple Woman of a humble Heart, would ſeriouſly conſider the Works that God does in her Interiour, ſhe might give a better Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of all his Secrets, than all the Doctors of the World wou'd ever do with their Learning. They amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in contending about Words, or ſome Terms that they lay down upon which to found their Diſputes; and thereon they raiſe great Buildings without any ſolid Foundation: and the more they will dive into the Matter, the more they trouble it; becauſe God <note n="a" place="bottom">Matth. 11. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>hides</hi> his Secrets from the great and the <hi>wiſe</hi> of the World, and <hi>reveals</hi> them to Babes and to the ſimple; for he ſays, <note n="b" place="bottom">Matth. 18. 3. and 20. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Except you be converted, and become as little Children, you ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> making appear ſufficiently, that it will not be by Philoſophical Reaſons or Diſputes that we ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Truth of his Works, but by a dove-like Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That many believed that Man has his full Liberty to do evil, but that he is not ſo free to do well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Theſe are all Errours; for Man has even more Advantage and Inclination to do good than evil, if he did not <note n="c" place="bottom">Prov. 4. 23.</note> go <hi>out</hi> of himſelf, by diverting himſelf to hear the Diſcourſes of Mens Inventions; for God having cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him for Salvation, did conſequently imprint in him the Inſtinct of doing good, and the Will alſo; becauſe good is always agreeable and lovely. Evil then muſt needs be contracted from without us: for God being the Centre of our Soul, cannot but lead it unto Good; and if it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its ſelf, its Bent and Inclination, it could not do Evil: becauſe Evil is <note n="d" place="bottom">Gen. 4. 7.</note> without us, we being led to it either by the Devil, or ſome other Creatures without us, who ſtir our Paſſions, and the Powers of our Soul, to pervert them to the Will of doing evil: otherwiſe 'tis far more eaſie for us to do good than evil. And as the Ray cannot be ſeparated from the Sun, ſo the Soul cannot be ſeparated <note n="e" place="bottom">Pſal. 13. 3, 5, 7.</note> from God,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104476:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Fountain of all Good; becauſe it has the ſame Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him that the Ray has to the Sun. If our free Will did not put a ſtop to the Rayes of Grace, they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten our Soul continually, and could not ceaſe from il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminating and warming it: But <note n="f" place="bottom">Iſa. 59. 2.</note> Sins and vicious Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions do ſtifle and oppoſe this Light; which, being hindred, cannot any longer ſhine into our Souls; and then, during this Darkneſs they fall from one Precipice into another. The Fault is not that this divine Sun ceaſes to ſhine for one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that our Sins put a ſtop to it; which, if they were removed, this Divine Sun would as ſuddenly ſhed forth his Rays. We muſt not labour, as we think we ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Grace of God; but we muſt only labour to remove <note n="g" place="bottom">Iſa. 1. 16. 17, 18.</note> the Hindrances which we give to it; becauſe Grace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways offers it ſelf, being inſeparably fix'd in God, who is the ter of our Soul. He cannot leave it: But our Sins hindring him, keep us from enjoying the Effects of this Grace.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That Man indeed received Benefits from God in his Creation, and his Graces did abound in him: But ſince he fell into Sin, he has loſt theſe Graces, and is become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, you wrong the Goodneſs of God to ſpeak or believe ſo: For God has not <note n="h" place="bottom">

This being ſo, he does not deny his Graces to any Body: For they are where-ever he is; and being in the Center of our Souls, his Graces conſequently are there with him; but it is our Fault only that they do not there perform Operations. It is true, if our firſt Parents had not ſinned, we had been born in the ſtate of Innoceence, and in coming into the World, had not brought with us a Hindrance to Grace, which we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by our firſt Parents; but by accompliſhing the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that God enjoyn'd them for the ſaid Sins, we enter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into the ſame Grace of our firſt Parents; ſince God treats with us as if we had never offended him, their Sins not being able <note n="i" place="bottom">Mal. 3. 6.</note> to change the Grace of God, but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject us indeed to Penitence till we arrive at the Uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and then, being tranſplanted out of the free Will
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104476:136"/>
of our Parents we enter into our own. If from that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, our Will deſires to reunite it ſelf to that of God, we ſhall receive the Effects of his Grace; but the Miſchief is we ſtray to ſee and hear the other vicious Creatures, and commit the Sins that we ſee in others with the Conſent of our own Will; which withdrawing it ſelf from God, puts Obſtacles and Hindrances to his Divine Grace, by which it is impoſſible that we ſhould feel the Effects of it; not that we are ever rendered unable to do good for want of the Grace of God, which <note n="k" place="bottom">Iſ. 30. 19. 2 Pet. 3. 1.</note> always waits that we may make uſe of it; but it is becauſe of the ſmall Endeavours that we uſe on our Part to remove that which hinders this Grace that freely offers it ſelf to us; ſo that we cannot ſay truly that we are rendred unable to do good, ſince the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which cannot extend it ſelf farther over us than till we are arriv'd at the Uſe of Reaſon: Then we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the liberty of doing Good and Evil, tho' all Good comes from God; he never denies his <note n="l" place="bottom">Matth. 7. 7, 11.</note> Graces to him who ſeeks and deſires them. For he <note n="m" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 11. 14, 25.</note> loves us always as the Work of his own Hand, even tho' we be wicked; and if we feel ſome inability to Good, this can never be but thro' the Oppoſition that we will needs make to the Grace of God, who deſires to give it us <note n="n" place="bottom">Luk. 15. 20, 22, 23.</note> more than we deſire to have it. This is but to flatter our ſelves, to ſay that the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> has rendred us unable to do good: For 'tis nothing but our perverſe Habits, and <note n="o" place="bottom">Deut. 30. 11. Mat. 23. 37.</note> our Self-will that can give us this Inability: We aſcribe it alſo ſometimes to the Devil thro' the ſame Spirit of Flattery; for the Devil cannot hurt us in any thing without our own Conſent: He can only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent evil things to us, our Will being free to follow or reject them; as alſo our natural Inclination cannot commit Evil without the Conſent of our free Will. Sir, Slanders and Blaſphemies ought no longer to be uttered againſt God; for he is All-good, All-just and All-true, and can never do any thing that is evil, or unjuſt, or againſt Truth.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>If Man, after having ſin'd of his own free Will, could indeed recover again, and return of himſelf to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, it ſeems you would uſe the School Terms, which have occaſion'd ſo many unprofitable Diſputes: For, to ſay that Man could recover again of himſelf, would be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104476:136"/>
the deſiring to ſhew that he had no need of God's Grace, and that his Converſion depended only upon his own Will. This would be an Atheiſm, not to acknowledge that all Grace comes from God: For there is no Good but what comes from him, as being the only Source of all Good: If therefore Man forſakes his Sin, and returns to God, this can only be thro' his Grace: but this Grace is always given and never denied to thoſe who ſeek and deſire it; and even God prevents us before we ask it <note n="p" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20,—33.</note>. Sir, let us leave theſe Terms of Schoolmen and uſe our own Experience: We know well enough how many Graces God has given us, even while we have offended him, and withdrawn from him; how many times has he call'd us back by Remorſe of Conſcience, by inward Light, by Adverſities, by inward Reproofs, and ſo many other Means which God has made uſe of to draw us to himſelf after that we have forſaken him by our Sins? are not all theſe preventing Graces? If the greateſt Sinner in the World would tell the Truth of what he has experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd in himſelf, he would tell to his Confuſion, that God has never been wanting to give him his Grace, but he has ſtrongly reſiſted it: Every one may make this Trial on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; Why ſhould we amuſe our ſelves with ſcholaſtick Terms which are nothing but forg'd Words? We muſt come to the Eſſence of the Thing; that is, that God gives always his Grace to Man <note n="q" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 23,—32.</note> how wicked ſoever he be; and when this Grace is not operative, it is ſtill thro' the Hindrances which the free Will of Man gives it: For God does not give his Graces imperfectly, but they have leſs or more of Efficacy, according as Man contributes thereto, by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or Co-operation.</p>
               <p>I might anſwer to your Queſtion, <hi>if Man can of himſelf ariſe again from Sin,</hi> by ſaying <hi>yes</hi> and <hi>no:</hi> For he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf without the Grace of God; but he will obtain it always, even to his laſt Gaſp, <note n="r" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 42, 43.</note> if he will by his free Will co-operate therewith. That ſo many Sinners cannot get rid of their Sins, the Fault is not, that the Grace of God is not effectually given them, but only that they cleave ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their Sins, that their Will has not effectual Deſires to forſake them. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was one of this kind of Sinners; for the Habit of Sin made him believe that it was impoſſible for him to forſake them: But no ſooner was his Will effectual
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104476:137"/>
than he abundantly experienc'd the help of God's Grace, which attended him.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>what ſhe meant by ſaying, that having the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Reaſon, we paſs out of the free Will of our Parents, and enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our own?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, I mean that our Parents hold our Will uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to theirs, as long as our Underſtanding is not capable of making full uſe of its Reaſon; in that time they may give us to God or to the Devil by their free Will; becauſe nothing can continue void neither in Grace nor in Nature; it muſt needs ſtill ſubſiſt in ſomething: Now free Will cannot ſubſiſt in an Infant, for it is not yet capable of it; neither can it 1ubſiſt in God, ſince he has given it to Man in creating him: He cannot retake what he has once given; for a thing given, is no more his who gives it: Of Neceſſity therefore, this free Will muſt continue united to that of our Parents, till we have arriv'd at the Uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and are capable of being able to uſe it our ſelves, as the free Will of all Men remained in that of our firſt Father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and this by an equitable Juſtice, becauſe God gave to all Men free Will in the Creation of the firſt: ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> was free to ſave or damn all Men, who died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Uſe of Reaſon; but having lived till they attain to the Uſe of it, every Man enters into the ſame Liberty of ſaving or damning himſelf into which <hi>Adam</hi> was created; For God has created all Men in <hi>Adam,</hi> and has not ſince taken from or added any thing to them, becauſe he maintains e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally <note n="s" place="bottom">Eccl. 3. 14.</note> what he has once done, never changing it: All his Creatures will be upheld in their kinds to all Eternity, and none of the Works of God ſhall be altered from the State in which he has plac'd and order'd them; ſo that we are born and abide in the Will of our Parents as we were, and abode in the Will of our firſt Father <hi>Adam;</hi> but as ſoon as we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Uſe of Reaſon, we are put in Poſſeſſion of our own free Will.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>If it be ſo, that our free Will remains in the Power of our Parents, till we have attained to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where can the free Will of Children remain who loſe Father and Mother in their Infancy, or as ſoon as they are born?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She replied;</hi> Thoſe, Sir, abide in the Will which their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had in their Conception and Production, or as they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104476:137"/>
leave them when they die. In whatſoever Will they leave their Children when they die, theſe abide in it till they have attained the Uſe of Reaſon; for then they are always put in poſſeſſion of their own Will, whether they have been till then, given to God or to the Devil; they can nevertheleſs chooſe the one and leave the other: But the Child who has been given by his Parents to the Devil, ſhall have much more Difficulty of returning to God, than he who by his Parents has been given to God, becauſe of the Bent to Evil which he has already contracted: He muſt do a far greater Violence to his Nature, than he that has been habituated to Good from his Infancy, becauſe Cuſtom is another Nature; ſo that it is very hard for a Child train'd up in Evil, even till the Uſe of Reaſon, to forſake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or change it afterwards: Therefore he who is born of good Parents, fearing God, has great Advantages beyond him who is born of <hi>Mahometans, Jews</hi> or evil <hi>Catholicks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> who muſt uſe great Efforts before he overcomes the Evils acquired during his Weakneſs and Childhood. Nevertheleſs, God will never be wanting to give him Grace to do this, if he hath an effectual Deſire and Will for it; for he created Man for no other end but to ſerve him, and he can deny him nothing that is neceſſary for his Salvation: On the contrary, he affords him on his Part all Occaſions and Means of Salvation, even tho' he be born of evil Parents or Sorcerers. They have no more Power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Children after they are come to the Uſe of their own Reaſon, <note n="t" place="bottom">Ezec. 18. 14, 17.</note> if ſo be they will apply it to know and love God: For they are put in ſuch a State as if they were begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be born, except as to the evil or good Habits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in their Childhood.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That we ſee two Children ſometimes begotten of the ſame Father and Mother, and yet the one enclined to Good and the other to Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> This may very well be, Sir, becauſe Fathers and Mothers are not always in the State of Grace; ſometimes they fall from it, and afterwards they recover it: The ſame befalls their Children, as long as they have the free Will of theſe Infants in their Power, it is ſtill united to theirs; and while the Father and Mother live, they may put the Souls of their Children being yet in Childhood in Favour or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace with God: Therefore one may be enclined to Good
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104476:138"/>
and another to Evil, according to the divers Diſpoſitions and Deſires of the Parents, who at one time give one of their Children to God, and at another time give another to the Devil. They may indeed give their Bleſſing to one of theſe Children of the ſame Womb, and their Malediction to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="u" place="bottom">Eccleſ. 3. 8.</note>, which will operate in their Children ſo long as they are not yet arriv'd at the Uſe of Reaſon; becauſe their free Will is united to that of their Fathers and Mothers. From this Ground has proceeded the uſe of giving a Bleſſing, which Uſe has paſt beyond Father and Mother to the Prieſts, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpiritual Fathers of Chriſtians, tho' they have not the ſame Power that the natural Fathers have; for they have not co-operated to the Formation of their Body, nor yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often to the Inſtruction of their Souls, which Fathers and Mothers ought to do under Pain of their own Damnation. We have ſeen Examples enough of the Power which Parents have over their Children; for many have received the Devil in their Body by ſome evil Wiſh of their Fathers. <note n="x" place="bottom">Gen. 27. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> proſpered and was bleſs'd by the bleſſing of his Father, tho' he was not his eldeſt Son. Many Curſes have befallen <note n="y" place="bottom">Exod. 20. 5.</note> ſome Children for the Sins of their Fathers; and this is juſt; becauſe the free Will of the Child remains always depending on that of the Father, till he hath received full Judgment to be able to uſe it himſelf: Therefore the People cried at the Condemnation of Jeſus Chriſt, <note n="z" place="bottom">Mat. 27. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That it fell out often that good Fathers and Mothers had evil Children; and on the contrary, thoſe who were very evil, have had very good Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> This falls out, Sir, when the Children of good Parents have attain'd to the Uſe of Reaſon, being put in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their own free Will they forſake the good Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their Parents, and contract evil Habits by bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, or by other Means, which turn them away from their Parents Benediction to follow their own perverſe Will, over which the Father has no more Power, ſince they are emancipated from the Power of their Fathers Will. In like manner, when the Child of an evil Father becomes good and lives well, this is ſtill after he has acquired the Uſe of Reaſon, and that then opening the Eyes of his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104476:138"/>
to conſider his evil Life, he returns to do good by his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and his free Will, in which the Converſation of good Men does greatly help him: But as long as he continu'd in the Power of his Fathers free Will, he muſt of neceſſity be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or ſaved according to the Diſpoſition of his ſaid Father; and this by an equitable Juſtice, becauſe of the great Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy there is between the Father and the Child, as being Fleſh of his Fleſh, and Bone of his Bones: And as the Child who is in its Mothers Belly, receives no other Nouriſhment but that of the Mother, who may by her Food, give Life or Death to her Infant, which is in her Power ſo long as ſhe bears it in her Womb; even ſo is it of the Soul by the great Sympathy there is between the free Will of the Father, and that of his Child; Tho' they be two Souls, they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs dependant upon that which has its full Reaſon; as the Body of the Infant and of the Mother do both of them depend upon the Food which the Mother takes; becauſe ſhe alone is capable of receiving it to make it paſs to her Infant: ſo that theſe two Bodies are reputed but one till the Infant be brought to Light, and become capable of receiving its own Food: Then the Mother is no longer capable of cauſing Life or Death to it, except with what the Child may take of it ſelf. God acts ordinarily as to our Soul, the ſame way that he does as to our Body, at leaſt by Similitude.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That ſhe gave me very profound Thoughts; that never any Body had ſearched ſo far into this Matter; but that all they whoſe Spirits were perplexed about the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why God damn'd one Infant and ſaved another, did ſtill referr to the Power of God, and to his admirable ſecrets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, God will never damn any Body; <note n="a" place="bottom">Wiſdom 11. 24.</note> for being the ſource of all Good, He cannot do any Evil; and the Damnation of a Soul is the greateſt Evil of the World. The loſs of all the Wealth, and all the Bodies of Men, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether is nothing in compariſon of the Loſs of the Soul of the meaneſt Infant. How durſt you believe that God would do ſo great an Evil as to damn it? I have already told you, Sir, that People do nothing but blaſpheme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God on all Occaſions, and this for want of not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ſufficiently his Works which are comprehenſible to our Senſes. If our Underſtanding did apply it ſelf
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104476:139"/>
ſeriouſly to conſider them, they are all ſo clear, ſo juſt and good, that no body can with Reaſon form a Doubt about them. God has created all Men unto Salvation, and none to Damnation, having given to every one Grace ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for his Salvation. If ſome are damned, it is their own Fault, and always with their own free Will. God has Power to ſave One and damn Another, but he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do it, becauſe his Almighty Power will never depart from his Righteouſneſs and his Goodneſs. We make God, as it were the Complice of our Paſſions, when we ſay, he ſaves one Child and damns another, whom he could not have created but to ſave them, without doing an Evil, and an unjuſt Thing; which the Child might reproach him with who ſhould find it ſelf damn'd before it was capable of committing any Sin. It might ſay with Reaſon, Wherefore haſt thou created me to damn me? It had been better for me to have continued in the Nothing from whence thou haſt taken me, than to have damned me after my Creation. Thoſe who referr to the Almighty Power of God, in the Damnation of an Infant, do tacitely condemn him of Injuſtice; for God ſhould uſe his Almighty Power Unjuſtly: which he cannot do. There cannot be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Secrets in that which is not: Nothing is to be admir'd there.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That at leaſt God did permit a Child to be born of an Heathen Parent, or of an evil Chriſtian, or to die before the receiving of Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> God permits this as he permits all other things. On God's Part the Heathen were born to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as good Chriſtians; if they are become Evil or Heatheniſh, it is their own Fault, becauſe he has created all Men in creating of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was certainly choſen by God to Salvation, with all his Poſterity. And having given to him, as to all others, a Liberty and Free-will, he muſt needs permit every one to uſe it according to his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for otherwiſe he would not be juſt to hinder every one from enjoying this Gift of his Free-Will. 'Tis thus that all Evils are committed in the World: Not <note n="b" place="bottom">Eccleſ. 15. 20.</note> that God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Evil, but he only permits Men to make uſe of their Free-Will. This is a moſt good thing that God does not withdraw from Man that firſt Liberty which he gave him as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104476:139"/>
the greateſt Treaſure which he could ever receive; and if he abuſe it, 'tis for himſelf: For after that God has made all things beautiful and good, he does not change them any more, but lets ſecond Cauſes act: If they be well applied, he permits not a bad Uſe to be made of them; but he cannot hinder it when Man does it of his Free-Will. For Example, God has given to Man the Induſtry to make Knives for the neceſſary Uſes of his Entertainment: This is a good and very convenient thing; but if with the ſame Knife he comes to kill his Brother, can it be ſaid that God has permitted him? no ways, for if he had ask'd permiſſion of God, he would have forbidden him. Even ſo is it as to the Children which are born of Heathen Parents, or Evil Chriſtians, or other Enemies of God. This is not his Permiſſion, but the Wickedneſs of thoſe who are become Enemies of God through their pure Malice, and if they beget Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren God will not hinder them, becauſe he has ordain'd this natural Production, which he will never change, for it is very Good in it ſelf, as are all the Works which he has made. Man does all Evil only by the Conſent of his evil Will, and not at all by the Permiſſion or Conſent of God, who cannot but do all Good, without ever permitting Evil, except indirectly, in permitting Man to uſe his Free-Will.</p>

               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That Infants who die without Baptiſm, and are come of good Chriſtians, are damn'd without their own Conſent, or that of their Parents, who dedicate them to God; together with their own Souls; and ſo they cannot have co-operated to the Damnation of their Children.</hi>

                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, here are many things to be conſidered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Parents are often guilty of the Death of their Children through Negligence or Intemperance, and a thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accidents which fall out as to this Matter.

who are not aware of it: But as for Infants who die before Baptiſm without the Fault or Co-operation of their Parents, theſe are certainly ſaved by the Will and Deſire of the Free-Will of their Parents; for God can damn none but thoſe who die in ſin, either actual or original. Now the Children who die before the Uſe of Reaſon, cannot have committed actual Sins, for they are not yet capable of them; and if their Parents are true Chriſtians, they have certainly ſatisfied the Penitence due for the <hi>Sin of Adam.</hi> If their Children partake of their Sins till they have attain'd the Uſe of Reaſon, by the ſame Conſequence, they partake of their Merit and their good Works, becauſe they are ſtill reputed the ſame thing <note n="a" place="bottom">

               <p>I ask'd her; <hi>If ſhe believed that Infants begotten of truly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick-Parents who had offered them to God, dying without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, could be ſaved; and that they who died after Baptiſm, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been begotten of wicked Parents, who of their Free-Will had given them to the Devil, were damned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Yes, Sir, the firſt are ſaved by the Free-Will of their Parents, and the ſecond <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſ. 58. 4.</note> are damned by the Will of theirs; becauſe both of them, the Good and the Bad, had the Free-Will of their Children joyn'd to their own, and might ſave and damn the Soul of their Children, as they might ſave and damn their own Soul; becauſe they were inſeparably joyn'd and united together for Good and for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: So that Baptiſm cannot ſave the Soul of a Child who is without the Grace of God thro' the Free-Will of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and the want of this Baptiſm, cannot hinder the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of an Infant, who is in the Grace of God thro' the Free-Will of his Parents, tho' he ſhould die without being baptized: For if this outward Baptiſm be ſo neceſſary to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104476:140"/>
Salvation, the Primitive Chriſtians, and they who followed them, would have baptized young Infants; and likewiſe all thoſe immediately who came in to be Chriſtians: On the contrary, they kept many in the State of <hi>Catehcumens</hi> for a long Space of Time, during which, they might die, as 'tis to be believed many did. Thoſe who had the Will to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Jeſus Chriſt perfectly, ſhould they have been damned for not having receiv'd the outward Sign of Baptiſm? No, no, Sir; It does not go ſo before God, as Men make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: For a real Deſire only to be a Chriſtian, is capable to ſave us, even tho' we ſhould die without Baptiſm, becauſe God <note n="b" place="bottom">Jer. 17. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>ſearches the Heart and trys the Reins,</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="bottom">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> having more Regard to the Baptiſm of Deſire than to that of Water, which is given only to confirm the Will of the Heart of Man; and if we ſhould be ſurprized with Death e're we have made this outward Confirmation, we ſhould not for this, ceaſe to enjoy Eternal Life, and to reign with God in his Glory.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That many Fathers had written of the Neceſſity of being baptized, and that it was taught thro' all the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, that Baptiſm gives Salvation to all thoſe who receive it, that it even cleanſes from all actual Sins, if we have been defiled with them before Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> I know not what the Fathers ſay, nor what is taught by all the <hi>Romaniſts;</hi> but I declare to you what God makes me know and underſtand in the Inward of my Soul. I do not think that all they who are baptiz'd, ſhall be ſav'd; for Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid that <note n="d" place="bottom">Mark 16. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>they who believe and are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Now Infants newly born are not capable of believing; and if their Parents be wicked, they likwiſe have not Faith to believe in the Name of their Children; how therefore can Baptiſm work Faith, ſince Jeſus Chriſt places it before Baptiſm? Faith <note n="d" place="bottom">Mark 16. 16.</note> muſt be the chief Piece for working Salvation; which being wanting, Baptiſm can do nothing: How would you therefore have wicked Children to be ſaved by Baptiſm? For Example: A Sorcereſs being with Child, gives her Soul to the Devil, and alſo that of the Child which ſhe bears, and as ſoon as it comes into the World, it is carried to Baptiſm, and thereafter dies; By what do you think that this Child ſhould be ſaved? If it be not capable of having Faith, and if its Parents have denied<note place="bottom">(<hi>e</hi>) <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</note>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:104476:141"/>
God, ſhould the Water of Baptiſm alone have more Force than the Free-Will of its Parents, who would give it to the Devil with the Conſent of their Will? Can God reſiſt their Will, after having given them the Power of enjoying this Free-Will, both in regard of their own Salvation, and that of their Children? We ſee that by an exact Juſtice, Subjects bear the Puniſhment of the Sins of their Kings, <note n="e" place="bottom">2 <hi>Sam</hi> 18. 19. <hi>and</hi> 20 <hi>Chap and</hi> 24.</note> as <hi>David</hi>'s People were chaſtized for the Adultery and Murther which their King had committed; How ſhould not Children bear it with much more Reaſon for the Sins of their Parents <note n="f" place="bottom">Exod. 20. 5. Pſ. 58. 4.</note> who have much more of Union and Dependance than the King with his Subjects, who has nothing over them but a voluntary Submiſſion which they yield to him?</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That no Chriſtians doubted but that a Man muſt be baptized to be ſaved, and that none could enter into Paradiſe without having received Baptiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which She replied;</hi> Sir, if this were true, it would be a great Unhappineſs to many good Men who are dead long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go; becauſe many were not baptized aright, thro' the Fault of the Prieſt, who, may be, did not pronounce the Words of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, thro' Neglect, or his Mind being carried otherwiſe, or he had not the Intent to baptize, or, which is worſe, if the Prieſt, who baptized was a Sorcerer, as it falls out but too often, and inſtead of baptizing Children in the Name of God, he ſhould give them to the Devil; all theſe Perſons ill bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, muſt according to your Saying be damned, even tho' they ſhould have lived holily, in caſe this Baptiſm were ſo neceſſary to Salvation. God would be cruel thus to damn Perſons for the Fault of ſome wicked Prieſts, who had no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation neither to their Souls nor their Bodies: Nevertheleſs it ſhould be in his Power to ſave or damn all thoſe whom he ſhould baptize. Truly, Sir, theſe Sentiments which they have of God, are inſupportable to me, becauſe they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his Juſtice and Truth: They muſt be ignorant of him, to believe that he would yield up the Salvation of his People to the Diſpoſal of ſome wicked Man, who adhering to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, might give him all the Souls of thoſe whom he ſhould baptize. If he left us the Free-Will <note n="g" place="bottom">Eccleſ. 15. 14,-17.</note> to ſave or damn our ſelves, and that he himſelf would not reſerve this Power over us but ſtill leave our Free-Will <note n="h" place="bottom">Pſ. 110. 3.</note> to act, without forcing us
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104476:141"/>
to Salvation, nor yet hindring our Damnation, when ſuch is our Will, how ſhould he give to a Man the Power of being able to damn us by an evil Baptiſm? There can be no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Truth in this; and if it be difficult for you to believe that Parents have the Free-Will of their Children in their Power, how is it not much more uneaſie to you to believe that a Prieſt ſhould have the Power to damn ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons thro' his Fault of not having the Intention to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them aright? For Parents have contributed to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Body, and the Soul of their Children; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this Prieſt has never known them: And what Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to the young Man in the Goſpel <note n="i" place="bottom">Matth. 19. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>that to be ſaved, he muſt keep the Commandments,</hi> would not be true in caſe Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm were ſo neceſſary, ſeeing he who ſhould keep them without being baptized, could not be ſaved, ſince Salvation depends on Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I was ſo convinc'd by ſuch powerful Reaſonings, that I knew not what to reply: Nevertheleſs,</hi> I yet ſaid to her, <hi>that Faith was neceſſary to Salvation with Baptiſm; but that it is ſuppoſed the Faith of the Parents ſupplies that of the Children; and that the Godfather and Godmother are likewiſe taken to confirm it in Name of the Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, it is an ill-contriv'd thing to baptize Children before the Uſe of Reaſon: For they cannot have Faith, and their Parents or Godfathers and Godmothers are alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times void of it: They content themſelves with doing the outward Ceremonies without conſidering what is done. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is an outward Sign to ſhew that he who is baptized, gives up and conſecrates himſelf to the Service of God, and will live in the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, renouncing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the World, and its Pomps. This is what he ought to do in the inward of his Soul who deſires to be baptized, and then to come publickly to the Font of Baptiſm to confirm the Vows and Promiſes that he has made to God in his Heart, that they may be publickly known and own'd by the Church: But in the Baptiſm of new born Infants, nothing of this can concurr; For the Infant being weak, has not yet the Will to give it ſelf to the Service of God, or to follow the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, nor yet to renounce the Devil, and the World, and its Pomps: For it has no Senſe nor Underſtanding more than a ſilly Beaſt; and the moſt Part of Parents, who
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104476:142"/>
ought to ſupply the Defect of the Infant, have not Faith themſelves, and cannot teach them to follow the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, ſince they themſelves will not do it. On the contrary, ſo ſoon as their Children begin to have any little Judgment, they teach them to follow the World and its Pomps, which is very far from minding them, that they have renounced it by Baptiſm: What Effect therefore can this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sign have, when nothing is effectuated in the Heart of him who receives it, neither by himſelf nor by his Parents? And when Godfathers and Godmothers ſpeak in the Name of the Infant, they lye: For they ſay that he deſires to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and the Infant cannot have this Deſire. They ſay, that he renounces the Devil, the World and its Pomps, and as ſoon as theſe outward Ceremonies are ended, they never think more on what they have promiſed in the Child's Name; far leſs do they acquaint him with it when he is grown up, to the end the Child may remember the Promiſe which he made at Baptiſm: For in doing this, they would give a Reproof to themſelves; becauſe neither Father, nor Mother, nor Godfather, nor Godmother, nor any Body at preſent, obſerves the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, tho' all Chriſtians are outwardly baptiz'd. They would count him a Fool or a very Preciſian who ſhould affirm that we are oblig'd to keep and obſerve the Evangelical Life, becauſe it is not any longer in uſe: They would even be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to renounce the World and its Pomps, becauſe the moſt wiſe and the moſt holy follow the World and its Pomps. The Wiſe ſay that one muſt live civilly, <hi>and maintain himſelf in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi> and the Saints at preſent ſay, <hi>that a Man muſt accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date himſelf to the World, that we cannot make a World by our ſelves.</hi> We ſee the moſt Reformed, Monks ſtudy to pleaſe the World, deſiring to be lov'd and honour'd by it, and would be very ſorry to be hated by the World, as Jeſus Chriſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told his Servants <note n="k" place="bottom">Joh. 15. 18, 19.</note> ſhould be. On the contrary, every one ſeeks to draw the World to himſelf, and to have its Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to the end, that having gain'd the Heart, he may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gain the Purſe. Are not theſe fine Chriſtians in Parade and not in Effect! For they have no ſooner renounc'd in Baptiſm the World and its Pomps, than they think of nothing but to follow and to love it; as if their Promiſe were nothing but a Formality of Words; They do with God, as they would do with a Fool, promiſing him a great many things to pleaſe him,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104476:142"/>
without having any Deſire to give him them. Baptiſm ought not to be received, but by him who reſolves in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to conſecrate himſelf to God, and to follow the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, which he ought to know before he be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and reſolve of his own Free-Will that he will follow it, quitting the Maxims of Men, which are all contrary to thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt. <note n="l" place="bottom">Acts 2, 41, 8, 37.</note> The Chriſtians of old did ſo: No body was made Chriſtian but they who of their deliberate Will would conſecrate themſelves to God, and follow the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt; but at preſent, they force every one to be baptized before they have the Uſe of Reaſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing what they do, or what they promiſe.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That the Cuſtom of baptizing Children in their Infancy, was Inſtituted on good Grounds, to the end no Chriſtians might die before they were baptized, that all thoſe who died in their Childhood, might aſſuredly be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, I believe rather that the Devil invented this to the end no Chriſtian might be ſaved; as it falls out that very few ſhall be ſaved of thoſe who are baptized in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy; becauſe, when they are outwardly baptized, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are ſufficiently aſſured of their Salvation, <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. 2. 28, 29</note> which is the greateſt Miſtake in the World: For Baptiſm operates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our Souls, no more than the other Sacraments; but according to their Diſpoſition. How can a Child without Judgment have the Diſpoſitions requiſite for receiving Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? If their Baptiſm were delayed till they had their full Reaſon, we would certainly yet find true Chriſtians; for they who had no Mind to follow Jeſus Chriſt, would not be baptized, unleſs it were out of Hypocriſie: But at preſent every body thinks himſelf a good Chriſtian, if ſo be he have been out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly baptized, without conſidering that this Sign gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our Souls <note n="m" place="bottom">Pet. 3. 21.</note> if we have not ſuitable Diſpoſitions. If they were not baptized in their Infancy, all thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſaved, would ſtudy to know what is neceſſary for becoming true Chriſtians, and would have no Reſt till they had obtained this Happineſs; but at preſent, every one reſts ſatisfied with this outward Baptiſm, not conſidering that to be Chriſtians <note n="n" place="bottom">Luk. 14. 26, 27, 33.</note> they muſt follow the Inſtructions of Jeſus Chriſt; without which, it had been better they had never been baptized. It is juſt the ſame as if a Servant ſhould go hire out himſelf to ſerve ſome Prince or Lord, and as ſoon as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104476:143"/>
he had got on his Livery, ſhould quit his Maſter to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Robbery, ſetting himſelf to ſteal and rob in the ſame Habit, which would ſerve him the better to catch his Prey: For the Merchant who ſhould ſee him clothed with ſome Prince's or Lord's Livery, would not be aware that he were a Robber, till he ſaw the Effects, of it: But if this Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were ſome Day ſeiz'd by Juſtice he would be more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſh'd for having committed his Thefts and Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in ſome Prince's Livery, than if it had been in his own Habit. Even ſo it is when a Perſon is baptized, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately abandons himſelf to the Vanities of the World; he deceives God and the World, and renders himſelf ſubject to greater Chaſtiſements than if he were not baptized; becauſe this outward Sign which ſhould ſerve him to obtain Grace, ſerves for his greater Condemnation, as the Liverty ſerves the Robber. We ſee the Devil has found out this Invention to baptize young Children, knowing well that no body when he came to Age would remember what he had done ſo ſoon as he was born, and that he would eaſily baniſh out of Mens Minds the Promiſes which they made in Baptiſm. He has alſo invented the not reiterating of Baptiſm, fearing leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure ſome coming to be converted, ſhould come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to receive Baptiſm in a due manner and with requiſite Diſpoſitions. All theſe Devices have been covered with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pretext, <hi>That no Chriſtian ſhould die without having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Baptiſm.</hi> This every one has aſſerted under this Appearance of Piety, which nevertheleſs is founded but upon a falſe Suppoſition of this expreſs Neceſſity of Baptiſm for Salvation; which cannot be true, ſeeing ſo many true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans died in the Days of Jeſus Chriſt and the Apoſtles in their Non-age, or while they were yet but <hi>Catechumens,</hi> or at the Inſtant of their Converſion. Should not all theſe Perſons be ſaved after they have been in Heart and Affection conſecrated unto God? as alſo thoſe who ſhould yet at preſent live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Law in a Country where Baptiſm is not uſed. I would fain know, Sir, if you read any where that the Apoſtles themſelves were baptized; and if you could doubt of their Salvation, tho' they had not been?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the Devil has crept into the Church as Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and is there maintain'd and authoriz'd.</p>
               </argument>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, do you not remember that I have already told you, that the Devil ſlip'd into the Church from the time that Jeſus Chriſt would eſtabliſh it? He had then almoſt all the World at his Devotion, and he needed not great Labour to maintain the World in its Wickedneſs; for it was as it were become natural to it: But how ſoon he ſaw that Jeſus Chriſt came to enlighten the World, and to make known their Sins to them, that he might bring them back to Repentance; The Devil then <note n="a" place="bottom">Eph. 6. 11. 12.</note> unites all his Force and Power to oppoſe himſelf to this Light, and every way to countermine the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. From that time he got the Name of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> becauſe he ſets himſelf againſt Chriſt; he has ever ſince continu'd in the Church, that he might deſtroy and ruine it if he could; and from time to time he has gain'd <note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 29, 30. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 14, 15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 3.</note> ſome who have followed his Suggeſtions and his Malice, whoſe Number has always encreas'd, and he has maintain'd them in Honour and Dignity, making them by his Artifices to ariſe to the higheſt Degrees of Honour; becauſe then his Adherents did render him the more Service. I doubt not but he has made many come to the Office of a Biſhop or other Prelacies, who being conſulted or conven'd together about the Determining of Points relating to our Chriſtianity, may have given Sentiments in favour of the Devil, and prejudicial to the Salvation of Chriſtians. If this were not, Sir, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhould have made Decrees ſo contrary to thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt, who never required a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of any body, but in Love <note n="c" place="bottom">2 Cor. 8. 8, 12.</note>: For he ſays <note n="d" place="bottom">Mat. 19. 21.</note>

                  <hi>me, let him deny himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. requiring always our <hi>WILL</hi> in all the Vertues that he teaches us; and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Beginning of the World unto this preſent time, gives us no Command but <hi>to love him:</hi> For all things are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Means to attain to this <hi>Love,</hi> even leaving Men free to obſerve his <note n="f" place="bottom">Pſ. 110. 3.</note> Commands according to their Free-Will <note n="g" place="bottom">Deut. 30. 19. Eccl. 15. 15.</note> without Conſtraint; but thoſe of the Councils, do oblige Perſons by force to obſerve their Decrees: So that they who tranſgreſs them, are impriſoned and puniſhed. This is very far from imitating Jeſus Chriſt in his Meekneſs; which, he ſays, we ought <note n="h" place="bottom">Joh. 6. 67.</note> 
                  <hi>to learn of him who is meek and gentle;</hi> whereas theſe uſe Force and Rigour to make their Commands be obſerved: For if a true Chriſtian ſhould not go to Maſs on the Days which they have appointed, they would commit him to Juſtice or the Inquiſition; or if another ſhould not communicate at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> he would be in the ſame Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

                  <hi>he that WILL be my Diſciple?</hi> This rigorous Spirit which is now obſerv'd in the Church, is not conformable to that of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe <note n="k" place="bottom">Mat. 11. 30.</note>

               <p>I muſt confeſs, Sir, that by the Grace of God, I do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; for ſince I yielded my ſelf wholly unto God, and left the Converſation of Men, I have had no Ground to confeſs once a Year: Should I be therefore obliged to go and offend God, that I might have Matter to confeſs at the End of the Year, that I may obſerve the Ordinances of theſe Councils?

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Reformation of the Church, of its Councils, Commands and Ordinances.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Said to her; <hi>That the Councils were held, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the great Abuſes which had crept into the Church; that it was expedient that the Church gave Commands, or otherwiſe every one would live after his own Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, we have the Commandments of God: Had it not been a more perfect way to reform theſe Abuſes, by taking up again only what Jeſus Chriſt had taught us, than to make new Commandments? What <note n="a" place="bottom">Prov. 30. 5, 6.</note> could be wanting in the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt that other things muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it? They who would make a good Reformation, ought always to take up again the firſt Inſtitution, and make it only be obſerv'd: For the Holy Spirit can never be miſtaken. <note n="b" place="bottom">Eccl. 3. 14.</note> There is nothing to be mended in nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to any of his Works; and ſince we can never change a perfect Form, and give it another without ſpoiling the firſt, ſo we cannot form new Commandments without deforming thoſe of God; <note n="c" place="bottom">Pſ. 19. 7.</note> which were compleat and perfect. The great Abuſes which had crept into the Church, would have been redreſs'd better by the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, taking it in the plain Letter, than by ſo many other new Precepts and Ordinances. No body could have lived any longer after his own Mode, when once the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt had been ſet again in its Light; for it regulates all our Actions and Manners: There needed nothing to be added to it in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to revive the true Spirit of Chriſtianity with more Eaſe than all that they would joyn to it ſince; which things have been the Cauſe that many have withdrawn themſelves from the Church to forge Hereſies according to their Fanſies: For they judg'd they were as learn'd as thoſe who would oblige them to their Laws.</p>

               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>I could not comprehend how the Commands of the Church had deformed the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, ſince they were only added as more expreſs Means to make it be well obſerv'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, you do not reach to the Bottom of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair: For if you remark it more nearly, you ſhall find direct Contradictions; becauſe theſe Councils would have by force what Jeſus Chriſt would not have but by Love: He never preſs'd any body to follow his Doctrine: On the contrary, when any of his Diſciples left him, he ask'd his Apoſtles <note n="d" place="bottom">John 6. 67.</note> 
                  <hi>if they would leave him alſo</hi> leaving always every one to his own Free-Will; whereas theſe damn the Souls and oppreſs the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of thoſe who will not obey them. They condemn as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mortal Sin all thoſe who will not obſerve their Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and even impriſon their Bodies, baniſh them from their Country; yea, for this they ſometimes put them to death. <note n="e" place="bottom">Matth. 20. 25, 26.</note> This Spirit of Rigour, does it not deſtroy the Form of that ſweet Goſpel-Law which was ſo perfectly formed by the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Artiſt that ever was or ſhall be, that is, by Jeſus Chriſt who was God and Man? Could there be any thing to be added to the excellent Work of ſuch a Maſter? For there can nothing be added more than taken away, without altering the firſt Form If one take from a Picture the ſweet Draughts of ſome Figure, by adding to it ſome rude ones, the Figure ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to be what it was before: For it is impoſſible that two contrary things ſhould abide together in the ſame Subject. Cou'd Rigour be introduc'd into the Church to make Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be obſerved there? Theſe Arguments which you lay down, Sir, are without Foundation; but you do it to excuſe what you have once eſpouſed, (as I have done alſo): Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I cannot cover its Deformities ſo well known to the Eyes of my Saviour, who will very ſhortly make them known to all the World, tho' they ſtrive ſo earneſtly to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>I ſhould be very ſorry if I ſhould aim to cover what diſpleaſed God; but that it was the common Sentiment of all Chriſtians to own and follow as a good thing, what the Church, aſſembled in a Body, had ordain'd, and determin'd: For we ſay in our Creed, That we believe in the Holy Catholick Church.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:104476:145"/>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, you would have reaſon if you did not take the Bark for the Wood, and a Humane Church for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. The Holy Church cannot err, as I have told you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times; becauſe it is the ſame thing with God. If it be Holy, it is Apoſtolick: Now the Apoſtles never commanded the going once a Year to Confeſſion upon Pain of Sin, nor even taught it to any as a Vertue. On the contrary, Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to all thoſe whoſe Sins he remitted, <note n="f" place="bottom">Joh. 5. 14. and 8. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Go, and ſin no more,</hi> This was far from commanding them to go once a Year to Confeſſion: For this would be tacitly or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to command them to ſin once a Year; becauſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion always ſuppoſes Sin; yea, they even teach us that he who receives Abſolution without Matter of Sin, commits a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege, as he does alſo who gives it. Therefore of Neceſſity a Man muſt ſin every Year, that he may confeſs every Year, if he would not commit a Sacrilege. Do you not ſee, Sir, that the Holy Spirit cannot have inſtituted ſuch things? This muſt come from elſewhere, as many other things ordain'd and reſolv'd upon by this Church collegiately aſſembled, tho' it be in uſe amongſt Chriſtians to referr to it and believe it? This can be nothing but a blind Submiſſion: For if we had good Eyes, we would ſtill look <note n="g" place="bottom">2 Cor. 10. 15.</note> whether what they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or ordain us, be truly good and conformable to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, before we follow it. They tell us indeed, that Faith ought to be blind, becauſe it conſiſts in believing what we do not ſee; But this Faith does not extend ſo far as to believe what Men ſay to us, but only what God himſelf has told us by the Holy Prophets and Apoſtles, or by Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who <note n="h" place="bottom">Eph. 2. 20.</note> has foretold us a great many things which we do not ſee, becauſe they are not yet come to paſs. In this we muſt uſe Faith; becauſe God cannot lye nor fail in making good his Promiſes: But our Faith does not ſtand in that which Men ſay to us or command us: For they themſelves are often fallen from the true Faith while they ordain us things contrary thereunto.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>If ſhe judg'd the Commandments of the Church to be evil things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> No, Sir, there are divers things which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are good; as faſting in <hi>Lent,</hi> in imitation of Jeſus Chriſt, who faſted forty Days in the Deſart; and alſo the communicating at <hi>Eaſter</hi> in Memory of the Supper which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104476:146"/>
Chriſt made with his Apoſtles at that time; and alſo the Sanctifying the Days dedicated unto God; becauſe he himſelf has commanded it: All theſe things are good in themſelves: But this Conſtraint under Pain of Damnation, or civil or bodily Puniſhment, is moſt evil; becauſe good Works done with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, cannot pleaſe God, who has no need of our Faſts or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; but he regards our Heart and our Will. If this do not concurr to our good Works, <note n="i" place="bottom">Mal. 1. 13, and 2. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>he will throw them as Dung into our Faces:</hi> For nothing can pleaſe him but what is offered him by Love: Therefore he ſays in ſo many Places, <hi>He that WILL come after me, or he that WILL follow me.</hi> In all things he requires our affectionate <hi>Will,</hi> and nothing by Force or Violence. This belongs but to cruel Men, who are not of God, ſeeing he <note n="k" place="bottom">1 Joh. 4. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>is ALL LOVE,</hi> and has given us no other Laws but that of Love; whereas theſe Perſons come with a great many Commandments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pain of Damnation, and other Temporal Puniſhments. Have you ever read, Sir, that Jeſus Chriſt, his Apoſtles or Diſciples did at any time impriſon any or impoſe Fines on any for not obeying their Ordinances; as theſe Councils do, who deforming this beautiful Law of Meekneſs and Love, do forge troubleſome and conſtraining ones. Does not God deſerve that we ſanctifie the Days which are dedicated to him out of Love? Is not the Deſire that we have to follow and imitate Jeſus Chriſt, powerful enough to make us faſt the <hi>Lent,</hi> and communicate once a Year, without the being oblig'd to it by force? He who does it not out of Love muſt do it with regret<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in Hypocriſie. Were it not better not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to it, than to do things ſo troubleſome without merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, and to die the Devil's Martyr, which this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and forcing Command does occaſion? For a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian has no need of being forc'd; and they who are not ſo, have no need of theſe Commands.</p>
               <p>I ſaid; <hi>I believ'd that all our good Works to make them me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious ought to proceed from the Heart and from our Will; but that God alone can ſearch the Inward; and therefore the Church ordain'd outward things of which ſhe could judge, and that to keep Chriſtians united together, it was needful to give them Laws and make them be obſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, you grant me by what you ſay, that the Church at preſent is not that which Jeſus Chriſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104476:146"/>
ſince to keep Chriſtians united, ſhe makes Laws that are nothing but civil and temporal ones, reſpecting only outward things; becauſe that which was eſtabliſhed by Jeſus Chriſt, ought not to be upheld, but <note n="l" place="bottom">Col. 3. 14. Joh. 13. 34. and 15. 10.</note> by the Bond of Charity, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chriſtians by a Conformity of their Wills in God; which Unity of Spirit appears ſufficiently by outward Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; becauſe the Chriſtian who is poſſeſs'd with Charity cannot remain hid: For Charity is always working. There need no other outward Laws to make appear to Men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be true Chriſtians, but <hi>THE LOVE of GOD, and CHARITY FOR O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R NEIGHBO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R.</hi> Theſe things are as well outward as inward, and may be judg'd by Men: For to diſcover true Chriſtians it was not needful to ordain them ſo many Precepts under Pain of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin: For the Doctrine of the Goſpel was but too ſufficient to regulate all their Actions and Manners: Why ſhould they command the hearing of Maſs under the Pain of mortal Sin, ſince Jeſus Chriſt in his Goſpel, has never oblig'd, nor even counſel'd any body to do it, nor yet to confeſs their Sins once a Year? Tho' indeed he ſays, <note n="m" place="bottom">Jam. 5. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>confeſs your Sins one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;</hi> this is not that one muſt do it once a Year; But when he has ſinned he muſt be humbled and confeſs to his Brother that he is a Sinner; and this rather in publick than in private; that the Humility of declaring our ſelves Sinners, and the Confuſion that we have to be known for ſuch before Men, may give ſatisfactory Puniſhment to our Sins. This is not to ſay that he muſt go and confeſs at certain Times and Days; But when the Sinner deſires to return to God in Heart and Affection, even tho' this ſhould not befal but once in his Life, and at the end of it: He ſhould not ceaſe for this to have the Pardon of his Sins, and to obtain Mercy from God: And if to be ſaved, it were ſo preciſely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to communicate at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> how could a <hi>Paul,</hi> a <hi>Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> and ſo many other holy Hermites have been ſaved, who ended their Lives in the Deſerts of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Thebais,</hi> without having ever communicated or heard Maſs? If Jeſus Chriſt had ſpoken of the Euchariſt when he ſaid, <note n="n" place="bottom">Joh. 6. 53.</note> 
                  <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, you ſhall have no Life in you.</hi> This Church which you believe to be holy, would have err'd in holding all theſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104476:147"/>
Perſons for Saints, who never communicated, or at leaſt very ſeldom: For St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermite having been for ſo many Years in the Deſert without ſeeing any body, died without receiving the Euchariſt: The <hi>Aegyptian Mary</hi> after having been thirty Years without ſeeing any body, received it once only before her Death, with a thouſand ſuch like. What, could theſe be ſaved without obſerving ſo much as one of theſe Commands of the Church? For they ſanctified all the Days of their Life by a continual Union with God, as all true Chriſtians ought to do. It was not needful for them to pitch upon certain Days appointed by the Church, all their Days (none excepted) being ſanctified by continual Prayer. In like manner they could not obſerve the Faſts of <hi>Lent,</hi> and the other times expreſly appointed: For their Life was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a continual Faſt, taking no other Food but what was purely neceſſary, as all true Chriſtians ought to do, who expect to be ſatisfied in the other World, without deſiring to ſatiate themſelves in this. Why ſhould they who have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to defend this Church, ſay, that People cannot marry in <hi>Lent</hi> or <hi>Advent?</hi> Neither Jeſus Chriſt nor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ever forbad ſuch things, neither did they command the Paying of Tithes: For that great Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that <note n="o" place="bottom">Act. 20. 34. 1 Theſ. 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>his Hands gain'd his Bread, and that he was chargeable to no body:</hi> And Jeſus Chriſt bids his Diſciples, tho' <note n="p" place="bottom">Luk. 10. 7,-11.</note> 
                  <hi>The Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be worthy of his Reward: take and eat whatſoever is given them; and when they enter into a Place and are not received, that theygo from it ſhaking the Duſt off their Feet;</hi> whereas thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils ordain the Payment of Tithes by Force: So that he who is wanting in it, ſhould be treated as a Criminal. I do not know, Sir, how you can ſay, that all theſe Laws, with ſo obliging them were needful to keep Chriſtians united, by many others, to obſerve them by Force! Becauſe I can ſee nothing in all theſe Ordinances which has the Property of uniting Hearts On the contrary, rather of dividing them,</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That in all well order'd Common-wealths, there muſt always be heads and Superiours, whom we ought to obey, and follow their Laws; or otherwiſe there could be no Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, if you hold the Church for a Civil Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, you have Reaſon; but if you hold her to be Holy and Spiritual, or the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt, you are <note n="q" place="bottom">Col. 2. 20</note> much in the wrong: For her Head was ſtill her Superiour, and has
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104476:147"/>
given her ſuch excellent Laws and Rules, that no body can add any thing more perfect to them: Thoſe who would needs make ſome Changes in them, have wholly confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them; and they who would be their Superiours, have abuſed the Graces of their Liege Lord: Since being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Lieutenants on Earth, to maintain his Ordinances, they have neglected them, and have made others after their own Mode, or for their own Advantage, againſt the Deſigns of their Sovereign Maſter: For by forbidding to marry at certain times, they diſturb the Order that God has ſet from the beginning of the World. Nothing was more holy, nor ever will be, amongſt Men in this World, than <hi>Adam</hi> before his Sin. Nevertheleſs God gave him a Wife, that he might know her for the Generation of Men, and for the perpetual Unity that they ought to have together. If God found it meet that this Marriage ſhould be inſtituted in the Earthly Paradiſe in the moſt holy time that ever was, before <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinn'd, why do theſe Perſons forbid to marry in the times of <hi>Lent</hi> and <hi>Advent?</hi> If it were for the Piety of the Time, they would not give ſo many Diſpenſations to do it after they have forbidden it: For ordinarily we ſee more of the Rich married in this forbidden Time, than in that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd. It ſeems this Prohibition is but for the Poor, who have not Money enough to obtain theſe Diſpenſations. It is a Pain to me to bend my Mind under theſe Laws: For I find them not at all conformable to thoſe of God: And if we muſt leave the doing good things becauſe Men forbid them, they are then greater Maſters than he.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>I did not believe that the Church can forbid good things, or command evil things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, conſider narrowly this Prohibition of marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a certain time; it cannot at all be good in it ſelf: For they themſelves call Marriage a Sacrament, and they ſay well; for all the Works of God are ſacred and holy: If therefore it be a ſacred thing, why may it not be received in the times of <hi>Lent</hi> or <hi>Advent,</hi> which they reckon alſo to be holy times? May not holy things be done in holy times? This ought to be the fitteſt time for receiving the Sacraments; and Marriage is certainly inſtituted of God from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World, and he did nothing more perfect in Nature than the Inſtitution of Marriage, as he did nothing more perfect in Grace than the Free-Will which he gave to Man; and thoſe who call themſelves the <hi>Church,</hi> would indeed by their Ordinances hinder both the one and the other, bounding
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104476:148"/>
and limiting the Will of Man to their Submiſſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicting them Marriage at certain times limited by them. Jeſus Chriſt <note n="r" place="bottom">Joh. 2. 1.</note> went in Perſon to a Marriage with his Mother, and his Diſciples: that he might authorize it by his Preſence: Why then ſhould theſe forbid it for the Piety of the times of <hi>Lent</hi> and <hi>Advent?</hi> as if Marriage was evil and unworthy to be celebrated in pious times! while Marriage has even more of Piety and Sanctity, than this <hi>Lent</hi> and <hi>Advent,</hi> which are not authorizd but by the Commandment of Men, and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age by the Ordinanece of God himſelf, and confirm'd by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, being at a Marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> where he did the firſt Miracle, turning Water into Wine for a Bleſſing to the Married.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That Marriage was truly inſtituted of God, and conſequently good in it ſelf; but that the Cuſtoms of Men had render'd it evil and inſolent, by Exceſs of Feaſts and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and that for this Cauſe it was forbidden in holy times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> If Marriage is become evil thro' the ill Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of Men, the Church ought not to permit an evil thing at any other times, no more than in <hi>Lent</hi> and <hi>Advent:</hi> For it is not lawful to do evil things at any time; and if they will forbid good things for the ill Uſe of them, they muſt forbid the Uſe of all the Sacraments; becauſe in general they are all abuſed: And inſtead of forbidding all by the ſame Conſequence that they interdict Marriage, they incite Chriſtians to uſe them more, and even in the moſt holy times: For if they ſend them ſome <hi>Jubilee,</hi> or ſome other Indulgence, it is always on condition that he who would obtain them do confeſs and communicate. In the mean time, no body can be ignorant of the great Abuſe and ill Uſe that is made of the receiving theſe two Sacraments, which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt never received but they commit Sacrilege, we ſee by Experience that Sorcerers do nothing more willingly, than go to Confeſſion and Communion. Baptiſm, as I told you alſo heretofore, is greatly abuſed in the receiving of it, ſince, we ſee, no body lives according to the Promiſe made at Baptiſm. Nevertheleſs, the Church is ſo earneſt to make all Chriſtians receive it, that they will not wait till they have the Uſe of Reaſon to know what they do. If this ill Uſe has given Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to interdict the Sacrament of Marriage at certain times,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104476:148"/>
wherefore do they not likewiſe interdict this of Baptiſm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Child have attain'd the Uſe of Reaſon, that he may uſe it aright? <hi>Confirmation</hi> was a verygood thing, that the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Child baptized at its Birth might confirm the Promiſes which the Godfathers and Godmothers made in its Name: But they are alſo ſo eager to confirm Children, that ſometimes they will not wait till they be out of their Swadling-Clothes: So that they do no more obſerve the Promiſe of Confirmation than that of Baptiſm; becauſe it is uſual never to think any longer on what they have done, when they received theſe two Sacraments in ſuch Non-Age: They content themſelves with receiving the outward Signs, without caring any farther, either for Faith or for the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. Are not theſe great Abuſes and very ill Uſes of them? Yet they interdict no body, no not for a Day: On the contrary, they preſs and draw all Chriſtians to them with Precipitation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out caring for the Abuſes which are committed in them: So is it likewiſe, as to the Sacrament of <hi>Orders.</hi> How many Prieſts are there who abuſe this Dignity? How many are there of them who lead a debauch'd Life? How many Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds and Sluggards? As ſoon as they are made Prieſts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of employing their time in the Study of a truly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Life, they amuſe themſelves with Plays and Paſtimes, and worldly and vain Recreations. Notwithſtanding of all theſe Abuſes, they interdict no body to become a Prieſt, provided they have ſtudied ſufficiently: On the contrary, they conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate them profuſely, and in an exceſſive Number: And whereas Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, that <note n="s" place="bottom">Mat. 23. 8. Jam. 3. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>they ſhould not be many Maſters.</hi> The Church makes ſo many of them, that one cannot tell which of them to hear or obey; becauſe of ſuch a Diverſity of them, and yet ſhe commands to pay them Tithes, under Pain of Sin.</p>
               <p>Judge you, Sir, whether all theſe things are ordained, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, or commanded by the Holy Spirit, who is the Righteous, Good, and True God, always conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſaid, that</hi> the Workman is worthy of his Reward, <hi>and that the Church might very well ordain the Paying Tithes to the Prieſts, who being continually occupied in the Service of God, the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the People, and the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, could not gain their own Living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:104476:149"/>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, if none pretended to the Tithes but they who are in the Office of a Paſtour, or continually employed in the Service of God, there would be no need to make People pay them: For all good Chriſtians would be well pleas'd to maintain their ſpiritual Fathers, even tho' it were never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd them: But this Command extends much farther; for the Tithes muſt be paid to maintain thoſe Prieſts who have no other Charge but their own Perſons, and deſire to rule like ſecular Princes, employing the Wealth of their Tithes in Coaches, Horſes, Trains, Rich Moveables and Sumptuous Buildings. This is ſo much the Faſhion that now-a-days there is ſcarce any body to be ſeen that will be content with what is neceſſary; but they will have all in exceſs and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, even they who manage their Wealth, as to their own Perſons, heap it up to enrich their Kinsfolk. Are theſe Goods employed aright in the Service of God? On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they are ſpent rather in the Devil's Service, who is ſtill glorified by the Pride and Avarice which thoſe Perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in the Abuſe of their Privilege; Becauſe thoſe Goods which are dedicated to the Service of God, whether Tithes or other, are not proper to the Prieſts who poſſeſs them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to poor Chriſtian Brethren: and they cannot take of them for their own Uſe beyond what is juſtly neceſſary, even tho' they be Paſtors, or have Charges: This cannot warrant them to diſtribute or heap up this Wealth of the Church, except for the Entertainment of their poor Chriſtian Brethren, after the Example of the Apoſtles; who diſtributed to every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Neceſſities: So that no body had need of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, even tho' they did not oblige them to give them Goods by Force: For when <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> brought a Part of their Wealth to St. <hi>Peter</hi> when they came to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, he ſaid to them, <note n="t" place="bottom">Act. 2. 48. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To ſhew that they conſtrain'd no Body to give their Goods, leaving every one free to do it who would; whereas they conſtrain Men by Force to give their Goods to the Prieſts, and damn them if they do it not; as if they, by their own Authority could damn them; which they cannot do: For Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid, <note n="u" place="bottom">Act. 4. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Judge not, and you ſhall not be judged; condemn not, and you ſhall not be condemned.</hi> For my part, I think, if People did not give ſo many Tithes, they<note place="bottom">(<hi>x</hi>] <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 1.</note>

would not co-operate to ſo many Sins, and that temporal Wealth has been the Cauſe of the Church's Ruine, and that the Holy Ghoſt has been entirely baniſh'd from her: For ſince ſhe would needs maintain her ſelf by Wealth, Honour, and Authority, the Holy Spirit has been baniſh'd from her, and ſhe governed by a purely Humane and Political Spirit; or, to ſpeak truly, a Diabolical one: Becauſe a Spirit ſimply Humane, could not ordain things contrary to Jeſus Chriſt: For Humane Wickedneſs does not extend farther <note n="x" place="bottom">1 John 2. 15.</note> than the Pleaſure, Honour, or Profit of Man; but theſe ordain things wherein they have neither the one nor the other of theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, as to cauſe, baptize, and confirm Children in their Infancy, and to faſt on Pain of mortal Sin.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I ſaid; <hi>That it was at leaſt needful, that ſome Tithes or Goods ſhould be appointed for thoſe who were neceſſary for the Service of God and of Chriſtian People; becauſe they were forbidden to trade, or work to get their Breaed.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, this forbidding the Prieſts to work that they may get their Bread cannot come from God,; becauſe he commanded all Men in <hi>Adam</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>to gain their Bread with the Sweat of their Body.</hi> Why then ſhould the Prieſts be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who ought to obey him more preciſely than others; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they make a particular Profeſſion of it, and they ought more punctually to be ſubject to the Commandments of God, who having appointed bodily Labour for Penitence, did not exempt the Prieſts, nor his Apoſtles, nor <hi>Joſeph,</hi> nor <hi>Mary,</hi> nor <note n="b" place="bottom">Mark 6. 3.</note> even Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who labour'd for his bodily Food. How can they change ſo general an Ordinance, confirmed by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104476:150"/>
ſo many Saints, and by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf? If Labour were evil, God would not have appointed it; for he cannot do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil things; and if it were not good and ſaving, the Saints and the Apoſtles would not have exerciſed it, and Jeſus Chriſt would not have confirm'd it by working himſelf with his Mother and his Father. By what Spirit could they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the Prieſts to work, when we hear St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <note n="c" place="bottom">Act. 20. 34, 35. 1 Theſ. 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Lo, theſe Hands gain'd my Bread, not being willing to be chargeable to any.</hi> What greater Dignity would the Prieſts pretend to now-a-days, than the Apoſtles had, and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, that they ſhould be interdicted and forbid Working; Do we not plainly ſee, that theſe are but the Inventions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men for their Eaſe and Commodity? For God never changes his Laws, and can never find that to be evil which he has once found to be good. If Labour be good wherefore ſhould it be forbidden the Prieſts, who ought to be more good and perfect than others? And if Labour were not good, yea, neceſſary for Man, God would never have ordain'd it as a Satisfaction for his Sins.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That Labour was forbidden the Prieſts that thereby more time might be given them for attending on their Studies, and the Perfection of Souls, for fear temporal Labours and Buſineſs ſhould deprive them of the Leiſure to attend upon what is for the Glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, theſe Ends have not their Effect: For tho' the Prieſts uſe no bodily Labour, yet notwithſtanding they do not apply themſelves to labour for the Glory of God, but rather to offend him by their Sloth and Idleneſs; which is the Cuſſion whereon the Devil reſts. The ceaſing to labour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files them with a double Sin: For notwithſtanding of this, they do not give themſelves to the Study of Perfection: On the contrary, they give way to Temptation, and give the Devil Leiſure to tempt them at his Pleaſure: For wherever he meets with Idleneſs, there <note n="d" place="bottom">Eccl. 33. 31.</note> he enters as into his own Houſe. It were better to command the Prieſts to labour much, that the Devil might get no hold on their Souls; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being diſoccupied from all the Buſineſs and Affairs of the World, they are the better diſpoſed to hearken to the evil Thoughts and Suggeſtions of the Devil: Whereas a Soul that is continually employed, takes no Leiſure to give Ear to the Devil. Do we not ſee ſo great a Number of Prieſts, Monks,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104476:150"/>
and Religious, paſs their Time without doing any thing, and live in Sloth upon the Sweat of the People? They will not be aſhamed to go beg their Bread at the Houſes of poor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers and Tradeſmen; who have no other thing but what they can gain by the Sweat of their Face, who ſometimes give them what they've need of themſelves: Nevertheleſs they dare not refuſe them, becauſe they are Church-men: But if they were of the true Church, built by Jeſus Chriſt, <note n="e" place="bottom">Acts 20. 35.</note> they would be ſo filled with Charity, that inſtead of asking or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Alms of theſe poor Workmen, they would work themſelves to give them the Gain of their Labour. Sir, I look upon what is received by Form of Alms as a Robbery, when we may get our own Bread by our Trade or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or we may have whereupon to live of our own Goods; and I believe 'tis thus <note n="f" place="bottom">Eccl. 40. 31, 34.</note> before God: For it is an unjuſt thing to live on anothers Goods, and to keep our own; or to go beg, when God has given us an healthful Body and ſound Mind that we may labour. But you will ſtill excuſe that Church which you have for ſo long a time look'd upon as holy. It were better to open your Eyes to diſcover the Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its Wickedneſs, that you let not your ſelf be deceiv'd to your Perdition.</p>

               <p>I Said to her; <hi>That ſhe gave a deal of Light in divers things for which I did infinitely bleſs God; but I could not deny, it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me a little to hear that the</hi> Roman <hi>Church was thus fallen from the Spirit of true Chriſtianity.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, it is more expedient for the Salvation of your Soul, that you know the Miſery into which the Church has fallen, than if you knew the higheſt Myſteries of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104476:151"/>
or the greateſt Good of all Men together; Becauſe an Evil known, is eaſie to be avoided: But as long as 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and hid from us, it is always dangerous, and may greatly hurt us, without our being aware of it. Therefore you ought to give the more Attention, and to apply your Underſtanding more to underſtand and comprehend the Truth, which I tell you of Evil, than to diſcover the Good: For if I told you the Good of all Men, this would only give you ſome little Contentment, or ſenſual Satisfaction; which would add nothing to your Soul: But by knowing the Evil as it is, you may prudently beware of it, that it do not touch or harm you: For all theſe Evils which I ſaid were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into the Church, even while it was yet Holy, are all covered with Appearances of Good and Piety, and Reaſon; becauſe the Devil could never have gained ſo many Souls as have followed him, but under this Colour or Mantle of Good: And he will yet gain many by their Ignorance of theſe Evils, or by their Unbelief of them: For as long as they take Evil for Good, they will ſtill blindly follow it; and Ignorance will not excuſe the Sin: For God having given us an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to comprehend, and a Spirit to diſcern, <note n="a" place="bottom">Eph. 5. 15, 17. Phil. 1. 9, 10.</note> we ought particularly to apply them to what concerns our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and when the Truth is ſet before our Eyes, and we will not open them to conſider it; we reſiſt it, and may look for the Condemnation of the Holy Spirit; who ſays, that <note n="b" place="bottom">Rev. 21. 8.</note>

               </p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>I would not be incredulous, but believe the Truth: But that I felt an inward Oppoſition when it thus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn'd the Church in the chief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Points of Belief, which we owe to it in caſe it were the Holy Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, I believe in the Holy Church; and if I had a thouſand Lives, I would voluntarily expoſe them for its Defence, and would think my ſelf happy to ſpend the laſt Drop of my Blood for ſuch a Cauſe: But when God makes me ſee clearly that She is not Holy, nor that which Jeſus Chriſt eſtabliſhed; but that She is the Whore <note n="c" place="bottom">Rev. 17. 1.</note> which is ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> I cannot reſiſt ſo clear Truths, which do not only lie ſecret in my Soul, but God gives me alſo Terms and Words whereby to explain them to you, that you may likwiſe receive the Knowledge of them for your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For which I have often bleſs'd God, who beſtows on
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104476:151"/>
us ſo many particular Favours, hoping he will do it alſo to others, But I intreat you, doubt not what I tell you of the Miſeries into which Men are fallen: For they are yet great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than I have told you: But perſuade your ſelf aſſuredly, if they were not true, I would not have engag'd my ſelf in Diſcourſes ſo melancholly and diſagreeable to your Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It would be more pleaſant to me to tell you, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is Holy and Perfect; and that thoſe who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and follow her, are holy. This would recreate both my Heart and yours, and the Hearts of all who could hear it. I ſhould be very light-headed, or void of Underſtanding, to pleaſe my ſelf with things which diſpleaſe all the World, and which oblige me ſtill to hold my Peace, and to conceal my ſelf: Becauſe I know very well, if they ſhould hear me declare thoſe Truths, all the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> would riſe up againſt me, and even the moſt Pious <note n="d" place="bottom">Joh. 16. 2.</note> would think they made a Sacrifice to God in killing me: For they are ignorant of theſe Truths, and are wedded to their Church, as if ſhe were Holy; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no better; becauſe the great Darkneſs that is now throughout the whole World, wherein the Devil has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd all Minds with Errours, <note n="e" place="bottom">2 Theſ. 2. 10, 11.</note> they may never come to the Knowledge of the Truth, which every one withſtands, even thinking they do well in it.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>If I might not ſuſpend my Belief of thoſe things which were contrary to the Church, and believe only what concern'd Vertue and the Love of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, you can never follow Good without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from Evil; nor adhere perfectly to God without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning that which is contrary to him. Have you not remark'd in how many things this <hi>Roman</hi> Church is contrary to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt? How therefore can you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to her, and follow Vertue and the Love of God, ſo long as they are really contrary? Jeſus Chriſt ſays, that <note n="f" place="bottom">Mat. 6. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>We cannot ſerve two Maſters, without being unfaithful to the one or the other.</hi> You muſt chuſe which you love beſt. Good can never profit you without the Knowledge of Evil; becauſe while you do not know and believe it, you will inſenſibly fall into it; yea, you will often take Evil for Good: For the Evil of this Church is ſtill covered with the Sanctity of pious Reaſons and Arguments: And if Antichriſt did not cover his Wickedneſs with Vertue, he could gain none but the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104476:152"/>
but with pious Pretexts, he gains all the Good, who would even make a Scruple not to follow him, as you do, Sir, by your Demand: For if you do believe, and follow Vertue and the Love of God, you will certainly hate all that is contrary thereunto. I think I have already told you enough to let you ſee that the Rules, the Commands, and Ordinances of this Church are not conformable to thoſe of God; who, when he created Man, gave him full Liberty to uſe his Will; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thoſe conſtrain it in all Points, and will not only ſubject it by Councils or Advices; but by Force and Violence both bodily and ſpiritual: So that as much as in them lies they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Law and the Ordinances of God, to eſtabliſh their own Authority, and to bind the Souls of Chriſtians by ſo many Conſtraints, that 'tis impoſſible for them to ſatisfie them without diſpleaſing God, tho' there were no other thing but the forbidding Prieſts to labour, and making them ſwear never to explain the Holy Scriptures otherwiſe than the ancient Fathers have done.</p>
               <p>Do you not ſee, Sir, that all their Laws are nothing but political, and made to maintain their State and Authority? If a Prince or a King, to whom you were ſubject, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Tyrant; would you make any Scruple to abandon him when it were in your Power to do it, tho' he were the lawful Son of your King and gracious Father who had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded him? A Man muſt be his own Enemy, or of an effeminate Heart, if he have not the Courage to leave his own Country, that he may avoid his Tyranny and Severity, and live in Repoſe and Tranquillity.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>That this Compariſon was not ſutable, and that I had not found the</hi> Roman <hi>Church Tyrannical.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, that is becauſe you have always ſubmitted to her Laws, without conſidering whether they were good or evil; and the good Impreſſion they cunningly gave you of her Merits, made her Burthens, tho' very weighty, ſeem light to you. If you have done it in Innocence, God will pardon you, becauſe you perceived no other thing at that time: But at preſent when God ſends you his Divine Light that you may diſcover the Dangers in which you have walk'd amidſt your Darkneſs, do not reſiſt it by Doubts or Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which the Devil will put into your Mind, which have no other Foundation but a Puſillanimity and Softneſs of Heart; which more regards Natural Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, than the Perfection of the Soul, to which if you would attain, you muſt hear what <note n="g" place="bottom">2 Tim. 3. 17.</note> God teaches
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104476:152"/>
and commands you without amuſing your ſelf with ſo many other different things which Men propoſe to you, who are not to be truſted: But God can never deceive you, no more than he can ſuffer any Mutation or Change. He is our lawful King, who has always governed us by Fatherly Affection and Love: And even when Men had offended him thro' Exceſs of Wickedneſs, he ſent them <note n="h" place="bottom">

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Yes, Sir, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was in her Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the true Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt, who had received all the Riches of the Goſpel, the true Word of God, and the Wiſdom of the Holy Ghoſt: But ſince ſhe left that, ſhe has fallen into the Miſery into which <hi>Adam</hi> fell, when he would quit his Dependance on God, and become his Enemy, that he might depend on none but himſelf. <hi>Adam</hi> was the ſame Perſon after his Sin that he was before it; but he was not cloathed with the ſame Graces, nor with the ſame Spirit: For he was aſhamed and confounded, ſubject to all ſorts of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, bodily and ſpiritual, ignorant, inconſtant, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, with all the other Miſeries under which we now groan. Even ſo is it of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church which was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with all the Graces of the Holy Spirit; but ſince ſhe would needs depend upon her ſelf and eſtabliſh her own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;<note place="bottom">(m) 1 Joh. 2. 7, 8.</note>

                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 16,—19. <hi>John</hi> 15. 6.</note> changed the Order in which God had ſet her, and would needs <note n="t" place="bottom">Iſa. 66. 3, 4.</note> give Orders and Praecepts to her ſelf, after her own Way, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

God Immortal and Unchangeable, who cannot change nor forſake any thing; but <note n="z" place="bottom">2 Tim. 2. 12, 13.</note> when thoſe Men who repreſent the Church, do falſifie their Faith to him, and will needs take their Pleaſure in worldly Riches, Grandeurs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; they withdraw from and forſake their lawful Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band for this Earthly Traſh; and inſtead of continuing the faithful heavenly Spouſe, they become Harlots, by cleaving to earthly Honours and Pleaſures. By which you may ſee, Sir, that Jeſus Chriſt has not left his Church, but has only repudiated the Harlots, whom he has diſcovered in it, who are not ſuch by Faults or Falls that are caſual, of which ſhe repents, or <note n="a" place="bottom">Rev. 2. 21.</note> deſires to amend; but by ſo long inveterate Habits, that ſhe will never change from them but by Death: <note n="b" place="bottom">Rev. 17. and 18.</note> Therefore there is nothing to be looked for but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that <hi>BABYLON,</hi> and the Fall of that <hi>GREAT WHORE<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, God hath <note n="c" place="bottom">Acts 10. 34.</note> no Reſpect of Perſons, and has no fix'd Place, being univerſally in all things. Even ſo is it of his Church which is united to him; ſhe has no fix'd Place: Therefore ſhe is call'd <hi>Catholick,</hi> or common and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal: For ſhe is to be found in all Places indifferently: For otherwiſe, none ſhould have the Liberty to be of the Church, but they who remain'd in this fix'd Place.

All other things are but for enlarging and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein this Dependance on God conſiſts. Therefore the Goſpel ſays <note n="f" place="bottom">Matth. 16. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>deny your ſelves;</hi> to make us underſtand that as long as we live to our ſelves, we are not reſigned to God: For if we rejoyce in Proſperity, and are grieved in Adverſity, it is a Sign that we are not yet reſigned to God, but that we live to our own Deſires and Wills, not to thoſe of God, who will never permit any thing to befall us but what is good and wholeſome. But when we live to our ſelves, we will have this and that, according to our own Judgments, which are blind as to Eternal Things. For this Cauſe Jeſus Chriſt has taken the Pains to teach us ſo many divers things, that he may make us know what hinders us from coming to this Dependance on God, and alſo what makes it eaſie to us: But if we find this Dependance without theſe Means, we have fulfilled the whole Law, and are the <hi>Church.</hi>

               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That we hold in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church that out of it there is no Salvation.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>She replied;</hi> And I doubt, Sir, if one can be ſaved in it, ſince ſhe is not governed by the Spirit of God, how can ſhe guide any to Salvation? If the Devil ſit in her Throne, is it to be believed that he will ſaye us? His Malice encreaſes as his Authority augments. I cannot believe that one truly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an wholly reſigned to the Will of God, can remain in the College of <hi>Rome:</hi> For they would not ſuffer a Spirit ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which rules them. Theſe Reproofs would be inſupportable to them. God himſelf could not preſerve his Church among them, tho' it were but in one Perſon only. They would certainly deſtroy it, and that without Delay. If they teach that none can be ſaved out of their Dependance, it is becauſe they would fain rule over the World, and be as great as God; as the Devil had this Ambition ſince his Creation, and retained it hitherto with a great

deal of Succeſs; becauſe he holds at preſent almoſt all Men under his Authority: For to ſay that there is no Salvation out of the Dominion of <hi>Rome,</hi> is to contradict the Goſpel. For the Apoſtle having told Jeſus Chriſt that ſome taught the Goſpel, who notwithſtanding, did not follow Jeſus Chriſt nor his Diſciples, he ſays to them, <note n="g" place="bottom">Luke 9. 50.</note> 
                  <hi>Let them alone; for they who are not againſt us, are with us.</hi> Should the Pope be a greater Judge to condemn thoſe who obſerv'd the Law of God, becauſe they did not depend on him? This could not be true, even tho' the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were as yet guided by the Holy Spirit: She could not notwithſtanding, make void the Salvation of thoſe who did not follow her; ſince Jeſus Chriſt has not done it in his Goſpel; which is their Rule, and that which they ought to follow. The Apoſtles never condemned <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples, who followed not them, and did otherwiſe than theirs. There was a Complaint indeed that they faſted not as St. <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples did; <note n="h" place="bottom">Mat. 9. 14, 15.</note> and Jeſus Chriſt excuſes them. Each Apoſtle had his Diſciples apart; and all the Churches were alſo ſeparate. That of <hi>Peter</hi> was not the Church of <hi>Paul,</hi> or of the other Apoſtles: Every one had his Church and his Diſciple ſeparately; and none of them ſaid that thoſe who did not follow them were damned. It ſufficed that all had the Goſpel for their Rule, without mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Difference, whether one was of <hi>James</hi> or of <hi>Philip: S. Paul</hi> even ſeverely <note n="i" place="bottom">1 Cor. 1. 12. 13.</note> reproves thoſe who ſaid, <hi>I am of Paul</hi> or <hi>of Apollos,</hi> asking them, <hi>If they were not all of Chriſt who died for them?</hi> But at preſent, they will have none to be ſaved but thoſe who are under one Man only; whereas then all were ſaved who were under Jeſus Chriſt. Have we gotten another God, or rather another Law ſince the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus Chriſt? that theſe Men will needs damn all thoſe who will not follow this Pope! For my Part, I would rather upon Pain of my own Damnation, aſſure all thoſe of Salvation who ſhall obſerve the Commandments of God in whatſoever Place and Condition they may be: For Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to the young Man in the Goſpel <note n="k" place="bottom">Mat. 19. 16, 17.</note> who ask'd him <hi>What he ſhould do to be ſaved? Keep the Commandments,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other thing; becauſe all is comprehended in this. A Man muſt not go by four Ways when he knows one that is ſtreight and ſure. What ever Men would make us to believe, the Truth that is of God, is always the moſt certain.</p>

               <p>I begg'd, <hi>She would explain to me how God could not preſerve his Church in the College of</hi> Rome, <hi>even tho' it were but one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only, ſeeing he is Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, the Almighty Power of God will never extend it ſelf beyond his Righteouſneſs and his Goodneſs. He has given to Man a Free-Will to uſe it at his Pleaſure, by which he has made him partake in the Deity; which is the greateſt good he could ever do to Man: For by this Free-Will he renders him capable of taking his Delights with him; or otherwiſe there would not have been any Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of God with Man, ſince Likeneſs begets Love, and Love is always bent to love its like. If Man had not had Liberty of uſing his Will, he would not have been like to God in any thing: For a Creature bounded and conſtrain'd, has no relation to an Almighty God. It was neceſſary that the Power of uſing his Free-Will, ſhould be given him that God might take his Delight with that which in ſome manner was like unto himſelf, and nothing could reſemble him but this free Power of his Will. Tho' he had created Man's Soul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this had been but a limited Spirit without this Free-Will which muſt certainly concurr to compleat the Delight which God would take with Men: For as a King can take no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in recreating himſelf with a Slave, as he would do with a Queen, who is nearer his Quality; ſo God would make Man in his full Liberty, and capable of uſing his Free-Will fully, that in this Liberty he might be ſome way like to him. This being done, <note n="m" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 29.</note> he cannot repent of any thing, but lets Man enjoy his Gifts: However he abuſe them, his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Conſtancy will not let him withdraw or take from him what he has once given him; but he leaves it him, and will leave it to all Eternity: Whether Man ſave or damn himſelf, Free-Will ſhall never be taken from him; for God is not changeable in his Gifts, no more than in all his Works. This being ſo, <note n="n" place="bottom">Rev. 12. 6, 14. 18, 4.</note> he cannot hinder the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> from killing any body amongſt them who would be the true Church, without bounding or limiting the Free-Will that they have to do this: But his Goodneſs preventing their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, will move his Church <note n="o" place="bottom">John 12. 39.</note> to withdraw out of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or to hide her ſelf, as Jeſus Chriſt hid himſelf to avoid the <hi>Jews</hi> Tyranny; and by this means he exerciſes his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104476:155"/>
towards his Church, and leaves thoſe Men of ill Will in the Liberty that he has given them, who do only the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that are in their Power, and cannot reach the doing thoſe which the Good by their Light and Foreſight can avoid. 'Tis thus, Sir, that I ſaid, God could not preſerve his Church among theſe <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> becauſe he will never uſe his Power againſt the Juſtice of the Right that he has given them to uſe their Free-Will. Sir, we ought always to take things in their Source, or elſe we would utter Calumnies againſt God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſaying that he is not Powerful to hinder Evil, nor Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to preſerve his own, or not juſt in not letting Cauſes work according to the Order in which he has eſtabliſhed them, which would be ſo many Blaſphemies: Becauſe God can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do any Evil, for he is the Source of all Good: He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not permit Injuſtice, for he is perfect Righteouſneſs: And likewiſe he cannot againſt Promiſe, take from him the Free-Will that he has once given him: But he does all his Works in ſuch Perfection, that <note n="q" place="bottom">Pſ. 89. 15.</note> Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs, Faith, and Truth concurr in all, in an excellent Harmony, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhes the Underſtanding of him who conſiders them.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That the Impreſſion of Dependance on this</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Church, was as it were naturalized in my Soul, and that it would be very ill in me to leave her altogether, tho' I abſolutely deſired to reſign my ſelf entirely unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, be not any ways troubled. Continue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently under the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, provided you do not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in her, but that which is good in it ſelf; abundance cannot hurt. After you ſhall be entirely reſigned unto God, he will uphold you, and will govern you thro' all: The more you ſhall be united to him, the more you will partake of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and his Light ſhall be given you more clearly, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Truth of every thing. You are now yet a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier of this <hi>Roman</hi> Church: Therefore you love her and would feign excuſe her Faults, that you may not be obliged to forſake her; which likewiſe you ought not to do by the Inducement of any; but if you approach to God you will partake of this Light as the Ray partakes of the Sun, according as it is near it. When you ſhall partake of the Righteouſneſs of God, you will ſee with an upright Eye the Injuſtice of this <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and when you ſhall partake of the Truth of God, you will diſcover their Lyes; and having partaken of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104476:156"/>
the Goodneſs of God, you will diſcover that Malice which now you can ſcarce believe: For all the Perfections of God do aſſuredly diſcover the Imperfections which are oppoſite to him. Labour therefore, Sir, to find this Union with God, and be not troubled under whoſe Dependance you are. <hi>Rome</hi> cannot hurt you, when you hearken to none but God. We need not be at the Trouble to learn where the true Church is: For ſhe will be in us as long as we poſſeſs the Law of God and the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, which only makes up the holy Church. It remains only that in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church you beware of the Seductions which are crept in there. This is what Jeſus Chriſt has ſo often warn'd us of in his Goſpel, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng, <note n="r" place="bottom">Mat. 7. 15. 24. 5. 11. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets, who will come deceitfully, and ſhall ſeduce many. Falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, who ſhall, if it were poſſible, deceive the very Elect.</hi> He neither ſpeaks of <hi>Turks</hi> nor of <hi>Heathens,</hi> but of falſe Chriſts.</p>

Many Superſtitions have crept into them, againſt God's Honour and our Salvation: Therefore you muſt always join your Intention with what <note n="a" place="bottom">Phil. 2. 5.</note> God may have in theſe things, or otherwiſe you will commit many Faults, and will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe deceive others. For my part, I believe the Maſs repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Communion that Jeſus Chriſt had with his Apoſtles, who eat and drank with them every Day, bleſſing the Bread and breaking it to diſtribute them; which the Apoſtles
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104476:156"/>
                  <note n="b" place="bottom">Acts 2. 46.</note> continued to do with their Diſciples, and afterwards all the Primitive Chriſtians, who aſſembled every Day to eat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and bleſſing God, imparted to every one as he had need; which maintain'd and nouriſh'd among them the true <hi>CHARITY</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt had left them by Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <note n="c" place="bottom">Luke 22. 19. John 6. 55.</note> 
                  <hi>Do this in Remembrance of me, and you ſhall live for ever;</hi> becauſe without this <hi>Charity</hi> no body can be ſaved; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us; <note n="d" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1,—4.</note> 
                  <hi>Tho' one could even remove Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, tho' he gave all his Goods to the Poor, yea, his Body to be burn'd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all this would be nothing without Charity;</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt had recommended to all his Diſciples a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death. This is now out of uſe, and inſtead of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and maintaining it by theſe daily <note n="e" place="bottom">Acts 6. 1, 2.</note> Meetings of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, thoſe who did aſſemble to eat and drink, bleſſing God for what he beſtowed on them, they have chang'd it into the Maſs, which we obſerve to this Day with little Profit and Salvation, except that the Intentions of ſome may be to do it in the Spirit and Deſire which Jeſus Chriſt had when he appointed it, and left it in his Teſtament. It is to this I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you, Sir, that you may loſe no Occaſions of following the Deſigns of God, and that you deceive no body in teaching them that they have done enough in going to Maſs: For tho' they ſhould hear a hundred every Day, this would avail them nothing if they have not Charity, which is not now cheriſh'd amongſt Chriſtians tho' they aſſemble every Day to Maſs; becauſe they are not taught for what it is inſtituted, ſince theſe <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have turn'd all things to their greater Advantage. If we would examine narrowly all the other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, we would find all the ſame Miſchiefs done to the Intereſt of Salvation by thoſe new Inventions and Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That it were better than that I did not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the Eccleſiaſtical Functions, ſince there was ſo much Abuſe and Hazard in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> You would not do Ill, Sir, to abſtain from them, and to live as if you were no Prieſt, were it not that not having as yet Light enough to diſcover the Evils which are hid in them, you would by degrees fall into Scruples for leaving off all your pious Exerciſes. Pray to God that he may let you ſee what you ought to do; and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:104476:157"/>
he will ſhew you (as he does me) that all holy things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come prophane, and that there is not any thing in this <hi>Roman</hi> Church which does not ſavour of its Corruption. All People believe that having declared their Sins to the Prieſt, and got Abſolution from him, they are pardoned, tho' it <note n="f" place="bottom">Mark 2. 7.</note> is God only who can pardon Sins. The Prieſt can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed pray for the Penitent who humbles himſelf to declare his Sins as an Interceſſour between God and the Penitent; but he cannot pardon him by his own Authority. He may indeed judge by the Word of God if the Penitent in Juſtice be diſpoſed to have the Pardon of his Sins, and may give him Ground to hope that he ſhall obtain it of God, but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him by making him believe that he himſelf will pardon them, if ſo be he declare them to him; for this Declaration will do nothing without a ſincere and a firm Reſolution of <note n="g" place="bottom">Prov. 28. 13.</note> Amendment, which God regards, that he may pardon according to his ſtraight Righteouſneſs, and not according to the Judgment of the Prieſt, who may be miſtaken as well as all other Men. How could God have ſo little Equity as to commit to ſome frail Men the Power of ſaving and damning others? What Juſtice could there be that a Confeſſour for want of the Intention to abſolve, ſhould by this means damn thouſands of Perſons who made their Confeſſions to him? It muſt needs be an horrible Blaſphemy againſt God, for any to have ſuch a Perſuaſion, that a well-meaning Perſon, truly penitent, after having duly confeſs'd, dying in this State, ſhould be damn'd, becauſe the Prieſt had not the Intention to abſolve him. If this were true, it would be to render God a Tyrant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all our good Works would ſerve us for nothing, in caſe our Salvation did depend upon a good or ill Abſolution. Theſe Thoughts or this Belief would make us fall into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, in taking Men for God, who could ſave or damn accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Fancies. This God himſelf would never do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can never depart from his Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth, to judge us always according to them; whereas Men full of Paſſion, Injuſtice, and Impiety, could not but judge us according to theſe. How little Wiſdom ſhould we attribute to God in believing that he would give Men Power to ſave and damn us? He who has commanded us to worſhip none but <note n="h" place="bottom">Deut. 6. 13.</note> one God alone, he ſhould give us Occaſion of worſhipping all theſe Confeſſors, who would be the Saviours
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104476:157"/>
of all Chriſtians? Do you not palpably feel, Sir, what evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Perils there are in the Adminiſtration of thoſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, after the manner they are uſed at preſent? It were far better to be Idle than to do Evil. 'Tis no Wonder that I doubt of the Salvation of Chriſtians now, when I ſee in their religious Functions ſo many things againſt the Righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Goodneſs, and the Truth of God. Nevertheleſs I will not give you Advice in this: You may with your own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Judgment diſcern aright Truth from Lying, and thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reſolve to continue or leave off your <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> For God never conſtrains any body, each one remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free to chuſe the Means which he perceives to be moſt expedient, without believing any thing blindly, no more what I ſay, Sir, than if another ſaid it to you: But enter into your ſelf, that you may judge uprightly of the pure Truth, you will perceive and feel it if you be diſengag'd from all the Diſcourſes which theſe <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have forg'd, to make their Authority valid. Free your Spirit of all ſorts of Imaginations and Arguments, and come to the Center of the Truth to judge if God would in Juſtice put our Damnation or our Salvation into the Power of any Man unknown to us, who might be a wicked Perſon or a Sorcerer; in which Caſe he would damn as many Souls as he could to gratifie the Devil, to whom he belong'd. It muſt not be ſaid in this, God is Almighty, or his Works are incomprehenſible: For he never exerts his Power without his Righteouſneſs, which is <note n="i" place="bottom">Wiſd. 12. 14.</note> not incomprehenſible but makes it ſelf <note n="k" place="bottom">Pſ. 98. 97, 2.</note> be ſeen and commprehended by all thoſe who ſeriouſly conſider it: Becauſe no Good is perfect, if it be not communicated and known.</p>

               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>How the Righteouſneſs of God could permit ſo great a Number to periſh thro' Ignorance?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> It is a culpable Ignorance; Becauſe we have always had the Means to ſearch the Truth if we had had a Deſire to find it: For the Goſpel was recoverable, eſpecially in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, where it remains as the Teſtament that Jeſus Chriſt has left his Spouſe. What Unrighteouſneſs was there in God, in ſuffering theſe Perſons to remain in the Ignorance of their Errours, ſince they loved them <note n="q" place="bottom">2 Theſ. 2. 10, 11, 12.</note> more than the Truth? and becauſe theſe Errors were more agreeable to their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualities, they have voluntarily followed them, building on <note n="r" place="bottom">2 Pet. 2. 18, 19.</note> the Flatteries of thoſe who promis'd them Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by theſe Errors. It would be rather an Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104476:158"/>
in God, if he had conſtrain'd them to follow his Truth, after having given them their Free-Will: He could not take it back again without Injuſtice, no more than we can any thing that we have given to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is not in our Power to take it again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out committing a Robbery: Becauſe the thing given away, does not any longer appertain to us. Thus God by an exact Righteouſneſs, may let the Ignorants err; Becauſe their Ignorance is affected: For if their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance were out of Simplicity, God is ſo good that he would rather ſend an Angel from Heaven to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them, that <note n="s" place="bottom">Pſal. 25.

For it is moſt true, that if I were to Day among theſe erring Ignorants, and if I told them the Truth, I would not be heard, and far leſs followed: Becauſe they who teach them theſe Errors, ſpeak more to their Liking and accommodate themſelves more to their Senſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than the Truth does; which often reproves them, and never flatters them. Thus they with juſt Reaſon are abandoned to the Spirit of Error; ſince accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Saying of the Goſpel, <hi>They</hi>

If you knew, Sir, the Righteouſneſs of God, it would be impoſſible that you could once doubt of it: For it is ſo juſt that neither Man nor the Devil can find any thing in Truth to blame in it: But when we look on Things on the Outſide, and according to our Ignorance, it ſeems to us that God does unjuſt things, when they are moſt perfect.</p>

For this Cauſe they will not be forgiven in this World: For no Sin is forgiven here without <note n="b" place="bottom">Acts 2. 37, 38.</note> true Repentance and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Deſire of Amendment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which two Conditions are nottobe met with in the Matter of thoſe Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt: For they are contrary to Repentance and to Amendment; and therefore will not be forgiven, neither in this World, nor in the other: For no body will then receive Forgiveneſs, but they who ſhall receive the Truth; which thoſe who commit one of theſe Sins do reſiſt, by impugning the known Truth: So that the ſaid Sins will neither be forgiven in this World, nor in that to come. I do not ſpeak of an imaginary Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; becauſe no Sin enters there, and conſequently they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be forgiven if there be none. But in the other World, which ſhall be the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, he will yet find many Sins to be forgiven <note n="c" place="bottom">Rev. 1. 7. compare Zach. 12. 10.</note> at his coming: Nevertheleſs thoſe committed againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven there no more than here in this World; becauſe they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to all the Means which can procure this Pardon. It is of

theſe that Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <note n="e" place="bottom">Matth. 12. 31, 32.</note> 
                  <hi>That he who has ſinned againſt the Son of Man, it ſhall be forgiven him; but he who has ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall never be forgiven him:</hi> Becauſe this Coming of the Holy Spirit on Earth is the laſt Mercy that God will grant the World; and he who ſhall reſiſt this, can never any more repair his Fault. He muſt needs die in it.</p>
               <p>I entreated, <hi>She would ſhew to me in particular, the Meaning of theſe Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, I do not know them all in Order, but I ſhall ſpeak of thoſe which I remember, beginning with that of the <hi>Preſumption of being ſaved without good Works.</hi> This concerns all thoſe who profeſs to live will <note n="f" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 1,—8.</note>: For amongſt them there are very few who do good Works; becauſe they eſteem their Works good, when they appear ſuch to their own Judgment or that of ſome others, tho' very often, they are not ſuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: becauſe all that's good before him muſt partake of his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> which is always <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>True.</hi> Now our good Works for the moſt part have neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Conditions: For they are done, either out of Humane Reſpects, or out of Natural Inclination, or they are not truly good in themſelves: and when we do any good Works out of Humane Reſpects, they are not good before God, and can never make us obtain Salvation; becauſe we have received our Reward in this World, having obtain'd the end for which we have done them, to wit, the Satisfaction of Men, and we have no right to pretend to any other Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: And if we have done our good Works out of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclinations, or for our own Satisfaction, theſe Works likewiſe can give us no Pretenſion to Salvation; becauſe they are rewarded by the Satisfaction which we have received in them. Thirdly, we do Works, as good, which are but indifferent, or indeed, ſometimes evil. For to go to Church only out of Cuſtom, is an indifferent Work; and if being there, we behave as in a prophane Place, it is an evil Work. It is the ſame as to the frequenting of the Sacraments: And if we give Alms thro' ſome Natural Tenderneſs or Inclination this Work has not that Righteouſneſs nor Goodneſs to make it paſs for Good in God's Sight. So that to do no good Works before God, and notwithſtanding to preſume of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is a Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt: So that we believe we have merited Salvation by good Works, which do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104476:160"/>
their Goodneſs from God. Nevertheleſs we think he is obliged to give us Paradiſe <note n="g" place="bottom">Mat. 7. 21, 22. 25, 11.</note> as the moſt part of Pious and Religious Perſons do, preſuming to have that by Right of Juſtice which is not due to them; becauſe there are none but true Righteouſneſs and Charity that can be call'd good Works by which we may hope for Salvation: And tho' none be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with theſe Vertues, each one notwithſtanding believes he ſhall obtain it, as if God could ſave without Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is <hi>to impugn the known Truth.</hi> This is now commonly Practis'd by thoſe who are called Spiritual.</p>
               <p>For if we ſhould tell any of them that they are not true Chriſtians, or that we live in the Reign of Antichriſt, or that the World is judged, and that its Wickedneſs is come to the Heighth, they would believe nothing of this; loving ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtick to their old Cuſtoms, than to learn how they may become true Chriſtians, and they would likewiſe ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to believe that we are fallen into the Reign of Antichriſt tho' we ſee by Mens Lives and Manners, that of Neceſſity, they muſt be engag'd to the Devil; and tho' they ſee no Hope or Appearance that the World will grow better, yet they do not believe that 'tis judged. Thus they impugn the Truth of all theſe things, the Belief of which might bring them to Converſion and to a Life leading to Salvation; but they impugn all theſe Truths, that they may continue in their ſo dangerous Darkneſs, tho' they be ſufficiently known to all thoſe who will open their Eyes: But they who will impugn the Truth, commit this Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which ſhall not be forgiven, neither in this World, nor in the other: For they will never be converted <note n="g" place="bottom">Mat. 7. 21, 22. 25, 11.</note>, becauſe of the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which they make to the Truth, which is that that gives Salvation. They know well enough that their Life is not that of a true Chriſtian: Nevertheleſs they impugn this Truth; becauſe they have no Deſire to become one. They ſee the Devil rules thro' all in Lyes and Deceits, and that all oppoſe the Doctrine of JeſusChriſt; and they will not believe that this is the time of Antichriſt, that they might reſiſt and beware of him, and by impugning this Truth, they deſire not to avoid his Snares. They ſee that Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs is univerſally at a Heighth; and they will not<note place="bottom">(<hi>h</hi>) 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 8.</note>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:104476:160"/>
believe that the World is judged, that they may not be afraid of this Judgment.</p>
               <p>Another Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is the Envy of the ſpiritual Good of others, which is ſo generally committed, that almoſt they make no Reflection on it, and among the moſt Pious this Envy is the moſt ordinary. We may only remark the ſeveral Orders of Religious Perſons: They are almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable to one another, each one valuing his own Order and Community, and they cannot hear the Perfections and Praiſes of others mentioned, without having a ſpiritual Envy againſt them ſecretly in their Hearts; and even if a particular Perſon among them excel the reſt in ſpiritual Good, he would be envied, yea, hardly uſed by all the reſt, or impriſoned, if he ſhould live in greater Perfection among them than gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they do, or ſhould declare the truth of their Faults: So that if a votary of any of their Religious Orders, ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve literally the Goſpel which Jeſus Chriſt has left us, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he would be martyr'd, or ſo hardly us'd by the reſt, that it would be impoſſible for him to live among them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering a thouſand Deaths of Perſecutions; and for any ſecular Perſon who would obſerve the Goſpel in the World, he would be envied likewiſe by all thoſe who profeſs to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and are not, who would reject with Contempt this manner of Practice, which would not be conformable to their own: For there is ſuch a ſecret Pride in their Hearts that they cannot ſuffer that another ſhould lead a better Life than themſelves, nor even that he ſhould have the Name of it; but they would endeavour to vilifie and deſpiſe him, or make him to be ſuſpected of Levity or other Evils; in which is now fulfilled the Prediction of Jeſus Chriſt, when he ſays, <note n="i" place="bottom">Luk. 21. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>You ſhall be hated of all for my Name's ſake:</hi> For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were never hated of all; becauſe many ſtill lov'd and follow'd them: But at preſent this Warning is fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; becauſe he who walks in the Truth is hated of all: For this Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt of the ſpiritual envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of another, poſſeſſes the Hearts of all thoſe who make a Profeſſion of Vertue: Becauſe having no true Vertue, they envy that which is true and continue therein all their Days without deſiring to change, becauſe they do not eſteem this a <hi>Sin,</hi> but rather <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> that they will not own what they do not practiſe, covering this Sin with a Fidelity and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104476:161"/>
Conſtancy in what has been firſt taught them: And thus they die in Envy.</p>
               <p>Another Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is <hi>Obſtinacy in Sin,</hi> is alſo in uſe amongſt thoſe who make a Profeſſion of Vertue: For not being willing to own the forementioned things to be Sins, they continue obſtinate in them, and therefore will not be forgiven; becauſe they will not ask Pardon nor repent of them: For as much as they are perſuaded that they are not Sins, becauſe they are inward and ſpiritual: Therefore they die in Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in Sin: And even tho' they ſhould live till the other World, they would not be converted from the Preſumption of their Salvation; becauſe they are poſſeſs'd with a good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their good Works, neither will they ſubmit to the Truth, which would ſhew them the contrary. Thus they commit this Sin with the other following ones, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wilful Munder</hi> is alſo committed by the ſame ſpiritual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and they will not acknowledge it: For very often they occaſion Death to themſelves or others by their ſenſual or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet Inclinations. How many of thoſe do we ſee wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their Appetites of Eating, Drinking and other bodily Exerciſes, tho' they be prejudicial to their Health? They will not change nor leave them, even tho' they be advertis'd of it. How many die before their time by too much Eating or Drinking or taking ſomething prejudicial to their Health or thro' too much Labour? And on the contrary, how many are there who kill themſelves by indiſcreet Faſtings, or other Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or the Neglect of neceſſary things? All thoſe are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Murtherers, becauſe they kill themſelves, to ſatisfie their own Senſualities or Inclinations; and they are alſo often Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of others; becauſe they occaſion ſometimes their Neighbours Death by indirect Ways, as in forcing ſome to work beyond their Strength, or in croſſing and vexing them ſo much in their Goods and in their Spirit, that they die of Grief; or by not taking away Debates and Quarells when they can do it; and theſe encreaſe till they come to kill one another; or when by ſome Act or Omiſſion they occaſion the Riſe of ſuch Debates; or when one comes to die thro' the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of our neceſſary Succour or Aſſiſtance. By all theſe things wilful Murther is committed; tho' the Will be indirect, it ceaſes not to be before God as great a Sin as a direct Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For the Life is taken away indirectly as well as dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly: And ſometimes it would be leſs evil to kill a Perſon at
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104476:161"/>
one Stroke, than to kill him by degrees; and the Sin alſo would ſometimes be leſs, by a Stroke given in a ſudden Paſſion, than when it laſts for ſo long a time; and theſe Sins are often repeated. Nevertheleſs none do perceive theſe kinds of Sins to be ſuch as they are; but the moſt ſpiritual fall into them thro' Negligence, and very often without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to know them: And thus while they do not repent of them, they cannot obtain Pardon no more than of the other Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe they are committed ſecretly, and without Repentance; which draws on a Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of Salvation, which is alſo one of thoſe Sins. This <hi>Deſpair of Salvation</hi> is ordinarily excited by the Devil at the End of their Life. When he he has train'd up Souls in the other Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt he diſcovers them to them at Death to make them fall into Deſpair of their Salvation: For then their Eyes being open'd to conſider the great Number of Sins which they have committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, all the Days of their Life, of which they have never repented, and how often they have receiv'd the Sacraments in this evil State: This makes them fall into a Deſpair of being ſaved, becauſe the Soul is diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and cannot perceive the Means of its Salvation: Yea, tho' they ſhould not diſtinctly perceive all thoſe Sins, they are notwithſtanding in ſuch Confuſion and Perplexity that they durſt not hope for Salvation, and they would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to declare their Miſery to Men, who ſtill held them for good Men. Hence it is that theſe Souls die without Repentance, which is the Conſummation of all their Evils: For by the ſtraight Righteouſneſs of God no Sins will ever be pardoned without Repentance; and they, not embracing this, die miſerably, tho' they have lived in a ſeeming Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they go notwithſtanding to receive their Portion with Devils; even tho' they had but one of theſe Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt, they ſhall never be ſaved.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That I began to doubt of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Men, ſince they who are called Saints do ſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly periſh: That theſe Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt were ſo much to be dreaded, and nevertheleſs ſo few are afraid of them; that God's Judgment of things is quite different from that of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Yes, truly Sir, God's Judgment is quite another thing than Man's: <note n="l" place="bottom">Luke 16. 15.</note> For moſt frequently what they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem<note place="bottom">(k) Iſ. 55. 8, 9.</note>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:104476:162"/>
Good is in God's fight very bad. This is ſince they left his Righteouſneſs and lean'd to their own. They are now uncapable of making a right Judgment; becauſe their own Righteouſneſs is blind, and founded only on their own Imaginations, and not at all on the Truth, which could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deceive them: For it is unchangeable, and without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation; but the Truth and Righteouſneſs of Men is lying and deceitful, and he who truſts in it, muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity periſh; becauſe it flatters us to our Perdition. If we had continued in the Righteouſneſs of God, our Judgment would have been conformable to his: But ſince we are fallen into Unrighteouſneſs, we judge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſly, both in reſpect of God and of our ſelves: For we judge falſely of God on all Occaſions, attributing very often to him the Blame of our Damnation, and of all the other Evils which befall us: Tho' not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding no Evil can come from God, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fountain of all Good, to which all Evils are oppoſite: We may alſo judge amiſs as to our ſelves, believing often our Salvation to be ſure, when it is in great Hazard as you may ſee by the Deduction of the Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt, of which I have ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſpoken to you, to let you ſee, Sir, how the moſt Pious are deceived, ſince they ſtrayed from the Righteouſneſs and the Truth of God, they are full of frivolous Devotions, which blind their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that they know not real Truth, nor ſolid Vertue, but amuſing themſelves with the Diſcourſes of Men, and ſeeming Vertues, they live and die in a Preſumption of their Salvation, without good Works, and thus they periſh for ever.</p>

                  <hi>Theſe laſt Words made me tremble, being joyned to thoſe ſhe had ſaid before; that there was not ſo much as one Man in the World who was reſigned to God. I asked her how it was poſſible that God ſhould create all Men to be damn'd?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, God hath created no body to be damn'd; <note n="i" place="bottom">1 Tim. 2. 4, 5.</note> but all Men for Salvation: For God can damn no body. It muſt needs ſtill be that Man damns himſelf of his own Free-Will; otherwiſe God ſhou'd do an evil thing, which he cannot do, but does all good. This being ſo, Sir, you muſt ask Men, each one in particular, <hi>how is it poſſible that they damn themſelves?</hi> But you muſt not ask God, how is it poſſible that each one is damn'd? For he wou'd anſwer, it is <note n="k" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 36. Wiſd, 1. 16.</note> becauſe they'll be ſo of their own Free-Will; which ſhall never be taken from them. Every one damn us himſelf, for his own particular, and all theſe particular Damnations being put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, make this general Damnation, which God cannot hinder: <note n="l" place="bottom">Matth. 23. 27.</note> For he cannot ſave ſo much as one Soul without the Conſent of the Free-Will which he has once given it; letting each one enjoy this Free-Will without any Conſtraint; all Men in particular are free to damn themſelves, as they do; becauſe they will not reſign themſelves to the Will of God, which Reſignation wou'd aſſuredly ſave them, rendring them happy both in this World, and the other. But ſince we will not continue in a Dependence on God, but will follow and depend on our own Wills, we render our ſelves miſerable, both in this World, and to all Eternity. The Sins of our firſt Parents ought to have made us wiſe: For by forſaking this Dependence, they brought on themſelves all ſorts of Miſeries; and we not ſatisfied to groan yet under theſe by participation, do daily encreaſe them by our own proper Reſolution, that we will not be rul'd and govern'd by the ſame God, who demands of us the ſame Dependence which he demanded of thoſe our firſt Parents; which we do conſtantly deny him, and will needs depend on our own Will, and follow it as much as we can, without informing our ſelves of the Will of God. Now every one doing this as to his own particular, is it a Wonder that all in general pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ſince none in particular will reſign himſelf to the Will of God, without which no body ſhall be ſaved?</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:104476:164"/>
               <p>I ask'd, <hi>If God could have created ſo beautiful a World, with all that is within it, only for Men, who will damn themſelves ſince all in general will needs depend on their own Wills, and that no Perſon in the World is reſigned to the Will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> God has not created this beautiful World, Sir, for theſe Men who ſhall be reprobated, but for the Elect only; and thoſe who of their free Choice and Free-Will ſhall depend entirely on God, and be ruled and governed wholly at his Pleaſure, renouncing altogether their own Will and Deſires <note n="m" place="bottom">Pſ. 37.</note> Theſe ſhall enjoy to all Eternity this beautiful World, with all that is within it, in all Perfection, as I have already told you, Sir, the World ſhall laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and none of the Works of God ſhall ever periſh; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men, nor Beaſts, nor any other Creatures; but each of them in their kind, ſhall remain for ever for the Honour of God and the Delight of Men who ſhall live after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of all Evil.</p>
               <p>But if the Men who live now, will not reſign themſelves to the Will of God, but follow that of the Devil or their own: Theſe ſhall not poſſeſs the World, but ſhall only ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ in it for a little time, and they ſhall go out of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out carrying any thing away but the Sins with which they have loaded themſelves during ſo ſhort a Voyage: But all that is beautiful and good in the World, ſhall remain for the Elect <note n="n" place="bottom">Rev. 21. 7. Iſ. 60. 21. 65. 9,—25.</note>, who ſhall enjoy it to all Eternity. For if this were not, we ſhou'd have indeed a mean God, who had created the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, all the Elements, ſo many different Creatures as there are in the World, and all this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Devil, and for Men who will damn themſelves, as they do at preſent. It wou'd follow that God ſhou'd have little Power to be thus fruſtrated of his Pretenſions, in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing created ſo many excellent things, if they ſhou'd ſerve only for the Uſe of the Reprobate, and the Devil ſhou'd carry away all the Fruits of the ſix Days Labours which he did in creating this beautiful World, if all this ſhou'd be for the Devil and his Adherents! No, no, Sir, this cannot go ſo. God muſt have his time to reign over all his Creatures, that they may adore and know him the only true God, and that the Number of his Elect may be multiplied, as much as he has deſtin'd them; that theſe never dying, may bleſs him to all Eternity. This is the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104476:164"/>
I wait for, Sir, with Chearfulneſs. Nothing can afflict me in this Hope. It is a joyful Life to think on it, what Joy muſt it be to poſſeſs it?</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That theſe Words did raviſh me with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but that I had alſo in Exchange the Grief to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that all Men now are in a State of Damnation, for fear leſt I alſo be of the Number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She replied;</hi> You may indeed rejoice, Sir, 'Tis the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Ground of Joy that we can ever have. 'Tis the Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece of all the Works of God, and <note n="o" place="bottom">Rev. 21. 6.</note> the Accompliſhment of all things. For this the World is created, for this Man is created, and for this God is become Man. The Coming of Jeſus Chriſt in Sufferings, was for Sinners; but his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Coming will be for the Righteous. Therefore he ſays, being in the World, <note n="p" place="bottom">Matth. 9. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>I am not come to ſave the Righteous, but to bring Sinners to Repentance.</hi> God from all Eternity deſign'd to become Man, to the end he might not only make Man like to him, but that God alſo might be like to Man, that he might take his perfect and compleat Delight with him. 'Tis good to conſider this, Sir, that God is not become Man, only on deſign to ſuffer and to die: For this would have been a ſad Subject; and the ancient Patriarchs wou'd have had little Ground to have prayed and deſired ſo earneſtly that God ſhould become Man to ſee him hardly uſed, ſuffering Reproaches, Scourges, and ſo cruel a Death. The Love they bare to God wou'd rather have made them deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their Captivity, than to be delivered from it at ſo dear a Price as the Sufferings and the Death of God-Man. All thoſe Wiſhes and Aſpirations which all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Prophets of the ancient Law made, cou'd not be for this Coming in Sufferings; but rather that glorious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein Jeſus Chriſt <note n="q" place="bottom">Joſ. 12. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>being lifted up, will draw all Men unto him;</hi> which his Death on the Croſs has not done, becauſe very few followed him then, and no body follows him at preſent. This is very far from drawing all to him, ſeeing ſo few have been drawn from the Beginning of the World even till now. Muſt there not a Time come wherein that he may fulfil his Word, he will draw all in general to him? Muſt he not alſo to make the ſame Accompliſhment <note n="r" place="bottom">John 1. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>take away the Sins of the World?</hi> For his Death, inſtead of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104476:165"/>
taking away the Sins of the World, has rather brought on more; becauſe they have encreas'd and multiply'd ſince. Can God fail in his Promiſe? Muſt there not come a time when he will take away all the Sins of the World? If this were not, God ſhou'd not be faithful in his Promiſes; which cannot be true: For <note n="s" place="bottom">Matth. 24. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away, but his Promiſes ſhall not paſs away.</hi> There is not a Syllable of them which ſhall not have its entire Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in an altogether perfect Sence. They wou'd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make us believe that all this ſhall be fulfilled in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; and they tell us that nothing defiled can enter there: How then ſhall there be Sins there to be taken away? And if all the Bleſſed are united to him, there will be no more need of drawing them.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That I was ſo convinced, as to believe that we muſt look for a new World and a new Earth, and that I knew well enough that nothing of the holy Scripture ſhall have its Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment in this World; but that I was not freed from the Trouble of believing that all Men now were in a State of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, of which Number I was one, tho' nevertheleſs I deſired to be ſaved, whatever it coſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, to diſcover Truths, you muſt always take things in their Source. Conſider, I pray you, that the Coming of Jeſus Chriſt in Sufferings, was for no other Grounds but to make known to Men their Sins. in which they liv'd ſo blindly that the moſt Part knew not what they did, but followed one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother inſenſibly in the Way of Perdition, as they do yet at preſent, God of his great Mercy wou'd have become Man before his Coming in Glory, that he might bring Light to Sinners, whereby they might know their Sins, and to teach them in particular what they ought to do and avoid, to the end they may obſerve the Law of God, which he came not to change nor aboliſh, no more than to give a new one; but only to teach the Means by which Men ſhou'd eaſily attain to the obſerving of this Law of God, which was given from the Beginning of the World, and will never be changed: For God will never demand any other thing of Men but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, which they ought always to acknowledge, they have on their God, who has created them and given them all things. In the Practice of this Dependence is contain'd all the Law and the Prophets, and the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104476:165"/>
They can have no other thing in Subſtance: But Men being fallen from the obſerving of this firſt Law, have need from time to time of divers Means to raiſe them again from their Fall. For theſe ends Jeſus Chriſt is come into the World timouſly, and ere it periſh, before his limited time; that tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Humane Fleſh, he might teach Men palpably, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Senſes, to the end they might not be any more ignorant of any thing, but might get out of Darkneſs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Sins, and ſee clearly the Way they ought to take, to come to Salvation. And that thoſe Means which Jeſus Chriſt came to teach them, might not ſeem too grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and difficult to them, he wou'd needs pave the Way himſelf, and put them in practice all the time he was on Earth, to the end Men might afterwards follow his Steps <note n="t" place="bottom">1 Pet. 2. 21.</note>, and imitate his Example. By this Foundation, Sir, you can eaſily diſcover whether all Men be in the Way of Salvation or Damnation. Lay this down firſt, that <note n="u" place="bottom">Marth. 7. 21.</note> no body ſhall be ſaved but he who keeps the Law of God. Secondly, that Men thro' their Frailty, cannot obſerve this Law but by ſuch Means as Jeſus Chriſt has taught them <note n="x" place="bottom">Rom. 8. 3.</note>; becauſe they imagine that they live in a Dependence upon God, when they do but depend on their own Wills. To make this known, Jeſus Chriſt teaches them, that to be his, <note n="y" place="bottom">Matth. 16. 24.</note> they muſt deny themſelves. Not that this Law of denying ones ſelf, was ordain'd in theſe preciſe Words in the Beginning of the World, but it was tacitly contain'd in the Law of <hi>LOVING ONE GOD ONLY;</hi> becauſe we cannot love him only, when we love our ſelves; and whereas Men did not underſtand well the Contents of this Law, Jeſus Chriſt is come to explain it to us ſo particularly by all the Precepts of his Goſpel, that no body can be ignorant any longer, how he ought to keep the Law of God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, work out his Salvation; becauſe this Goſpel Law does preciſely mark out to us all that we ought to do and to avoid: So that we muſt not look any longer from any, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from God nor Men, for other Inſtructions in order to our Salvation; becauſe Jeſus Chriſt has omitted nothing, nor ſaid any thing that is ſuperfluous, but ſhewn us all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for obtaining eternal Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:104476:166"/>Now conſider, Sir, if you know any living this Day in the World who have entirely reſign'd their Wills to that of God, and who love no other thing but him. If you do not know any, be firmly perſuaded, that none within your Knowledge, is in a State of Salvation. And fearing leſt you be deceived by this general Perſuaſion, as many are, who perſuade themſelves that they are reſign'd to God, and love none but him; remark particularly if they obſerve the Goſpel Law: For we cannot obſerve the one without practiſing the other: For he who has entirely reſign'd his Will to that of God, <note n="z" place="bottom">Gal. 2. 20.</note> lives no longer to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but God lives in him, and works there all that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt has taught; ſeeing the ſame Spirit lives in one reſign'd to God, which lived in the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. There can never be any difference here, being in both the ſame unchangeable God.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That this being ſuppoſed, I had good Ground to fear, that all the World was in a State of Damnation, and I likewiſe, but that I would get out of this Darkneſs and receive the Light that God ſhould give me, that I might follow him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, you'll be happy in doing it: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is to be feared, you may periſh with others; becauſe all the World goes on blindly to Perdition; <hi>but the Light</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">Iſ. 58. 10.</note>

                  <hi>to love your Darkneſs rather than the Light;</hi> but rather <note n="c" place="bottom">Joh. 12. 35, 36.</note> 
                  <hi>walk according to it while the Day doth laſt,</hi> that is to ſay, our ſhort Life, which is nothing but a Day in Compariſon with Eternity: The Night of this Day, is our Death, after which there is nothing more to do: In whatſoever <note n="d" place="bottom">Eccl. 11. 3.</note> State we die, we ſhall abide in it. Therefore we ought not to let the Occaſion ſlip that is now offered us. Let not your felf be gained by Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, nor by falſe Perſuaſions. Seek always the Truth: For they who flatter us, <note n="e" place="bottom">Iſ. 9. 15.</note> ruine us. Look on all thoſe as Flatterers, who ſpeak to you according to their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Inclinations, and hold thoſe for Deceivers who perſuade you that you are a good Chriſtian, and that you will be ſaved after the Way that you live at preſent: For there are no true Chriſtians but thoſe who follow and imitate
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104476:166"/>
the Life and Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt; and there is no Salvation to be hop'd for, but in keeping the Law of God. You muſt take up with theſe two Things, Sir, if you wou'd attain to Salvation, the Law of God and the Doctrine of Jeſus. The Holy Spirit, which is now come into the World, brings no new Law, nor new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of it; becauſe Jeſus Chriſt has ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained it: He comes only to make the Law appear <note n="f" place="bottom">John 16. 8.</note> and the Sins that are oppoſite to it, to the end that we may embrace the one and reject the other. You have wondred ſometimes that I told you ſo many evil Things of the Church and of ſpiritual Perſons: Believe me, this was not but by the Light of the Holy Spirit, that you might avoid the Evil in order to the doing well, ſince you cannot love the one without hating the other: Truth muſt always diſcern the one from the other, or otherwiſe you will be eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as all the World at preſent is, who take Vice for Vertue, and apparent for true good. Therefore receive the true Light, that you may judge uprightly, and not according to the Appearance of Things: For the Devil is ſo covered with Virtue, and cloathed with Hypocriſie, that he deceives even thoſe of the beſt Diſpoſitions. There are frequently ſo many falſe Goods in the World, that we do not diſtinguiſh them from the true: And that we may not come to diſcover them, he puts ſome Scruples in the Minds of good Men, that they may not believe the Truth of the Evil, and makes his Adherents teach, that 'tis a Sin of Detraction to diſcover the Faults of Prieſts, and of thoſe who make a Profeſſion of Vertue, that their Sins remaining ſecret, they may deceive the more, and may commit them more honourably; and they ſay, <hi>that a Man ſhould take his own Garments to cover the ſins of the Prieſts.</hi> That you may ſee that this Doctrine comes from the Devil, you need but mark what Jeſus Chriſt did in ſuch Encounters; whether he covered with his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the Sins of the Popes, Biſhops and Prieſts who were in his time. We will find <note n="g" place="bottom">Matth. 23. 8.</note> that he declared them open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before all the World, calling them <hi>Hypocrites, Generation of Vipers, wicked Sepulchres,</hi> and ſo many other Names, to the end he might declare to People their Wickedneſs, that they might beware of them: For he ſays, <note n="h" place="bottom">Mat. 16. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>beware of the Leaven of the Phariſees, and</hi>

                  <hi>Sheeps Cloathing, and inwardly are ravening Wolves.</hi> All this, with many other Evils, Jeſus Chriſt ſpoke of the Prieſts of his time; and now they teach that we muſt honour them and ſpeak well of them, tho' they live ill! Does not this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine oppoſe that of Jeſus Chriſt? and therefore it is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Nevertheleſs, you, Sir, with ſo many others, think you commit a Sin to hear the Truth of Evil. 'Tis by this falſe Piety, that the Devil takes his Advantage: For their Evils being conceal'd, they commit them more than if they were diſcovered; becauſe Shame and Humane Reſpect wou'd with-hold them from Sin; and alſo the Good and Pious wou'd not be ſo eaſily deceived, as they are by the good Opinion of Evil, which often draws in the Good by Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, who are perſuaded that they who have the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of being good, wou'd not do Evil. How many thouſand have been deceived after this manner! Take heed that you never be one of theſe; but ſtay yourſelf on the living Rock, which is Jeſus Chriſt. He cannot deceive nor fail. Take up with his Inſtructions, Sir, and follow them. You'll be ſure of your Salvation, which otherwiſe I cannot promiſe you. Whatever Men ſay, they are not our Saviours: For it is written, <note n="k" place="bottom">Jer. 1. 17, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Wo to the Man that put his Confidence in Man.</hi> He is truly miſerable who grounds his Salvation on the Words and Sentiments of Men, who can give us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vain Hopes, founded on their Imaginations. It is not enough to truſt to theſe weak Stays; we muſt take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aim, and direct our Selves towards that Morning Star which appears to our Eyes, that we may follow it till we have found this Holy Spirit who muſt teach us all things.</p>

                  <hi>the Holy Ghoſt; who ſhall teach us all things,</hi> had not its full Accompliſhment: For there were many things which the Apoſtles knew not; and there were alſo ſeveral Faults committed by them after having receiv'd the Holy Spirit. It is in theſe laſt times that the Holy Spirit comes, who ſhall teach us all things. If your Soul were wholy reſign'd to the Will of God, it wou'd be prepared to receive the Holy Spirit in Fulneſs: For his time is now come. Do you not even now feel ſome Rays of his Light by ſo many different things which I have told you in our ſo frequent Converſation; Do you not ſee that many of theſe things have not been known nor diſcovered in former times? Can you doubt that there is at preſent a <hi>Treaſure hid</hi> in the Earth, which begins to be diſcovered? From whence otherwiſe shou'd theſe precious Stones of the Kingdom of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, come, the ſo fragrant Roſes of true Vertue, and ſo many new Notices which appear in our Eyes as Buds of Paradiſe? Wou'd you have a Holy Spirit viſible and carnal? Men ſince the Apoſtles Days have more Underſtanding of ſpiritual things. Therefore God has multiplied their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and refin'd their Underſtandings, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Light of the Holy Spirit by lively Reaſons and ſolid Truths; not by material Forms and Figures, which were given only for outward Signs, capable of being ſeen by the Eyes of Fleſh, which did not yet perceive thoſe things of the Spirit: For the Holy Spirit not a Dove, nor Wind, nor Tongues of Fire; but an intelligible Spirit who makes us know God and our ſelves, and brings always along with him <note n="e" place="bottom">Galat. 5. 22.</note> his twelve Fruits, and his <note n="f" place="bottom">Iſa. 11. 12.</note> ſeven Gifts, all which are ſpiritual, and cannot be ſeen no more than their Author, but by their Operations. This is the Holy Spirit which you ought to deſire, Sir, and not a viſible and material one. Reſign your ſelf to God, and you ſhall certainly receive him: For his Time is come.

In one Word, all our Life is a conſtant Tract of Self-love; and yet we ſay we are reſign'd to God; and if this were true, we wou'd have no longer ſelf-will, but that of God wou'd be our Rule and our Contentment, as well in Troubles, Adverſities and Derelictions, as in all ſort of Proſperity and Abundance: For regarding nothing but the Will of God, we wou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all things with Joy: But as long as the one's too ſweet, and the other too ſalt to our Taſte, it's a ſign we yet live to our ſelves and are not reſign'd to God, nor ready to follow his Will, and ſo are not diſpos'd to receive the Holy Spirit, becauſe our ſelf-will hinders him: For he cannot operate in a Soul which is not diſengag'd from its own Will, which ſtill oppoſes the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> of the Holy Spirit, and directly hinders his Operations. It's thus that I ſay I know no body, yet who'll be reſign'd to the Will of God, except in Words but not in Deed. Indeed we wou'd do God's Will as long as 'tis conformable to ours; but as ſoon as it oppoſes that, there's no more Submiſſion. We give God our Will as long as all goes right according to our Deſires and Wiſhes; but as ſoon as the contrary falls out, we take back this giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Will to diſpoſe of it our ſelves: and thus we continue always full of ſelf-love, and yet we wou'd receive forſooth, the Holy Spirit to joyn him with our Filth and Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to make a very unſutable Marriage, as that wou'd be of God with Sin <note n="g" place="bottom">2 Cor. 6. 14, 15, 16.</note> which are two incompatible things, as Heat and Cold, which can never dwell together. Yea, truly tho' there were nothing but the Sin of ſelf-love, it is a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Wound, againſt the Commandment of loving one God alone.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How Man muſt reſign himſelf to God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Said to her; <hi>That I would very willingly reſign my ſelf to God, and yield myſelf to be entirely governed by him, and to follow all that I ſhall know to be his Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, this <hi>Reſignation</hi> has ſome <hi>Exception</hi> yet, and is not wholly diſengag'd: For if you wait till an Angel from Heaven come to make known to you what the Will of God is, you'll no ways be reſign'd to him; but you muſt take <note n="a" place="bottom">Joh 1. 11. 2. 10. Rom. 8. 27.</note> all that befalls you for his Will, great or ſmall things, all comes from him, without excepting any thing: For if you are reſign'd to him, you'll have no longer Deſires of your own, and will no longer ſeek any thing: Therefore all that ſhall befal you, ſhall come by his Order; when you take it from his Hand, you can never fail, even tho' it were the Devil himſelf <note n="b" place="bottom">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note> or ſome wicked Creature did it: he'll never permit them to hurt you <note n="c" place="bottom">Joh 1. 12. 2. 6.</note> but in ſo far as it ſhall be his Will. 'Tis true, a wicked Man has his Liberty, to do what Evil he pleaſes; but God has Power alſo to preſerve us that their Evils do not touch us: Or if he permit them to touch us, gives us Strength to <note n="d" place="bottom">Phil. 1. 29.</note> ſuffer them, and that with Joy; and ſo they can't wound us: For all worldly Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil are for the moſt part but imaginary things; and when our Mind is brought to take Afflictions joyfully, they ſeem to us Contentments, and no longer Afflictions. This depends ſo ſtrongly upon our Imagination, that our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Miſery ſeems to depend upon it. If we imagine that Riches are a Burden, Poverty will be a Repoſe to us. And thus it is of every other thing. Take confidently all that ſhall befal you for the Will of God; for otherwiſe that wou'd be but like a forc'd Reſignation which wou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to know preciſely on every Occaſion, if this were the Will of God or not. This Study or Application of Mind, is an Hindrance to a perfect Reſignation.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:104476:169"/>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That I would take all from God's Hand; and that I had often told her, that I yield my Will to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> 'Tis true, Sir, you have often ſaid it; but I doubt you have notdone it; becauſe I obſerve often yet Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in your Will. He that has gain'd a Place, does not fight againſt it any longer. Far better be a Conquerour than a Combatant. If your Will were given up to God, as you think, you wou'd not have it any longer: For a thing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> does not any longer belong to us. How cou'd your Will make Oppoſition then, if it truly belong'd to God? You cou'd not feel any Combats of that which you had not any longer: For if I had not a Hand, I could not ſuffer any Evil in it. We often ſay and think ſome Things that are not true. Reflect but a little ſeriouſly, Sir, upon all your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſee if you'll not find that they are done by your own Will; Yea, even your own pious Exerciſes. Conſider a little if it wou'd not be a trouble to you to change or leave them by reaſon of ſome Accident which God ſhou'd permit to befal you. This is a Sign that they proceed from your own Will: For if they did proceed from the Will of God the abſtaining from them wou'd be as agreeable to you as the doing of them: For there is little on Earth, the Want of which does not give as much Honour to God as the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it; and a Will reſign'd to God, does no longer feel Self-contradiction: So that if ſuch a Soul were depriv'd of all ſort of Spiritual and Chriſtian Exerciſes by ſome Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of War, Sickneſs or other Inconveniencies, which might happen, 'twou'd not ſo much as regret that it cou'd not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them; becauſe God's Will wou'd be more dear to it than all the Contentment it might receive in the Performance of all its pious Duties: Yea, it wou'd think it ſelf in a more happy State; becauſe the Practices of Vertue brings along with them ſome Self-ſatisfactions and Pleaſures, which leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens their Merits: For having receiv'd a Recompence in this World, we ought not to look for it in the other. Thus, Sir, you may ſee and obſerve, if it be true that you are reſign'd to God, not only in Spiritual things, but in all temporal Affairs. I believe you will not find one that is delivered from Self-Love or natural Inclinations.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her; <hi>How I could perfectly make this entire Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God without ever revoking it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, reſign your ſelf to God in ſuch a manner as that you no longer follow your own Will in any thing: For <note n="e" place="bottom">Matth. 25. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>He who is faithful in a few things, will be ſet over great</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:104476:169"/>
                  <hi>things.</hi> Every Moment, and on all Occaſions, you may make a Sacrifice of your own Will: For it acts always. It will ſee, hear, walk, and do many other things that are not needful, and always for the Glory of God. In all this, you muſt deny it the Satisfaction of executing theſe ſort of Wills, which are unprofitable, and robb us of our time, that is ſo dear and precious: And if we muſt <hi>render</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="bottom">Matth 12. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>an Account of every idle Word,</hi> much more of idle Actions: And it ſhou'd never be ſaid that <note n="g" place="bottom">Matth. 10. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>theſe are but ſmall things:</hi> For God takes notice of ſmall things, ſince he ſays, that (<hi>h</hi>) <hi>the Hairs of our Head are numbered,</hi> and that the Leaf of a Tree ſhall not fall without his Permiſſion. It is becauſe God has given us this limited Time to do Penitence in, that he will exact an Account of it from us, even to a Moment, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear wherein we employ it; and if we employ it in unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Actions, according to our own Will, we are certainly to blame; becauſe we do not accompliſh the Penitence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd us, and we apply the time allotted for it, in idle and unprofitable Actions. We ought, Sir, on this Occaſion, to deny our Will by way of Penitence, and to remember that we have given it to God, and that we our ſelves ought not any longer to diſpoſe of it; and by combating it thus, we ſhall certainly overcome it: For our Will is like a Horſe, which the Bridle turns whither we would lead him. If we yield it up to the good Will of God, we muſt conſtrain it to follow him in ſmall things as well as great, or otherwiſe it will endeavour to eſcape in Perils and Dangers, and from unprofitable things will fall into evil things. The beſt Curb is to put the Reins into God's Hands, that he may guide as it ſhall ſeem good to him, and never take them back again; becauſe we our ſelves have not enough of Wiſdom and Force to govern it: But he alone muſt guide it to its bleſſed End.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>How I might accompliſh my Penitence, and how I might put in practice this Reſignation to God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, we muſt chuſe no other Penance but that which God gives us. When we endure the Cold, and Heat, the Hunger, Thirſt, Wearineſs, Infirmities, and Diſeaſes, that it pleaſes God to ſend us, we muſt ſuffer them in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Penitence; becauſe all wou'd not come upon us if it were not for Penance for Sin: For before it nothing troubled
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104476:170"/>
us. All our Miſeries and Corruptions come by Sin, even the Vermine of our Body, the Lice, and all the other Beaſts engendered by Corruption, are produc'd by Sin; and therefore we muſt ſuffer them willingly, ſince this is the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which God has in Juſtice permitted to befal us inſtead of the Puniſhments due to our Sins. We ought not to invent Penances according to our Fancy, ſince God has enjoyn'd thoſe which he thinks fit, that is, to gain our Bread with the Sweat of our Face <note n="i" place="bottom">Gen 3. 16.</note>: ſo that all our Travels, Pains, and Labours, both of Body and Mind, are all fatisfactory Penances enjoyn'd us by God himſelf: But the Penances choſen after our Fancy, are often invented by the Devil, who wou'd thereby drive us headlong, or at leaſt excite us to vain Glory; becauſe ordinarily thoſe who faſt or wear Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, are chagrin and preſumptuous, believing themſelves to be better than others, and that God is oblig'd to them for their good Works, as the <hi>Phariſee</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="bottom">Luke 18. 11.</note> who thanked God for his Righteouſneſs. All this proceeds from Self-love: But true Penitence conſiſts in taking patiently whatſoever God permits to befal us, either to our Body, Eſtate or Mind, and willingly to ſuffer it in the Spirit of Penitence, to ſatisfie for our Sins. This is the true Practice of the <hi>RESIGNA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION</hi> of our Will to God: For every Moment there falls out Occaſions of Suffering and Submiſſion; ſo that we need not ſeek for them. It is only neceſſary that we practiſe this Reſignation of our Will to God for accompliſhing the ſaving Penitence which he has enjoyn'd us, and for the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all ſort of Vertues: For as ſoon as God ſhall be Maſter of our Will, he'll lead it to all good: ſo that we ſhall do no longer Evil, even in temporal things: For God will govern all with his Spirit of <hi>Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth,</hi> which can never fail in any thing. <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> doing good to all and evil to none. Truth giving Light to diſcern all things and ſo to bring all to a good End. If you reſolve, Sir, truly to reſign your ſelf to God, you ſhall enjoy all this Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; but as long as you act by your own Will, you'll ſpoil all, and ſhall not be ſaved.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That this Way was ſo ſtreight, that one would be afraid to paſs through it; and that it would make one afraid that he could not be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:104476:170"/>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> This Way is only a little ſtreight at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but as ſoon as one has forc'd himſelf to depart from his own Will, 'tis then ſo large, free and pleaſant, that there can he nothing more agreeable: For the Soul which has reſign'd its Will to God, lives <note n="l" place="bottom">Pſ. 36. 37, 5.</note> like a Child, without Care: and tho' Heaven and Earth ſhou'd be overturned, ſhe is ſtill in Repoſe, and without Fear, knowing well that God who governs her, is able to preſerve her through all: She ſeeks no longer after any thing, knowing well that her God will ſtill provide for her; <note n="m" place="bottom">Pſ. 72. 73. 75.</note> She has no more Deſire after any thing; for ſhe finds in God a Satiety and perfect Satisfaction: She places her Hope no longer in any thing but the Promiſes of God. In ſhort, Sir, this is a Life whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delightful and pleaſant, full of ſolid Contentment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is not founded upon the Levity of Chances, or Changes of Men, but upon a permanent Stability: Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Life of one who is governed after his own Will is very miſerable, and he walks continually upon the Briars and Thorns with which it is ſown: So that a Soul ſubject to to its own Paſſions furniſh him with a kind of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom. How many Vexations and Cares are there to ſatisfie this Self-will which often is unſatiable? The more 'tis ſatisfied, the leſs 'tis contented. How often does our Self-will throw us into irreparable Miſchiefs? It's ignorant, inconſtant, inſolent, haſty and enclin'd to all ſort of Evil; ſo that he who follows it, is oblig'd to lead a miſerable Life and to end it in an unhappy Death. It ſeems, Sir, you are, afraid yet of reſigning your ſelf to God, as if this Reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation were a ſtreight Way, and troubleſome Life! when you ſee by ſo many Truths, that 'tis ſo ſweet and agreeable: and on the contrary, that which ſeems ſo pleaſant to you, is ſo painful and dangerous. All the Difficulty that you'll find to make this Reſignation, is no other thing but a Shadow which appears ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and in Effect is nothing As ſoon as you ſhall turn away your Eyes from your ſelf, to look towards God, this Shadow of Apprehenſion will vaniſh, and you ſhall ſee it no more.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That I was not ſo much afraid of reſigning my ſelf to God: For I wou'd willingly do it, but that in ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters ſhe had given me Occaſion to doubt of my Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:104476:171"/>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, do you love flattering Diſcourſes more than the Truth? If it be ſo, you may retire from me: For I am ſettled in the Truth, and I have no deſire to depart from it. I can make no Reflection whether it pleaſes or diſpleaſes my Hearers; but I am reſolved ſtill to obſerve it, tho' it wou'd coſt me my Life: For he who forſakes the Truth, forſakes God, which I will never do. I love rather to loſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of all the Men of the World, than to omit the Truth when I am oblig'd to ſpeak it: But ſetting aſide this Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I can very well hold my Peace; becauſe Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid, <hi>that Pearls ſhould not be caſt before Swine.</hi> If the Truths that I have told you beget Scruple in you, 'tis a ſign that you are not reſolved to be ſav'd: For otherwiſe you wou'd greatly rejoyce to underſtand the Truth. Thoſe who are called <note n="n" place="bottom">Matth. 7. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Swine</hi> in the Goſpel, are Men who make a Dunghil of the Roſes of true Vertue, or of the Pearls of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. Thoſe hidden Secrets are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones; and he makes a Dunghil of them who ſays that they are imaginary or contriv'd things, or Hereſies. All theſe Sentiments make a Dunghil of the Pearls which are preſented to them, and according to the Counſel of Jeſus Chriſt, they ought not to be told to ſuch, but to thoſe who value them as they merit. And when yor tell me that I give you occaſion to doubt of your Salvation, by ſpeaking of true and ſolid Vertue; it ſeems you wou'd alſo make a Dunghil of its Roſes. I have told you the Truth, <hi>That no body ſhall be ſaved but he who of his free Reſolution, reſigns his Will to God's, and denys his own.</hi> You need not therefore doubt of your Salvation, if ſo be you will do this, Sir; but if you will not, doubt confidently of your Salvation: For you ſhall never obtain it. This Doubting is good if thereby you take a Reſolution to ſearch for the means of your Converſion: For <note n="o" place="bottom">Prov. 1. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>the Fear of God is the Beginning of true Wiſdom.</hi> If you be not in Fear as to your Salvation, you will preſume of it, and therefore will be ſure of your Damnation: Becauſe he who preſumes to have it, uſes no Endeavours to obtain it, but dies in a Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Therefore it is a great Advantage that I have made you doubt of your Salvation, ſince this Doubt will certainly lead you to Salvation.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:104476:171"/>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That I deſired indeed to have the Fear of God, and of my Salvation; but that I ſaw my ſelf ſo far from this perfect Reſignation, that it ſeem'd to me I could never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, that is nothing but a panick Fear; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no Ground to fear what we wou'd willingly do. If you have been reſolved in it for ſo long a time paſt, ſuffer not the Devil to tempt you now: For there is no more Difficulty at preſent than the firſt Day you had the Will to do it. Be not carried away by imaginary things which are nothing but Amuſements. Fix on the Reality of the thing. You perceive clearly that you have a Free. Will and Choice and that by this you act in all things. It is by it you go from one Place to another: It is it that deſires to ſee and hear: It makes you covet or pretend to Wealth, Places, or Honours: It is it alſo that deſires Pleaſures and Proſperities: It is it likewiſe that wou'd rule over others, and cannot ſuffer from any: It is it that deſires its Eaſe and Repoſe with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things for our Advantage: It is always our ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, that Works in us without ceaſing. This being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, there is nothing more to be done, but to interdict and forbid it theſe Operations, to the end it may let God work <note n="p" place="bottom">Heb. 13. 21.</note> alone in us what it ſhall pleaſe him; and then there will be nothing more to fear: For when we ſhall attain to this ſo much deſired Reſignation, there is nothing more to be feared: For God who will rule us, will give us all things. Does this ſeem difficult to you, Sir, that you doubt you cannot attain to it? There is nothing to do here, but to ceaſe: For God does then all in us. There is nothing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary but to reſt: For this Reſignation conſiſts not in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but in Omiſſions. The Practice of it is ſo ſweet that there's nothing more deſirable. All conſiſts in taking care not to let our own Will act: And ſo often as we perceive that it is enclin'd to any thing to Bridle it, and to ſay to it, <hi>Ceaſe; for God only ought to move thee.</hi> Is not this a ſweet Exerciſe, upon which notwithſtanding our Salvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends? For if it depended upon wearing Sackcloth, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcipline to our ſelves, Faſting, Watching, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther troubleſome things, we wou'd have ground to ſay and to fear that we cou'd not attain to it: but when we muſt only reſign our Will to God, no body can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelf, without Hazard of periſhing.</p>

                  <p>Of diſcerning the Motions of God from thoſe of Nature, wich muſt be done by Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth, which are three divine Qualities, according to which, all our Motions and all our Actions ought be regulated with great Care.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I <hi>Ask'd her, how I might know when my own Will acted, that I might make it ceaſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, as often as it is led to any thing that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or very unprofitable, it is certainly always our ſelf-will: Becauſe God cannot encline it to ſuch things: And when we ſeek our Honour, Pleaſure or Profit, this alſo proceeds from our ſelf-will: For God will never give any ſuch Deſires. Indeed he permits them ſometimes to befal us; but he will never make us ſeek or deſire them. Therefore if we have a ſerious Application of Spirit, we will remark preſently if it be God or our ſelf-will that acts in us: For God can never move it but to good, or neceſſary things; and will never make our Will act but what ſhall be for his Glory, or for the ſaving Good of our Neighbour. Nothing elſe can come from God, but from our ſelf-will, which is wholly deprav'd, and ought never to do any thing for it ſelf; for it ſpoils all. It were better to make it ceaſe without any more ado than to let it act alone and without God: Becauſe we preſume often that we have done many good Works, which <note n="a" place="bottom">Luk. 18. 14.</note> will be found to be evil and condemned by God: becauſe our ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will was corrupted from the Beginning of the World in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and is yet more corrupted by our own actual Sins: ſo that it is not capable of moving it ſelf but to Evil, and not at all to Good. This may be very eaſily obſerved: For we feel always in our ſelves ſome Inclination to do Evil: And
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:104476:172"/>
if it were not reſtrain'd or bridled by Reaſon or Vertue, we wou'd do nothing without Sin, or which did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>avour of its Corruption: For if we ſpeak, it will be ſtill with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to augment what is for our Liking or Advantage, or to excuſe our Faults: ſo that naturally, we wou'd never abide in the ſtreight Truth: And if we converſe or do Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with our Neighbour, it will be ſtill with a Spirit of Covetouſneſs, either of Wealth, Honour or Pleaſure: ſo that all our own Bents and Inclinations are carried always to Evil, unleſs we be habituated by Vertue or good Breeding, not to follow Lying, Rapine or Deceit, nor the Spirit of Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>By what means I might diſcover if it be God that moves my Will in all my daily Actions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, there are certain Marks whereby to know when theſe Motions come from God; becauſe they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompanied with <hi>Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> which Qualities are ſtill inſeparable from God's Spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Therefore when we feel our ſelves moved to undertake any thing whatſoever, we muſt always bend our Mind to remark our Undertaking 'ere we begin it, and ſee if it reſpect the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, or the ſaving Good of our Neighbour: And if ſo, we may perſue our Undertaking; but by means that are juſt, good and true: For elſe we may be yet miſtaken, thinking that it was for the Glory of God, and the Good of our Neighbour, when it was only our own Will and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. For a Motion that comes from God, is ſtill accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth; and if we muſt lye or be unjuſt, or hurt our Neighbour that we may attain to our Pretenſions, however they may be good in themſelves, yet nevertheleſs they are not of God. That we may follow the Motions of God, we muſt always obſerve this Rule, to remark in all our Actions, whether ſmall or great, if they are accompanied with Righteouſneſs, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Truth: And if all theſe together are not to be found in them, we muſt ſtill reject them as evil things, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by our ſelf-will: For God will never move to any
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104476:173"/>
thing how ſmall ſoever it be if it be not juſt, good and true. This is the true Touch-ſtone whereby to diſcover when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions come from God: We need not conſult Oracles, but examine well if our Works be diſintereſſed from all our own Advantages, and if they be juſt, good and true.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>If my ſelf-will might not mingle with the Divine Motions?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Yes, Sir, our ſelf-will does very readily mingle with the Motions from God. By this many Saints have committed great Faults. This falls out when we arenot whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſengaged from our ſelves, and Nature does yet live with Grace: Notwithſtanding it is eaſie to diſcover it when we are not precipitate in any thing, and when we take time to examine narrowly what we do, to ſee if it be juſt, and good and true. Then there's nothing to be fear'd whether our own will mingle there or not. It's God always is juſt, good and true. Our Nature being transform'd in him, does the ſame Functions of Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <note n="c" place="bottom">Gal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>It is no longer I that live, but Jeſus Chriſt lives in me:</hi> becauſe the Soul which is reſigned to God, does ſo habituate it ſelf to his Will, that it always becomes one <note n="d" place="bottom">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> and the ſame thing with it: ſo that its own Will, being purged from it ſelf, moves no longer but by God: So that the Motions of the Soul and thoſe of God become the ſame thing, and they can no longer be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; becauſe the Soul cannot now do any thing but what is juſt, good and true, unleſs it ſhould depart from its Union with God, and during this Straying ſhould follow its own Will: In this caſe it may do amiſs, and not otherwiſe: But for you, Sir, you are not yet habituated to this Union; exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſtill whether what you think, ſpeak or do, be <hi>juſt, good</hi> and <hi>true.</hi> With this you cannot be miſtaken, even tho' yourown Inclination ſhou'd incite you to do things which have thoſe three Qualities of God: They are always of him, tho' the Devil himſelf ſhou'd move them; becauſe there is nothing juſt, good and true which is not of God; becauſe he only is juſt, only good and only true: And by theſe Marks you will certainly diſcern your own Motions from thoſe of God; and even tho' they were but mingled with them, there wou'd ſtill be ſomething evil, or unjuſt, or untrue, and then you muſt purge your Works from this Malignity, or elſe omit them altogether.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:104476:173"/>
               <p>I told her, <hi>That I had yet one Doubt; that is, whether I ought to do or omit the Works in which I perceived not preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe three Qualities, of Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth; whether the Works were indifferent or neceſſary, or out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, you ought to do all neceſſary Works when they cannot be eaſily done by others; And for thoſe which are indifferent, to do them, is but to loſe time. They muſt either be unprofitable or have ſome end. If this end does not reſpect the Glory of God, take good heed of miſ-ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, which is ſo precious. Never be perſuaded of this Indifference; becauſe under that Name we often do evil things without being aware of it. We can never do indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, except very ſubtilly, before we reflect upon what we are doing: For otherwiſe all our Actions, how ſmall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, have ſome Scope at which they aim: And as for Works of Complaiſance, they are forbidden by Jeſus Chriſt, when he ſays, <note n="e" place="bottom">Gal. 1. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>that he who ſeeks to pleaſe Men, is not the Servant of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> unleſs your Complaiſance aim at ſome good or neceſſary End: Otherwiſe every Deed of Complaiſance is vain and evil. Reſolve, Sir, to do thoſe things only, which have the Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth of God: For all others are to be ſuſpected, and bring no Glory to God, nor ſaving Good to our Neighbour; and ſeeing you wou'd follow Jeſus Chriſt <note n="f" place="bottom">Col. 3. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeek thoſe things which are above, and not thoſe which are upon the Earth,</hi> which muſt very quickly periſh. It is better <note n="g" place="bottom">Matth. 6. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>to lay up Treaſures for Heaven, where the Ruſt does not corrupt:</hi> For tho' you ſhou'd gain herethe Friendſhip of all the Men of the World by your Works of Complaiſance, they cannot give you any thing. One Degree of the Glory of God is of more worth than ten thouſand Worlds. Endeavour, Sir, to labour for this, or be ſtill. Make no more fruitleſs Labour: For all that is not of God, is nothing, and God alone is all permanent Good.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That I had not made this ſerious Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to remark if all my Actions were accompanied with Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth, but that I did them often without thinking on any thing, if I did not remark in them any of my own Wickedneſs.</hi>

                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, you do therefore commit many Faults, both in reſpect of this preſent World, and that to come. For by proceeding inconſiderately, it is certain you act only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Motions of Nature, which being corrupted, can do nothing that's good. After this manner, your good A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are but humane, and will end with you: this is a very prejudicial Ignorance not to know that all the Works which we do naturally, ſhall not be rewarded before God, and that all their Reward is received in this World. Many Perſons have done many ſuch good Works who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhall never be ſav'd: And even tho' they ſhou'd <note n="h" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13. 3.</note> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Martyrdom by natural Motions, this wou'd profit them nothing; becauſe to partake of Eternal Life, all muſt have the Righteouſneſs of God: For finite things cannot come to be infinite. Now all our Works which do not partake of God, are finite, and cannot reach Eternity; becauſe they have not theſe Eternal Ends, but Natural or Temporal ones. In this many do greatly deceivethemſelves, looking for Salvation by Works ſimply Humane or Natural, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all Works are good when they are not accompanied with our deſigned Malice. It's thus before Men who judge only according to the Reach of their ſhort Sight: But the clear-ſeeing Eyes of God do judge according to Eternal Truth and Righteouſneſs. Therefore we muſt endeavour to do our Actions according to theſe, elſe we ſhall remain empty-handed at Death. It's not enough that we ceaſe to do evil: we muſt alſo do well, or otherwiſe we ſhall fall into the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is a Preſumption of being ſaved without good Works; and none can be called <hi>good;</hi> if they bear not the <hi>Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of God. His Righteouſneſs does every juſt thing, both as to our ſelves and our Neighbour. His Goodneſs does good to all and evil to none. His Truth is always ſtreight and ſingle; and when our Actions are not accompanied with theſe three Conditions, they don't proceed from God but from our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the Suggeſtions of the Devil, who willingly covers his moſt ſubtil Temptations with ſeeming Good that he may make every one believe they ſhall be ſaved without good Works, by making them eſteem their Natural and Temporary Works to be good.</p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:104476:174"/>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>I ſhould have great Difficulty to apply my ſelf ſo as to remark always whether my Actions had theſe three Qualities, and if they were only divine Motions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, if you do not this, you'll loſe all your Reward, and will alſo occaſion the Damnation of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, while you think you are doing good Works. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; you ſee ſome one in Want: Your Nature is mov'd with Compaſſion towards him: Without more Reflection you give him of your Goods, either what is ſuperfluous, or even what you need your ſelf; and you believe you do a Work of Charity. Nevertheleſs it may be ill done: For if you don't conſider from whence the Poverty of that Man proceeds, you'll often occaſion his Condemnation: For your Gifts may ſerve him for means to offend God; as, if he be enclined to drink, your Alms will lead him to new Acts of Drunkenneſs; or if he have a proud and haughty Heart, by your Gift he'll be the more puffed up, employing it upon ſumptuous Apparel or other Vanities to nouriſh his Pride and his Boaſting, or to commit other Exceſſes to which he's addicted, of Luxury, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance or Contempt of his Equals. In ſhort, this Good that you think you have done him, will often occaſion divers ſort of Evils to this your Neighbour, and alſo to your ſelf, in caſe you have need of what you have given him: For <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> well order'd begins always at ones ſelf; and he who ſhould give his Goods to another, and leave his own Debts unpaid, wou'd commit Robbery, by taking from him to whom 'tis due, to give it to another out of tender Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore I ſay we muſt always obſerve whether our Works be accompanied with Righteouſneſs, remarking whether this neceſſitous Perſon wou'd do any ſaving Good with our Gifts, whether they would draw him out of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and bodily Miſeries, whether he ſhall not abuſe them by employing them to do evil: Then the Giving him will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Righteouſneſs of God, provided you have what is ſuperfluous to give him: But when you have only pure Neceſſaries, 'tis not juſt to give them to others unleſs they be in ſome Extremity of Want: Then you muſt ſuccour your Neighbour as much as you are able, yet without caſting your ſelf into the Extremity from whence you wou'd bring another: For this wou'd neither be juſt nor good: For a Man ſhou'd never ruine himſelf voluntarily: This is to do an ill thing and againſt the Goodneſs of God. To do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Work of <hi>Charity</hi> that has the Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth of God ſtamp'd upon it, we muſt firſtſee if it be true
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104476:175"/>
that the Perſon whom we wou'd aſſiſt is really poor: This is the Truth of God: For there are now ſo many Cheats and Lyes, that the moſt part of the Poor are ſo thro' their own Fault; becauſe they will not work or they are prodigal and Cheats, or they will not manage, but are careleſs of the Goods that God has beſtowed on them. In all theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Perſon is not truly poor; and therefore we cannot find the Truth of God in our Alms, neither can we therein find his Goodneſs: becauſe it would be ill for the Salvation of him to whom we give it: Neither would it have his Righteouſneſs; for it would not be juſt to feed by Alms any in their Sloth, or in other Sins of Gluttony or Careleſneſs. You ſee clearly, Sir, that it is neceſſary to remark always by what Spirit we do our Actions; or elſe we ſhall commit great Faults without perceiving them. If you find ſome Difficulty in this ſerious Reflection, yet this ſhould not make you omit it: For our Salvation, and that of our Neighbour does well deſerve all this Trouble. If ſo many Men of Wit and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity do ſo earneſtly ſtudy to render themſelves honeſt, civil and accompliſh'd in the Eyes and Judgment of Men, how much more ought you to do to renderyour ſelf ſuch in the Sight of God, This Difficulty will be well rewarded by your Salvation, and that of ſo many others: Whereas theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are often obliged to bow their Wills as Reeds at the Will of thoſe whom they honour; who nevertheleſs can give them nothing but periſhing Things, either ſome Breath of Honour or tranſient Pleaſures, or ſome Riches that periſh by a Turn of Fortune; and yet for this they force and torment them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves exceedingly. Sir, let other Mens Folly make you wiſe. Study as much to gain the Favour of God as they do to have that of Men; For your eternal Happineſs depends upon it. You can never follow God if you do not embrace his Truth. Without it all your Works are vain and temporal, ending with your ſelf.</p>
               <p>I told her, <hi>That I would abſolutely ſtudy from benceforth to become agreeable to God, but that I never yet had Light enough to diſcern in all my Actions, whether the Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth of God was to be found in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, this comes from no other thing but Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Mind: For if it would apply it ſelf, it would certainly know all that it ought to do and omit, more clearly than your Eyes perceive, ſenſible Objects. Apply only the Underſtanding that God has given you for the Perfection of your Soul, and you ſhall learn all things. As ſoon as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104476:175"/>
you <note n="i" place="bottom">John 7. 17.</note> ſhall firmly reſolve to ſeek no longer for any thing upon Earth, but only to ſeek the Glory of God, you ſhall obtain the Light of the Holy Spirit which will teach you all things. There is nothing to be feared on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion but the Bent that we have to the Earth, which if we follow, we ſhould ſoon loſe the Star which ſhou'd guide us to the Place where God dwells. Therefore I exhort you never more to look behind you, nor to aim at any thing on Earth: For all that we can ſee or hope for here are but Chains and Bands to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw us from God, our alone Saviour: Therefore, Sir, forſake your ſelf and all things: For they are Enemies of your true Good. The Love we bear to Men, hinders us from the Love of God, and the Love of our ſelves renders us his Enemies; which Things ſtifle in our Soul the Light of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. But if we are reſolved to ſeek and love no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er any thing but the Glory of God, we ſhall ſoon perceive, if what we ſpeak, think or do, be for this Glory or not, by the leaſt Diligence or Care to do it. Only you muſt be firm in your Reſolution, that you will do nothing but what ſhall be for this Glory, and thruſt far from you all other things as unworthy of your Pretenſions. Then ſhall we walk with a ſteady Pace, and ſhall no longer do any thing but what ſhall have theſe three Qualities of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Goodneſs and Truth of God: For all that is for his Glory, brings ſtill theſe Conditions along with it his Glory being inſeparable from his Eſſence, his Eſſence from his Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth, nothing can be wanting there any longer.<note place="bottom">(<hi>k</hi>) <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 4.</note>

                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, I believe indeed my Company may ſerve you as a Mean to preſerve you on Occaſions; but it is not neceſſary for this: For God alone is ſufficient <note n="a" place="bottom">Pſ, 73. 23, 24, 25.</note> who'll guide you thro' all, provided you continue firmly faithful to him: For you know not me yet; and if you knew me, you wou'd ſee in my Practice all the things that I tell you by Word. My Thoughts, Words and Deeds, muſt have the three Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of which I have ſpoken to you; elſe I ſhou'd be like the Braſs that ſounds outwards, and has nothing within it ſelf. I have remarked that you have not yet diſcovered theſe Truths; and therefore my Converſation would be uſeleſs to you, and a great Hindrance to me: For you not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving God in my Words and Works, would not follow them, and you would hinder me from hearing God perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It is true, you do me no hurt when you look upon my Actions as Humane; but you cannot profit by them.

I have ſpoken to you of many different Things which may give you Light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Secrets of God and your own Salvation and particular Perfection. There remains only to put them in Practice. Read the Holy Scriptures, they will confirm you in all that I have told you, and give Credit to nothing but the Truth

               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That ſhe ought not to deprive me of her Company, ſince it gave me ſo much Light and good Purpoſes, and that I heard her Diſcourſes as proceeding from the Holy Spirit; but that I had not as yet ſtrength enough to put them in Practice: that I would be conſtrained to accompany ſome other Perſon; becauſe I could not ſtay alone.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, if you do this you are undone: For now you'll meet with no body in the World that poſſeſſes theſe three Qualities of <hi>Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth;</hi> and conſequently you ſeek in vain among Men what you will certainly find with God, from whom Men will divert you, and fill your Mind with their own Idea's and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, enticing you to follow them. Tho' they are not in the Truth, yet they think they are, and willingly draw over every one to their Errours, while they even believe they are doing well. Be on your Guard, Sir, for we are fallen into the dangerous Times foretold by Jeſus Chriſt, wherein <note n="c" place="bottom">Matth. 24. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Many falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, and ſhall deceive many.</hi> Obey theſe Warnings, and let not your ſelf be deceived: For many come in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, who are in League with Satan, and do deceive many. Remember ſtill that we live now in the Reign of Antichriſt, and that God <note n="d" place="bottom">Luke 18. 8.</note> at his Coming finds no more Faith in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, among his People; For all have denied him. Faith conſiſts in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Promiſes and Word of God. Who is there now a-days that hears his Word, and acts according to it? The
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104476:177"/>
Chriſtians are the People of God, nevertheleſs none of them has Faith: For if they did believe in one only God, they wou'd not make ſo many Idols, that each one has his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Idol; One makes an Idol of his Wealth, another of his Honour, another of his Wiſdom, and ſo of all other things, which they adore and eſteem. So that none has any longer Faith to believe that there is but one only true God, whom we ought to worſhip, nor yet the other things which God taught us by his holy Prophets, his Apoſtles and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. The Church has no longer Faith to believe that all theſe things muſt be practiſed in order to Salvation. Theſe ſeem to be but Stories of the ancient Times, and that it's not neceſſary now to put them in Practice: So that the word is now fulfilled, which ſays that when the Lord ſhall come, he ſhall not find Faith in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He is come and he finds no Faith in his People.

               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That they who retire from the World to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Religious or enter into Cloyſters, ought preciſely to follow Jeſus Chriſt, ſince they make ſolemn and particular Vows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, do you not ſee that theſe Vows are not well obſerv'd? They vow <hi>Chaſtity, Poverty</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> Remark if this be obſerved in the Cloyſters or among the <hi>Monks.</hi> Theſe are only outward things which ſeem as little obligatory as Baptiſm ſeems<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For neither the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is obſerved; and after the outward Ceremonies are performed, they do not think any longer on the Promiſes they've made to God: Every one lives according to his Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Religious Vows are as it were a ſecond Baptiſm, or a Confirmation of it; becauſe they enter into a Religious Life that they may renounce the World, its Pomps and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities as they had promiſed in Baptiſm: And when they have taken the Habit, and made Vows, they love the World more than they did before. There is often greater Pomp and Vanity under the mean Habit of a Religious Perſon than under the Purple of a King. Who does not perceive the Heart of thoſe Perſons puffed up, becauſe they have the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104476:178"/>
Name of Saints or vertuous Ones? It ſeems all the World ſhou'd do them Honour and Reverence; becauſe of their mean Habits which People kiſs kneeling, with more Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence than they worſhip God. They get the Titles of Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, Reverences, moſt illuſtrious. In ſhort, Sir, it cannot he true that theſe Perſons have renounced the World, ſince they deſire to be lov'd, honour'd and eſteem'd by it. On the contrary, in their Religious State they do often require more worldly Honour than wou'd have belonged to them, if they had remained Seculars. Does it not hereby appear that there are no where any true Chriſtians, and that all Chriſtianity now conſiſts only in outward <hi>Idea's?</hi> For no body renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Devil, the World and its Pomps, tho' all have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it in Baptiſm: And tho' they have confirmed theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes by Religious Vows, yet they are not more careful of one Obligation than the other. This may be concluded even from the Deeds and Practices of all thoſe Religious Votaries.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That at leaſt, the Religious did follow Jeſus Chriſt at a diſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> She knew not one thing in which they follow'd Jeſus Chriſt: For all their Practices were contrary to him: For he ſaid, <note n="b" place="bottom">Matth. 11. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Learn of me who am meek and lowly in Heart;</hi> and theſe are proud and arrogant. He was poor throughout his whole Life, and theſe deſire to be rich. He had not where to lay his Head, whereas theſe have all ſorts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, building Houſes as if they were to dwell here for ever. Jeſus Chriſt did ſtill labour, ſweat, toil and ſuffer in this Life; whereas theſe <hi>Monks</hi> will live at eaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without labouring or ſuffering any thing. Jeſus Chriſt choſe Reproach, Contempt and Confuſion; whereas theſe make themſelves to be honour'd by all, taking to themſelves the firſt Place, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtill the fineſt and the beſt: whereas Jeſus Chriſt did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways chuſe the leaſt, tho' he was the Lord and Creator of all things. He choſe a poor Mother, Apoſtles from among the Common-People, a Stable to be born in, and a Gibbet to die upon. Do you think, Sir, that there is any Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between the Life of the <hi>Monks</hi> and that which Jeſus Chriſt taught us by his Example? For my part I can't per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing in which they follow Jeſus Chriſt, neither cloſely nor at a diſtance: For even all their Outſide is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104476:178"/>
directly contrary to him. The pompous Ornaments of their Houſes and Churches do ſhew the Vanity of their Hearts: For he who is not vain, ſeeks nothing but what is neceſſary. Theſe Superfluities are real Evidences of it; For he who is not luxurious (or loves not Luxuries) will never heap up Treaſures upon Earth. All that <hi>Gold, Silver, Silk</hi> and thoſe other Ornaments, are all worldly Pomps which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in Baptiſm, and ſince in making Religious Vows. Nevertheleſs every one endeavours to heap up more. Is not this to mock God, to make falſe Promiſes to him, which we have no Mind to keep? For thoſe who at preſent enter into a Religious Life, have no Deſign to follow Jeſus Chriſt: But on the contrary, many enter therein, that they may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and have their Conveniencies and Pleaſures, or that they may be free of the Cares and Troubles of maintaining their <hi>Families</hi> if they ſhou'd live in the World, or for ſome Reaſons which are for their Profit: All which nevertheleſs are covered with a Pretence of following Jeſus Chriſt, tho' they will or deſire nothing leſs than this.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That ſome of them did ſincerely enter into a Religious ſtate; being perſuaded that hereby they ſhall more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally imitate Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> I bewail theſe, Sir, who go thither upon ſo good Deſigns; becauſe they cannot put them in Execution in theſe Societies at preſent, who are eſtabliſhed more for their own Profit than according to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. How many have entered into them who have been diſſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed from worldly things, and they have learned them to cover and ſeek them? If a <hi>Monk</hi> know not the way to bring the Water to their <hi>Mill,</hi> they will caſt him off as unprofitable for the Good of Religion. So that to obſerve his Vows a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, he muſt ſtudy to be covetous rather than poor. I doubt not but there are yet ſeveral particular Perſons among the Religious Orders who have a ſincere Intention to pleaſe God; but they are ſo blinded with the Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of others that they follow their Vices inſenſibly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perceiving it, becauſe theſe Vices are changed as to their Name, and they call them Vertues: For the <hi>Pride; Luxury</hi> and <hi>Avarice</hi> of theſe Perſons are called by the Name of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> Their Hearts will be full of theſe three Vices; and to make them paſs with others for Vertues, they will perſuade them that they ought to procure to themſelves, Honour, as being the Servants of God, or Prieſts conſecrated to him; and that therefore all Honour is due to them, that God may be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104476:179"/>
honour'd by them. Thoſe well-meaning Perſons believe this to be true, and follow others blindly, without reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Behaviour of Jeſus Chriſt, his Apoſtles and Diſciples, who were deſpiſed by the World: For Jeſus Chriſt ſays that he is <note n="c" place="bottom">Pſ. 22. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>the Reproach of Men;</hi> and when they wou'd have honour'd the Apoſtles for the great Miracles they wrought upon the Sick, they ſaid, <note n="d" place="bottom">Acts 3. 12, 16. 10. 26. 14. 15. Pſ. 115. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>ſee that you do it not for we are Men like to your ſelves; we do theſe Wonders in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, who ought to be honoured and glorified, and not we who can do nothing.</hi> Now theſe at preſent aſcribe all Honour to themſelves, making the World believe that it is Charity to give them Goods wherewith to maintain their Luxury, as well in their Movables and Buildings as in the Ornaments of the Altars under Colour, that 'tis the Houſe of God which deſerves all good and fine things, as if God were honoured by their Luxury and Superfluities, which are ſo well maſqu'd that the moſt Pious follow them without conſidering that neither Jeſus Chriſt nor his Apoſtles did ever build magnificent Temples or Houſes, but followed a plain Simplicity. Can God be honoured by the Sins of Luxury and Exceſs? He who being in the World did chuſe Poverty and Miſery! Thus he wou'd be indeed a changing God if he ſhou'd now glory in the Magnificence of Temples, Houſes and Ornaments, who wou'd neither have the one nor the other, tho' he was Lord and Creator of all things. If the Glory of his Father had conſiſted in Churches and ſumptuous Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wou'd not he to whom all appertains, have pitch'd upon them and built them? What Dotages do Men now publiſh, that God is honoured by great Buildings and rich Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments! So our Dung ſhou'd be his Honour: For <note n="e" place="bottom">Luke 16. 15.</note> all that is fair and good in the Sight of Men is nothing but Dung before God. We have renounced the Pomps of the World that we might become the Children of God; and by the ſame Pomps we wou'd honour him in his Churches! It is not fit to renounce the Pomps of the World to become Chriſtians, ſince theſe give Glory to God. It had been better to encreaſe theſe, ſince they honour God, that by the Encreaſe of them, God might receive Encreaſe of Glory. What Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind is it, Sir, that makes Men believe that God is honoured by worldly Pomps when they are applied to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104476:179"/>
Church-Walls. If they diſpleaſe God in the Souls of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, how much more ſhou'd they diſpleaſe him in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Places that are peculiarly dedicated unto him for Prayer, ſince this does ſtill require Attention, and theſe pompous and magnificent Ornaments ſerve for nothing but to diſtract and divert the Mind by regarding theſe Pomps and Ornaments of Churches which do certainly diſtract the Mind of all thoſe who regard them, and can ſerve for nothing but to ſatisfie the Avarice of thoſe who covet them. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they call thoſe charitable who afford them Money wherewith to provide all theſe Pomps and Ornaments of Churches. Every one praiſes and eſteems them, as if God were a vain God, who wou'd be adorn'd with fine Garments. If he wou'd have a rich Temple in <hi>Solomon's</hi> time, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe People were then ſo groſs, that they cou'd comprehend nothing of God or of his Majeſty, but by groſs and material things. But now that we have the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, we have received Light enough to know that <hi>God</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="bottom">John 4. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and Life, and not bodily or material. So that they who go to Cloyſters or Religious Orders that they may follow Jeſus, are greatly deceived; becauſe there he is not at all followed, but oppoſed: For which they ought rather to be called the Cloyſters of Antichiſt than of Chriſt; becauſe the things wherein they contradict him are more than thoſe wherein they follow him.</p>
               <p>I ask'd <hi>If thoſe would not be ſaved who ſhould enter into a Religious ſtate with a good Intention, and being in it ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to live well according to their Language.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, theſe are all Impoſtors in the Sight of God: For they promiſe Poverty and they obſerve it not; becauſe they yet covet worldly Goods, and do all they can to pleaſe Men, that they may give them of their Goods. Theſe Vows oblige them not to deſire Riches, and they do their beſt to have them. If they cannot deſire them, much leſs can they poſſes or receive them. They vow Chaſtity alſo and very often they are content only by Force, and for want of Occaſions. God who <hi>tries</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="bottom">Jer. 17. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>the Reins,</hi> ſees well if their Hearts and their Thoughts are chaſte, ſince ſo many things contrary thereto are heard of them. They vow Obedience, and they are full of ſelf-will. So far are they from obeying God, that they do not ſo much as hearken to him, and are ſubject only to their own Wills and Deſires, without any
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104476:180"/>
other Submiſſion. By what means would you have theſe Perſons ſaved who falſifie their Faith to God ſince thoſe cannot be ſav'd who falſifie their Faith to Men? Some falſifie their Faith to God out of Malice and Hypocriſie, and others falſifie it out of Ignorance, being directed in their Faith more according to what others do perſuade them, than according to their real Practice. They make them believe that Poverty is obſerved when they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs nothing in particular, and in the mean time ſince the Kings and the great Men of the World do ordinarily profeſs nothing in particular having People and Officers under them who govern their Revenues: Even as theſe Votaries of Poverty have, who wou'd not by it be depriv'd of a Glaſs of Wine or any the leaſt thing. They are in this more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than ſecular Perſons, who are oblig'd to care and labour for neceſſary things; whereas theſe <hi>Monks</hi> have all at their Wiſh without Pain or Labour; and if they be depriv'd of a Wife, they are free alſo of the Labours which Marriage brings along with it: So that their Chaſtity is more ſenſual than the being joyned with ſome Perſon of a froward or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Humour, which is more irkſome than Continence: So that theſe <hi>Monks</hi> who are called Penitents, do far leſs of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in their Monaſteries than they wou'd do if they were out of them: For their Vows of Obedience do conſtrain them only to what they have a Mind to do. They have no ſooner paſs'd their <hi>Novitiate</hi> but they are abſolute Lords, and taking the Will of their Superiours for that of God, they make them eaſily to condeſcend to theirs, elſe they wou'd become rebellious and chagrin or Diſturbers of others: And nevertheleſs they will think they have kept their three Vows, and believe that for this Cauſe they ſhall go to Paradiſe, tho' indeed all their Vertues be nothing but imaginary ones or Apiſh Tricks: And tho' they ſhou'd live well according to their Knowledge, yet they periſh; becauſe Ignorance does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe Sin. To be ſaved, we muſt of Neceſſity have the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of God; theſe for the moſt part have none of theſe Vertues: For that cannot be true Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to quit their own Wealth to go afterwards and beg that of others, who very often have need of it themſelves, and yet dare not refuſe theſe whom they eſteem to be the Servants of God: neither is it juſt to live upon Alms, when the Body and Mind is ſound for Labour, neither is it juſt to leave their own Goods to their Kinſmen to enrich them, and they themſelves go live at the Charge of a Common-Wealth. For my part, Sir, I perceive in my interiour that all theſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104476:180"/>
things are Unrighteouſneſſes before God however they cover them with Perfections and Vertues: Neither do I ſee the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God reign in theſe Souls; becauſe its Property is to do good to all, and to do evil to none: But we ſee theſe Religious Perſons do good only to themſelves or thoſe who are aſſociated with them, ſtudying to do Miſchief to all thoſe who will not follow them. And as for the <hi>Truth</hi> of God, it is yet leſs obſerved by them than the two other Vertues: For all their Works are nothing but external, far from the real Truth of God, which appears always to be what it is, and theſe <hi>Monks</hi> make a ſhew of the Holineſs and Vertues which they do not poſſeſs, but are truly Hypocrites.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That many of theſe</hi> Monks <hi>were Saints, and did Miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> They became not Saints, Sir, by that manner of Life which is obſerved now in the Cloyſters. They muſt either have been Saints before they entered there, or being there, they muſt have reſigned themſelves to the Will of God, and followed the Holy Spirit; and if ſo, they might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in any Place, and in any State and Condition, and not in the Cloyſter only; but theſe <hi>Monks</hi> extol their Sanctity for their Honour and Profit, attributing it to the Perfection of their Rules, tho' theſe have often prov'd Hindrances to thoſe who were guided by the Holy Spirit, who is always without Conſtraint, whereas theſe Rules do fetter and bind Souls with ſo many Chains, that they are more chain'd than Slaves in the Galleys. This cannot but bring great Diſturbance to truly Chriſtian Souls, whom theſe Conſtraints do not render holy, but the Conformity of their Will to that of God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there can be no Holineſs but what is derived from him, and therefore no Saints, but according as they partake of his <hi>Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> from which Mens Practices are very remote; and if Men were not ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in greater Darkneſs than that of <hi>Aegypt</hi> of old was, they wou'd not reverence the <hi>Monks</hi> to day, becauſe there were Saints among them formerly: Since their Lives were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from the Lives which the <hi>Monks</hi> lead now; and if they obſerve narrowly the Hiſtories which they themſelves write of them, they will find them a Reproof to them in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing. For they write that thoſe <hi>Holy Monks</hi> did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpiſe the World, and theſe at preſent do love and ſeek it; that thoſe lov'd Poverty, whereas theſe love and ſeek for Riches: The firſt were humble and deſpiſed, and theſe are ſelf-conceited, and will be honour'd. Read, Sir, if you pleaſe, the Lives of all the <hi>Holy Monks,</hi> you will find
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104476:181"/>
them wholly contrary to what we ſee at preſent So that what ought to raiſe their Eſteem, confounds them.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That Saints had inſtituted theſe Orders and Rules; and therefore they muſt be good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, if theſe Orders and Rules had remained in the State in which their firſt Founders eſtabliſhed them, they might have been helpful for Sinners who wou'd reform their Vices; becauſe when Nature is left to its own Freedom, it contracts ſuch evil Habits, as that it cannot afterwards be delivered from them but by Rigour and Conſtraint. This is the Reaſon that mov'd thoſe firſt Founders to obſerve bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Mortifications and Auſterities; becauſe the World was ſo addicted to all ſorts of Senſualities, that Men almoſt thought of nothing elſe but their bodily Eaſe and Pleaſures: To remedy which, theſe Lovers of Souls, introduc'd Ways of living that might reſiſt ſuch inveterate Vices, appointed Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to <note n="h" place="bottom">1 Cor. 9. 27.</note> ſubdue the Body, Watchings <note n="i" place="bottom">Matth. 26. 41.</note> to attend upon Prayer, bodily Severities to reſiſt Luſt, and ſo of all the other Means that were proper to withdraw Men from the Vices to which they were habituated. All theſe things cannot be evil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be obſerved in the Spirit and Intention with which they were eſtabliſhed, becauſe they may ſerve as powerful Helps for Sinners who deſire to be converted; but every one has no need of theſe Means to be holy; becauſe they cannot give Holineſs, but ſerve only to correct the Vices that might make the Soul ſtill cleave to bodily Senſualities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhou'd hinder the Reſignation they ſhou'd make of themſelves to be diſpos'd of by God. But to believe that theſe Auſterities can of themſelves render us holy, is a great Errour: For even the Devil might obſerve them, and continue a Devil ſtill: So alſo wicked Men may become Religious, and obſerve their Rules, and yet not change their Affection to their Vices: ſince the ſame Means which might deliver them from them, may plunge them farther into them, as we ſee by Experience that they will ſometimes ſtudy more Senſuality when they eat but Fiſh and Pulſe, than they wou'd do in eating Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges and other good things, and will have more Vanity in wearing a courſe Habit, than in Silk and Purple: We may alſo meet with more Avarice in a poor Man than in one who abounds in Wealth: Therefore we can't judge the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Soul by outward Exerciſes, ſince both a good and ill Uſe may be made of them.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:104476:181"/>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That Vows and the conſtraint Rules were Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Helps to regulate ones Life, and that the Cloyſters cut off many Occaſions of offending God, being out of the Hurry of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Truly, Sir, I cannot believe that that Conſtraint of Vows and Rules have been eſtabliſhed by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: becauſe it is contrary to the Free-Will that God has ſo bountifully given us. The ſame Spirit cannot <note n="k" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 29.</note> give and take back the ſame thing. He ſhou'd be ſubject to the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of changing as we are, which cannot be in God. He cannot hold that to be evil which he has once approv'd as good. The greateſt Favour which ever he beſtowed on Man, is the having given him his Free-Will, which renders him a depending Deity, and capable of converſing with God as with his like; becauſe he is pleaſed to make a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſuch a Nature, that it ſhou'd have this Free-Will to all Eternity: And how is it poſſible that the ſame God ſhou'd change his eternal Deſigns, and ſhou'd inſpire the Saints to curb Men, and to deprive them of this ſame Liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, when he created them, he wou'd endue them, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them afterwards by Vows to follow or love him? If God had theſe Deſigns, no body ſhou'd be damn'd; becauſe the Goodneſs of God is ſo great, that it wou'd by force con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain all Men to be ſaved. No, no, Sir, this cannot be true: God can bind no body to Vows. This muſt be the Invention of Men, who having a good Will and Deſire that many ſhou'd be ſaved, thought it was good to conſtrain them by Vows and Ties, that they might be bound to continue in pious Exerciſes. This can come only from humane Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not from the Holy Spirit, tho' the Founders of Orders inſtituted it, or the Church after them found it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient by Vows to oblige<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Religious, that thereby they might be preſerved in their firſt Reſolution of ſerving God. This cannot at all proceed from the Holy Spirit, who will never act contrary to himſelf. And to know whether Vows and Conſtraints were powerful enough Means for the well ordering of Mens Lives that they might ceaſe to offend God, and live as true Chriſtians, we need only come to experience, which is ſtill the Miſtreſs of all Sciences. How many thouſand Perſons in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> are now under Vows in Cloyſters and Religious Orders, and how
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104476:182"/>
few of them are there who do Miracles? If theſe Vows and Rules came from the holy Spirit, they would certainly be all Saints: For the obſerving the Commands of the Holy Spirit, does ſtill produce Holineſs: ſo that all who wou'd be ſubject to the Vows which the Holy Spirit ſhou'd dictate to them, wou'd receive all the Fruits and Gifts, which are not to be found among the Votaries in Cloyſters: On the contrary, we ſee they are rather guilty of ſix Sins againſt the ſame Holy Spirit, which are ſo ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in theſe Votaries, that it may be ſaid, they are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from them: For we find in them always a Preſumption of being ſaved without good Works; becauſe being full of ſelf-love, they can never be good. They oppoſe alſo the known Truth, becauſe the real Truth reproves them: Therefore they will not hearken to it, chuſing rather to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in their Darkneſs, and to lay the Streſs of their Salvation upon the Opinion or Diſcourſe of Men. So that we need not enter into Monaſteries to diſcover clearly that they are not become Saints by their Vows and the Conſtraint of their Rules, nor yet have quitted all Commerce with Men, ſince we ſee they deſire as much their Converſation as ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons do. And what will it ſerve for the Perfection of Souls, to have their Wills bound by Vows, and even their Bodies ſhut faſt up, when the Spirit is yet curious to know what paſſes in the World, as the Practice is in the encloſed Cloyſters? For if one would learn all ſort of News, he may go into one of their Parlours; and if our Will were bound to God when it is bound to the Will of Men, there wou'd not be ſuch Contradictions in the Cloyſters, where as many Perſons as there are, there are almoſt as many contrary Wills. All this does ſufficiently make appear that the Rules and Vows do not make the Perſon holy, or depending upon the Will of God: On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they rather eſtrange him from it: For as ſoon as they have fulfill'd their Obedience to their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, they believe they have wholly ſatisfied God; whereas very often they offend him: for theſe Superiours are often eſtranged from the Spirit of God, neither is it to be accounted a great Vertue that we acquieſce in the Will of ſome Perſon whom we love. This is purely natural, and not from the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That we have ſometimes heard that Miracles have been wrought by this Obedience to Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:104476:182"/>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, theſe cannot have been true Miracles if they had their Riſe from Obedience to Men. There are ſo many things to be diſtinguiſhed in the matter of Miracles, that the Devil may eaſily work ſuch as the World wou'd admire: And I believe he has already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many pious Perſons by falſe Miracles: For he can dazle Mens Spirits, and make them take nothing for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. He can alſo trouble the Humours of the Body and cauſe Diſeaſes, which he can afterwards remove; becauſe it is done by Charms, and by the ſame Charms it may be undone again: Beſides that, he has ſo many who are bound to him by preciſe Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who do his Will, by whom he can work many Malefices which might ſeem real Miracles, tho' they be only all Tricks of the Devil. Therefore I will not believe that thoſe Stories which they tell us of Miracles fallen out by this Obedience to Men, are true, nevertheleſs I do not reject the Approbation that God has ſometimes given of the Submiſſion rendered to his Servants, who poſſeſs his Spirit, and ſpread it by teaching it to others, in obeying of whom, they obey God himſelf; becauſe they are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but by him: So that thoſe who obey them, do indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey God. In this manner I believe that God may work true Miracles to confirm that it was his true Spirit which dwelt in theſe Superiours: As he wrought Miracles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that the Apoſtles did poſſeſs his Spirit, becauſe he did not remain in the Fleſh to converſe with Men and teach them. He taught them by his Servants: Therefore he ſaid <note n="l" place="bottom">Luke 10. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>He that hears you, hears me:</hi> But he ſays not this to all bodily Superiours, as it is now taken; becauſe it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that many of theſe do directly follow the Devil's Will, and conſequently teach others to do the ſame, at leaſt indirectly. By which we may fear the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard there is in this Submiſſion to Men, and may learn alſo the Deceit there is in what they teach Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians now, and particularly thoſe who wou'd ſerve God in Perfection.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That the Vows were approved by the Church as a perfect thing, and that all the World did look on them as good things.</hi>

                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> And for my part, Sir, I look upon them as evil things for all Perſons: For he who reſolves to be reſign'd to God with all his Heart, has no need to be conſtrain'd to this by Men; becauſe the Love he bears him, is ſtill ſtrong enough to tie him to God without needing that Men ſhou'd interpoſe in it; and he who has not this reſolute Will of reſigning himſelf to be governed by God, cannot make Vows in any Order, except in Hypocriſie: Becauſe Vows cannot conſtrain his Will, but his Body; and when the Body is conſtrain'd to do good againſt the Deſire of the Will, he is then the real Martyr of the Devil; becauſe he ſuffers much and merits nothing. And thus Vows cannot be good, neither for the Wicked nor yet for the Good, who, if they are ſo truly, have no need to be forc'd to do good by the Conſtraint of Men, if theſe Holy Founders have inſtituted Vows (which I do not believe) this muſt have been only out of humane Reſpect or Perſuaſion, or for want of divine Light; and if the Church approves them, it is to keep theſe Perſons in a preciſe Dependence upon her, from which, if theſe Vows were laid aſide, many would deliver themſelves; which is to be deſired, and it were far better that all theſe Perſons in Vows had their Liberty, than to continue cloyſter'd to the Damnation of their own Souls, and the deceiving of others, who look upon thoſe under Vows as Saints; ſubmitting to their Council and Government, tho' very often they are governed by the Devil, and he by their Means, gains the moſt Pious, who could not be gain'd any other way but by this Cover of Religion, which all the World eſteems to be good and holy. By this the Devil gets into the Throne of God, that he may deceive by falſe Appearances. If he had remain'd among the <hi>Turks, Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> he could not have become Antichriſt, ſeeing one cannot ſhock an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at a diſtance, unleſs he approach him: So the Devil could not ſtock the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, if he had not inſinuated into the Church it ſelf, and among thoſe in it, who make a Profeſſion of Vertue, as the <hi>Monks</hi> and Religious Perſons: and he having ſlipt in among theſe, draws all the World after him, and yet they do not diſcover him, neither dare they believe that he dwells in theſe Perſons, who in Appearance and in the Eſteem of all the World, are holy; becauſe he has on his ſide the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That they who had enter'd upon a vertuous Courſe of Life, went into the Cloyſters, that they might learn it better, and that by ſubmitting their Wills to Superiours, they might learn to ſubmit them to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, this School of Perfection is not good, for there they cannot learn true Vertue if it be not there. He who truly deſires to reſign himſelf to God, would do very ill to enter into Monaſteries now: For the Spirit of God is departed from them. The firſt Founders informed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whether thoſe who wou'd enter into a Religious Life, were endued with or aimed at the Love of God and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for their Neighbour: And theſe Inſtitutors at preſent ask how much Money they have to bring with them into the Monaſtery? And if they have Friends to give them Money after they are come there? This is a general Cuſtom. They muſt have one of theſe Qualifications, elſe there is no Entry into the Cloyſters: They muſt alſo have a good Body, a good Voice, and good Health, unleſs Money ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all the reſt, and for it they wou'd receive the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if he came there with abundance of Money. How can Vertue be found there, ſince nothing but Money and Gain is there ſought for? So that a vertuous Soul who ſhould enter there, would be conſtrained to yield to the Prevalence of Vice, or elſe to go out again: For if ſuch a one thinks to learn Submiſſion to God by Submiſſion to ſome Superiour, he will be very far from it: Becauſe their Will is ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of God, who does all things that are juſt, good and true; whereas theſe take Wealth unjuſtly againſt the Intention of their firſt Founders, who deſired to live in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.</hi> They act alſo againſt the Goodneſs of God, when they will receive none but the Rich, or thoſe by whom they may reap Advantage; whereas Jeſus Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives every one, without Reſpect of Perſons. They act alſo againſt the Goodneſs of God, when they teach their Novices holy Geſtures and Countenances while the Heart is far from it, and they do not teach them any true <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> but that only which has the Appearance of it, and is not true: So that the Novice cannot learn to ſubject himſelf to God by his Submiſſion to Men, who in all things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him. Therefore I am ſorry that a truly ſincere Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould enter into a Monaſtery: For there he will find himſelf deceived, and will loſe the Vertue that he had before he came thither: For there God is not to be found any longer.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:104476:184"/>
               <p>I ask'd her yet one more Queſtion upon this Head; that is, <hi>Whether one who in Simplicity believes that the Monaſteries are yet governed by God, and goes thither with a Deſign to lead a better Life than in the World, and being there Endeavours to live well as to his own particular, without following the evil Maxims which he ſees are practiſed by others, would do Ill to go there, or to ſtay among them, having taken the Vows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, this is a great Queſtion; but I will anſwer it, ſince I have promiſed to anſwer to what you ask. One who in Simplicity believes that God does yet govern the Cloyſters, would not ſin by entring into them; But if he diſcover the Reality of the Evil, he is obliged to depart from them, even tho' he were profeſt, provided it be in his Power: For before God his Vow is null; becauſe he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of the Conditions for which he made it, which were to learn Perfection, and to be ruled according to God's Spirit. Theſe ſuppoſed Conditions being wanting, he by Conſequence may in Conſcience and before God break his Vow, but not before Men, who by the greater Force, will maintain their Authority: So that one who has taken his Vows going from them, tho' for a good end and his greater Perfection, ſhall by them be held for, and treated as an Apoſtate. In this Caſe he muſt conform himſelf to the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Jeſus Chriſt, and endure Perſecution for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. It were better therefore not to enter into them, fearing leſt he have not Strength enough to endure Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. But if he have been there for a long time, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find the way to get out from them, he muſt reſolve upon a long Martyrdom: For they will not only hinder him to live well, as to his own particular, but they will oblige him by Force to follow the evil Maxims of others: For the Devil is of this Temper that he will never ſuffer Good where he can hinder it; and theſe Perſons being guided by the ſame Devil, will not ſuffer another to do good where they can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. Hereby we ſee evidently that their Malice is not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, but deviliſh. For humane Malice extends it ſelf only to Evil by its own Malice and Infirmity, or ceaſes to do good thro' Sloth or the Corruption of its own Will, which is never enclin'd to do Good. Nevertheleſs it eſteems and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours the good Deeds of others, tho' it be not enclin'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or imitate them. This is the utmoſt that humane Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice extends to; but it never goes ſo far as to hinder another ſtom doing good. How great ſoever this Sinner be, yet he willingly recommends himſelf to the Prayers of the Good:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104476:184"/>
But deviliſh Malice hinders all the Good it can, as theſe <hi>Monks</hi> do at preſent.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>I was much troubled to underſtand that there were ſuch Miſchiefs in the Cloyſters; becauſe ſome of my Friends were there, whom I eſteemed to be good Men, and deſirous to pleaſe God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, If they are ſuch they muſt be perſecuted there, elſe I will not believe that they can be truly the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet remain in the Cloyſters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Perſecution. A truly good Man can no more abide in the Cloyſters than Water can abide in the Fire. There are many indeed who ſeem to be good Men, and have a good natural Temper to be at every body's Service, as <hi>Hackney-Horſes</hi> are. Theſe are not good Men tho' they ſeem to be ſuch; becauſe like a Reed they bow with every Wind. The Devil and wicked Men make uſe of ſuch Perſons to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their great Wickedneſs; becauſe by ſome ſuch Simple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, the World will judge that all are good and ſimple. But if your Friends be Men of Underſtanding, and of ſolid Vertue, they will eaſily perceive that all is corrupted in the Monaſteries, and if they love the Righteouſneſs of God, they cannot be ſilent, but will ſpeak againſt Iniquity in, doing of which they ſhall be oppreſs'd with Perſecution. If you ſpeak to them in particular, Sir, and if they truſt you with a true Relation of what paſſes among them, they will tell you yet more than I do: For I know not the Particulars of what paſſes in theſe Cloyſters, but only in general, that they are abominable before God; of which, their Behaviour in general is Evidence enough to thoſe of good Underſtanding, who will obſerve it that they may conceive it aright. The greateſt Evil is, that they cannot diſcover theſe Truths in any body; becauſe they are ſo powerful, and have ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that all the World dreads them; and thus the Evil being unknown, does Miſchief to many, and encreaſes dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and there can be no Remedy applied to it: And he who ſhould attempt to do it, wou'd be cruſh'd under their power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Arm: For they govern now all the Kings and great Men upon the Earth; as it is declared in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that <note n="m" place="bottom">Rev. 17. 1.</note>

All thoſe who follow her ſhall be deſolate. For ſhe ſhall be ſo miſerably treated, that all the World will bewail her; and according as ſhe lifted up her ſelf in Glory and Magnificence, ſhe ſhall be as much debaſed and contemned. All her Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, who at preſent extol and defend her, ſhall periſh with her, and ſhall ſwallow down as much of her Curſe, as they now drink of her delicious Wine. Yet a little while and ſhe ſhall have no longer Force to perſecute the Friends of God. Then we may preach the Truth thro' all the World, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ſhall receive it. What is now hid and cover'd with Silk and Purple, will then be diſcover'd to their Miſchief and Confuſion. Read, Sir, the Particularities of this Whore in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> you will find more than I tell you of them; for I ſee its Miſchiefs only in general, and they are ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to me that I tremble to think of them, and cannot, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>(o)</hi> pray that they may not come to paſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is what ſhe has merited by the ſtreight Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, which will never be truly known or followed but by the Ruine of her who has quitted her lawful Husband to joyn her ſelf with Fornicators; Such are all falſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians with whom ſhe commits daily new Adulteries to the wronging of her faithful Husband, who has lov'd her ſo much, and enrich'd her with all ſort of Graces and Vertues, which ſhe abuſes, to give up her ſelf to her own Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Pleaſures. Theſe if conſidered, will be found the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſs of Evils: For ſhe has no longer Fidelity nor Loyalty for her lawful Husband: She deſpiſes his Commandments and Laws: In ſhort; ſhe will depend only on her own Authority and Power, without reſerving it to him from whom ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, with all that ſhe has and poſſeſſes, which ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, the moſt perfect things become the moſt vile when they abuſe their Perfections. We ſee Examples of this, both in divine and humane things. The Angels who were ſuch excellent Heavenly Creatures, are they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come moſt infamous Devils? Men who were created by God, with all ſort of Perfection, ſurpaſſing all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are they not become more miſerable in Nature than any other Animals, for having abuſed the Graces of God? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a beautiful Woman that gives up her ſelf to Lewdneſs: Does ſhe not commit more Sins and Impieties than an ugly one wou'd do, tho' ſhe ſhou'd proſtitute her ſelf as well as the fair one? The more wealthy a Man is, the more he loſes when ruined; and one that ſtands very high, when he falls, hurts himſelf worſe than if the Fall had been only from his own Height; becauſe the greater Height we fall from, the Fall is the more grievous. Jeſus Chriſt had raiſed the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church above all the People of God <note n="o" place="bottom">Rom. 1. 8.</note> that ever were in the World: For neither the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor any others, did ever receive ſuch Graces and Prerogatives as the Church did that Jeſus Chriſt himſelf came to eſtabliſh upon Earth. He beſtowed on her, and adorned her with all ſorts of Gifts and Graces, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her a perpetual Aſſiſtance and infinite Happineſs, ſending her the Holy Spirit to rule and govern her: But ſhe abuſing all his Favours, falſifies her Faith promiſed to her God; makes no reckoning of his Laws and Ordinances; but will follow her own Inſtitution. She abandons her ſelf to that which moſt pleaſes her <hi>Senſualities,</hi> and makes Alliance with the Kings of the Earth, and Creatures like her ſelf, having waſted with them all the ſpiritual Treaſures which ſhe had received from her only Husband: So that in her there is no Footſtep any longer to be ſeen of the Path in which ſhe trod, nor any of the Ways by which he walked, nor any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of the Precepts that he gave her. Inſtead of Poor, ſhe is become Rich, inſtead of Contempt ſhe is honour'd, and inſtead of renouncing the World, ſhe ſeeks it, follows and carelles it: Are not theſe Heights of Infidelity great enough to make her be rejected and abandoned unto the Miſeries in which ſhe is plunged?</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:104476:186"/>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That this Change of the Church from Poverty to Riches, and from Contempt to Honour, was introduc'd for a good End; and that the Councils had ſo ordain'd it for to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port her.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, theſe are all vain Amuſements, to believe that what Jeſus Chriſt found to be evil, the holy Spirit wou'd now find it to be good. We have not a mutable God <note n="p" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 17.</note> who changes his Reſolutions as Men do. He never chang'd and never will change. The Doctrine that Jeſus Chriſt brought upon Earth is the laſt Inſtruction that God will ſend Men for working out their Salvation. We muſt not look for any <note n="q" place="bottom">Gal. 1. 8, 9.</note> other thing. Whatſoever is contrary to his Words, does certainly come from the Devil, who preſided in theſe Councils, who thus chang'd the Rules that Jeſus Chriſt gave his Church for maintaining her aright in his Spirit. But they would not perſevere therein but deviſed to find out Ways to maintain themſelves in the Name and Authority of the Church by worldly Riches and Honours. It had been much better for the Salvation of Souls, that the Church had periſh'd outwardly, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſhe did ſo, than to invent new Ways contrary to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to maintain her in Reputation. Even as it wou'd be much better not to have a Body, than to have one that is rotten: For that wou'd only infect others. I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to you, Sir, the Stench that I feel of the Corruption of the Body of this Church. How much more Stinking muſt it be in the Noſtrils of God? Wou'd it not be a great Sin to praiſe and commend a Whore that outwardly were beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but Pocky within, and deſign that many might go into her to be infected with her Filthineſs? Such a one wou'd commit as many Murthers as there were Perſons killed by Familiarity with her. Are not you afraid, Sir, to do the ſame, when you will ſo much commend and excuſe this <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, which you may eaſily perceive to be corrupted? And the more ſhe is dreſt up with Vertues and Sanctity, ſhe is the more capable of corrupting the Innocent, who approach her, thinking to find the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt without Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, while in the mean time they contract nothing but the Corruption of an infamous Strumpet.

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, it is indeed a deſirable thing, but it is very little deſired: For all the World reſiſts this Diſcovery, and they think they do a very pious Action, when they will hear nothing ſpoken of the Evils which have crept into the Church, nor yet of the <hi>Monks</hi> and others who proſeſs to ſerve God. The Holy Spirit, it ſeems muſt accommodate himſelf to the Times if he would be heard, and muſt praiſe the Vices and Sins that are at preſent committed againſt him: For that String muſt not be touch'd to ſpeak evil of thoſe who deſire to continue in Reputation or Authority in the Church, even tho' they ſhould commit all ſort of Abominations, and tho' they were Sorcerers and Devils. They teach it as a Principle of Vertue that we ought to excuſe their Sins, and take our Garments to cover them, that no body may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. This is very far from deſiring that theſe Wounds may be laid open that they may be healed. 'Tis no wonder, Sir, that I have ſo often told you, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee by what way there ſhould be ſo much as one Perſon at preſent ſaved in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> becauſe the greateſt Part live as <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> without acknowledging God any longer <note n="h" place="bottom">Pſ. 10. 4.</note> or
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104476:187"/>
thinking on him; and the reſt having the Reputation of good Men, are ſo full of the Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt, that I know not what way they can be gained. If it ſhould be told a Prieſt, <hi>Sir, you are deceived in the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments: They do not operate of themſelves, as you think,</hi> he would think this Advertiſement came from the Devil, and would reſiſt it as a very ill thing: Or if it ſhould be ſaid to a <hi>Monk,</hi> or any other devout Perſon that they were not true Chriſtians, they would preſently take the Alarum and withſtand the Perſon who ſhould tell them this Truth, as if he were an Enemy of God, and a Liar: becauſe he who has no deſire to amend, will not be pleaſed to have his Faults diſcovered to him: Thus every one continues in his Sins, and deſires not to leave them off, or ſo much as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them. In this Men love <hi>Darkneſs rather than the Light,</hi> which ariſes ſo graciouſly, upon which depends the Salvation or Damnation of all the Men in the World: For the Darkneſs is <note n="i" place="bottom">John 3. 7.</note> univerſal and there is no Sect or Nation whatſoever that is in the real Truth.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That ſhe was obliged to diſcover theſe Truths, that they would be of great uſe tho' it were but to my Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, you are no more diſpoſed than any other to receive the Light of the Holy Spirit, unleſs your Heart be humble and your Spirit ſimplified. This is what Jeſus Chriſt told <note n="k" place="bottom">Matth. 18. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that he muſt become a Child, and enter again into his Mother's Womb; affirming elſewhere that (<hi>l</hi>) <hi>If we are not converted, and become as little Children, we ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Theſe very Words muſt now have their compleat and perfect Senſe: For he who ſhall not ſubmit his Spirit in Simplicity as a little Child, cannot receive the real Truth which the Holy Spirit brings into the World; becauſe the Doctrines of Men and their evil Cuſtoms have ſo blinded and darkned their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, that 'tis impoſſible for them to receive the Light of Truth, unleſs they be firſt ſtript of all their Sciences acquired by humane Means, which prove Vails and Banda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to the Eyes of the Soul: For theſe humane Maxims are all lying and deceitful, teaching to honour Men, and give Deference to them, when they are in Place and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not conſidering that Honour is due to God alone by<note place="bottom">(<hi>h</hi>) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 2.</note>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:104476:188"/>
his Commandment, and that Deference ought to be given to the Truth only, to which it is due; and as long as we don't apprehend theſe things, we will think we do well to adhere to the Sciences we have learned from Men, and will not empty our ſelves of them, that we may receive the Wiſdom of the Holy Spirit; eſpecially when by it we ſhall diſcover things quite contrary to our Sentiments, or thoſe which our Maſters taught us. You are not more than any other, Sir, delivered from your own Wiſdom, which hinders the Holy Spirit, and that even under a Colour of good: For you wou'd make Scruple to believe the Holy Spirit, when it ſhou'd tell you things contrary to the Councils held in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as I perceived when I ſpoke of ſuch things to you; becauſe you have been brought up in it, and foſter'd with a Belief that theſe Councils were directed by the Holy Spirit; tho' this cannot be true; it being your Reſolution not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from her. This will hinder you from ſubmitting to the Light of the Holy Spirit, which will have no Oppoſition nor Reſiſtance, but a ſimple Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That I could not diſown I had Difficulty to believe things contrary to the Councils: Nevertheleſs I would follow the Light of the Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, you cannot follow the one without quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the other; becauſe indeed they are as far from one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as Truth is from Lyes: For the Holy Spirit teaches only the Truth, which makes for the Glory of God; whereas theſe Councils teach only that which makes for their own Glory and Authority. Take off a little, Sir, this Veil of Preoccupation of believing blindly that <hi>Rome</hi> is the Holy Church; and ſubmit to God that he may ſhew you what Truth is in this. You will feel evidently in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of your Soul, that God cannot change as theſe Perſons have changed the Inſtitutions of Jeſus Chriſt. We muſt not be ſo void of Judgment, as blindly to lay the Foundation of our Eternal Salvation upon falſe Suppoſitions; but we muſt fully open our Eyes and conſider if what we have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hitherto, be more clear and ſolid than what is now diſcovered. You will thereby perceive which of the two is fartheſt from the true Light: But as long as you are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and can hardly believe this or that, your Soul is not free to receive this Truth. If you believe things, becauſe Councils or others have told you them, you are not eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Truth of theſe things, but only in the Opinion you have of thoſe who tell you them. And do you not know
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:104476:188"/>
that the Holy Spirit ſays <note n="l" place="bottom">Pſal. 116. 11.</note> that <hi>all Men are Lyars?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then will you believe things becauſe Men ſay them? I wou'd never have you to believe my Words, becauſe I ſay them; but I wou'd indeed have you to believe them becauſe they are true. We ought always to follow and love the Truth, wherever it is; but never to believe and follow a Lye, even tho' it ſhou'd come from the Mouth of a holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: For otherwiſe we ſhall commit great and irreparable Faults as to the Salvation of our Souls, eſpecially in this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous time, wherein the Devil is plac'd <note n="m" place="bottom">2 Theſ. 2. 4</note> in God's Throne, and teaches us Lyes inſtead of the Truth. That God has given us an Underſtanding to comprehend, is not for temporal and tranſient things, but that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and diſcern the Things that concern our Salvation and Eternal Life. In this we ought to employ all the Force of our Spirit <note n="n" place="bottom">Acts 17. 11.</note> to diſcover if what they tell and teach us now in this Matter be true or not, without adventuring upon a blind Belief, as all Chriſtians do at preſent.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That I would not lean to a blind Belief, but to the ſtreight Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, if it be ſo, you will have no trouble to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what I tell you, tho' it be contrary to the <hi>Councils:</hi> For I do not ſpeak of my ſelf, and I tell only what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God dictates to me. Take good heed to my Words: they proceed always from the Spirit of Truth, who muſt teach all things. He cannot deceive you, as wou'd your Learning and Studies, that you may have acquired by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Means. Be jealous of them: For 'tis ſo long ſince the Devil did inſinuate himſelf into the Church of God to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it, that almoſt it cannot be told from what time it was corrupted: Inſomuch that even while Jeſus Chriſt was yet upon Earth, the Dvil <note n="o" place="bottom">John 6. 10.</note> liſted himſelf as a <hi>Soldier</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, on deſign to thwart his Doctrine, and in the time of his Apoſtles he became a Captain; becauſe he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gained many under his Power <note n="p" place="bottom">Pſal. 1, 16. 3. 18, 19.</note>; and in the time of their Diſciples he had yet more, and might then by juſt Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle have born the Name of <hi>Colonel;</hi> becauſe he <hi>ruled many;</hi> and after the Apoſtles Death he became a Governour by the Encreaſe of his Power: But ſince they wou'd needs form this <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the Devil is become <hi>General</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:104476:189"/>
of it, by which Government, he has now conquered all the World, and is <hi>univerſal Emperor,</hi> eſpecially over the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whom he <hi>holds</hi> under his particular Empire. He is therefore juſtly called <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> becauſe he has gainſaid the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, which by him has been <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed</hi> and <hi>annihilated;</hi> becauſe under this Pretext of Chriſt, he has infatuated Mens Minds to make them believe that what is contrary to Chriſt, is Chriſt himſelf, and that what <note n="q" place="bottom">Rev. 2. 9.</note> is the Synagogue of Satan, is the holy Church. And thus by theſe falſe Perſuaſions, he has deceived all the World, and the moſt Religions believe they follow God, when they follow the Devil: becauſe he is ſo maſqu'd with the Veil of Piety and Devotion, he cou'd have prevail'd with <hi>well-meaning Perſons,</hi> by teaching them Evil; but under this Colour of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and the <hi>Holy Church,</hi> all the World do blindly follow him with ſuch <hi>Fidelity,</hi> that it wou'd be very hard to divert them from him. Every one wou'd think he did ill to quit this Church, which is ſo only in Appearance, to follow the true one. I only regret you, and ſuch as you, Sir, who ſincerely intend to follow the real Truth, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs fear to reſiſt Lyes, out of a frivolous Imagination that the Church will ſtill continue in the material Place where Jeſus Chriſt eſtabliſhed it.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That when I ſhould diſcover this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Errour, I would never follow it: That I would gladly abandon it, and follow the Spirit of Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, if you wou'd follow the Spirit of Truth, quit then all theſe fooliſh Perſuaſions that Chriſtians have now, which are only invented by Antichriſt, that he may gain all the World to himſelf by apparent Holineſs. They wou'd perſuade you that <hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>Holy Church,</hi> that you muſt obey her in all her Ordinances. If you do this, you ſhall be an <hi>Idolater,</hi> aſcribing to Men what belongs to God only; as <hi>Honour, Power</hi> and <hi>Infallibility.</hi> Every one believes that this belongs to her; tho' it belongs to none but God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> and to uſe his Almighty Power: As alſo to receive Honour, appertains to God only: and he who ſeeks and deſires it, is a Robber, and receives what does not belong to him. Moreover, if you refer your<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf in all things to the Church, ſhe will oblige you to things againſt God and your Conſcience, and make you to

acknowledge that ſome Saints are Hereticks, as if the knew of me, ſhe wou'd condemn me for ſuch, tho' I act only by the Holy Spirit, and all the Books that handle the pure Truth, are condemned and forbidden by this Church. There is no longer any thing but Lying that triumphs in her: For ſhe even teaches that we may have the Pardon of our Sins without a preciſe Love of God; which overturns all the Law and the Prophets: For they are eſtabliſhed, and have ſpoken for no other End <note n="r" place="bottom">Pſ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Say the Church what it pleaſe, it cannot change the Ordinance that God made from the Beginning of the World. I ſee nothing there but Tricks and Diſtractions: For inſtead of ſaying to us what Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to the Young Man in the Goſpel <note n="t" place="bottom">1 Cor. 16. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou wouldeſt enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, keep my Commandments:</hi> For the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of this Kingdom, ſhe teaches us a thouſand Fopperies which Jeſus Chriſt never taught us, by <hi>Indulgencies, Confra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities, Cords, Girdles,</hi> or <hi>Scapularies,</hi> and <hi>Devotions,</hi> to <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> All this to me ſeems ſo far from the Spirit of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that I am pain'd at the Heart when I think on't. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all theſe things ſerve only to dazle Mens Spirits, that they may never come to the Knowledge of the Truth, and to amuſe us as they do the Children, with Rattles to charm our Miſeries.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>I would fain diſcover where the Holy Spirit was, that I might follow him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, he is now come in the World. You ſhall know him by Truth, Righteouſneſs and Goodneſs: For he is the ſame with God. There are not in God three Perſons, as People imagine; becauſe all that we can ſay of God, is, only that he is perfect <note n="u" place="bottom">Mat. 19. 17.</note> Love, all-juſt, all-good and all-true. Behold, Sir, all that we can know of God in this preſent Life; and when we are told, that there are three Perſons in God, it is to be underſtood that there are three Powers, that Love is his Eſſence, that his <note n="x" place="bottom">1 Joh. 4. 8.</note> Word communicates
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104476:190"/>
this Love, and that his <note n="z" place="bottom">1 Cor. 2. 12.</note> Underſtanding makes Man to comprehend it. This Love being the Eſſence of God, never beginning, and alſo will never end, which Love was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Man from the Creation: But ſeeing he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it not ſufficiently, God made his Word <note n="a" place="bottom">1 Joh. 5. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>to become Fleſh,</hi> that it might be the better underſtood by an Organ ſutable to our Senſes. Jeſus Chriſt therefore is no other thing but the Word <note n="b" place="bottom">Joh. 1. 14. 16.</note> which <note n="c" place="bottom">Rev. 19. 13.</note> communicates to Man this Love that is in God; and the Holy Spirit <note n="d" place="bottom">1 Joh. 4. 9.</note> is the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom' that gives the Underſtanding to comprehend this Love. Behold the three Perſons that muſt be known in God, theſe are, the <hi>LOVE,</hi> the <hi>WORD</hi> that declares this Love, and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NDERSTANDING,</hi> that comprehends it. Now the Eſſence of Love, was from all Eterniry; But Men cou'd not know it but ſince the Creation, and even then imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Therefore the Goodneſs of God found out the Means to make it known by this humane Body which he took for this end <note n="e" place="bottom">Eph. 1. 17.</note> when he came to treat familiarly with Men; he becoming Man to make them ſee manifeſtly how much he lov'd them: And not being yet ſatisfied with this, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate this Love ſo ſenſibly, he <note n="f" place="bottom">Joh. 3. 19.</note> moreover ſends his Holy Spirit to teach them all things. You ſhall know him, Sir, by the principal Qualities of God, which are <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> which are always inſeparable from the Spirit of God. Remark well, if what is told you, be ſtill accompanied with theſe three Qualities.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>If the Holy Spirit comes into the World in Fleſh, as Jeſus Chriſt did at his Birth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> No, Sir, there is no need of his coming in the Fleſh, to communicate himſelf to Men as Jeſus Chriſt did; becauſe he comes not to ſhew them any new thing for working out their Salvation, Jeſus Chriſt, having ſufficiently taught them all things, tho' Men have not comprehended it; and now the Holy Spirit comes to give unto the Mind the Underſtanding of the ſame things which Jeſus Chriſt taught while he was on Earth. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as Jeſus Chriſt came not to deſtroy the Law of God, but <note n="g" place="bottom">Joh. 16. 13.</note> to perfect it, ſo the Holy Spirit comes not now to deſtroy the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, but to <note n="h" place="bottom">Matth. 5. 17.</note> perfect<note n="g" place="bottom">Eph. 5. 9.</note>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:104476:190"/>
it, and to give the perfect Underſtanding of it to all thoſe who will receive it. 'Tis not Needful that for this end he take a Humane Body; becauſe he brings no new Words but new Notices, that may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Mens Spirits. Theſe Notices being ſpiritual have no need of a natural Body that they may be communicated to the Spirits of Men. If you wou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, Sir, you muſt become a Child, and <note n="i" place="bottom">Gal. 4. 6.</note> ſubmit your ſelf wholly to God, and then you will find the Effects. But never let your ſelf be deceived by falſe Appearances: For there are now many falſe Prophets that come in God's Name, and are of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Satan, as I told you formerly. Try al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways if they who ſpeak to you do poſſeſs theſe three Qualities of God: Thereby you ſhall aſſuredly diſcover them. For if you let your ſelf be amuſed with good Words, or even by the Gifts of Propheſies or Miracles, the Devil can counterfeit enough to deceive you. Reject alſo all thoſe who praiſe or flatter you: Becauſe the Devil does ordinarily uſe theſe Means to deceive thoſe whom he deſires to gain to himſelf. The Spirit of God is always firm and true, full of Righteouſneſs and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There is no need that he make himſelf viſible to the Eyes of the Fleſh, he ſhall be ſufficiently felt by the Sentiments of the Soul, and the Eyes of the Spirit. He ſhall illuminate all Fleſh, and enlighten the Spirits of all thoſe who will hear and follow him. But there muſt be an humble Heart, and a Spirit entirely yielded up to God.</p>

                  <hi>to beware of falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, that they will ſeduce and deceive many.</hi> It is not as to <hi>Turks, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> or <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt bids us <hi>be ſo much upon our Guard,</hi> but falſe Chriſtians who ſit in the Throne of God.

                  <hi>the Abomination of Deſolation is in the Sanctuary</hi> cannot reſiſt the Devil, becauſe he reſiſts the known Truth, and ſo commits a Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt: For this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination</hi> is ſo true and manifeſt that no body can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it, but they who are obſtinate in Sin, and will die without Penitence, blindly preſuming of their Salvation, without deſiring to diſcover the Truth which is now ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes. The Holy Spirit who is now come to bring

into the World the Light of Truth, clearly diſcovers all things, and ſhall make manifeſt the Lyes and Defects of thoſe who are believed to be the Church, if the People will only give ear to the Truth, and not continue obſtinately in the Perſuaſions which they blindly received: For ſuch ſhall be deſtroyed <note n="d" place="bottom">Rev. 21. 8.</note> with <hi>Sorcerers;</hi> not that they ſhall commit the ſame Sins with thoſe <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> which poiſon others, but becauſe of their Unbelief, they ſhall perſiſt to believe and follow theſe falſe Prophets, who ſhall lead them into the Depth of their own Miſeries, and this by the juſt Judgment of God; becauſe they <hi>loved</hi>

               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>How I might avoid theſe falſe Bretheren, with whom I muſt daily converſe? and if I ought to have an ill Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all?</hi>

All theſe Marks, Sir, will make you eaſily diſcern with what Spirit thoſe are led with whom you muſt converſe, that you may not let your ſelf be adviſed by any erroneous Spirits, who are now ſo numerous, and in the higheſt Places and Dignities: Becauſe the Devil being ſo powerful, he ſtill prefers his own to Honours and Offices, that by theſe Means he may gain the more Followers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I adviſed you heretofore to abandon all, that you may not continue in ſo great Perils as there are now in converſing with Men.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That I had a long time agoe quitted the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of worldly and evil Men; but as for thoſe who ſeem'd to me to be good Men, I had never a hard Thought of them, and I could hardly believe that they belonged to the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> If none but Worldlings and wicked Men cou'd deceive us, Jeſus Chriſt wou'd not have ſo often ſaid, <note n="h" place="bottom">Matth. 24. 4, 5, 11, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of thoſe who come to you in my Name and deceive many, yeae, even if it were poſſible the very Elect.</hi> Theſe Words make appear ſufficiently that it is not Worldlings and wicked Men, of whom Jeſus Chriſt ſays ſo often, <hi>Be not deceived;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all good Men do abhor theſe Worldlings and wicked Men: They are therefore out of Hazard of being deceived by them. But theſe devout Perſons, or who wear Religious Habits, being nevertheleſs in the Devil's Service, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many under theſe falſe Appearances. It is with juſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that Jeſus Chriſt calls our Times <hi>dangerous,</hi> wherein the Dangers are ſo cover'd and diſguis'd with great Advantages, that the one can ſcarcely be diſcerned from the other. We will eſteem it a great Happineſs to have ſome Friend a Prieſt

or a Religious Perſon, or plac'd in ſome Dignity, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man of Honour and Learning, will give us his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Counſel, both as to our ſpiritual and temporal Good: Nevertheleſs this Perſon ſhall ſometimes be engaged to the Devil to do all the Miſchief he can. Is not this a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous thing? For we take their Counſel as if it came from God himſelf; and it comes directly from the Devil, who makes us follow his Will under the Pretence of its being the Will of God. Was it not needful, Sir, that Jesus Chriſt ſhou'd ſo often and ſo preciſely warn us <hi>to take heed of theſe Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> to which no Perils, neither from the Wicked nor from viſible Devils, are to be compar'd? becauſe all good Men will always reſiſt them: But theſe falſe Bretheren who come in Chriſt's Name, wou'd deceive the very Elect, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Sir, truſt no body, tho' they ſhou'd ſay, <hi>I am Chriſt:</hi> For Chriſt is not here and there, but only in the Doctrine <note n="i" place="bottom">John 14. 21, 23.</note> that he left us by his Word. He who believes any other thing, is deceived.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That if this were true, many Souls would be deceived; becauſe all they who profeſs to ſerve God, do follow the Counſel and Direction of ſome Man; and if he be of thoſe who belong to the Devil, they may deliver many Souls to Satan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, this is lamentable in our Days, wherein they have introduc'd theſe Directions of Men, by which ſo many are led to Damnation, even tho they were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by ſome Sorcerer, they are at leaſt turned away from God to adhere to Men. This is a great Hindrance to Vertue, and the Salvation of Souls: For as long as we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the Creatures <note n="k" place="bottom">Cant. 3. 2, 4.</note> we ſhall never find God. The one muſt go out before the other enter; and theſe Guides inſtead of leading Souls to God do withdraw them from him, even tho' they were good Men; becauſe God is jealous, and will not ſuffer a Rival, nor our Hearts to be ſeparated or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. If ſo many Souls be engag'd to the Devil by theſe Directions, it is becauſe they choſe rather to be lov'd by Men than God. This gives the Devil Power to gain them by the Means of theſe Directors, who are much more lov'd and follow'd than God is: For he is often forgotten, that they may remember theſe Men. Wives eſteem them more than their Husbands; Daughters more than Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104476:193"/>
and Mother, and Men take more of their Counſel than that of Jeſus Chriſt: Thus every one furniſhes Matter for the Devil to be deceiv'd by him. It is by this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Door he enters to make himſelf univerſal Emperour of the whole World. He had gain'd many before the Coming of Jeſus Chriſt; but ſince he ſlipt into the Church by theſe Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he poſſeſſes all, the Wicked with their own Will, and the Good indirectly by the Conduct of his Adherents, whom he has introduc'd into the Church: For Jeſus Chriſt did never eſtabliſh ſuch Directions in his Church, nor yet his Apoſtles, nor their Diſciples. If this had been an Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Spirit, it wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d have been obſerv'd by the Primitive Chriſtians, who had more Zeal to gain Souls to God than theſe new Directors have: For they rather draw them to themſelves than lead them to God. This often makes the Guides and thoſe who are led by them to periſh and go both together to the Devil.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>By what Means I might avoid the Seduction of theſe falſe Prophets, ſince they had the chief Ranks in the Church? how I might diſcover them from the true ones? If the one be Prieſts and Religious Perſons as well as the other?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> It will be very hard for to diſcern them, unleſs you read diligently the ancient Prophets,: There you will find how the true and how the falſe Prophets have ſpoken: For both the one and the other are this Day guided by the ſame Spirits. The holy Prophets were and ſtill will be led <note n="l" place="bottom">2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> by the Holy Spirit; and the falſe ones were and ſtill will be led and directed by the Devil <note n="m" place="bottom">1 Kings 22. 21, 22.</note>, as well at preſent as under the old Law. There is only this difference of times, that then there were many holy Prophets, and now there are few or none; becauſe the Number of the Falſe is ſo encreaſt that they have almoſt ſwallowed up the Good. And as God is not viſible by the Eyes of the Body, neither is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil viſible after that Manner, both being inviſible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; who nevertheleſs render themſelves viſible by their <note n="n" place="bottom">Gal. 5. 19, 22. 2 Cor. 6. 7. 13. 8.</note> Operations: For he who is guided by God, will ſtill ſpeak (<hi>o</hi>) the Truth without regarding whether it pleaſe or diſpleaſe Men: On the contrary, he who is led by the Devil, will ſtill ſpeak <note n="p" place="bottom">1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 5, 6. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3.</note> as Men are willing to hear.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104476:193"/>
Remark well, Sir, in the holy Scripture; you will find <note n="q" place="bottom">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 12, 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 14. 23. 17, &amp;c.</note> that all the falſe Prophets did then always tell good News, and promiſed to every one Peace, Proſperity and Aſſurance whereby they deceived all the World. This is even pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed at preſent: For if you take notice of all theſe Prieſts and Religious Perſons, you ſhall hear them always promiſing Peace and Safety to every one, and that even in temporal Affairs, whether as to the State or as to particular Perſons: You hear them always telling good News, and promiſing that all ſhall go well: So that if you remark the Diſcourſes of theſe falſe Prophets of the old Law, and the Preachers and Confeſſors at preſent, you ſhall hear them all ſpeak almoſt the ſame Language: For the moſt Pious now-a-days ſtudy to pleaſe Men, and to tell them things agreeable to their Senſes, and hereby they deſtroy all the World: For if they were in the Spirit of God, they wou'd tell the Truth, and wou'd preach to all the World <note n="r" place="bottom">Matth. 24. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>that the Abomination is in the Sanctuary, and that it is high time to turn to God. That</hi>

                  <hi>that great Statue of the Church which Sin has rendered abominable in the ſight of God; and alſo that the Life of Chriſtians is very far from true Chriſtianity; and that the beſt of them live in a Preſumption of their Salvation, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Which is moſt true: But inſtead of doing this, they praiſe and exalt the Church as if ſhe were holy; and they perſuade People that they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians when they are baptized; and tho' they do not at all live according to the Rules of true Chriſtianity, that yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they ſhall be ſaved. In which they deceive and ſeduce them: For there are no true Chriſtians, but they <note n="u" place="bottom">2 John 9.</note> who obſerve the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and no body can be ſaved, but <note n="x" place="bottom">Matth. 7. 21. 19. 17.</note> he who keeps the Commandments of God, the firſt of which, is, <hi>to love God with all our Heart, and our Neighbour as our ſelves,</hi> which no body does: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs all theſe falſe Prophets tell the People that they ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly be ſaved, and that all ſhall go well with them. Is not this a ſure Mark to diſcern falſe Prophets from the true? becauſe the Falſe flatter us always for our Ruin, and the True reprove us for our Salvation. He that wou'd deliver him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:104476:194"/>
from being deceived, muſt diligently examine whether theſe Church-men ſpeak to us according as they are willing to hear, or if they truly reprove what is blame-worthy, of which ſort we ſhall find ſo very few, that almoſt none will ſpeak the Truth when it is diſpleaſing to People, eſpecially to thoſe who are in Places and Dignities. For this cauſe our Times are juſtly called <hi>perilous Times</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="bottom">2 Tim 4. 1.</note>, ſince the Evil is ſo maſqu'd with Vertue: For if the Evil were manifeſt, there wou'd be no danger; becauſe all good Men wou'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it, and ſo wou'd put themſelves out of Hazard of being deceived: whereas when it is covered over with Piety and Vertue, they think ſometimes they wou'd do evil if they ſhou'd look on it as evil. Therefore Jeſus Chriſt has great Reaſon to ſay to us ſo often, <hi>Beware of falſe Prophets that come in my Name, and be not deceived by them;</hi> and alſo to tell us <note n="z" place="bottom">Matth. 24. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>that we muſt get out of</hi> Judaea; that is, out of the Church, <hi>when we ſhall ſee the Abomination of Deſolation.</hi> For this Cauſe I think, Sir, it is now time to flee.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>If it would not be better to abide in the Church, and endeavour to make others like my ſelf ſee the Deceit and Dangers in which they live, than by flying out of her to abandon them to theſe Perils?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> If you could illuminate them and make them ſee the Truth without deſtroying your ſelf, it would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to remain in her, tho' it ſhou'd coſt your Life; but there is no Appearance of prevailing with any, becauſe they are ſo obſtinate in their Sins, which they will not know: For if you ſhou'd tell any benefic'd Perſon in the Church that he is not a true Chriſtian, and that the Church has fallen away and become more <hi>Phariſaical</hi> than ever the true <hi>Phariſees</hi> were, they wou'd not believe you, but perſecute you; and your beſt Friends, the moſt Pious of them wou'd believe you were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Heretick, and that you wou'd alſo pervert them: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Darkneſs is ſo great that they take Lies for Truth without perceiving it; and they ſhou'd eſteem that to be evil which were moſt good. Therefore you wou'd do others no good, and you wou'd do evil to your ſelf, and draw upon your ſelf many Perſecutions, and bring your ſelf in hazard of falling from the ſtreight Truth thro' an Infatuation of Spirit, with which the Devil directs every one, and hinders them from knowing or diſcovering the Truth. Therefore Jeſus
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104476:194"/>
Chriſt ſaid very well, <note n="a" place="bottom">Matth. 7. 6.</note> that we ought not to give Roſes to Swine nor Childrens Bread to Dogs <note n="b" place="bottom">Matth. 15. 26.</note>: The Swine are Perſons who wou'd make a Dunghil of the moſt fragrant Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and Dogs are they who wou'd tear the Truth by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and Calumnies. It wou'd not therefore be adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at this time to remain in the Church, when Jeſus Chriſt adviſed <hi>to depart and flee out of her:</hi> For there you ſhall not find Children who will receive the Word of God, which is the Bread of our Soul, but Maſters and Miſtreſſes who believe they are more wiſe and more juſt than the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That it ſeemed to me, we were wanting in Charity, when we minded only our own Salvation, and that it was grievous alſo to follow God, without any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, you will not act againſt Charity, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from Chriſtians now; becauſe they are obſtinate in their Courſes to which they are habituated, and in which they will die without Repentance, and therefore it will avail nothing to preach to them: And the Holy Spirit tells us ſomewhere <note n="c" place="bottom">Iſa. 58. 9, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>that we muſt leave off to point out and ſpeak that which does not profit; and that the God of Peace will very ſhortly</hi>

                  <hi>bruiſe Satan under our Feet.</hi> I underſtand hereby that it is no longer ſeaſonable to repreſent the Truth to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians now, becauſe they will reſiſt and quarrel the Truth, even when we wou'd make it known to them. It is to them we ought not to point out the Finger, nor to ſpeak; becauſe no Words, how true ſoever, will profit them any thing. Yet for all this, you ſhall not remain all alone in following God; but <note n="e" place="bottom">Rev. 7. 4,-9. 14. 1,-15.</note> a great many will follow him with you; but you muſt go among the <hi>Jews,</hi> where many will be converted and receive the Truth, and will flee from the Spirit of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, in which they have been detained for ſo long a time; For of God's People they became his Enemies: For this cauſe they were ſcattered and divided: But by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Spirit <note n="f" place="bottom">Iſa. 44. 3. 59. 20, 21.</note> they ſhall recover the Light and <note n="g" place="bottom">Iſa. 40. 11.

And becauſe theſe are only guilty of the Sin againſt the Son of Man, it ſhall <note n="i" place="bottom">Matth. 12. 32.</note> be forgiven them; whereas thoſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans will ſin now againſt the Holy Ghoſt: Therefore they ſhall not be forgiven in this World nor in the other. You need not then amuſe your ſelf any more about this Matter; I have made Trials enough, having accoſted the Perſons moſt renowned for Vertue among the Chriſtians, and I found not ſo much as one of them capable of receiving the Truth; they are ſo pre-occupied with their <hi>Roman</hi> Church, their Maxims, and ſeeming Vertues, that it may be ſaid of them <hi>that as Jannes and Jambres reſiſted the Truth, even ſo Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do reſiſt</hi> it in the ſame manner. You are the firſt who has heard me tell the Truth: For till now I cou'd not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it to any body. This did often trouble me and made me alſo reſolve to quit the Converſation of all Men, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel ſo long till I ſhou'd find ſome one to whom I might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Truth; Becauſe <hi>FOR THIS I AM BORN.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That therefore ſhe was obliged to declare the Truth to many, ſince ſhe was born for this end, and ſhe knew thoſe who were capable to receive it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, it is not my Buſineſs to enquire for Men; becauſe my Life conſiſts in my Recollection, from whence the Converſation of Men would withdraw me: For I know by Experience that all Creatures are a Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to me, and loſs of time. I love rather to remain alone: But if you will tranſmit to others the Truth which I have communicated to you, you are free to do it, or rather obliged to it: Becauſe God having permitted you to rencounter me, and given me time and Place to tell you ſo many diverſe things, I ſhall believe he will require of you that you impart them to others: But you muſt conſider well to whom; becauſe every one is not capable of ſo great things, and if you addreſs to ſome that are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Devil, of which there are ſo many at preſent, they will uſe you hardly, and conſult with all theſe Followers of Satan, to oppoſe and to ſtifle theſe Truths in their Cradle.

                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Yes, Sir, there is Hazard there as well as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; becauſe the Devil has thoſe who are in Covenant with him, in every Place, in every State, in every Sect, and under every Law: For he has run to and fro thro' all the Earth, and hath devoured many, as well among the <hi>Jews</hi> as among others: But I except the Good among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and I know certainly that theſe are more diſpoſed to receive the Truth than any others; becauſe they ſin thro' Ignorance: For they never knew that Jeſus Chriſt was the Son of God, and do not yet know it: For they look for this Son of God in Glory, and know not that he ſhall be the ſame who came already among them in Diſhonour. As ſoon as they ſhall diſcover this Truth <note n="a" place="bottom">Matth. 23. 38, 39.</note>, they ſhall return from their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile, and re-enter into the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſhall return to be God's People, in Excluſion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who having abuſed ſo many Privileges <note n="c" place="bottom">Rom. 11 21, 22, 23.</note> ſhall be cut off, and the <hi>Jews</hi> ſettled again on their Ruins.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>Wherefore the Chriſtians could not be reformed, that they might become the People of God as well as the</hi> Jews <hi>Converted, to take away their Crown?</hi>

the <hi>Jews</hi> have not done, They do yet fear and know God, and the Chriſtians do neither: For they preach publickly that to obtain the Pardon of our Sins, we are not obliged to love God; that to ſave us from going to Hell, it is enough to have ſelf-love; that this Fear of their Damnation is capable of procuring them the Pardon of their Sins and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and they utter a thouſand other Blaſphemies againſt God in every thing. This they can't do thro' Ignorance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe beſides the Law of God which they have received as well as the <hi>Jews:</hi> They have moreover the Law of the Goſpel and the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, which was left them in Writing for an everlaſting Memorial, which all Chriſtians ought ſtill to follow. The Chriſtians have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Faith to believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and that he came into the World, where he ſuffered Pains, Labours, Poverty and Contempt, was perſecuted, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſcourged, buffetted, and at laſt put to Death on a Croſs, as a Malefactor, and all this to give an Example <note n="d" place="bottom">1 Pet. 2. 20,—24.</note> to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that by following his Steps, they might enter into his Glory. They do believe all theſe things, and alſo that the ſame Son of God is really in the Sacrament of the Altar, with a great many other things contain'd in the <hi>Creed.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, againſt their Belief they live directly contrary to what Jeſus Chriſt taught them, and what they believe by the Command of God. If the <hi>Jews</hi> believed this, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, they would mourn for the Sins which they committed againſt him, and would follow his Example, (which <note n="e" place="bottom">Zach. 12. 10,—14.</note> ſhall very ſhortly come to paſs:) whereas the Chriſtians ſhall die obſtinate in their Sins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance.</p>
               <p>By which you may judge, Sir, that the <hi>Jews</hi> are much more diſpoſed to receive the Spirit of Truth ſo ſoon as it ſhould be communicated to them, than the Chriſtians who oppoſe the known Truth. They know that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God and that he is in the Sacrament of the Altar, and they ſhew him leſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect than a Servant would do to the meaneſt Maſter, and eat and ſwallow him as a Piece of Bread.</p>
               <p>How would you have theſe Perſons to be reformed, ſince they would reform all the World, looking on themſelves as Gods of the Earth, and Children of the true God, while
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104476:197"/>
they are led by the Devil? This they will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, chuſing rather to periſh in their Darkneſs, than to give ear to the Truth: whereas thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> would gladly hear what will enlighten them, and would be bettered by knowing the Truth: For many good Spirits among them aſpire after it, <note n="f" place="bottom">Jer. 31. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>hungring and thirſting after Righteouſneſs,</hi> which when they ſee and know, they will immediately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; becauſe nothing but Ignorance hinders them from reſigning themſelves wholly to God: Whereas the Chriſtians thro' pure Obſtinacy in their Sins, will not do it: So that if I ſhould go to the College of Cardinals at <hi>Rome,</hi> and tell them that I come from God to advertiſe them that they are not true Chriſtians, and that Jeſus Chriſt taught another way of living, than what they obſerve, and that to be ſaved, we muſt of Neceſſity follow Jeſus, they would preſently ſeize on me as a Criminal, and put me to death, if I would not retract my Words, tho' they knew well enough they were true; even tho' they ſhould evidently perceive that I had the holy Spirit, they would oppoſe this Truth, that they might maintain their Errours. How then, Sir would you have ſuch Perſons to be converted?</p>
               <p>God will never force any body, having given to all Men their Free-Will, to uſe it according as they pleaſe. If theſe Chriſtians will acknowledge no other God but their own Authority, they would deal hardly with God himſelf if he ſhou'd come to ſpeak againſt it. How cou'd God in Juſtice reform theſe Chriſtians, who will not be reformed, loving rather to periſh in their Blindneſs, than to receive the Light, and this of their deliberate Will? Whereas thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> are ſtill looking for and aſpiring after the Coming of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in Glory: Tho' in many things they err, Nevertheleſs they perſevere in this Hope which will infallibly come to paſs <note n="g" place="bottom">Rom, 11. 26. Rev. 1. 7.</note> to them, provided they <note n="h" place="bottom">Hoſ. 5. 15.</note> acknowledge the Fault they committed in putting Jeſus Chriſt to Death.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>Whether there was any Sect or Nation more capable of receiving the Truth, than the</hi> Jews, <hi>who were a People rejected by all Nations, and deſpiſed by every body, as unworthy of the Converſation of all good Men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, I know not preciſely what the <hi>Jews</hi> are; but as a Friend I can tell you, that they are yet the People who love God more than any other. Their being rejected and deſpiſed by every body, ſhall perhaps ſerve for a Satisfaction to God for the Sins which they committed in putting him to death: Becauſe this is God's Way, <note n="k" place="bottom">1 Cor. 1. 27, 28.</note> to chuſe always the Things that are moſt vile and moſt contemned by the World. I do not at all doubt but the <hi>Jews</hi> will be the firſt in the Kingdom of Heaven; becauſe they have been ſo humbled and deſpiſed in this World; in which they have imitated Jeſus Chriſt more than the Chriſtians; who honour themſelves more than God, and every one eſteems them as the People of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Jeſus Chriſt has told us by the Mouth of his Mother, <note n="m" place="bottom">Luke 1. 52.</note> 
                  <hi>that he will put down the Mighty from their Seats, and will exalt the Humble.</hi> This makes me believe that this People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo humbled through all the World, ſhall be exalted, <note n="n" place="bottom">Iſa. 62. 2, 3.</note> above all others; and that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church which is placed in the higheſt Chair on Earth <note n="o" place="bottom">Iſ. 47.

                  <hi>that he who exalts himſelf, ſhall be abaſed; and he who humbles himſelf, ſhall be exalted.</hi> It muſt needs be, Sir, that all the Words of God be fulfilled in all Reſpects. The <hi>Jews</hi> having been the moſt humbled People among Men, <note n="r" place="bottom">Iſa. 60. 14, 15, 16.</note> ought to be according to the Juſtice and Truth of God, the moſt Exalted, as it ſhall <note n="s" place="bottom">

called unto it: But the <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathens ſhall ſit down there, and the Chriſtians ſhall be thruſt out; becauſe they would not obey God's Call; who having called them to Chriſtianity, they would not conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto it: Therefore they ſhall never taſte of his Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; becauſe this is the laſt Mercy of God, who will bring to his Table the Sick rather than the Whole, who reſiſt his Will, as the Chriſtians do now.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>If I might declare to the</hi> Jews <hi>all the things ſhe had told me, as coming from God by a Prophetical Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, I am not Prophetical as the Ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were, who ſpoke of very obſcure things: So that many times, neither <note n="a" place="bottom">Jer. 30. 24.</note> the People, nor <note n="b" place="bottom">Dan. 12. 8.</note> they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves underſtood well what they ſignified; becauſe the Time was not yet come to give the full Underſtanding of them: But at preſent, in this Fulneſs of Time, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares his Secrets very manifeſtly, that every one may underſtand them: So that you muſt not ſay, Sir, that you are ſent in the Name of ſome Prophet: becauſe the Things that I have told you, are ſuch plain and lively Truths, that no body of a good Judgment can doubt, but the Holy Spirit muſt have inſpired them: For if they believe that God is Truth, my Words are ſo ſenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from it, that all Nations, both great and ſmall, muſt confeſs, that in all my Diſcourſes, the Truth is in its Source: And this Truth being <note n="d" place="bottom">2 Pet. 2. 16.</note> God; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God aſſuredly, who declares theſe Truths: For the Devil is the Father of Lyes, and Nature finds out ſtill Excuſes, either in its own Sins, or in thoſe it loves. By which you may ſee evidently, that Truth comes imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God, tho' it ſhou'd come out of an Aſs <note n="e" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13. 8.</note> as once it did. Therefore you need not ſo much ſtay to judge whether I have the Spirit of Propheſie, as you ought to examine very narrowly whether I ſpeak the Truth: For that is always God. The Propheſies of the Ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, will all of them very ſhortly be fulfilled. There is no Need of any longer having obſcure Propheſies; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are fallen into the laſt Times, wherein <note n="e" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13. 8.</note> all the<note place="bottom">(<hi>c</hi>) 1. <hi>John</hi> 5. 6.</note>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:104476:198"/>
Propheſies ſhall ceaſe, and we ſhall ſee them all entirely accompliſhed, and we ſhall not receive any more new ones: Becauſe the King of all the Prophets will him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf govern his People, and will give an entire Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment to all that has been propheſied of him. So that, Sir you ſhall not need to ſay, that you hold theſe Truths from a Prophet; becauſe the Work does always bear Witneſs who its Workman has been. Even ſo when the Truth is lively declared, it gives ſufficient Evidence by what Maſter it is formed. I cannot conceal that I derive all my Wiſdom from God; becauſe I never learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing from Men: But there is no Need to ſay that I have a Prophetick Spirit, when God gives Reaſons and Compariſons to explain it after the Manner of Men.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That in many of her Diſcourſes ſhe ſpoke of the Future, and of the Time to come, and that as to thoſe, we could not know yet, whether they were true or not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, what is to come, is as true as what I have already experienced. Receive all with Humility of Heart, and you ſhall ſee in its Time as clear as the Sun, that all ſhall be accompliſhed: For God cannot lye. The holy Scriptures muſt ſay the ſame things that I ſay: Becauſe all proceeds from one and the ſame Spirit, and the <hi>Jews</hi> will underſtand me yet better than you do, becauſe they are more vers'd in the holy Scriptures. I think if I ſpoke to them, their Hearts would be over-joy'd and raviſh'd with Pleaſure, to know that ſo great a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is to befal them, as to become the People of God, and to ſuffer for his Love, till they ſhall ſee him come in Glory, with his Angels, to render to every one according to his Works. The Chriſtians have this in their Creed; which contains the twelve Articles of Faith, <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt who is aſcended into Heaven, ſhall come again to judge the Quick and the Dead:</hi> And notwithſtanding they will not believe it, tho' they ſay it daily: Or, they imagine that this Coming ſhall be ſo ſuddenly, as if the Judgment were to be by Way of Enchantment, and that it were to pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s in an Inſtant, or in one Day. Theſe are fooliſh Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For the Judgment is already begun, and I know not how many Years it ſhall laſt; only at the End <note n="f" place="bottom">Matth, 24. 30.</note> Jeſus Chriſt ſhall appear upon the Earth in Glory and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104476:199"/>
Majeſty, and ſo ſhall <note n="g" place="bottom">Rev. 12. 13.</note> converſe with Men, who ſhall be all made happy with his glorious Preſence, which ſhall fill them with Glory, and ſhall wipe away all their Tears and Griefs to bring them into Joy that ſhall never end. They who will not believe this, are Enemies of their own Good; becauſe there is nothing in the World that can give them <note n="h" place="bottom">Rom. 8. 18. 2 Theſ. 1. 5.</note> more Conſtancy to ſuffer, than the Hopes they have, that in the End they ſhall ſee the glorious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth. All ſorts of Conſolations are comprehended in this.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That the</hi> Jews <hi>look for the Coming of their Meſſias in Glory, that he would come to reign and abide with them: but that the Chriſtians look'd for him only to come and judge the World, and to go away again, carrying along with him all the Bleſſed,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall not be diſappointed of their Expectation: They ſhall ſee their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in Glory, <note n="i" place="bottom">Ezech. 34. 23, 24.</note> who will govern them upon Earth, converſing, eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them: For he himſelf ſays, <hi>that</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="bottom">Luke 12 37.</note> 
                  <hi>he will make his Friends ſit down at his Table; and that he will riſe up and ſerve them;</hi> now in this Paradiſe, which the Chriſtians imagine, there ſhall be no need of ſitting at a Table, nor eating nor being ſerved: And alſo when Jeſus Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples <note n="l" place="bottom">Matth. 26. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>that he would drink no more of the Fruit of the Vine, till he drank it new in the Kingdom of his Father;</hi> he means certainly of the Earth; which ſhall be the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that God will give to the Body of Jeſus Chriſt: Becauſe in the Divine Kingdom, there can be no Planting of Vines nor making of Preſſes to drink Wine there. Truly, Sir, the Chriſtians are ſuperſtitious in many things, and they judge raſhly of all that they do not comprehend. They may clearly ſee by the holy Scriptures that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall have a glorious Reign, and that he <note n="m" place="bottom">Rev. 21. 25.</note> will be the Reſtorer of all things, and alſo the Saviour of Men; Becauſe all <note n="n" place="bottom">Acts 3. 21.</note> the Prophets with the Apoſtles and other Saints have ſufficiently ſpoken of theſe things which ſhall certainly come to paſs: For the Scripture cannot err or fail: But becauſe they have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:104476:199"/>
the compleat Knowledge of them to explain all, the Chriſtians Fancy in their Speculations; that this ſhall come to paſs in a divine and incomprehenſible Paradiſe without reflecting that the divine Kingdom cou'd not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe as God, he always poſſeſs'd it, and has no need of being promiſed what he poſſeſſes: For Poſſeſſion is always greater than Promiſe; for that is wholly accompliſhed by Poſſeſſion. Therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Jeſus Chriſt muſt be on Earth; where he ſhall reign <note n="o" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 29. 71. 8. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 9.</note> over all Men, ſhall ſave them, and re-eſtabliſh all things; becauſe in the divine Heaven there is nothing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed: For nothing was ever ſpoiled there: Nor any to be ſaved; becauſe all that are there, have Salvation; and whither, can they imagine that God ſhou'd carry the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him, ſince he comprehends all things, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be contain'd by any thing? They ſpeak of God, as if he had a Cloſet ſomewhere for his Retirement.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That the</hi> Jews <hi>had look'd a long time for the</hi> Meſſias; <hi>but that the Chriſtians did not expect him till the Day of Judgment and the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, the <hi>Jews</hi> have done well always to wait for their <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> For a Thing is then more loved when it is long deſired. It is a conſtant Faith that makes them perſevere in this Expectation, which ſhall be recompenſed with a great Joy, when they ſhall receive the Fruit of their Hope: For it is not vain, but very well founded on all the Holy Scriptures; which is the moſt ſolid Foundation in the whole World, ſince it is the Word of an <hi>all-wiſe, all-good</hi> and <hi>all-mighty</hi> God: But when the Chriſtians look for their Saviour only on a certain Day, <note n="p" place="bottom">Luke 12. 45, 46.</note> they are not ſo diligent to prepare for his Coming, which they imagine to be yet far from them. They confound divers things together, which have no Relation to one another; and they make but one Day of the Plagues, the Judgment, the Reſurrection of the Dead, and the Coming of Jeſus Chriſt in Glory; as if all theſe things were to be done together: But they are greatly deceived. <note n="q" place="bottom">1 Cor. 14. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>we have not a God of Confuſion,</hi> who ſurpriſes Perſons
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104476:200"/>
at unawares, confounding them by precipitating things: On the contrary, all his Ways are ſo well regulated and ordered, that there is not a Devil in Hell that cou'd ſay in truth that God gave him the leaſt Surprize, or that he could find in all his Works the leaſt Injuſtice or Want of Goodneſs and Truth. This being ſo, how cou'd it be that God ſhou'd ſend all his Plagues in one Day, that no body might have Leiſure to be converted, being ſurpriſed ſo ſuddenly with ſo many different Evils as to be chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, judged, raiſed again, ſaved or damned all in one Day? If God has been juſt, good and true from all Eternity, wou'd he become impious at the laſt Day? This cannot be: But Men miſtake him, and every one judges of him according to their Fancy: For if they wou'd judge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, they wou'd not dare to ſay that God cou'd ſurpriſe Men to judge and chaſtize them ſo ſuddenly. I wou'd glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ask Chriſtians, where they find it Written, how long the Judgment ſhall laſt?</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That no body had diſtinguiſhed theſe Times, and that all Chriſtians believed that the Judgment, the Chaſtiſement, the Reſurrection of the Dead and the Coming of Jeſus in Glory, were but one and the ſame thing, and that they ſhould come to paſs all together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, They are very much deceived: For theſe are all divers things which muſt come to paſs at different Times: For firſt of all the Judgment is, when God ſaw the univerſal Iniquity of all the Men of the World, and that not ſo much as one knew and lov'd him; he by ſtreight Juſtice judged and condemned the World: And that he might not ſurpriſe any, <note n="r" place="bottom">2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> he delays the Execution of his Sentence, that Men might diſcover by Experience that the World is judged, ſeeing the Evils to encreaſe, and Peoples Amendment deſperate. This is the greateſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to verifie that the Sentence is irrevocable. God does this, that Men remarking theſe Truths, may quake for Fear, and be converted unto him, that they may obtain his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, at leaſt every one for their own particular. I believe, Sir, that theſe thirty Years the World is judged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; and that now the Time is come to put this Sentence in Execution. It will begin <note n="s" place="bottom">4 <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 16. 18, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 8.</note> with the Plague
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104476:200"/>
of War, and then that of Peſtilence, and after of Famine, that there may be time given to all Men of good Will to repent, and to take theſe Plagues in Penitence for their Sins, and by theſe Sufferings to find a Way to return to God with all their Heart and to riſe from Death to Life, that is to ſay, from Sin to Grace, as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall do by being converted firſt of all, that the Lord may find <note n="t" place="bottom">Iſa. 62. 6.</note> them watching at his Coming, and may ſay to them, <note n="u" place="bottom">Matth. 25. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant; becauſe thou haſt been faithful in a few things, I will ſet thee over great things: Enter into the Joy of thy Lord:</hi> Which Joy ſhall be recovered at the Coming of Jeſus Chriſt in Glory, who will overthrow <note n="x" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pſalm</hi> 97. 3, 4. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 4, 5. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7.</note> all Evil by the Brightneſs of his Coming, which ſhall be ſeen and underſtood by all the Men who ſhall then be remaining on the Earth. Thus it is that God orders theſe laſt things <note n="y" place="bottom">Wiſd. 11. 20.</note> with Weight and Meaſure, that he may ſtill exerciſe his Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth, even to the End of the World, waiting ſtill for Sinners to Repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous <note n="z" place="bottom">Ezech. 33. 11.</note> that they ſhou'd be converted and live. Whatever Men ſay, God will never depart from his eternal Qualities, and will not confound his laſt Works no more than he did his firſt: For he continues ſtill firm and conſtant in all his works. If Men will not know this, 'tis their own Fault, and the Effect of the ſtraying of their Minds: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it is time to open their Eyes: For the Plagues are begun.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That the</hi> Jews <hi>were wilfully obſtinate not to believe that Jeſus Chriſt was God, which the Chriſtians did believe aſſuredly; and conſequently they were nearer to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted than the</hi> Jews.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, the <hi>Jews</hi> are leſs obſtinate than the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; becauſe there is more Ground for their Unbelief than for that of the Chriſtians, who reject the Coming of Jeſus Chriſt in Glory, tho' it be verified by all the Holy Prophets, the Apoſtles and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who in ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Places declare his glorious Coming, and very few ſpeak of his Coming in Reproach. This makes the <hi>Jews</hi> doubtful, knowing that God never ſurpriſes any; but often
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104476:201"/>
foretells the things that muſt come to paſs; and they find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo frequently in the Holy Scripture the Propheſie of his Coming in Glory, and ſo ſeldom his Coming in Reproach, they have ſome fundamental Reaſons, for which they cannot believe his Coming in Reproach: But ſo ſoon as the Truth ſhall come to enlighten them, they will yield to it; becauſe they love it: Whereas the Chriſtians do formally reſiſt it, and wilfully impugn it, and will not believe what they read ſo often, nor hearken to the Light that is offered them thereupon; being deſirous to continue obſtinately in the Perſuaſions in which they have been trained, and blindly to believe the Sentiments of Mens preferring them to the Truth of God. So that the <hi>Jews</hi> will ſooner believe that Jeſus Chriſt is God, than the Chriſtians will believe that the ſame Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come to reign in Glory upon Earth, tho this Coming be much more to be deſired and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued than that Coming in Sufferings and Reproaches: For he who highly eſteems God, will be troubled to believe or ſee he ſhou'd be abaſed or deſpiſed, and become the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Men, he who deſerves all Honours in Heaven and Earth. Hereby the <hi>Jew's</hi> have more humane Ground not to believe the Coming of Jeſus Chriſt in Sufferings, than the Chriſtians have not to believe his Coming in Glory, which is more honourable, pleaſant and deſirable, tho' the <hi>Jews</hi> as well as the Chriſtians do very ill not to believe both the Comings of Jeſus Chriſt, which are equally true, both the one and the other.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her; <hi>That ſhe ſeem'd to hold the</hi> Jews <hi>Part more than the Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Pardon me, Sir, I am not partial; and if I were, I wou'd rather take the Chriſtians Part, among whom I am born, than that of the <hi>Jews</hi> whom I never ſaw. I hold only the Part of Truth without leaning to any Side; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have no Pretenſions upon Earth: Neither <hi>Jews</hi> nor Chriſtians will give me any thing: But God will judge me in Truth and Righteouſneſs: Therefore I will always obſerve it without Reſpect to any body. If I knew not that the <hi>Jews</hi> are more diſpoſed to receive the Truth than the Chriſtians, I wou'd not ſpeak to their Advantage: But I cannot conceal the Truth, when it is asked me. If you addreſs theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> you will find my Saying true: For I know nothing of my ſelf:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:104476:201"/>
All comes from a Source from whence no Lye can be drawn. I am not enclined for the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor for any other Sect in the World: For I know none of them that are well pleaſing to God: But I love thoſe beſt that are moſt diſpoſed to receive the Truth, and to be converted unto God, and I remark this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be more diſpoſed for this than any other: Which, in Truſt, I declare to you: Not that I may be lov'd or deſpiſed; but that I may ſimply declare the Truth as I know it. Make a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of it, Sir, and of all the other Things which I have told you, you will find them in their Time, all true: For I am not for telling things that are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant, or without Neceſſity. You will have Need after this, to know all that I have declared unto you. They will be very profitable for you, and for thoſe whom you ſhall judge capable of receiving them. Doubt nothing of them. Conceive and digeſt them all. You ſhall receive from them great Light in your Underſtanding, and Strength, and Nouriſhment to your Soul, and you ſhall ſtill enter farther into the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and of your ſelf, which ſhall be an Everlaſting Happineſs for you. Beware of being tempted to believe the Contrary: Becauſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will ſurprize you with falſe Appearances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Pretext of ſcrupulous Piety and Juſtice.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How the Holy Spirit gives his Light to the Soul.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Said to her; <hi>That I would not doubt of her Words; becauſe I believed that they all came from the Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Softly, Sir, all my Words come not from the Holy Spirit: For he does not dictate to me all the Words that I muſt pronounce; but the Subſtance of all that I ſay; becauſe I would never ſpeak otherwiſe than by his Motion; and no other Diſcourſes are neceſſary for me: For I have no Deſire to pleaſe any; and all that makes not for the Glory of God, ſeems to me a ſuperfluous and uſeleſs Thing. Therefore I do not willingly utter any Diſcourſe but theſe to which the Holy Spirit moves me: But he does not dictate to me all my Words. I have Need to expreſs my ſelf by Humane Reaſons or Compariſons; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe they could not underſtand me: For the Holy Spirit ſpeaks ſo ſuccinctly, that one Word makes me comprehend many things. He gives Subtilty to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to conceive great Things by one of his ſmall Motions. It is juſt as if one were in a fine Room<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well adorned with divers Furnitures and Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: But there were no Light in it whereby to ſee all theſe things. In ſuch a Caſe it wou'd require a great many Words, to make him who had never ſeen them, underſtand in particular all the fine things and Furniture that were in the Room, telling him here are ſuch and ſuch Pictures, ſuch Tables, ſuch Seats, and ſuch like Things; and yet we could not make him comprehend well the Beauty of this Furniture and Rarities: But if a Light were brought into the Room, tho it were but that of a Candle, in a Moment it would give more Knowledge of all the Things that are in the Room,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104476:202"/>
than all the Diſcourſes that were uttered to make them known. So it is with the Light of the Holy Spirit when it enters into a Soul, it makes it know and comprehend all things very clearly: Nevertheleſs theſe things cannot be ſeen by Souls who are yet in the Darkneſs and Obſcurity of their own Paſſions; Many Words and Diſcourſes muſt be uſed to make them underſtand the Rarities that are in the Works of God. It is thus, Sir, that I tell you all my Words do not come immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the Holy Spirit: But indeed all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what I ſay; Becauſe I never had any other Maſter, nor any other Study, but that of purging my Soul from Earthly Affections. By this I received the Light of all the things of which I have ſpoken to you with many more, which nevertheleſs I could not make you underſtand, but by Words and Diſcourſes, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to your Capacity, which are not all preciſely endited by the Holy Spirit Word for Word, except that in general they are produced by the Gift of Wiſdom, which <note n="a" place="bottom">Iſa. 11. 2.</note> the Holy Spirit always brings along with him into the Soul where he reſides, giving it the Skill to expreſs it ſelf, and to make Divine Things be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by thoſe who are in Darkneſs. Therefore, Sir, you are not deceived in believing that my Words come from the Holy Spirit: For it is true, if you take them in Subſtance: But if you would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a preciſe enditing of Words, the Enemies of the Truth might ſurprize you in ſome Terms not well expreſs'd, or ſome Word of a contrary Signification, or other Faults of my Language, which come from my Weakneſs or Ignorance: For the Holy Spirit can commit no Faults. He always gives his Light perfect and compleat to the Soul that is purified from it ſelf: But he does not always give preciſe Words and Terms to make it be underſtood by others; becauſe it does not remain always preciſely hearkning to the Endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Holy Spirit, being often diſtracted by Earthly Objects, which divert it ſometimes without its being aware; and in this Diverſion it may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit many Faults, even tho' it had received the Holy
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104476:203"/>
Spirit. For this Cauſe our Life is always dangerous, and we ought <note n="b" place="bottom">1 Pet. 5. 8.</note> ſtill to watch that we be not ſurprized by our Enemies.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>How ſhe could ſee by the Light of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, things which conſiſt in Matter of Fact, as the Deportment of the</hi> Jews, <hi>and Chriſtians, and others?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, this is manifeſted to my Underſtanding even as Divine Things are, without any Diſtinction, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that the Soul receives more Contentment in conceiving and underſtanding the Things of God, than thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Men; tho' all come from the ſame Source, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they have different Effects: For when God ſhews to the Soul his ſtraight <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> his univerſal <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> his pure <hi>Truth;</hi> it is filled with Wiſdom and ſolid Vertue by thoſe which it remarks in God; and when he makes it ſee his <hi>Glory, Majeſty,</hi> and his <hi>Almighty Power,</hi> the Soul is filled with Joy, Honour and Strength, in Conſideration of the Qualities of its God; But he no ſooner makes appear to it the deplorable State to which Men are reduced now, than the Soul is afflicted, and thirſts with a Deſire to ſee them converted unto God, who alſo ſhews unto it all the neceſſary Means for this Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as a Phyſician cannot rightly cure a ſick Perſon or Patient, without ſeeing firſt the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, or laying open the Sores of his Evil; even ſo does God towards a charitable Soul, that is touched with a ſenſible Regret to ſee its Neighbour periſh, and with a Deſire to ſuccour him with all its Power. Then God makes it ſee the Sores, that is, the Faults and Sins of his People more diſtinctly than if it converſed daily with them, even though it has never ſeen them by the Eyes of the Body. Nevertheleſs it knows them better than they who converſe daily with them; Becauſe the Light of God pierces to the Bottom of Souls; and the Sight of Men perceives only outward things. Therefore many are often deceived, and take what is falſe for true: But God judges always with an upright Judgment: And when the Soul has Bowels of Charity to help its Neighbour, God ſhews it the State in which he lives, and alſo the Means by which he may riſe again from his Fall. This
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104476:203"/>
is the Reaſon why God makes Matters of Fact, which reſpect our Neigbour, to be as well perceived as divine Things, and that by the Light of the Holy Spirit, which is ſo much the brighter the farther it is removed from Humane Light and Natural Knowledge. For this Cauſe, Sir, I retire ſo much from Men, and will learn nothing from them; becauſe their Wiſdom hinders and obſcures the Light of the Holy Spirit; and according as I am removed from them, accordingly I approach to true Knowledge: For ſometimes I wou'd tell you better what paſſes among the <hi>Turks</hi> or other remote Places, than what is done in my Preſence: For my Eyes may deceive me: But the Holy Spirit cannot deceive me.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>How this Light had its Original? If the Holy Spirit did immediately declare things to the Soul, or if the Soul did propoſe them firſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid;</hi> Sir, this is done differently: For ſometimes the Holy Spirit gives Notices of the Things which the Soul never ſaw nor thought of: At other times he makes it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſomething which it ſaw or underſtood imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly: But for the moſt Part, the Light is demanded by the Soul when it prays for it or for ſomewhat elſe: Then if it be well recollected, it receives the Underſtanding of what it asked, either God grants it, or makes it ſee wherefore he denies it, or elſe what it ought to do or forſake to co-operate with the Deſigns of God, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its Requeſt. Behold how the Lights of the Holy Spirit have their Riſe. All that is needful in this, is <note n="c" place="bottom">Pſ. 73. 23,-28.</note> to diſengage our Soul from Earthly Affections, and to reſign it to the Will of God; Then he governs and illuminates it in ſuch ſort as that it cannot be ignorant of any thing that it ought to know: For as for ſimple Curioſities, we ought never to ask or deſire them; but only that which is well pleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, or profitable to our Neighbour: The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which Things God does not deny to Souls who are faithfully dedicated to him. I wiſh, Sir, you may be one of them, that you may learn in a Moment more things in theſe Matters, than I cou'd tell you in a whole Day: For one Word from God contains more than Ten Thouſand Diſcourſes of Men, which are ſtill accompanied
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104476:204"/>
with many Defects and Imperfections: Whereas the Holy Spirit has a perfect Accompliſhment in every Thing, and enlarges himſelf according as the Soul is emptied of it ſelf. We have nothing elſe to do, but to empty our ſelves; becauſe God being always in the Center of our Soul, he wou'd enlighten it abundantly in caſe the Hindrances were removed: For take them away and we receive Light.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Third Part</hi> ſhews yet more clearly than the Two fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, how much the Church of God is fallen from her firſt Inſtitution, and how far ſhe is remov'd from the Principles of the Apoſtles, and the Life of the Firſt Chriſtians; how many Errours and Corruptions have by little and little crept and ſlipt into Chriſtianity; what Appendages and Circumſtances they have added to it: How many New Laws and Ordinances for the Ornament of it, which in effect have deform'd and disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd it? So that whereas Chriſtendom was in its Beginning <hi>The True Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhe is now become <hi>The great Whore, which commits whoredom with the Kings of the Earth,</hi> drinking in their Cups, and eating of their Dainties, which are the Ambition, the Pleaſures, and covetous Deſires of the Things of this World. Which Things are now as common among the Churchmen as among the Kings of the Earth, to ſay no more. This is very far from the Lowlineſs of Jeſus Chriſt and of his Diſciples, who lived in Humility of Heart, in a Contempt of the Honours and Glory of the World, and would take no other Delights but Labours, Fatigues and Sufferings; and diſpiſed Gold and Silver, as appears by the Offer that <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer made to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> of giving him Money to buy the Grace of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He curſes him and his Money.

               <p>But thoſe Perſons at preſent, do directly the contrary, deſpiſing Lowlineſs and Humility, abhorring Poverty, and avoiding Sufferings as much as they can. Are not theſe Adulterers who falſifie their Faith promiſed to Jeſus Chriſt in Baptiſm to renounce the Devil, the World, and its Pomps? And after their Oaths, they go and take up what they have renounced conforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the World, and its Pomps and Vanities, as much as they can: And in the mean time they will ſtill bear the Name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which ſignifies, the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt: As in effect thoſe Perſons really were, if they had continued in his Spirit and the Imitation of Him. From which they being fallen, they are nothing now but unfaithful Whoremongers and Adulterers, worthy to be caſt off by their Lawful Husband, as they infallibly ſhall be; for He cannot acknowledge them for Chriſtians when He ſees them in their Manners wholly Antichriſtian.</p>
               <p>It muſt not be imagined that this Evil is only in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as all the Reformed would perſwade themſelves, calling the <hi>Roman</hi> Church commonly, <hi>The great Whore in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation:</hi> ſince all and every one of theſe Reformed are more Whores than their Mother, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, from which they have ſeparated, not to Reform her, but to Deform her the more, by rendring her a greater Beaſt than ſhe was in her ſelf, For we ſee theſe Reformed live much more licentiouſly than thoſe who continue in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who being under Diſcipline, are regulated and reſtrained in their Manners, whereas the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed being ſubject to none, live as Beaſts, every one following his own Will and the Inclination of their corrupt Natures.</p>
               <p>This is that which made all theſe Reformers to depart from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that they might make New Inſtitutions, accommodated to their Looſeneſs. For ſince they were reſolved to give the Reins to their Brutiſh Senſes, they could not abide any longer under the Obedience of a Superiour; and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to follow Carnal Pleaſures, they muſt depart out of the <hi>Roman</hi> Obedience, where they had taken Vows and Oaths of Chaſtity, for elſe they had been caſt into Priſon as perjured and
<pb facs="tcp:104476:208"/>
impious: And that they might have Money enough to ſatisfie the Pleaſures of their Taſte, they muſt be followed by Rich Perſons who might furniſh them with Money in abundance. For this Cauſe they made Schiſms in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and they Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed New Churches every one after his own Faſhion, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted one another, and underſtood one another no more than the Builders of the Tower of <hi>Babel;</hi> and in this they were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by many Honourable Perſons, who thought there was ſome Good Thing in the Reformed, and ſo much the rather that they were agreeable to Corrupt Nature, which they flattered and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in its Vices. For theſe Reformers did not bid the People, ſeparate from the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, that they might live in Gluttony and Whoredom: This would have been too infamous and reproachful among Good Men; but they told them the Abuſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, propoſing to reform them: Though in Truth it was but that they might lead a Licentious Life, ſhake off Piety and Truth, and give Looſe Reins to the Motions of their Corrupt Nature, and let it follow its Deſires and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations without conſtraint.</p>
               <p>For if they had deſigned a Pious Reformation, they would not have deſpiſed the Good Things that were in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and would only have reſiſted the Evil which they judged to be there, and Reformed that Evil firſt in themſelves, that by their good Example they might have led others to Reform themſelves too; ſince Example is an Effectual Preaching. But theſe Reformers proceeded after quite another manner, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Good with the Bad, without diſtinction: Becauſe if they had maintained what was Good in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, they would have been obliged to obſerve it them themſelves. This they had no mind to do, being reſolved to lead a Licentious Life, and to give Looſe Reins to all their Brutiſh Senſes. They could not ſubject the People to the Obedience of a Superiour, ſince they themſelves would not at all depend upon one. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt of all they perſwaded the People to ſhake off a Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Pope and other Superiours, that they might live every one after their own Way, as the Beaſts who have neither Fears nor Cares but eat and drink well. This is againſt all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; ſince no Country, no Common wealth, no Family can be well ordered and governed without a Head, a Superiour, or a Father of the Family, to whom the reſt are ſubject: And I pray you, <hi>FRIENDLY READER,</hi> what would a City or a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince be, if it had no Magiſtrate, no Superiour? No other thing but a Den of Thieves, Robbers, and other Malefactours,
<pb facs="tcp:104476:209"/>
who would hinder all Good Men from dwelling there. And though Superiority be ſo good, uſeful and neceſſary even in the Civil State, yet theſe Reformers reject it as an Evil Thing, and will depend on none but themſelves, and live independently, that they may the more follow the Swinge of their Brutiſh Senſes, whoſe Motions they let looſe without Reſtraint. Theſe Reformers did not only cast off Obedience by their Reformation; but alſo the Confeſſion of Sins in particular: For they would not declare to another the Luxury and the Exceſs which they had a mind to perpetrate; and they could not enjoyn others what they would not do themſelves. Therefore they rejected, and even deſpiſed this Confeſſion, though the Scripture ſayes expreſly, <hi>Confeſs your Faults to one another:</hi> And Confeſſion in its ſelf is Good and Holy, humbling the Heart, and ſerving for a Bridle and Reſtraint to Sin in Time coming. All this ſort of Good theſe Reformers rejected, together with the pretended Errours they ſaid they had diſcovered, forgetting that the Scripture ſays, <hi>Try all things, and hold that which is good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not excuſe the Errours and Abuſes which have crept in among theſe Auricular Confeſſions; ſince I blame them more than theſe Reformers themſelves did, as may be ſeen in this <hi>LIGHT OF THE WORLD:</hi> But they ought not to pluck up the good Grain with the Tares. That belongs to the Lord to ſeparate them in the Day of Harveſt, and not to theſe Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to come before the Time and pluck out of the Holy Church the good Things which Chriſt had planted there: Such as Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Abſtinence are, which theſe Reformers have ſo abſolutely rejected and deſpiſed, though in the Scripture Faſting is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; for the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Be ye ſober, and watch:</hi> And elſewhere it is ſaid, <hi>Sanctifie your Faſt.</hi> And Jeſus Christ ſpeaking to his Apoſtles of one poſſeſt, ſayes to them, <hi>This kind goeth not out but by Faſting and Prayer.</hi> He himſelf faſted Fourty Dayes in the Deſert, and was an hungred. But theſe Reformers ſpeak of nothing but filling their Belly well the better to excite their Luſt. Are not theſe who would Reform the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, fine Zealots for the Glory of God? We ſee alſo that all their Reformation has brought nothing but Schiſms and Diviſions among the Reformed themſelves. There is nothing there but Debates and Diſſenſions. They wrote to me ſome while agoe that Two Preachers of the ſame Reformed Communion had fallen by the Ears together even in the Temple, and the one had rent the others Garment from Head to Foot. Theſe are the Effects of their Reformation, and of the Remedy they ſay they
<pb facs="tcp:104476:209"/>
have provided for the Abuſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: The Scripture ſayes, <hi>That the Tree is known by its Fruit.</hi> From whence we may infer how pernicious theſe Reformations muſt be, which have cauſed ſuch Miſchiefs in Chriſtendom, having brought in nothing but Hatred among Chriſtians, though Jeſus Chriſt did ſo much recommend to them, <hi>To love one another.</hi> By theſe Reformations they have deſpiſed, hated and perſecuted one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, beat, rob'd, kill'd and murthered one another without compaſſion, to maintain the Opinion that they have undertaken to believe, though all their Opinions be equally bad, the one erring one way, and the other another. So that to maintain the Errours of theſe Reformers theſe Christians kill'd and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd one another, inſtead of loving one another according to the Counſel of Jeſus Chriſt. And theſe Enmities continue to this Day, and they hate and deſpiſe one another upon the Account of their Religion, though all of them ſignifie nothing, and no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions can ſave any.</p>
               <p>Nothing but the Love of God brings Salvation; and all theſe Perſons love themſelves only, and live all according to the Motions of Corrupt Nature: Their Religions conſiſting in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Theory, and vain Speculations, not at all in Practice. But to flatter them with ſome Piety and Devotion; their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers have put the Bible in their Hands, and ſome Songs to ſing in the Temple: ſince the Prieſts and Religious <hi>Romaniſts</hi> uſed to ſing in the Temple, and corrupt Nature has no Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to Songs; it rather delights in them, as all theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers do at this Day, who lift up their Voice as well as they can to make their good Voice be heard in the Temple, where they ſit at their own Eaſe, with the Bible in their Hand, on which they profeſs to read that they may learn to diſcourſe of it, though I have not known one Perſon who puts in practice ſo much as one Point of the Goſpel. Lo this is all the Service that theſe Reformers have learned their Diſciples, together with the Lords Supper, that is performed without Devotion or Piety. And notwithſtanding of this they call themſelves good Chriſtians, Evangelical Perſons, Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated, or Regenerated Ones, and other good Names: Though they be as far from Salvation as Heaven is from Earth. But theſe Reformers have known ſo well how to perſwade them of an Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Salvation by their Scholaſtick Reaſons and Gloſſes, that they have thereby ſo confounded their Spirit, as that they receive Lyes for the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>That which is moſt to be admired, is, that among ſo many Perſons of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding who have followed theſe Reformers, none have perceived the Cheat of theſe Senſual Reformers, who teach a Life
<pb facs="tcp:104476:210"/>
quite contrary to the Evangelical Life, which ſpeaks of nothing but denying a Mans Self, bearing down his Fleſh, and doing Penitence, with a Threatning that without this Mean we ſhall all periſh. It muſt indeed be ſaid, That from that time Men have been abandoned to the Spirit of Errour and Lying, and that Mens Spirit has been quite blinded by Sin, and is ſince ſtill more blinded; ſince yet in our Time we ſee Perſons of a like Temper li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t up themſelves above others, and call themſelves the Reformers and Reſtorers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſeparate from the reſt of the Reformed, that they may live ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the World in greater Holineſs than others: Though in their Manners they be as ſenſual, yea more, than thoſe whom they have forſaken. For having no Accommodation of Worldly Goods, and being unwilling to Work, but deſirous to be well Treated and Served, they undertake Reformations, drawing over to them Wealthy Perſons that they may obtain their Aims, and they make all their Goods common: In which the Poor cannot but have Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and the Reformers Services, and a good Time of it, according to their Aim; ſince in effect many follow them, and give them all their Wealth, with which they Eat and Drink and Marry as thoſe did in the Dayes of <hi>Noah:</hi> On which Terms they make them Preachings of Fine Studied Words and fitted for the Guſt of the Hearers, who are well pleaſed to have found out a way of Salvation ſo well accommodated to their Corrupt Natures: ſince they make them believe, that they are all ruled by King Jeſus. They are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by their frivolous Diſcourſes that this is true, and thus Men are yet amuſed by Men as they were in former Times.</p>
               <p>And I can ſee no other Remedy but that God overturn all theſe Churches made with Mens Hands, that he may eſtabliſh one made of Spirit and of Life, where we ſhall worſhip God in Spirit and in Truth. Which he makes me hope ſhall come to paſs very ſhortly; ſince he makes me declare ſo many Truths with the hazard of my Life to overturn <hi>Babel</hi> and revive True Chriſtianity. Bleſſed ſhall he be who ſhall receive them from God's Hand, and ſhall not reſiſt the Truth as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> did; ſince theſe are undone for ever: But receive the ſaving Truth that God has communicated to me in this <hi>LIGHT OF THE WORLD,</hi> which will Illuminate you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, as ſoon as you ſhall make this Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of your ſelf, and ſhall deliver up into God's Hand the Freewill that he has given you, you ſhall receive the Holy Spirit, which will teach you all things. But never turn back again to reſume your own will; otherwiſe the laſt Fault will be worſe than the firſt: Since you have now received more Light than formerly, walk according to it, and do not any more regard the World, nor the Creatures, for they

cannot ſave you. You muſt fall into the Hands of God <note n="a" place="bottom">Pſ. 139. 7. 12.</note> whether you will or no: No body can eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape this, whether he live well or ill, he ſhall have no other Judge. 'Tis a very ſmall matter for us to yield to God the free will that he has ſo freely given us; ſince 'tis his Property, and he has entruſted it in our Hands only for our Benefit. Shall we procure our own Miſery with the greateſt Preſent that God has ever given us. Since we have ſo often experienc'd that we always abuſe this Free-will, <note n="b" place="bottom">Iſ. 66. 3. 4.</note> employing it rather for our Damnation, than for our Salvation; Let us acknowledge, Sir, our weakneſs, and reſign our Free-will into the Hands of God, that he may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it at his. Pleaſure during this ſhort Life. He will give it back to us in the other, with ſuch Perfections that we ſhall not be able to abuſe it any more. Do not delay longer, Sir, ſo much as one day to make this transferring of your Free-will to God: For in this conſiſts <note n="c" place="bottom">Joh. 6. 38.</note> all Perfection, all the Law and the Prophets, and Life everlaſting: For all Vertues, the Old Law, and the New, are no other but true means to attain to this <hi>Reſignation</hi> of our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to that of God: in doing this we fullfil all things, we need not be ſollicitous for any more.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>I was greatly comforted to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that to fullfil the whole Law we need only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign our own VVill to that of God, and that I heartily reſigned it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid.</hi> Sir it is moſt certain that God has never demanded any other thing of Man <note n="d" place="bottom">Prov. 23. 26. Iſ. 58. 13.</note> but the reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Will to his, and only gave him Laws and Precepts <note n="e" place="bottom">VViſd. 12. 2.</note> when he ſaw Man withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from him to follow his own Will, by which he is Fallen into all ſorts of Sins and Miſeries; and fearing leſt through Ignorance and Inadvertence he ſhould dye and periſh in his Sins, God gave him Laws and Precepts that Man might know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sins, and abſtain from committing them: Otherwiſe Man <note n="f" place="bottom">1 Tim. 9.</note> would
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104476:211"/>
never have needed any Laws in caſe he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in a dependance on the Will of God: He might have done all that he pleaſed, and enjoyed all things Created for his Uſe, and that even with delight. By which you may ſee, Sir, that it is ſufficient for Man to reſign himſelf to the Will of God, tho' he ſhould not follow any means appointed for the Attainment of theſe Ends, as the Commandments of the Church are, he will aſſuredly be ſaved; yea, though he were a <hi>Turk</hi> or a Heathen, <note n="h" place="bottom">Act. 10. 34,</note> or of any Sect or Nation whatſoever: Becauſe God has never given any other Law to Man, but the DEPENDANCE that he ought always to have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his God: And all the Laws are occaſioned by Sin, and their Goodneſs conſiſts in the <note n="i" place="bottom">Gal. 3., 17.</note> diſcovery of it, that this knowledge may withdraw Man from it, and remove from him all theſe Sins, which prove hindrances of this Reſignation to God: For if Man had no Sins which turn him away from God, he would certainly be reſigned to him: For he is created for this, that God may take Delight in him, <note n="k" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 31.</note> without any reſiſtance, and that he may accompliſh all his Will in Man <note n="l" place="bottom">Iſ. 1. 19.</note> with his free Conſent and Will, which is the moſt perfect thing of all that can be imagined; for if Man were united in Will to God, he would partake of all his Qualities; and as God is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Good, Man would be alſo all Good; and all Juſt, becauſe united to the true Righteouſneſs; and alſo all true, being conformable to the Eternal Truth; and conſequently he would fullfil all the Laws by this ſole Reſignation to God. without his needing to learn or follow them in particular, they being all comprehended and ſumm'd up in the inſeparable DEPENDANCE of our Will on that of God.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That my Soul was raviſhed with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to understand that God demands no other thing of Man, but the ſubmiſſion of his VVill to that of his God, and that by this means I hoped many would yet be Saved; whereas (according to her Diſcourſes) I had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deſpaired of all, and of my ſelf alſo.</hi>

I would believe that there are yet ſome Perſons ſcattered up and down the World who have reſigned their Wills to the Will of God; but taking the generality of the World, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how men govern themſelves, it is manifeſt enough that no body reſigns his Will to that of God; for we ſee nothing but ſelf-will reigns every where: From thence it comes that ſo many Sins are committed. We ſee the ſelf-will of all Men bear ſway in all things with the ſame affectation, for they eſteem nothing more than their own Will; they ſeek and follow it as much as is poſſible for them, in eating and drinking, and in all other bodily things, in Sciences, and in the choice of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and Dignities, and in all things that give Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to the Mind, yea, even in pious and ſpiritual Exerciſes, they are done according to the deſire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of Self-will, and no otherwiſe; for if our Will were reſigned to God, it would not ſeek it ſelf in any thing, neither in ſmall things nor in great: For one who is truly reſign'd does not any more poſſeſs himſelf: He takes and receives all that God is pleaſed to give him, and is moſt content with what he thinks fit to deprive him of. This is very far from the practice of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104476:212"/>
Men now, who would willingly ſet themſelves againſt the Will of God, if it were poſſible for them, in all that he permits to befall them againſt their own Will; yea, even though they be Perſons conſecrated to God by ſolemn Vows, we diſcover and find them to be ſo wedded to their own Wills and Inclinations, that all their Actions as well good as bad, are nothing but a conſtant courſe of Self-Love, which never ends till Death, and even ſometimes follows them after it by Legacies or Teſtaments made according to this Self-will; and nevertheleſs they believe, and all the World owns, that they are the Servants of God, entirely dedicated to him, without obſerving what Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <hi>that</hi>

And becauſe we did not comprehend ſufficiently how this dependance ought to be, and were ſo far removed from it; Jeſus Chriſt came upon Earth to explain to us by what means we ought to recover it; for all his Precepts are only means to attain to it.</p>

                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir it is very eaſie to know this; for he who has truly yielded up his Free-will to God, will uſe it <note n="s" place="bottom">Mat. 26. 39.</note> no more, but deny all that it demands, even to the leaſt things; he yields no longer to it in any thing, but waits on God for all that he muſt have, having no more to yield up to him but this Free-will, he only receives from God without acting in any thing. Such a Perſon performs all his Actions in dependance on God, if he eats and drinks it is nothing but out of pure Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, without regarding whether it be ſweet or ſowr, all is good to him, provided it be wholeſome and ſufficient for the maintenance of his Life: He ſeeks nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eaſe, Pleaſures, Honours, Riches, nor any Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Contentment; and if any of theſe things occur, he takes them indifferently from God's Hand, for he has no longer any deſire of his own. He neither deſires Honour, Eſtate, Riches, nor any thing that delights the Mind, knowing well that it is not in this Life that one muſt take his Contentment, no more than Jeſus Chriſt did while he was on Earth: On the contrary, he finds in his Soul a willingneſs <note n="u" place="bottom">2 Cor. 12. 10.</note> to ſuffer Reproaches, Pain, and Labour, though contrary to his natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. A Soul dead to it ſelf, and reſign'd to the VVill of God, neither ſeeks good, nor even Vertues,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104476:213"/>
but thoſe which God will give it, and affects no means to obtain them; but is well contented to be moſt ignorant, and ſtript of all ſorts of Sciences, and means even of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In one word, Sir, a perſon who has yeilded up his free will to God, deſires no longer any thing on Earth, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects only what it ſhall pleaſe God to permit or ſend him, receiving Proſperity and Adverſity with an even mind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Joy or Grief, ſince he believes, That <note n="x" place="bottom">Rom. 8. 28.</note> God will not permit any thing to befall him but what ſhall turn to his good. All theſe are ſigns to know whether we be reſign'd to <hi>God,</hi> or not; for we muſt not flatter our ſelves in ſaying, that we are reſign'd to God, while we live wholly to our own wills, and follow, as much as we can, our own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That I never knew any on Earth who was ſo reſigned to God, as to take all from his hands, and to have no ſelf-will, on occaſions; tho' many pretend, that they will live wholly to God, and do his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, Do you not ſee, that theſe are all Cheats, and that thoſe who ſay, they would pleaſe God, and do his will, deceive themſelves, in believing, that God is pleas'd with their words, without effect. If you never knew any perſon, who yeilded up to God the free will that he gave him, you may well ſay, that you know none in a ſtate of ſalvation: for no man can be ſaved <note n="y" place="bottom">Iſa. 66. 4.</note> who follows his own will. For <hi>Adam</hi> committed no other ſin to undo us, but the following his own will: The matter of eating an Apple was not ſufficient to cauſe all the miſeries under which we yet groan. That which ruin'd the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was nothing elſe but <note n="z" place="bottom">Pſalm 81. 12, 13.</note> that they would not be contented with the Government and Will of God, deſiring rather to ſuffer the miſeries of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in doing their own wills, than to enjoy the delights they had while they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd themſelves to God. VVhen all the world-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd by an univerſal Deluge, it was becauſe every one was more bent to follow his own will, than to ſubmit to the word that God proclaimed by <hi>Noah.</hi> And when the <hi>Jews</hi> were given up to the Spirit of Error, it was for no other Reaſon but that they valued more their own will than the light that God ſent them to receive, and know <hi>His.</hi> By
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104476:214"/>
which we may ſee, that in all Times and Ages God has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways demanded the Submiſſion of Man's Will to his own, and has rejected all thoſe who follow their own Will. Do you believe, Sir, that it will not be thus with Chriſtians and all the World now? It is certainly the very ſame thing, for God never changes. What he required from <hi>Adam,</hi> he certainly requires from all his Poſterity. We are miſtaken if we think to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him now with formal Words and Diſcourſes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>we will be reſigned to him, and do his VVill,</hi> when in effect we will only follow our own on all occaſions. This is one deceit among others, which are crept into Chriſtendom, to make all the World Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh: For no body knows what it is to be reſign'd to God, while every one ſays, he is; and on this falſe perſwaſion, they inſenſibly deſtroy themſelves.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104476:214"/>
God could not take Pleaſure? To deſire that we had no Free-Will, would be to deſpiſe extreamly the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of God, ſince it was purpoſely given us that we might <note n="c" place="bottom">

                  <hi>Little Gods,</hi> without which all Men would be but Filth: For, according to their Nature alone, they are more miſerable than the Beaſts. Could God take delight in a thing ſo unlike to himſelf, could ſo powerful a God unite himſelf to ſuch an Impotent Creature, who had not Free-will to love him? God having no bounds nor limits, could he take Pleaſure in a Creature whoſe Will was bounded, and could a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Will attain to the Love of a God without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits?

If ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe it, <note n="h" place="bottom">4 Eſd. 8. 56.</note> it is their own Fault. God has always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd the Juſtice and Goodneſs of a true Father in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to us, we are to blame if we will abuſe it; for theſe Benefits ought never to be upbraided to any: A Son who has waſted all his Patrimony, ought to ſmite his own Breaſt, <note n="i" place="bottom">Luk. 16. 8.</note> acknowledging his Fault, without ever believing that it comes from the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Equity of his Father, who on his part has done him all the good he could; but he ought to beg pardon for having thus abus'd his Favours. All thoſe who ſay they would have wiſh'd rather not to have had Free-will, are unworthy to be call'd <hi>the Children of God,</hi> for they impute to him the Fault which they commit themſelves. This is a quality of the Devil, always to blame others for the faults which they do themſelves, and to accuſe the Good of their own wickedneſs. And to wiſh we had never receiv'd Free-will, is to wiſh never to have been a Child of God, and indirectly to blame him for the Faults which we commit in abuſing his Graces. This is a great contempt of God, that deſerves a double Puniſhment, one for the Ingratitude that we commit againſt God, and another for having thus abus'd his Benefits. And as a Beaſt is not capable of knowing the Beauty and value of a precious Stone, ſo Man would have been a brutiſh Animal if God, had not given him an Underſtanding to comprehend, and a Free-will to love <hi>Him,</hi> without which he would be as uncapable of knowing and loving God, as a Beaſt is of a Jewel, which ſurpaſſes its Capacity. And yet they would wiſh that this Free-will, which is the only advantage of Man, had not been given him! what Ingratitude to take ſuch ineſtimable Favours of God for a Misfortune!</p>

                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, by all theſe humane Sentiments every one Blaſphemes againſt God; 'tis no wonder that the Whore in the Revelation is <note n="k" place="bottom">Rev. 17. 4.</note> full of names of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, ſince Blaſphemies are ſo common in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, which ſhe repreſents: They eſteem that good which God reckons to be Evil, and they hold that to be Evil which God counts good; yea, his moſt holy and perfect Works are rejected or deſpiſ'd by Men, which is evident by your preſent Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſince it ſeems to you, it had been better not to have received Free-will from God; that is to ſay, by way of Reproof to him, that he had done better not to have given it to Man. Do we not ſhew by this, that we would be God's Maſters, and Directors, to teach him his Duty, and correct him, by ſaying, he had done better not to have given this Free-VVill? To what is Man come, that ſilly Worm of the Earth, who would give orders to ſo wiſe and powerful a God? Is it enough for Man to excuſe himſelf by ſaying, <hi>That he conſiders only the ill uſe that is made of theſe Graces of God,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out applying his Mind to conſider that the VVorks of God are always good, juſt, and true; and that all the Evil that can ever be found in them, proceeds only from the wickedneſs of Man, who abuſing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of God, makes uſe of his Graces to offend him? It were better to have a Sentiment that reproves Man for this wickedneſs, than one that reproves God in his VVorks; as Men do now, who judging with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eyes, condemn the goodneſs and righteouſneſs of God. 'Tis more than time, Sir, that he ſhould take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with ſo many evils, without ſuffering any longer ſo many Blaſphemies as are daily utter'd againſt him, and wherein even the Holy judge ſiniſtrouſly of the moſt holy and perfect of his VVorks.

                  <hi>of the VVorks of God, ſaying to her, that it was only thro Ignorance, and not thro' Malice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, Ignorance excuſes not Sin. You are always obliged to know that God is a perfect Good, from whom no Evil can ever proceed; and that all his Works are accompanied with Truth, and all ſorts of Perfections: And that he can never do any <note n="l" place="bottom">Deut. 32. 4. Pſ. 33. 4.</note> imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thing; and therefore you ought not to wiſh that any thing were otherwiſe than he has appointed it; for all the Wiſe Men who are, were, or ſhall be upon the Earth, cannot have all together the leaſt Wiſdom of God, and all that they have, they have from him. Is not this general Rule ſufficient to make your Spirit ſubmit to theſe Ordinances, eſpecially as to this Free-will of Men, which he has' given them as a Pledge of aſſurance that they are his real Children, in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of which they ought to bleſs and praiſe him day and night, becauſe he could never teſtifie more Love to them than by this liberty he has given them to love him. For my part I can ſay in truth, that I would chuſe rather that God ſhould annihilate me than take from me the Liberty to love him. Therefore I reſent it ſo much when I hear it ſaid, <hi>That it would be better not to have Free-will;</hi> for I feel by Experience that it is the only thing that unites Men to God, and that alſo which <note n="n" place="bottom">Iſ. 1. 19.</note> can make them enjoy Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; no body can comprehend (but he who expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences it) what Conſolation the Soul receives <note n="p" place="bottom">Cant. 7. 12. 8. 6, 7.</note> when it can unite this Free-Will to God. This is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect an Alliance, that nothing can be found in Grace more accompliſh'd, no more than there can be any thing found in Nature more perfect, than that two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons united in their Wills in God, join alſo in Body, this compleats their Contentment; but if there were force, limitation or conſtraint on either ſide, the Pleaſure could not be compleat, This is the Figure of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly free Union that the Soul ought to have with God; and if the Soul were conſtrain'd, or forc'd to this union, God could not take perfect delight in it,<note place="bottom">(<hi>m</hi>) <hi>VViſd.</hi> 9. 6, 17.</note>

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:104476:216"/>
becauſe to have a compleat Contentment in the Union of two things, they muſt needs equally concur to it.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That I muſt confeſs I had been in great Darkneſs, and that I had never conceiv'd that ſo great a Good did proceed from Free-will, no more than the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which is found in Marriage, when two Perſons are united in Body and in Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> This is becauſe People conſider things only ſuperficially, and on the outſide, without piercing into their Sources, for, <note n="q" place="bottom">Deut. 30. 19. Eccleſ. 5. 17, 18.</note> it is the Free-will of Man only that gives him a perfect Union with God, without which he could never come to love him perfectly, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore among all the Spiritual Graces that God has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to him, this Free-Will is the greateſt good, as alſo Marriage among natural Goods is the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; though Men do very frequently abuſe both, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of their Free-Will to damn themſelves, and of Marriage to ſin. This is not God's Fault, who has ordained both the one and the other holy and perfect; but only Man's, who abuſes the moſt perfect Gifts of God, as well in Grace as in Nature. Ought we for this to deſire that he had not beſtowed theſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on Man? This would be to own that Man's Wickedneſs ſhould make the Goodneſs of God to ceaſe, which cannot be, for God will never ceaſe to be good, becauſe Man is evil. He remains ſtill the Fountain of all Goodneſs <note n="r" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 17.</note> and the giver of all Good, though the men of the World be wicked. God will never change for the Goodneſs or Wickedneſs of Men, nor for any other thing, becauſe he continues always that which he is. Let Man do what he will, with all the other Creatures, they ſhall never be able to make God deſiſt from the leaſt Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth, which he poſſeſſeth in himſelf, and will always exerciſe without regard to the goodneſs or wickedneſs of Men. Their abuſe <note n="s" place="bottom">Lam. 3. 22. Math 5. 45.</note> of his Graces will never hinder him from extending his Goodneſs towards them: If they uſe them well, they ſhall receive the promiſed reward,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104476:217"/>
and if they they uſe them ill, they ſhall meet with the juſt Puniſhment, without any mutability in God. It pleaſed God to Create Man after his Likeneſs, and ſo he was made, for God's Power is equal <note n="t" place="bottom">VViſd. 2. 18.</note> to his Will; and he would have this Man alſo joined to his Like, as God was to him, that is to ſay, entirely, ſpiritually, and bodily. Now Man could not be like to God by his humanity; for God was not corporeal or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; neither could he be like to God by a bounded and limited Will and Spirit, becauſe God has a free Power to do, or not to do any thing: God then muſt needs have given to Man the ſame free Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Will, or otherwiſe he could not be like to him in any thing. And ſince he would create Man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own Likeneſs, he was obliged to give him the free diſpoſal of his own will, there being nothing elſe in which he could reſemble God. By which we ſee that Free-Will is the greateſt ſpiritual Gift that Man has receiv'd from God, ſince without it he could not any way reſemble Him. And afterwards to render this reſemblance moſt compleat, God took a natural Body, and a reaſonable Soul, like to Man, that he might in all reſpects reſemble him, that is divinely by the free Power of his VVill, and after the manner of Man, by the Body and Soul which Jeſus Chriſt aſſumed in due time, that not only Man might be like God, but that alſo God might be like to Man, that there might be a perfect and compleat Contentment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, which will appear after the end of all Evil; when God ſhall reign with Men on Earth, Divinity and Humanity together joining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſeparably by an indiſſolvable and eternal alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Will, Body, and Spirit, by a perfect Bond and Union. This is the final Cauſe for which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Man, that they might dwell together in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal holy Union, the figure of which he ſhew'd in the Earthly Paradiſe when he created the Woman to give <hi>Adam</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="bottom">Gen. 12. 18.</note> his compleat and perfect contentment; for though indeed he had been created with his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to be able to love God, and take delight in him,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104476:217"/>
and alſo in all the Creatures which were made ſubject to him, yet his Contentment was not fully perfect; for God was to be the delight of his Soul, and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures of his Senſes. But his Body did not ſee its like; therefore God ſays, <note n="x" place="bottom">Gen. 2. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>It is not good for Man to be alone, let us make a help like to him:</hi> Becauſe God will make all his Works perfect in all reſpects. He is not ſatisfied to have created <hi>Adam</hi> in the enjoyment of his Free-will, by which he might have his VVill u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to God's; he gives him alſo all beautiful things to recreate his Sight, and all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They uſe their Free-will to ſatisfy themſelves; every one willing and deſiring that which is pleaſant to his Senſes, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous for his Intereſt in this VVorld.

And as there is nothing more holy and perfect than the Bond of Marriage for two Perſons who have dedicated their Wills to God, becauſe it unites three things which make now but one, to wit, the will of God, and the wills of the Married Perſons, who by exceſs of their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted VVills unite alſo Bodies in the Spirit and Deſign of God; ſo on the contrary, there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more wicked than two Bodies united by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Concupiſcence: for this Alliance is the ſource of all ſorts of Sins, yea, the Abyſs of all Evils: And as thoſe who are united to God, have, by being marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Perſon equally united to God, a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment both of Soul and Body; ſo thoſe who live after their own will, have, by marrying with their Like, ſtill ſome diſcontent both of Body and Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Souls not being in God they cannot have Peace, and their Bodies being joyn'd without Love, cannot be ſatisfied nor contented, but they are in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul as in a temporal Hell, which prepares the way to Hell Eternal; for theſe Bodies united without Souls and VVills can produce nothing but Sin through the Luſt of the Fleſh, beſides Contention and Strife, with a thouſand other kinds of Exceſs, Vain-glory, Luxury, gluttony, to which Married Perſons excite one another: So that their whole Life is nothing but a conſtant
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104476:218"/>
courſe of ſinning, which extends alſo to their children, thro' the bad example of the Parents, who train them up in evil cuſtoms, and they increaſe the number of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Hereby the world grew ſtill worſe, and its wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſtill increaſed, and the perverſe generation is become ſo numerous, that the Evil is without Remedy; for no body is aware of it, becauſe every one treads the ſame path: Cuſtom is changed into Nature. And whereas they ought to marry for the Two Ends that God gave them; that is, to preſerve a perfect Unity among his true Children, and to increaſe the number of them by generation, they uſually marry to ſatisfie their Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; and ſo they beget Children for the profit of the Devil. Thus the works of God are perverted by evil pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices; for of all that God has done in Nature, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more holy than the Matrimonial Conjunction, which by a perfect Union binds perſons in Love: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, God might have made men engender as the Fiſhes, or in any other ſeparate manner, which his Almighty Power and Wiſdom could have provided for. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to have in Nature a figure of the Union of his Three Powers, and of the entire and perfect Alliance which he would make with man, he ordain'd, that their generation ſhould be by the conjunction of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; that he might keep them always inſeparably united to his will in body and will, by a Bond of Charity; and gave them a natural bent and inclination to this conjunction, which is the moſt perfect thing in the world, if it were obſerved in the ſpirit of charity.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That it muſt be acknowledg'd no body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the works of God, and that they made an ill uſe of all, eſpecially of this Matrimonial Conjunction, from whence ſo many ſins did proceed; and inſtead of regarding it as an holy thing, it was matter of ſhame and bluſhing amongſt the most ſober perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, 'Tis ſin that renders it ſhameful, even as that of <hi>Adam</hi> made him ſee his Nakedneſs <note n="z" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 7.</note>, and gave him ground, thro' confuſion, to hide and cover himſelf. If he had remain'd in innocency, he would never have been aſhamed of being Naked; but it was his ſin only
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104476:219"/>
that cauſed this ſhame: He had no need of covering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before he ſinn'd, for his body was more beautiful, and more artificially contriv'd than ever the moſt coſtly Stuffs, with which he could cover himſelf; but the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination being diſorder'd by ſin, made him ſee beautiful things as if they had been filthy. This has remain'd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven till now in the imagination of all men, who eſteem that to be good and beautiful which they imagine to be ſo; and reckon that alſo to be filthy and evil which ſeems ſo to their imagination. Hence it comes that they look on natural things as ſhameful; but if they regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in Truth and Innocence, all would ſeem good and beautiful to them; for God could never make any thing evil; but man perverts all good into evil, and by his ſin corrupts all things; the moſt innocent become the moſt wicked by ſin. It muſt be acknowledged, Sir, that the way in which men now joyn for generation, is very filthy, and makes chaſt ſouls bluſh, becauſe they obſerve nothing there but the ſin which is in it, which is infamous: For this cauſe they are aſham'd of it: But if this ſin were remov'd, they would ſee nothing in it but what is pleaſant; as if two little children ſhould play to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether quite naked; there would be nothing but pleaſure in this, becauſe of their innocence; but if they did the ſame things when grown up, it would be infamous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the malignity of their thoughts. A thing that is in it ſelf the ſame, is render'd good or evil by the wickedneſs of the Heart. The ſins that are committed in Marriage, do not proceed from its being evil in its ſelf; for it is good: but they are introduc'd there thro' the perverſe will of men. Even as the Church is holy in it ſelf, but man's perverſe will has render'd it abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in the ſight of God; for they have chang'd the Order into which God had eſtabliſhed it. And if men commit the greateſt ſins by the inclination they have to this natural conjunction, this proceeds from nothing but the wickedneſs of the Heart, ſince the thing in it ſelf is good and holy. If man is become ſo negligent as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe all the works of God, is it not thro' his own wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that he periſhes, tho he lays the blame always on God? For if he ſin through Carnal Luſt, he will ſay, <hi>wherefore has God given me this Natural Inclination, by which I am led to ſin?</hi> And if men be chaſtiſed by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104476:219"/>
any Rods, they will ſay, that God afflicts them, or that he has forſaken them; and ſo of all other things: How great ſoever mens wickedneſs be, they lay the blame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways on God; tho they do not ſay it by word, yet they do it in deed, while they neglect to diſcover, that all his works are ſtill <note n="a" place="bottom">Pſal. 36. 9, 10.</note> accompanied with Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth; and that nothing that is evil can ever come from God, who is the <note n="b" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 17.</note> Source and Original of all Good, ſtill doing good to all, without excepting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. By which we ſee evidently, that he is no longer known at preſent; for they abuſe all his Favours, and blaſpheme him in every thing, and yet are not willing to confeſs it; for every one of theſe Chriſtians have it in their mouths, that they love God and honour him; <note n="c" place="bottom">Tit. 1. 16.</note> while truly and in effect they diſown and blaſpheme him by their works.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the blindneſs of men, who amuſe themſelves with the outward things which are delivered to them, without ſearching into the depth of the Truth it ſelf, they are ſo infatuated and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, thro' the fear of diſpleaſing thoſe who are in Reputation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Said to her, <hi>That men were in horrible darkneſs, and that the Truth was no longer known, but every one had for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, and taken a quite contrary way, while in the mean time they think they are in the right way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, This is what I bewail continually, to ſee men ſo far from their ſalvation, and yet they think they are in the right way to it. This cauſes the Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104476:220"/>
of thoſe who are eſteem'd the beſt men; for while they think they are good, they will not endeavour after a Change, but will live and die in a preſumption of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſav'd without good works; which ſhall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given neither in this world nor in the other: and no body thinks on't; for the darkneſs is ſo thick, that they cannot ſee whither they go. Truth is always bright, and diſcovers every thing, but it is no longer known. No bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knows the Truth any more, ſince the Devil ſpread this horrible Darkneſs on the Earth; but every one walks in darkneſs, and believes he is in the right way; and while they are periſhing they think to be ſaved. Have you not obſerv'd, Sir, all that I have ſaid to you, that man knows not God any longer, nor his works; and that they underſtand them in a quite contrary ſenſe, and that in truth they obſerve nothing of what God has comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and Jeſus Chriſt taught, and yet every one ſays, that he deſires to come to God? Muſt there not be a lie in the one or the other of theſe two contrary things? For what I ſay, and what Men do, are as diſtant from one another, as heat is from cold. Nevertheleſs truth cannot change, it remains always true: Let Men ſay what they pleaſe, let them ſtray from it, or approach it, it abides ſtill firm in its Integrity. Who that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands me aright can doubt that I ſpeak the Truth? And if you are oblig'd to confeſs it, will you not conſequently be oblig'd to acknowledge that all the World is deceived, and fallen from the Truth, and in forſaking it they have forſaken God? And if they have forſaken God who can uphold them any longer? The World muſt certainly periſh, for its diſeaſe is at the height; and the worſt of all is, that they do not know it; for if they knew it, there would yet be ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, who would open their Eyes, and perceive the reality of Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ask'd her, from whence this great blindneſs of Spirit, and this ſo obſcure darkneſs could proceed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, this comes from the Devil, ſince he crept into the Church, and began to countermine the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and took the title of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; he has labour'd ſo ſtrongly in this, that he has ſpread among them an univerſal Darkneſs, and ſo confounded the Spirits of thoſe Chriſtians with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104476:220"/>
different things, that they are no longer capable of knowing the Truth. Inſtead of it he has inſpir'd them with a great many falſe Opinions, that he might divert them from the pure Truth. So that I do not believe there is any Sect or Nation in the World farther from it than the Chriſtians of this Age, becauſe they diſcover it no longer in any thing: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Hereticks, Jews, or Heathens, know the Truth in ſome things, tho in others they are miſtaken: but theſe Chriſtians are miſtaken in all, thro' the ill uſe they make of all things, as I have formerly told you, Sir, that they know neither God nor any of his works, judging of all in a quite contrary ſenſe. And becauſe they could not have quiet without doing good things, the Devil has furniſh'd them with ſo many ſeemingly good works, that they have no longer any leiſure to think of the Truth, and to examine whether theſe New Devotions be true or not: but they blindly follow them without making any other Reflection, but that they are the Ordinances of the Church; without examining al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, whether this Church be holy or not, they lay aſide the Truth to receive that which is propoſed to them, ſuppoſing it to be a good thing. Hence <note n="d" place="bottom">2 Theſ. 2. 10, 11, 12.</note> there is ſuch blindneſs of ſpirit, and ſuch obſcure darkneſs, that there is ſcarce any way to make them ſee the Truth, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding being ſo preoccupied and darkned with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe things, that they can no longer conſider the Unity of Truth; on the contrary, they would think they did evil to follow this Truth, and quit the New Practices introduc'd by men. So that if we ſhould adviſe a Chriſtian now a-days to do nothing elſe in order to his ſalvation, but to reſign his will to that of God, he would think we deſign'd to make him an Heretick; and would cleave more firmly to the Ordinances of the Church than to thoſe of God.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>Whether ſhe was a Catholick, and whether one could be ſav'd out of the holy Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Yes, Sir, I am a Catholick, and ready to die for the Faith and Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe 'tis neceſſary for me. If I had remain'd in innocence,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104476:221"/>
without having contracted ſo many evil habits by the converſation of men, <note n="e" place="bottom">Mat. 9. 12.</note> I ſhould not have needed the Law of God, nor the Precepts of Jeſus Chriſt; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving departed from that innocence in which I ought to have reſign'd my ſelf wholly to God, yielding up to him the free will that he gave me, I have need now of this Law, and thoſe Evangelical Counſels, as means to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that innocence; and that I may with ſingleneſs of heart reſign my will to that of God; as all other men alſo have need of them; for every one has departed from that innocence, and contracted many evil habits, which hinder this reſignation to God. I embrace indeed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Faith and Belief; but I do not believe many things which thoſe who call themſelves the Chriſtian Church lay before us; becauſe they are not true; for he who ſhould believe to be ſav'd by going to Church, and frequenting the Sacraments, or ſuch like things, would at death find himſelf deceiv'd, becauſe no Prayers or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments operate without <note n="f" place="bottom">Joh. 4. 24</note> an inward diſpoſition: And whereas we ſee people frequent the Churches and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without piety or devotion, we may well judg that the world is deceived by ſuch like things, while they place the hopes of their ſalvation on outward things, which are but the ſignification of the inward diſpoſition of the mind <note n="g" place="bottom">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note>. You will ſay, It may be, Sir, that the Church ſuppoſes this inward diſpoſition; which is a falſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; becauſe we ſee evidently by experience, that the inward diſpoſition is very far from what appears out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly: and upon this ſuppoſition the Church could not appoint the baptiſing of new born Infants, who are not at all capable of inward diſpoſitions. I doubt not but theſe Romaniſts would bring many Reaſons and Arguments; but I hold to the Truth of God, and know no other Church but the ſouls which poſſeſs the Doctrine of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, Lo <note n="h" place="bottom">Joh. 8. 31.</note> this is the only true Church out of which there can be no ſalvation <note n="i" place="bottom">John 2. 9,</note>; for every one has need of taking up theſe means, that by them he may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to a RESIGNATION to God.</p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:104476:221"/>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That truly there muſt be ſome infatuation of Spirit that tied us to this Church: for tho we ſee ſhe does not at all poſſeſs the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, yet we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to leave her, as if ſhe were the holy Church; tho the truth makes it evidently appear that ſhe is not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, I bleſs God that he opens your Eyes to diſcover the truth in what concerns your ſalvation; for as long as you do not diſcover evil, you cannot avoid it, but will ſtill be in danger of being deceived by it. If the Devil were not in this Church, it is impoſſible that ſo many good ſpirits ſhould thus blindly follow her. 'Tis certainly by an infatuation of the underſtanding; for they ſee enough in the outſide to judg aſſuredly that ſhe is not guided by the holy ſpirit, and that ſhe follows not in any reſpect the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt; and nevertheleſs they continue ſo wedded to her thro' ſom panick or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimous Fear, that they dare not ſhake off her depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, fearing they ſhould do evil in following the truth: And if any perſon of a ſound Judgment diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers her deceits, and uncharms his Underſtanding, ſo as to perceive her Errors, yet out of reſpect to the Glory of the World he dare not forſake her, becauſe this Church is advanc'd to ſo great Honour and Authority, that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dares leave her, for fear of being diſgrac'd or perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her, as ſhe would certainly do ſo long as it is in her power. For this cauſe Jeſus Chriſt, ſpeaking of the laſt Times, in which we are fallen, ſays, <note n="k" place="bottom">Mark 13. 14, 15, 16.</note> That a man <hi>must get out of</hi> Judea, <hi>and flee, even without returning to his houſe to take his Cloaths.

That is but the manner of unrighteous men; but God always exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes Righteouſnes both as to the <hi>good and to the evil.</hi> However men imagine that God ſends his Plagues, they are deceived; for nothing but ſin can bring them on, and produce them. According as men Offend, their Evils increaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her; that theſe were moſt excellent Truths,</hi> that no evil could come from God, <hi>and that neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs nobody did comprehend this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, the reaſon is, Men do not know the <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> the <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Truth</hi> of God; but they judg blindly of all they ſee, according to their Paſſions. If they knew the righteouſneſs of God, they could never think of praying that God would keep off his laſt Plagucs; <note n="g" place="bottom">John 17. 9.</note> for they would ſee that they will never fall out but when ſin ſhall be univerſal, becauſe God is perfectly Righteous; but becauſe we do not conceive this Righteouſneſs, we believe that there are yet many good men in the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeem ſo to us. In this we give a tacite Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof to God; for if our belief were true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there were yet at preſent ſo many good men in the VVorld as we are perſwaded there are, God would
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104476:223"/>
be unjuſt to ſend on us ſo many different miſeries as we feel at preſent. If he would have forgiven them in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time provided <note n="h" place="bottom">Gen. 18. 30.</note> he could have ſhewn him but ten righteous Perſons, yea, even fewer, how could he chaſtiſe the VVorld now, if there were ſo great a number in it as we believe there are? Is he not the ſame God ſtill? And has he not the ſame goodneſs ſince he cannot change? Truly Sir, men miſtake God in every thing; and through this miſtake, they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reproaches againſt him, and blaſpheme againſt his Righteouſneſs, goodneſs, and Truth; particularly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who with their ſeeming Piety lay the blame on God of all their miſ-deeds. Is not this horrible darkneſs, ſince they chooſe rather to charge God with their Faults, than diſcover them by the Truth, that they might repent of them? Truly Sir, the power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is great, that it can ſo obſcure all the Men of the VVorld, that no body knows the Truth any longer, and even the moſt part ſhut their Eyes that they may not diſcover it, and in ſo doing they think they do well. The <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſs was far leſs dangerous, for it was felt, and they durſt not ſtir, <note n="k" place="bottom">Exod. 10. 23.</note> out of the place. for fear of falling; but thoſe Chriſtians now do not perceive their Darkneſs, or their Errours; on the contrary <note n="l" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. and 18. 7.</note> they think they are in the Light, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn others who ſee more clearly than themſelves. By what means ſhould the Children of the Kingdom be ſaved, when they take lying for Truth, which they reject as an evil thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaid to her, that nevertheleſs truth was a very lovely thing; and as for my ſelf, I would follow it as far as I could diſcover it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> You will diſcover it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſufficiently, if you love it; for the holy Spirit, who is now born into the World, will diſcover it to all thoſe who ſhall ſearch for it; but there are few among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who would receive it, tho' it offer it ſelf firſt of all to their Eyes, becauſe they are ſo full of Errors and Superſtitions, that they will not make way for<note place="bottom">(i) Jam. 1. 17.</note>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:104476:224"/>
this truth which is lovely. They live in a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Salvation, yea, they condemn all the World to Damnation, becauſe it does not follow their Laws, though in the mean time they be but humane, and no ways divine Laws. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God ſays, <note n="m" place="bottom">1 Pet. 5. 5.</note> that he reſiſts the proud, and gives Grace to the humble; he who is Truth <note n="n" place="bottom">Joh. 14. 6.</note> will reſiſt them, even as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they reſiſt the Truth, which is God. But, if for your part, Sir, you do it, and will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, you ſhall obtain the happineſs of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Jeſus Chriſt in Glory. But without Faith you cannot be ſaved; for if you do not believe that the World is Judged, you are not in the light of Truth; becauſe the deportment of Men is a certain Evidence of it, ſince we ſee them without Repentance and Amendment; and if you do not believe that we live now in the Reign of Antichriſt, you will aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly be deceived; For under the covert of Holineſs <hi>he will deceive the Elect,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> You would infallibly believe them, if you would ſeriouſly remark what you may ſee with your Eyes, and conceive with your Humane Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for theſe things are ſo far advanced, that one may feel them, provided his Mind be not infatuated. For <hi>firſt,</hi> as to the <hi>Judgment,</hi> as I have already told you, it is eaſy to ſee that the world is Judged, becauſe ſins are univerſal, and no body will Repent. There is every where <note n="s" place="bottom">1 John 2. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>the Luſt of the Eyes, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life;</hi> of which no body Repents and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends; and there can be no forgiveneſs, where there is no amendment; and therefore of neceſſity the World is Judged, becauſe theſe evils are not among ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons, as they have been in all times; but they are generally among all men, both ſmall and great: If you obſerve them narrowly, you will find, Sir, that theſe three ſins reign infallibly in the Hearts of all men, of whatſoever condition; thoſe in whom you cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them, are very often the greateſt Hypocrites, who know better to diſſemble and cover their ſins. And for the <hi>ſecond,</hi> The believing that we are now in the Reign of Antichriſt, you need only Remark narrowly by what
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104476:225"/>
Spirit Men are led, becauſe they who are led by God, follow his Righteouſneſs, <note n="t" place="bottom">Eph. 4. 9.</note> his Goodneſs and his Truth: On the contrary, they who are led by the Devil, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to this; and if you Reflect upon the Actions of Men now, you will find nothing in them but <hi>Injuſtice, Malice</hi> and <hi>Lying,</hi> which are three qualities of the Devil, oppoſed to the <hi>Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Truth of God:</hi> This is ſo common at preſent, that there is nothing to be ſeen but Injuſtice, Malice, and affected Lies.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>in my opinion there were ſome men who ſeemed to follow Righteouſneſs and Truth; tho it muſt be acknowledged the greateſt part live in Injuſtice and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, Judg <note n="u" place="bottom">John 7. 24.</note> righteouſly, and examin everything to the bottom. You grant already that the greateſt part of men now live in Injuſtice and lies. All the World finds this by experience: And when the greateſt part is for the Devil, we may well fear that he will ſhortly have the whole; for as rotten Apples ſpoil the ſound ones, <note n="x" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15. 33.</note> ſo Men corrupted by the Devil, are ſtill corrupting and drawing in thoſe who are yet ſound. If all men in general, or almoſtall, were on the Devils ſide, the Reign of Antichriſt would be at an end, for he could gain no more; he would be pleaſed to have all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents with him to Hell; for the reaſon why he keeps them in Life here, and raiſes them to places and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is, that they may ſerve him in corrupting others, and in doing all the miſchief to the good that may be. Now there would be no need of this, if all in general were dedicated to his ſervice; he could go no farther; and God would not continue the World in being to wait for men's Converſion; for thoſe who are Dedicated to the Devil, will not be converted, as ſome other ſinners would be who have not yet renounc'd God, nor given their Souls to the Devil, as his ſworn Votaries or Sorcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do, who are preciſely dedicated to the Devil of their own free will; as the greateſt part of men have done. This may appear ſufficiently by their Malice, which is not only human, but Deviliſh alſo; for human Malice
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104476:225"/>
extends it ſelf no farther than to that which is pleaſant or profitable to the Malicious Perſon; but at preſent we ſee men's Malice ſo black, that he who acts it, has neither pleaſure nor profit by it; and nevertheleſs they afflict the good, and ruin ſometimes the wealth and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of their Neighbour, without any profit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And lies are ſo common, tho frequently without any advantage, that the truth is ſeldom or never ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, from whence it appears, that it certainly comes from the Devil, for men could not arrive at ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice as that is, which we ſee now reign in the World.</p>
               <p>If I told you, Sir, that I had theſe truths by any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Revelation from God, you would entertain, it may be, ſome ſcrupulous doubts about it; but I refer you to your own experience, that you may know by human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that we are fallen into the laſt times, that the Judgment is paſt on the whole World; And that this is now the Reign of Antichriſt. For <hi>as to the coming of Jeſus Chriſt in Glory,</hi> I cannot make it appear to you ſo preciſely, as the things that are already come to paſs; but if you read attentively the Holy Scriptvres, they will plainly enough declare it to you; for of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in them, there is <note n="y" place="bottom">See Pſ. 50. 72 75 96 97 98. Iſa. 40. &amp;c.</note> nothing more ſpoken of, than of the coming of Jeſus Chriſt on Earth in Glory: <note n="z" place="bottom">

I cannot make you ſee this, Sir, by the Eyes of the Body, becauſe the time is not yet come: Therefore I ſend you to the Holy Scriptures. But as for the Judgment and the Reign of Antichriſt, you may ſee it with your Eyes, and comprehend it with your Natural underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For it is viſible and comprehenſible by him whoſe Spirit is not infatuated, and who ſeeks to diſcover the Truth. The thing is ſo manifeſt, that it ſpeaks out it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104476:226"/>
ſelf: Many ſay blindly, <hi>We are in the end of the VVorld,</hi> and they perceive not that they ſpeak truth: Others ſay, <hi>The Devil reigns over all;</hi> and they ſee not that this is the Reign of Antichriſt, who Rules as Univerſal Emperour of the whole world. They Judg by the effects, without ſearching into the cauſe. The Devil hinders this, for he well knows that if the cauſe were diſcovered, many would be Converted; therefore he darkens their minds, that they may never come to the Knowledg of the Truth, becauſe it would confound him.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>I perceived clearly enough that the world was Judged, becauſe ſin abounds in it, and no body will be Converted: But that we were in the Reign of Antichrist, I did not perceive ſo clearly, for we have always been taught, that he ſhall be a Viſible and corporal man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, it is well that you ſee the World is Judged. You ſhall perceive the reſt ſufficiently, for the Reign of Antichriſt is yet more manifeſt. Antichriſt, that is to ſay, againſt Chriſt. He whoſe underſtanding is not dark'ned may eaſily ſee, if men follow Chriſt, or if they go in a way contrary to what he walked in while he was on Earth: And you ſee that Chriſtians now adays live a quite other Life than what Jeſus Chriſt led, and they not only do not follow him at a diſtance, but are directly oppoſite to him; for there Pride Reigns, inſtead of Humility; and Avarice, inſtead of Poverty; and inſtead of Charity, there is nothing but Envy; and ſo of all the other things which Chriſt Jeſus Taught us; They act wholly in oppoſition to him, and they do not conſider that all that is contrary to Chriſt, is Aſſuredly Antichriſt. The time is come wherein men would fain have a God and Devil Viſible to their Eyes, that might go before them. This is great and thick darkneſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither God, nor the Devil are viſible; For <note n="b" place="bottom">Joh. 4. 24. Eph. 6. 12.</note> they are Spirits, who cannot be known but by their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, when they are good or evil, according to the Spirit that Animates them. Hereby we ſhall know by what Spirit the World is animated at preſent; For the Spirit of God is always Juſt, Good and True; <note n="c" place="bottom">Eph. 5. 9.</note> and that of the Devil is always evil, without Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104476:226"/>
and without Truth. By theſe real Signs, we may certainly diſcern if Chriſt rules the World, or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt: We need not go to conſult Oracles to make this Diſcovery; for all Men of good judgment, may make a ſufficient trial, and ſee it with their Eyes, and feel it with their Hands, by taking the Marks which diſcover the ſolid truth: For if they will needs make this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by the ſigns of apparent Vertues, they will remain in their Darkneſs; becauſe the Devil has ſo diſguiſed and coloured his wickedneſs with outward Devotions and Piety, that he thereby deceives all the World. We muſt come to the Eſſence of Vertue, to ſee if it be God or the Devil, who animates theſe outward Devotions; for if they be of God, they will always be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth. But we ſee but too much the contrary; for the moſt part of thoſe Devout Perſons at preſent, are without Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Equity: There was never ſeen ſo much going to Church, receiving the Sacraments, and ſo little Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; ſo many <hi>Pater nosters,</hi> and ſo little Truth; ſo many good Words, and ſo little true Charity. Do you not ſee, Sir, that all order of Juſtice is renvers'd, and that there is more regard of doing Juſtly before Men, than before God? And yet theſe are the beſt now, who do juſtly before Men; for the moſt part deceive and deal unfaithfully, as well before Men as before God: For Iniquity is become ſo common, that now almoſt they are not aſhamed to commit it publickly.

the Day; becauſe the evil is too manifeſt. But many Minds are ſo infatuated, that they cannot believe what they perceive ſo manifeſtly by their Underſtandings, but they wait to believe this Antichriſt, till they ſhall ſee him in a Humane Form: Which is a very ſmall matter, in reſpect of his Doctrine; for that Body can never cauſe Damnation to our Souls, as his Doctrine will do, which being contrary to Chriſt, leads us to Perdition. Since Jeſus Chriſt <note n="g" place="bottom">Joh. 14. 6.</note> is the way, we can never attain to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation but by him; contrary ways lead to Damnation; it matters little whether we are led into them by a Body, or by a Spirit, ſince we are undone as to Salvation.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>If we ought not to believe, that this Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt will be ſometime corporeally viſible in a Humane Form?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Yes, Sir, I believe this will be toward the end of his Reign; for he has ſet himſelf to counterfeit all the Actions of Jeſus Chriſt, and to ape what he ſees he has done: And perceiving that Chriſt became a Natural Man, he alſo will move his Sorcerers to produce Men by the operation of the Devil; which is done many times, for there are certainly many of theſe Antichriſts born al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the World, who make great Havock in the Church, and have in their Train thoſe who are moſt in Authority; and as the Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to introduce Truth into the World, theſe incarnate Devils labour to introduce Lies into it, and to ſow Tares, as they did good Grain. I doubt not alſo, but they have a Head of their Iniquity, who will appear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly when his <note n="h" place="bottom">2 Theſ. 2. 8.</note> wickedneſs ſhall be diſcover'd, and when he cannot deceive any longer under the Cloak of Holineſs, he will deceive then by pure Wickedneſs, and will exerciſe cruelty towards all thoſe who will not be his Followers. That time, Sir, will not be ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as the preſent is, becauſe he ſhall be known for the Devil, and now they follow him as if he were God. Therefore he keeps himſelf ſo long concealed, and does not appear bodily; for he could not do ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to Souls, if he were known. He has ſpread Darkneſs through all the World, that no body may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover<note place="bottom">2 Tim. 3. 2.</note>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:104476:227"/>
him, exerciſing all his wickedneſs UNDER PRETEXT OF GOOD THINGS, OR OF NATU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAL OR CASUAL THINGS, that no body may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all the evils which we ſee, do come from this Antichriſt, and that no body may be on his guard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he does not appear yet in human Fleſh: This blinds all the World; for tho they ſee all the qualities of the Devil rule in men, yet they will not believe theſe ſo ſolid marks, as they would do if they ſaw him bodily, which bodily appearance is not real: For the Devil is pure Spirit, and has not the Power of forming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Body, unleſs it be a fantaſtical one, or elſe by the Seed of ſome Sorcerer, which is abominable.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>It was not to be doubted that we live cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in the time when Antichriſt Reigns by his Doctrine and his Operations; becauſe Men (in the general) have all, or the greateſt part of them, the qualities of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, there is no reckoning to be made of any other thing, but what concerns the Salvation of Souls; for if the Devil be followed in his Doctrine and in his Works, he needs no more to make himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of our Souls: He'll do no more hurt to men by his Body than he does by his Spirit; and if it were not to Ape God, he would never take a Natural Body; for he knows well enough, how to make a body of Air, or ſome other matter, to deceive Sorcerers, whoſe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation he ſo blinds, that they believe they ſee and feel ſome real body, tho it be only Phantaſtical. By this he prevails with them to commit all ſorts of Evil, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to dwell with them, that he may ſtill prophane the works which God has introduc'd for an Holy end.

               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>It was a great Loſs that theſe Truths could not be publiſh'd to all the world; for all are ignorant of them, and believe there is no Antichriſt until he appear in his humane Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, 'tis lamentable that theſe things, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to ſo many Souls, muſt be conceal'd; and that the Marvels of God, which are ſo important, cannot be diſcover'd. The laſt Times are come <note n="c" place="bottom">1 Cor. 10. 11.</note>: Antichriſt Reigns over all <note n="d" place="bottom">Rev. 13.</note>: And Jeſus Chriſt <note n="e" place="bottom">Rev. 16. 15.</note> will come quickly to Reign here in glory: The forerunning plagues <note n="f" place="bottom">Math. 24. 8.</note> of Judgment are begun; and no body will believe any thing of all this, becauſe we cannot ſpeak of them openly. You are the firſt, Sir, to whom I have declared theſe ſecrets: Make a good uſe of them. I ſhall reckon it a gain, tho none but your Soul alone ſhould receive the Light of them. The world is deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and will be, while they do not open their Eyes to the Truths I have told you: They are nevertheleſs from God, and cannot fail; if all the world will needs ruin themſelves, Sir, ſave your ſelf: For tho none of theſe things ſhould fall out in your Life-time, and you ſhould not ſee the utmoſt extremities of the Plagues, nor the Body of Antichriſt, nor yet the coming of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in Glory, yet it will be moſt expedient for you that you believe all theſe things, which will open your eyes to diſcover your particular faults, and the dangers in which you live, and will give you prudence
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104476:228"/>
to avoid the deceits in which we live at preſent. Make uſe of the occaſion, Sir, without contending out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity about words, and the times of every thing: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Judgment ſtill falls out <note n="g" place="bottom">Heb 9. 27.</note> when we die; and it <note n="h" place="bottom">Eccl. 11. 3.</note> will never be recall'd. Tho even there were not a general Judgment; yet there is always our particular Judgment, which preciſely reſpects us; and if all the People of the world periſht by the Deluge, excepting eight perſons, it was thro' their unbelief; for <note n="i" place="bottom">Heb. 11. 7.</note> if they had believed the words of <hi>Noah,</hi> they would have been ſav'd in his Ark: Even ſo now thoſe ſhall Periſh who will not believe the Truths that I tell you from God. They ſhall certainly Periſh in the Ship-wrack, becauſe they will not ſave themſelves in time, it will be in vain for them to aſcend into their Houſes of Honour and Glory, that they might avoid the Plagues which will follow them every where.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That I could not doubt any longer of the things ſhe told me, becauſe of the Operation of her words in my Soul, which could not but come from God: But I wiſh'd earneſtly that many might enjoy the ſame effects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, Your deſire will be fulfilled: for many will receive this Light, tho very few among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; becauſe they are ſo obſtinately wedded to a preſumption of their Salvation, being falſely perſwaded that they ſhall be Saved by their frivolous Devotions. Theſe will reſiſt the Truth, and believe they are Holy, and Perfect, till they ſhall ſee themſelves ſwallowed up of the Plagues; and when it ſhall be too late <note n="k" place="bottom">Prov. 1. 28.</note> they will cry for Mercy, without any hope of ſuccour, no more than in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> for it is not written that he took ſo much as one into the Ark after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge was begun: Thoſe who had not formerly gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it did all periſh, even as thoſe ſhall do who will not now believe that we live in the days of Antichriſt. They muſt of neceſſity be deceived by him, and Periſh. What remedy can there be for their evils, ſince they ſeek not to be healed, becauſe they are inſenſible of them, as they would be of a Leproſie? We muſt flee from them that we may not contract ſuch a dangerous malady as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104476:229"/>
this blindneſs. becauſe they ſhall be deſtroyed <note n="l" place="bottom">1 Theſ. 5. 3.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they know it. <hi>It ſhall be with them,</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="bottom">Luk. 17. 26.</note> ſays Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>as it was in the days of</hi> Noah; <hi>They Ate, they Drank, they Married, without any apprehenſion:</hi> Even ſo tho they ſee and feel the beginnings <note n="n" place="bottom">Mat. 24. 8.</note> of ſorrows by Wars, they do not apprehend them to be the laſt Plagues; they endeavour to eſcape and avoid them by Human means, going from one place to another, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring what Chriſt ſays, <note n="o" place="bottom">Luk. 17. 34, 35.</note> 
                  <hi>That two ſhall be grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at one Mill, the one ſhall be taken, the other left, or even two in the ſame bed:</hi> To ſhew that it avails nothing for one to ſave his Body; but he muſt endeavour to be united unto God; or otherwiſe, he ſhall be taken in what place ſoever he go to.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That I would follow her even to Death, becauſe ſhe had the words of truth, tho all the world ſhould withstand it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, There is no need that you follow my Perſon, but my words; keep them in your Heart, and thereby you will attain to Salvation; for they are ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Never turn away from them: For the Devil has this invention, to raiſe a great many diſtractions that he may divert us from following the Truth; he ſends ſickneſs, Troubles, Affairs of Importance, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other occaſions, to divert our good purpoſes, that we may never bring them to effect. If you were ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sir, with all good men who are in publick Offices, whether Civil or Eccleſiaſtick, they would acknowledg to you that they were never ſo throng'd with Affairs or Buſineſs as now; becauſe the Devil being unable to gain them entirely to himſelf, he endeavours, at leaſt, to give them ſo much buſineſs, as that they may not have leiſure to think of their Salvation, nor of the Dangers in which they live: We muſt certainly diſcover his wiles, or otherwiſe he will draw us along with him inſenſibly. He has deceived ſo many by theſe means, making them believe that their imployments were profitable for the Publick, or their Neighbours, when they ſerv'd for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but human accommodations, without any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104476:229"/>
to the Glory of God, or the Salvation of Souls: And under this Falſe Perſwaſion many have loſt their own Salvation, without procuring that of others. It is not in theſe laſt times, Sir, that Places, Offices, or Imployments are ſaving; it is much for a Man to ſave his own Soul; for the times are too dangerous, and the world too blind and obſtinate. If they perceived their blindneſs, they would ſeek to find a remedy: But while they believe they ſee clearly, they cannot think of a remedy, and they fall eaſily into eternal ruin: But if you, Sir, for your own part, would be ſaved, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Truth, and follow it, for without it there can be no Salvation: For it alone makes us to know God, and the Devil, and likewiſe the ſtate of the World, and that of our own Conſcience; Truth ſhews us alſo the certain way of Salvation; and by it all the wonders of God are diſcovered. It is the Light of the World, and the ſure harbour of Salvation, without which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be good or beautiful.</p>

                  <hi>of all things.</hi> You ſee clearly by all the Truths that I have told you, that very few will be ſaved of all thoſe who live at preſent after the uſual manner; and if this miſerable World ſhould laſt yet longer, there <note n="r" place="bottom">Matth. 24. 22.</note> would ſtill be fewer, becauſe every day it grows worſe. How therefore ſhould Jeſus Chriſt be the Saviour of the World, if he did not reſtore all things? No body could be Saved; for the whole World periſhes. There muſt come a time <note n="s" place="bottom">Iſ. 4. 3. 45. 22. Luk. 3. 6.</note> that the whole World ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he may be fitly called the SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD. And this cannot be in Heaven as People imagine, becauſe all who enter there ſhall be Saved, having received Salvation at the hour of Death; and this reſpects only particular perſons, who by reaſon of their ſmall number cannot well be called the WORLD, becauſe it conſiſts in a Generality, and not in ſome particular Perſons. 'Tis a truth therefore that in a certain time <note n="t" place="bottom">Pſ. 98. 2, 3.</note> Jeſus Chriſt will ſave all the World in general: This will be at his coming in Glory, when <note n="u" place="bottom">Pſ. 98. 9. 96, 97. &amp;c.</note> he ſhall have judged the World and condemned the Wicked, he will ſave the Good with all <note n="x" place="bottom">Iſ. 60. 21, 22</note> their Poſterity, who can never periſh any more, becauſe of the continual Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt, God and Man, who <note n="y" place="bottom">Iſ. 40. 11.

Rev. 11. 17, 18.</note> to reſtore all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there has been no reparation yet of all the Injuries and Affronts that were done to his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: His low Condition has not been raiſed up; his Poverty has not been enriched; his Tears have not been wiped away; his Humility has not been exalted; neither have any other of his Contempts
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104476:230"/>
and Sufferings been repaired, nor of thoſe who have loved and followed him: One has died as a Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, another as a Seducer, a St. <hi>Andrew</hi> on the Croſs, a St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> on the Grid-iron, and ſo many other holy Martyrs who have ſuffered Perſecution and Death for Righteouſneſs and Truth. There has been no reparation of all this hitherto, but by imaginary things, as they ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt was exalted on the Croſs, which is an infamous reparation, to dye on a Gibbet as a Malefactor. If thoſe who hold this Croſs to be a reparation of Honour, were hanged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner themſelves, they would not believe that their Honour were repaired by this: How can they imagine that that of God was ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not to be imagin'd that Honour ſhould be repaired by Infamy it ſelf. But becauſe his coming in Glory was unknown to them, they have applied Infamy to Glory, that they might ſay ſomething of it. The truth is, Jeſus Chriſt will come upon the Earth to <note n="a" place="bottom">Rev. 20.</note> repair all things; for it would not be juſt that he ſhould have ſuffered ſo innocently, and after him ſo many other Saints and Martyrs, who were free from Crimes, and that they ſhould continue dead, without being repaired Spiritually and bodily for what they have ſuffered unjuſtly, or for the Love of God; and if People imagine that all theſe things muſt be repair'd in a Divine and imaginary Heaven; they are deceived, becauſe this reparation cannot be perfectly made there; for natural ſufferings ought alſo to have ſuitable reparations, unleſs God did as Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers do, who cure bodily wounds with ſpiritual reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, or ſome artificial words. No, Sir, this will not go after that manner; becauſe God does his works al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a perfection, every way accompliſh'd. <note n="b" place="bottom">Deut. 32. 4.</note> He will repair both bodily and ſpiritually all that has been done unjuſtly; and the whole world ſhall thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth, that every one may know that he is worthy, and juſt; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all honour; which then all the world will render to him <note n="c" place="bottom">Iſ. 45. 23, 24</note>; and juſt, to render compleat Juſtice to every

one <note n="d" place="bottom">Rev. 11. 18.</note>. There are ſo many innocent perſons afflicted, and Saints unknown and deſpiſed; on the other hand there are ſo many wicked men honour'd, rais'd to places and Honours, and even held for Saints. All theſe being Dead, and the Truth, as to them, undiſcover'd, muſt not God avenge the quarrel of the Good, and make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the wickedneſs of the wicked, that he may be Juſt, Good, and True?</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That every one look'd for theſe Reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the day of the general Judgment, which muſt be done in a little time, or ſuddenly, where every one ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenc'd in Heaven according to his Merits or Sufferings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, They will make God a God of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: What appearance is there that this Judgment can paſs in a day, or ſuddenly, ſince the whole world muſt appear there? It ſhould be neceſſary that all the men in the world, ſhould, after the manner of an Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be Tranſported to the ſame place in an inſtant; who could hear in that croud the Juſtification of the Righteous? If it were to be done only by word, they would not hear one, by reaſon of another; and if every one in particular muſt be ſpoke to, to declare his good or evil Deeds, it would need a long time before all were repair'd: Years would not ſuffice to Judg ſo many men as have been upon the Earth. Truly, Sir, all the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of men are nothing, in reſpect of the Truth, but Chimera's in the Air. God took ſix days <note n="e" place="bottom">Gen. 1.</note> to Create the World deliberately and in order, as he has done all his works by weight <note n="f" place="bottom">Wiſd. 11. 21</note> and meaſure, without any diſorder or confuſion. He made <hi>Noah</hi> prepare an hundred years before the <note n="g" place="bottom">Gen. 6. 3, 13, 14.</note> Deluge; and when it came, it began to Rain, which Rain laſted <note n="h" place="bottom">Gen. 7. 14.</note> forty days. The Plagues are now begun, and will follow in order even to their end, and the Judgment will alſo go on in order, ſo deliberately, that there ſhall not be the leaſt confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in it; for that can come only from men, and not from God, who does all in Order.</p>
               <p>Neither is there any imaginary Heaven, as people fancy it, where every one ſhall be Rewarded or Reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104476:231"/>
for Heaven is no other but the preſence of God, who contains all things, and can't be contain'd by any, becauſe he is greater than all things. We are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven when <note n="i" place="bottom">Pſal. 73. 25.</note> we are reſign'd to him, whether we live or die, we are ſtill in Heaven when we are in God: Now being thus Divinely in God, we do not, notwithſtanding, receive the material and bodily reparation of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which we have materially and bodily endur'd: And as God has given us both a Body and Soul, he has alſo given us a Paradiſe both of Body and Soul: For this cauſe God would have become Man, even tho man had never ſin'd; for God makes all his works perfect and compleat: The Soul can indeed have its compleat Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe by the Preſence of God, becauſe it is a Spirit like to him; but the Body can have no Paradiſe but a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and Bodily one like it ſelf; becauſe it is of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Nature, it cannot have a perfect happineſs by a Spirit, or Divinity. Lo, this is the reaſon why Man, that he may be happy, muſt of neceſſity have his Paradiſe in the world, which was Created by God for no other end <note n="k" place="bottom">Iſa. 45. 28.</note> but to ſerve for a Paradiſe to Man, whom he was pleas'd to Create of a Bodily and Spiritual Nature, both together; and he has alſo prepar'd for him, both a Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Spiritual Bleſſedneſs, which are, the Preſence of God as to the Spiritual; and for the Corporeal, the Earth, and the World, and all that therein is: By which you may ſee, Sir, the truth of the coming of Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth, to Reign with Men, that their eternal Bleſſedneſs may be compleated, and that every one may have a Reparation, by fulfilling all Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; not in a ſpeculative or imaginary way, or of a ſhort continuance; but a Real, Divine and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Reparation, <note n="l" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. and 66. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 14.—17.</note> which will laſt for ever: For God's Recompences are not Temporal and Finite, but Eternal, as coming from an Eternal God, who can't give finite or imperfect gifts. Conſider, Sir, all theſe Truths, and you will perceive ſenſibly, why Chriſt muſt come to Reign upon Earth; and that he has not taken an human Body to Reign in the Empyreal Heaven which is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:104476:232"/>
Divine, but only to Reign on Earth; for this Divinity has no need of any Body; but this body has need of, and muſt of neceſſity have ſome material place to contain it, ſuch as the Earth is. And if to repair an injury done to any, it be needful to make the reparation in the ſame place, and before the ſame perſons where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury was done; why ſhould not God repair upon Earth the injuries received there? On Earth they ſhall be <note n="m" place="bottom">Pſal. 37. 9, 11.</note> repaired, as on Earth they have been committed.</p>

by which the Devil has withdrawn Chriſtians from the Law of God, they having Ordain'd ſo many outward things, that the inward may be forgotten; and that thro ſo many Natural things, People may think no more of the Spiritual.

                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:104476:233"/>I AM SENT with a Commiſſion to declare all theſe things to men, to the end that, peradventure, ſome of them may be Converted and Repent, that they may Reign with Jeſus Chriſt in his Glory: But wickedneſs is come to ſo great an height, that the Truth can't be declar'd to Men, at leaſt they will not any more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it: They love nothing but <note n="r" place="bottom">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 3. and 4.</note> Flattery and lies, and reject the Truth, becauſe it agrees not with their way of Living; for he who will continue in his Sins and Errors, will ſay, that we trouble him, by Declaring the Truth to him; and he who will not amend, will ſay, that we raiſe ſcruples to him, by telling him the Truth, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves him. Thus all the World periſhes, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to be helped.</p>
               <p>I AM CERTAINLY SENT FROM GOD, to declare the Truth of every thing: But no body will hear it but in ſo far as it is agreeable to them, and does not reprove them. Should I ſtudy Sir, to pleaſe Men or God? A Meſſenger ought not to receive either Good or Ill, when he is but the Miniſter of good, or ill News, without having caus'd them. I have lov'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, for I was born and baptized under her; and have punctually follow'd her Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the deciſions of her Councils when I knew them: But ſince God has made me ſee, that ſhe is unfaithful to him, and has forſaken him to join her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Devil, ought I not to declare theſe truths to my Chriſtian Brethren, who are ignorant of them, that they may not periſh in their ignorance? They would be much to blame to render me evil for good, and to perſecute me for procuring their Salvation; for I have no advantage by declaring theſe truths to them, except the obedience I owe to God, and the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity I have for their Souls; for otherwiſe I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of ſpeaking things that are ſo diſagreeable to them.</p>
               <p>I ask'd her, <hi>What perſon on Earth could be ſo wicked, as to perſecute her for declaring ſimply the truth that comes from God without any paſſion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, all good men will perceive abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104476:233"/>
by my words that I am not mov'd by any vicious paſſions; but by a pure deſire of declaring the truth; becauſe I neither ſeek nor pretend to any thing from any body: The friendſhip and hatred of men is all one to me, there is nothing but the pleaſing or diſpleaſing of God that touches me. Notwithſtanding the Devil hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great a number of his adherents who are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, he will excite them to riſe up againſt me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the truth which diſcovers his wickedneſs. He has for a long time ruled in the Church under a colour of Holineſs, by which means he has gain'd the moſt Pious to be his Followers without their perceiving it: But as ſoon as the Truth ſhall be ſhewn them, they will eaſily diſcover his deceits, and will abhor them. This will enrage him againſt me, and <note n="s" place="bottom">Rev. 12. 13, 17.</note> he will purſue me with all his force. But I do not fear that he ſhall be able to touch me; for God is my defence. I will not fear all thoſe Enemies, how Powerful ſoever they may be. The Lord whom I ſerve is above all things. I have never done Evil to any Body; but all ſort of good to all, according to my Power. Nevertheleſs I ſhall not fail to be purſu'd and Perſecuted by all thoſe who are the Devil's adherents; becauſe by my means his head <note n="t" place="bottom">

I AM CRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATED FOR THIS, and cannot be ſilent, when it ſhall be time to ſpeak I will ſpeak, both in publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, when it ſhall pleaſe God, but ſtill the truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtraying from it.

               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That the</hi> Roman Church <hi>would be a ſtrong adverſary, for ſhe has great power and authority, and will yield to nothing that is not agreeable to her Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>* <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Sir, the power of that <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> ſhall be very ſhortly taken away by the Lord of Hoſts who will <note n="y" place="bottom">Rev. 6. 10, 11.

All her members ſhall be disjoynted, and diſlocated, and without power. She muſt bear rule yet for a little time, and exerciſe her villanies outwardly, as ſhe has done for this long time inwardly; her murders and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are at the door, to the end her evil may have its full accompliſhment, both inward and outward. Till then God will let her go on, becauſe his juſtice never inflicts a perfect puniſhment <note n="z" place="bottom">Mat. 23. 32, 33. Rev. 18. 5.</note> till the evil be perfect and compleat in all reſpects; for evil always <note n="a" place="bottom">Jer. 2. 19.</note> begets puniſhment, according to the greatneſs of the evil the puniſhment is meaſured out. I have no apprehenſion of her power; becauſe he who has given it, will take it from her. She will not do ſo much evil in killing bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as ſhe does now in killing Souls; for it will be the happineſs of thoſe <note n="b" place="bottom">Rev. 14. 13.</note> who ſhall die for the real truth, if they receive it. For hitherto it has not been yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, nothing of the Holy Scripture has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd in its perfect ſenſe, every one has drawn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures from it according to his Light, not according to what is in it in effect; thus they might well die for holding ſome opinion which was not the real truth, but the opinion of ſome Author, for which they might die indeed without being for this the <hi>Martyrs</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. For to be ſuch, a man muſt die for the Defence of the Law of God, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel, or otherwiſe he cannot be a <hi>Martyr</hi> before God, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men call many others by this name; this ſhews that there is obſcurity and darkneſs through all; even in the<note place="bottom">(<hi>x</hi>) <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. <hi>and</hi> 18.</note>

moſt holy things: Every one walks in the dark, not diſcerning the pure Truth: Even many who have the beſt Maxims, would judge indeed that I were an Heretick, in ſpeaking againſt the Decrees of the Councils of <hi>Rome,</hi> out of a pious belief that they have been all held by the Co-operation of the Holy Spirit. Which is a falſe Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: For the Holy Spirit never changes. With what he inſpir'd the Apoſtles, he inſpires alſo at preſent thoſe who hear him. They are always the ſame things.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That the Holy Spirit did ſometimes inſpire diverſe Means for the attainment of the ſame End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> 'Tis true, Sir, if the Means which thoſe Councils ſet before us did all aim at the keeping of the Commands of God, and at his Doctrine of the Goſpel, I ſhould believe that they came from the Holy Spirit; but when they aim at a quite contrary ſenſe, I may well judge that they come not from thence; becauſe God never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himſelf: He has commanded, that we love him with all our Heart; and theſe Councils ſay, that to get the Pardon of our Sins, and obtain Salvation, it ſuffices that we have a ſorrow for ſin out of fear of Hell. Can theſe two contrary ſenſes come from the ſame God? And there are ſo many other things which are variouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, (as I have told you formerly); as the baptizing little Infants; and a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other things, which are directly contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. I know indeed, that they deny this Truth, ſaying, that they have ordain'd nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of God: For with ſtudied: Words and Terms they cover all their Faults; and I am neither a Philoſopher nor Divine to anſwer their artificial Arguments or ſtudied Words; but I ſay in truth, that they do in effect directly contrary to the Law of God, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel: Not that they ſay ſo; but they do it: And Deeds are more <note n="c" place="bottom">Tit. 1. 16.</note> than Words. I doubt not but they would ſurprize me by my Words: For the Devil has nothing but Subtilties wherewith to cover his Malice: But they cannot ſurprize me in the matter of the Eſſential Truth, which abides always true. They might ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Councils do not ſay that we ought not to love
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104476:235"/>
God with all our Heart; but only that Attrition is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for Salvation: Is not that enough to teach indirectly that we are not obliged to love God? And is not this indirect Doctrine much worſe than the direct, which no good Men would follow?</p>
               <p>I asked, <hi>If the Light which ſhe received from the Holy Spirit was contrary to what the Councils had ordained?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid,</hi> Yes, Sir, the Decrees which the Councils have made (ſo far as I know them) are all directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what the Holy Spirit dictates to me: And you your ſelf may perceive it: Though there were nothing but the forbidding to read the Goſpels and the holy Bible in the Vulgar Tongue, is not this contrary to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt; who has given his Word rather to the vulgar and ſimple People, than to the Learned <note n="d" place="bottom">1 Cor. 1. 27, 28.</note>? And if it had not been his Will they ſhould read it after his Death, he would not have left it them in Writing. This is the Nouriſhment of the Children of God <note n="e" place="bottom">Mat. 4. 4.</note>: And theſe Councils would make them die for hunger. Is not alſo the forbidding Prieſts to labour againſt the Commandment of God, who ordained <hi>Adam,</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 19.</note> the moſt holy of all Men, to labour in penitence for his Sin?

There are alſo many other things which theſe Councils have ordained, that are contrary to the Light that God gives me which is wholly conformable to the Law of God and the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. I have no need to read any Books to know if they be endited by the Holy Spirit, becauſe the Sentiment of my Soul gives me ſtill evidence enough of them. When I underſtand only the ſubſtance of a thing, I perceive certainly, whether it come from the Holy Spirit or not. You may eaſily ſee, Sir, by all that I have already told you, that this Church and her Councils
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104476:235"/>
are not guided by the Holy Spirit; but <note n="h" place="bottom">Iſa. 29. 9, 10.</note> by the Spirit of Errour which deceives all the World under this falſe Maſque of the Holy Church and Holy Councils, whereby the moſt Innocent let themſelves be ruled by the Devil at his pleaſure, while they believe that they follow the Truth, which is God.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>I was more certain that ſhe was guided by the Holy Spirit, than that the Church and her Councils were ſo; and therefore ſhe muſt tell me what I ought to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, You may indeed lean to my Sayings, becauſe I ſpeak nothing of my ſelf. It is true, it ſeem'd ſomewhat hard to you, that I overturn the Church and her Councils; and alſo when I ſay that the Devil rules them: But I know this by the Light of the Holy Spirit, which obliges me to declare it, perhaps for the enlightning of others, that they may be converted; or to give them a full Meaſure, that no body may pretend Ignorance: For if I were not preſt in my Conſcience, I would beware to ſpeak of ſuch Evils, as one trembles to hear them. It were more pleaſant and agreeable if I could ſay in truth, that the Church is guided by the Holy Spirit, and that <hi>Rome</hi> is the Church of God. This Diſcourſe would comfort my Soul, and give content to all thoſe who are under her Obedience. But this not being true, I ſhould flatter them to their deſtruction: Whereas the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Things may ſave them. You have been alſo troubled ſometimes to hear me ſay that all men now are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104476:236"/>
in a ſtate of Damnation, which notwithſtanding is moſt true; and if I could ſay in truth the contrary, I would be lov'd and follow'd by all thoſe who believe they are in a ſtate of Grace: But becauſe I can't ſpeak a Lie, every one leaves me that they may flatter themſelves with fine Hopes; Truth ſeeming to them more hard than Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; though the one be much more lovely than the other; Becauſe Truth enlightens alwayes the Underſtanding; though it be ſometimes hard to Senſe, yet it can lead us to Salvation, and make us happy to all Eternity; whereas Damnation renders us for ever miſerable. 'Tis a trouble to us to be told that we are out of the way of Salvation, and we ought rather to be grieved for being ignorant of the truth in thoſe Things which concern our Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: <note n="i" place="bottom">Iſa. 4. 13.</note> The ignorance of this occaſions our Damnation. Therefore, Sir, never be troubled any more to hear me tell the Truth in evil Things; for it is much more uſeful than to have it declared in good Things. For if I ſhould ſay to you, that you are in a ſtate of Salvation, your Soul ſhould receive no advantage thereby: On the contrary, it might be tainted thereby with Vain-glory, or contract a ſloth in that which is good: And i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I ſhould ſay to you, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is Holy, and guided by the Holy Spirit, it would be of no advantage to you, ſince you obey her as much already as if ſhe were really Holy: You could not gain any thing by my ſaying ſo. So that to know the Truth of Good is much leſs profitable than to know the Truth of Evil, from which one cannot preſerve himſelf without knowing it. This the Devil knowing, he has found the way to introduce into the Church a Maxim, That <hi>we ought never to ſpeak evil of any, though it were true.</hi> They call this <hi>the Sin of Detraction;</hi> that her Evil may be ſtill concealed, and none may dare to diſcover it for fear of committing a ſin. It were good we knew in what place the Holy Spirit has declared, That to tell the Truth of Evil is a ſin: For if this were true, Jeſus Chriſt would have committed many ſins, when he publickly called the Prieſts and Phariſees, <note n="k" place="bottom">Mat. 12. 34. Chap. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Hypocrites, Generation of Vipers,</hi> and ſo many other Names, diſcovering their Wickedneſs and Falſehood, ſaying, <hi>That they were whited Sepulchers,</hi>

                  <hi>fair without, but within full of dead mens bones; and that they made clean the out ſide, leaving the in-ſide full of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Could all theſe Truths diſcovered by Jeſus Chriſt, be ſins of Detraction? as they have perſwaded all thoſe which declare ſuch Truths; ſince all that Jeſus Chriſt did while he was upon Earth, was to give us an Example? Is it not evident enough, Sir, that the calling that ſin, to declare the Truth of another mans Evil, has been invented by the Devil, to cover his filthineſs, and that all ſort of ſins and Evils might be cheriſhed by the privacy of them? For the moſt part of good men endeavour to excuſe and cover them, believing they do well in it, though notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it be a very ill thing, becauſe it is hurtful Three ſeveral ways: <hi>Firſt,</hi> to him that does evil, who will not amend ſo eaſily while his evil is conceal'd as if it were diſcovered: <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is very prejudicial to him to whom the evil is done; becauſe it is very hard to avoid or guard againſt an unknown Evil: And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To the Perſon who conceals anothers Evil, who co-operates to the Evil of him that does it, and of him that receives it; and nevertheleſs, they call that great Good of declaring the Truth of Evil, the <hi>Sin of Detraction.</hi> This unhappy Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence makes all ſort of Abominations daily to encreaſe in the ſight of God; becauſe they having loſt his Fear, they loſe alſo that of Men; ſince their ſins cannot be diſcovered without offending God. This is alſo a Doctrine which the Devil hath invented, with ſo many others, to the end that every one may follow Antichriſt, while they think they are doing well: For if it were a ſin to declare the Truth of Evil, Jeſus Chriſt would not have done it of his Apoſtles themſelves, calling <note n="l" place="bottom">Mat. 16. 23.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> publickly <hi>Satan,</hi> and reproving him in all his Faults; as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <note n="m" place="bottom">

                  </note> afterwards did their Diſciples: But theſe new Maſters teach, That it is a ſin to declare the Truth of Evil without any other ground but that of covering their Wickedneſs, that their Evils may not be diſcovered, and they may commit them the more, by continuing in the Reputation of being good Men, though they be wicked. If they had conſidered well the Nine ways by which we
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104476:237"/>
may ſin in another, they would find, that 'tis a ſin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the Truth of Evil; whereas they teach, that 'tis one to diſcover it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I entreated ſhe would explain to me the meaning of theſe ſins which we commit in another; and if we are guilty of them, that I might guard againſt them.</hi>

                  <hi>ſearches the Heart and the Reins,</hi> and not ſo much the Feet, or the Hands.

(18) 13.</note> though notwithſtanding they be mortal and damnable ſins. Every one excuſes himſelf of them before Men: Which he cannot do before God; for Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance never excuſes ſin: If we are very careful and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to know and diſcover what is neceſſary and profitable for our Body, we are obliged to be much more ſo as to our Soul. 'Tis not enough that one ſays he knows not theſe ſins, becauſe every one is obliged to know them; and our Salvation or Damnation depends upon them: For he who ſins ignorantly, goes ignorantly to Hell. We are created for no other end but for Salvation: This is the only Affair of Importance that concerns us moſt nearly; for ſetting aſide Salvation, all is periſhing. For this cauſe we muſt ſtudy to diſcover what <hi>Sin</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Therefore to ſatisfie your Demand, I will explain the Nine Ways by which we offend God in another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> We commit ſin in <hi>counſelling to do evil.</hi> How many are there who are guilty of this ſin without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it? If you have a Friend affronted, you will ſay to him, <hi>I would not ſuffer this Affront without revenging my ſelf:</hi> Or you will tell him, <hi>You would not have the Heart to ſuffer it;</hi> and ſuch like things: Or if we give any Counſel that is not according to the Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, or Truth of God; or if we counſel any to do evil for our pleaſure, or profit, or otherwiſe. Theſe Counſels are as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104476:237"/>
many Sins as the wicked Actions which thoſe commit whom we have counſel'd to do them, whether they be in Word or Deed; becauſe our Advice is often the cauſe why the Sin is done: By a juſt Title then, we ought to bear the puniſhment of it; as we ſhall certainly do before God, who looks more to the Wickedneſs of the Heart than to the evil Actions: And he who counſels another to do evil, is ſometimes more wicked than he who does it out of complaiſance to his Counſellour, or out of the eſteem he has for him. Thoſe in Offices, or Attorneys and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates who give Counſel, and not according to ſtraight Juſtice and Truth, do often fall into theſe Sins, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to be condemn'd of the ſame guilt with him who commits the evil Deeds to which they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him; for they have both equally contributed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and the Counſellour often with more Wickedneſs than the Doer, becauſe to counſel Evil is worſe than to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He who <hi>ſupports Evil</hi> commits alſo the ſame ſin with him who does it, becauſe if Evil were not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, it would not be ſo often committed: Therefore, the Supporter of Evil cauſes the evil Deed, and gives the Man boldneſs to commit it the more; and therefore he who ſupports it, ought juſtly to bear the puniſhment of him who does it, yea, even more; for it would be in his power to hinder it, by not ſupporting it. Thoſe are doubly guilty, that is, of the ſupport that they themſelves give, and of the Evil done by the other, which he would not do, if he were not ſupported in it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Way by which we commit ſin in another, is, In <hi>commanding to do Evil.</hi> In which Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Maſters and Miſtreſſes, and other Superiours, do very often fall; who command thoſe under them, to do ſomething that is not juſt or good. Theſe are guilty of as many ſins as they command their Subjects or Inferiours, who very often, if they were left to themſelves, would not, or durſt not, commit the Evils which are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them: Though Inferiours are not obliged, and never ought, to obey the Commands which are given them to do evil, yet the Commanders ceaſe not to offend mortally<note place="bottom">(q) Acts 5. 29.</note>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:104476:238"/>
only by commanding it; as an Inferiour commits a mortal ſin in doing the Evil which has been commanded him, becauſe the ſins of the one cannot leſſen the ſins of the other, but both are guilty of the ſame commanded ſins. In which many are deceived, who believe that 'tis lawful for them to do the Evils which have been enjoyned them by Father, Mother, Maſters or Miſtreſſes, or any other Superiours, whoſoever they be; as alſo ſuch Superiours deceive themſelves, who are perſwaded that they have not commited ſins, when they act not in the evil Deeds; for truly, and in the ſight of God, they commit as many as they have commanded to be done; for if their Wills were not evil, they would never adviſe to do evil, much leſs command it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> way by which we offend God by another, is, When we <hi>commend or approve Evil,</hi> This is very common in this Age, wherein evil Doers are commended. When we ſee any one avenge himſelf of an Affront, we will ſay, He ſhews that he has Courage; we are ready even to praiſe Children that are malicious in defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as others who give blow for blow; or thoſe <note n="r" place="bottom">Pſal. 49. (48) 18.</note> who ſignalize themſelves by Pompand Vanity; or we praiſe thoſe who exceed in Feaſting, or other Evils, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be. Now the Praiſe of Evil incites Men to do it the more, and encourages them to commit it the more boldly. And therefore he who praiſes it, is guilty of as many ſins as he who does the Evil.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> Way by which we offend God in another, is, In <hi>partaking of the Evil;</hi> as, when one has ſome Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by the Evil done by another; or, if any one profit by the Theft which another commits, whether by buying what is ſtolen, ot eating and drinking it, or by enjoying ſome ill-gotten Goods: So alſo he who makes gain by the Gluttony or Drunkenneſs, or other ſins which other Men commit. By all theſe Things Men are partakers of other Mens ſins, and thereby do the ſame Evil with him who directly commits it, yea, even more; becauſe he who commits Theft, or any other actual Wickedneſs, runs the hazard of his Life, or of other corporal Puniſhments; but he who partakes in it only, lives without fear
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104476:238"/>
though he be equally guilty with him who commits it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nevertheleſs he does not undergo the ſame Pennance in this World; neither does he acknowledge his Faults, that he may give ſatisfaction for it in the other: Therefore his ſin is ſo much the more dangerous, becauſe he does not weigh it as it is weigh'd before God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> Way that we offend God in another, is, When we <hi>take pleaſure in another Mans ſins;</hi> as he who takes pleaſure to ſee Men fight a Duel, or otherwiſe; or is pleaſed that another cheats cunningly, or ſteals hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely, or provides for his Accommodations with Luxury and Vanity. Thus, whatever the Evil be, the pleaſure that we take in ſeeing another do Evil, is ſin: For he who loves God, ought to be grieved <note n="s" place="bottom">Jer. 9. 1. 2 Cor. 12. 21.</note> for all kind of Evil that he ſees committed by others, as well as for what he commits himſelf.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> Way, is, When we <hi>do not correct Evil, as much as is in our power;</hi> as, Fathers, Mothers, Maſters, Miſtreſſes, who tolerate the Evil of their Children or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, becauſe they deſire not to offend them, or for ſome other humane Reſpect, or even out of ſoftneſs of Temper, or natural Goodneſs, ſuffering Evil rather than they will correct it, when they are oblig'd to do it. All theſe are guilty of the ſame Evils with their Children or Inferiours; for their tolerating them is the cauſe that they are habituated and continue in Evil, who might have amended if they had been rebuked and chaſtiſed for it. Thus, many will be damn'd who are not apprehenſive of it: For all the Evils which Subjects or Inferiours commit for want of reproof, will be laid to the charge of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, as if they themſelves had committed them by their own Deed <note n="t" place="bottom">Ezek. 33. 6, 7, 8.</note>, becauſe of the Obligation that lyes on them to correct Evil, and their neglecting to do it upon whatſoever pretext.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eighth</hi> Way that we offend God in another, is, <hi>When we do not hinder Evil when we may do it;</hi> as, if Two Perſons quarrel or fight, and we might pacifie or divert them, nevertheleſs we will not give our ſelves the trouble, either through ſloth, or humane reſpect, or ſome other cauſe; or when we ſee one ready to do evil, and we might
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104476:239"/>
hinder it by admoniſhing him, or diſcovering his Evil by crying out, or otherwiſe; which we omitting, we commit the ſame Evil with him who does it, when it is in our power to hinder it by what way ſoever this might be, as by giving too much liberty to thoſe under our Charge, or leaving them in dangerous occaſions, or giving them Money, or other things, with which they take occaſion to offend God. In all theſe, and divers other Caſes, we are guilty of the ſins which others commit, by not hindring them, when we might have done it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ninth</hi> and Laſt is, <hi>That we do not tell the Evils that we know of others to thoſe who might put a ſtop to them;</hi> as, in not telling the Faults of Children, Scholars or Servants, to Fathers, Superiours or Maſters, who might prevent them. Silence, in this reſpect, does as much Evil as the Faults which are committed without the knowledge of the Superiours, becauſe if they were known to them, they might hinder or correct them; which they not doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of them, the fault and blame falls upon thoſe who conceal them, whether to pleaſe the Evil doers, or upon any other pretext whatſover, becauſe by their ſilence in ſome manner they co-operate to the ſin. Nevertheleſs, there are very few who are apprehenſive of theſe kinds of ſins, and much leſs do they repent of them; for they imagine, they are not guilty of them, becauſe they have not committed them effectively in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; yet they will be all imputed to them as well as if they had perſonally committed them; and they cannot be excuſed through ignorance, becauſe all Chriſtians are obliged to know what they ought to do or avoid; for Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles have ſet down all for him who will take the pains to ſearch for it. But the darkneſs is ſo great, that they perceive not the things that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and they live in ſuch a negligence of their Salvation as if they were aſſur'd of it, though they be very far from it; becauſe <hi>no</hi> 
                  <note n="x" place="bottom">Rev. 21. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>unclean thing ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Thoſe who enter there muſt be holy. None can otherwiſe <note n="y" place="bottom">Heb. 12. 14.</note> draw near to God, the Source of all Purity and Holineſs. In which many are deceiv'd who believe that Holineſs belongs only to the Perfect, whom
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104476:239"/>
they imagine to be ſome ſingular Perſons: And yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Holineſs no Man ſhall ever be ſaved.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That very few Perſons conſider'd theſe things, and ſcarce any look on themſelves as guilty of thoſe ſins which they commit in another, no more than of thoſe which they commit againſt the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe they perceive not that they are guilty of them; though notwithſtanding I ſee clearly, that thoſe who are eſteemed holy or perfect are tainted both with the one and the other of the ſaid ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I am well pleaſed that you begin to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that by which the World is condemn'd, that you may not need to believe it blindly; for if you perceive clearly that the Holy and the Perfect now are polluted with the ſins which they commit in another, and with thoſe againſt the Holy Ghoſt, thoſe whom they call Wicked are viſibly defiled with divers kinds of Actual Sins: Which is known to all the World, Of whoſe Salvation then can you hope for? The Wicked bring their Condemnation upon them through their obſtinacy in a wicked Life; and the Good draw it on by the ſins which they commit in another, and thoſe againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which they will not know, and much leſs amend, becauſe they preſume upon the certainty of their Salvation without all theſe Circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions whereby they might diſcover the ſtate of their Souls, or the Sins with which they may be defiled, which are Spiritual, and of which through blindneſs they are inſenſible. Hereby the Proof is juſt of the World's being univerſally judged, becauſe the ſins are univerſal; which ſins <note n="z" place="bottom">Jer. 2. 19.</note> do judge and condemn Souls. For God judges no Body: He only fulfils all Righteouſneſs; and thoſe who ſhall be condemned, ſhall be ſo always by their own ſins, and never otherwiſe. And if Sins condemn, then all they who live in them do bear their Condemnation: And ſince we ſee that in this Age neither the Good nor the Wicked are free from ſins, we cannot but ſee and confeſs, that the whole World is judg'd and condemn'd, and that we are arriv'd at the general Judgment, ſeeing generally ſin rules and bears ſway. We muſt not look for any other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation but that of our own ſins known to Gods Juſtice, which condemns always all that's unjuſt, without hatred
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104476:240"/>
and without favour. The Righteous Ballance of this Divine Juſtice being ſtill kept ſteady by a Hand that never ſhakes, does always condemn Unrighteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That I was wholly convinc'd by ſo clear and true Arguments: That I acknowledg'd, without doubt, the World was generally judg'd by its general Sins; asking her, if while this Sentence was putting in execution, there were not means whereby a Man might be converted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir, there are means of Converſion as long as we have life. There is place for Repentance till Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come upon the Earth, and root out all Evil; yea, even when he ſhall come <note n="a" place="bottom">Revel. 1. 7.</note> there will be yet hopes of Pardon: Therefore he ſays, <note n="b" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 11, 12. &amp; 21. 31, 32.</note> That <hi>Sinners and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots ſhall inherit the Kingdom, and the Children thereof ſhall be caſt out;</hi> becauſe theſe wicked Perſons may be yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and acknowledge their ſins; whereas thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdom, who eſteem themſelves holy and religious, continuing obſtinate in the preſumption of their Salvation, will be caſt out, though they be called the Children of God and of his Kingdom. There are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore means of Converſion for thoſe who will repent and change their manner of Life, even though they were the greateſt Sinners of the World; yea, even for thoſe who are full of the ſins againſt the Holy Ghoſt, or of the ſins committed in another, provided they get out of their darkneſs, and receive the Truth. For theſe ends <note n="c" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 12. 2. &amp; 10.</note> God puts his laſt Sentence in execution ſlowly, and ſends his Plagues one after another, that he may give time and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to all thoſe who deſire to be converted, to do peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: In which he ſtill exerciſes the Effects of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Goodneſs and Mercy, <note n="d" place="bottom">2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> not willing that a ſinner ſhould periſh, but that he live and be converted. The ſins againſt the Holy Ghoſt will be forgiven as well as other ſins, provided they repent of them; which they not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ſhall no more be pardoned when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come upon the Earth, than at preſent: For where there is no Repentance, there can be no pardon; for this cauſe the ſins againſt the Holy Ghoſt will be very rarely
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:104476:240"/>
pardoned, becauſe they are very ſeldom repented of and amended.</p>

               <p>I asked her, <hi>By what means we might know or diſcover thoſe who are truly converted to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Take the <hi>Eight Beatitudes</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt <note n="e" place="bottom">Mat. 5. 3-10.</note> has declared, and ſee if thoſe who ſay they are converted do poſſeſs them: For theſe only ſhall be bleſſed, and no others. Many ſay by word that they would be converted, and be wholly for God; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there are no appearances of it. Theſe are nothing but <hi>wouldings</hi> without effect, with which we deceive the World and our ſelves, and think to deceive God; which cannot be, for he is too penetrating, and is not amus'd with Words; therefore he has told us the Marks that one muſt have of true Converſion, and of a Right to Bleſſedneſs, by which real Converts may be diſcern'd from Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> He calls <hi>thoſe bleſſed who are poor in Spirit;</hi> to ſhew, that all they whoſe Heart or Will is yet bent to the deſire of having Wealth and Temporal Riches, are not convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor bleſſed; becauſe he who yet deſires Earthly Goods, is not converted to Eternal Goods; for theſe Two Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions cannot dwell together <hi>(f):</hi> However we ſay we are converted to God, we lie, ſo long as we are not poor in Deſires, and that we ſtill covet Earthly Things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt calls <hi>thoſe bleſſed who are meek;</hi> to ſhew, that they who are converted to God do always partake of his Goodneſs, and do good to all as they are able.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104476:241"/>
we hear People often ſay, that they are wholly devoted to God, while on occaſions we ſee them chagrin, angry, froward, at variance with their Neighbours, quarrelling inſtead of bearing with them, or doing them no good but by conſtraint. Such are not converted, no more than they who in this World ſeek their Pleaſure and Contentment, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn;</hi> and when we ſee that they will not endure or ſuffer any thing, but ſeek their Eaſe, Honour and Contentment, that they may live in as much Mirth as they can, theſe are not converted, and do not willingly mourn under perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We know thoſe that are converted to God, <hi>when they hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs:</hi> that is, thirſt earneſtly to become righteous, and ſeek the means and occaſions to attain to this Righteouſneſs. Theſe are not converted who content themſelves with their own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Vertue, without aſpiring to Gods Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or thirſting after true Virtue; but are more careful for Earthly Things, than for thoſe which are Eternal.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> Mark that Jeſus Chriſt has given whereby to know thoſe who are converted, and ſhall be bleſſed, is <hi>Mercy.</hi> As long as we ſee Mens Hearts hardened, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Charity for their Neighbour, minding only their own Intereſt, and not caring for the Troubles and Neceſſities of their Neighbour, theſe are not converted; becauſe they have no Mercy, which is a Mark of True Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> Mark is <hi>purity of Heart.</hi> He who delights in diſhoneſt Thoughts or Actions, cannot be converted? nor he who is ſubtil, and not ſincere in his dealings, but deceitful and over-reaching, bearing envy or ill-will to another. None of theſe are of a pure and clean Heart, and ſo are not converted to God nor bleſſed; for a pure Heart is ſtill upright, ſimple and chaſt: By which we may diſcover if it be converted to God. As alſo if a Man be a <hi>Peace-maker, and of a peaceable</hi> Diſpoſition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, and toward his Neighbour; this is a Mark of Converſion to God: For he who ſhould ſay he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and nevertheleſs ſhould live in trouble and diſquiet within himſelf, or in Debates and Quarrels with his Neighbours, he would be a Liar; for converſion
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104476:241"/>
to God brings along with it Peace, and Tranquillity, and Repoſe: This the Children of God experience, who alone can be called bleſſed and converted, they having the Marks that Jeſus Chriſt has given whereby to know them from the Children of the Devil. That none may falſly perſwade himſelf that he is converted, he declares all the Conditions neceſſary for this Converſion, that is, the Eight Beatitudes; the Eighth of which is, <hi>to ſuffer Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for Righteouſneſs ſake.</hi> Many believe they are happy when they are without ſufferings; nevertheleſs, this is a ſign that they are not faithful to God; for he who faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſerves him, will certainly ſuffer, becauſe the Devil and wicked Men will perſecute him for Righteouſneſs, and true Vertue; which is ſtill reprehended by them. By this Touchſtone true Converts may be known: For he who does not willingly ſuffer Perſecution for Well doing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires not to imitate Jeſus Chriſt, who is the true Pattern of all the Works which lead to Bliſs; and none can be happy or ſav'd but they who follow his Steps.</p>
               <p>And we falſly perſwade our ſelves of being converted to God if we poſſeſs not the Eight Beatitudes which Chriſt has publickly taught us: And as few as we ſee poſſeſs them, there are as few converted unto him. 'Tis all amuſement to believe that any will be ſaved without the poſſeſſion of theſe Eight Beatitudes, which Jeſus Chriſt has given as Marks whereby to know his true Children from thoſe who ſay they are, and are not.</p>
               <p>And that you may not be deceived, Sir, I have explain'd them all to you, one by one, that you may know what manner of Perſons theſe ought to be who in theſe laſt Times, and during the Plagues, deſire to be converted to God, wherein many if they will may be converted: And that their Converſion may be true, they muſt ſtill examine if they have theſe Eight Beatitudes, and they may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that as long as they have them not, they are not entirely converted; for Jeſus Chriſt has ſaid nothing in vain, and he has nam'd in particular all the Qualities the Bleſſed ordinarily have, without which they cannot be ſo. Theſe are not the Speculations or Words of Men, but the Warnings of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who cannot lie. Men would indeed gloſſe and diſpute to amuſe the World, but they can never change the Truth.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:104476:242"/>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That the Behaviour of Men being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it ſeem'd there were none now in the Grace of God, or in the Bleſſed Eſtate that Jeſus Chriſt had marked out, but rather that all did abound in ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, It ſeem'd ſtrange to you formerly, when I told you ſuch things, becauſe you had not examin'd it nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly enough, and the darkneſs is ſo great, that the truth is not any longer diſcerned. The Devil has ſo blinded Mens Minds, and diſtracted their Underſtandings, that they look to nothing now but the Appearance of Things, and not the reallity of them. Every one believes he ſhall be happy, though he have not ſo much as one of the Eight Beatitudes. Either all the World muſt be deceived, or Jeſus Chriſt has not pointed out aright the ſigns of thoſe who are in a ſtate of Salvation: For theſe Eight Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are not pronounced for thoſe who are in Heaven; becauſe all thoſe who are with God, poſſeſs all the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in perfection; and alſo there is no more perſecution, nor Hunger or Thirſt to be endured there; for there they are in perfect peace, and fully ſatisfied; neither is there any thing to be bewailed there, being in perfect joy; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they have poverty of Spirit, ſince they poſſeſs all things; there alſo there is no more occaſion of ſhewing Mercy to their Neighbour, for none has need of any thing, the leaſt of the Bleſſed poſſeſs more than the worth of Ten Thouſand Worlds: By which it appears, that Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks only of thoſe who are upon Earth, who are obliged to have theſe Beatitudes if they would be ſaved, and come to the poſſeſſion of the Promiſes made to each of the ſaid Beatitudes, which are the certain Marks whereby to diſcover if we live in a ſtate of Salvation or not. Nevertheleſs, no body examines himſelf upon this Head, to ſee if he have thoſe Beatitudes, no more than if they were not proclaimed for us. We ſay them as a Litany, and not as things that we are oblig'd to put in practice. In which we deceive our ſelves; for no body will attain to the ſtate of Bleſſedneſs, but he who in this World ſhall put theſe Eight Beatitudes in practice: And as far as Men are eſtranged from them, they are as far from their Salvation.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>What Remedy there was for ſuch general Evils in which no body could be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:104476:242"/>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I told you long ago that Paradiſe was ſhut, My meaning was, that no Body now at Death attains to Bliſs; becauſe in their Life-time they make no Preparation for it, but they are every way eſtranged from God: For it is not now known what is Sin, nor yet what is Vertue: They imagine they are Vertuous when they do ſomething that's good in appearance, and that they are not guilty of ſin when they do not commit wicked Actions. This is the moſt crafty deluſion of the Devil; by which he certainly gains all the good through this blindneſs of Mind. This is an univerſal Evil, which makes me afraid that not one Perſon ſhall be ſaved; becauſe none do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Evil but groſſe Sinners who live in Actual ſins: As for others, every Moment they take the Name of God in vain: One will ſay, <hi>I truſt in God;</hi> another, <hi>God will help us;</hi> another, <hi>God will ſhew us Mercy;</hi> and thus on a Thouſand other occaſions the Name of God is ſtill in their Mouth, calling on him to co-operate in their ſins: For when they ſay they truſt in God while the Soul wallows in ſin, is to deſire that God would do Injuſtice: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may wait long in this ſort of confidence, and ſhall never obtain their Deſire: For God cannot help thoſe who go on in ſin, without being unjuſt; which he will never be. And he who ſays that God will help him, while he lives as People do at preſent, ſays that God will help him to ſin; which he cannot do: For he cannot contribute directly or indirectly to any Sin; and if he aſſiſted us in the way we live, he ſhould contribute to many ſins <note n="g" place="bottom">Iſa. 20. 10.</note> which we commit: For if he aſſiſted us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Temporal Goods, we would continue, yea, encreaſe our Pride, our Exceſſes and Vanities; and if he delivered us from Wars, Peace would give us occaſions to forget God, and to abandon our ſelves the more to bodily Pleaſures and Senſualities; and if he delivered us from our Miſeries, of whatſoever kind, we would certainly be led to greater Evils: For Eaſe and Sloth engender all ſort of Sins. And when we ſay, <hi>God will have Mercy on us,</hi> and nevertheleſs we go on in a ſtate of ſin, this is to blaſpheme againſt the Righteouſneſs of God: Becauſe he can never have Mercy but <note n="h" place="bottom">Exod. 20. 6. Ezek. 33. 12.</note> upon penitent Sinners: Which the Godly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104476:243"/>
now a days are very far from; for they encourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Sins as if they were Vertues, and even call them by the Name of Vertues: For the Avarice of the Cloiſters and of the Religious is call'd <hi>Charity</hi> done them; and the Adorning of Altars, building of Houſes and Magnificent Churches is call'd the <hi>Honour of God,</hi> though theſe be but Vanities and Superfluities by which God is greatly offended. For if at Baptiſm we have renounc'd the World and its Pomps to become Chriſtians, how can we adorn Churches, which we call the Temples of God, with the ſame Pomps and Vanities, which Chriſtians are not permitted to ſeek after in their own Perſons, nor in what belongs to them? How can it be allowed to uſe them in Places particularly dedicated to God, without tacitely Inſinuating that God is ſerved with our ſins and Impurities, as are all <note n="i" place="bottom">Mal. 2. 3.</note> ſort of Pomps and Vanities, which are ſo common in Churches as well as in other places? Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs all this is covered with an Appearance of Vertue and Holineſs. This renders all the World impenitent: For every one amuſes himſelf with the belief of being ſav'd in a ſtate of Sin and Damnation; Which is truly a deſperate ſtate; becauſe he who believes he is good, will never repent, and much leſs will he do Penitence, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he ſhall never obtain Pardon: For God cannot pardon <note n="k" place="bottom">Luke 13. 3.</note> without Repentance. All the Remedy that I ſee in this, is a perfect Converſion unto God, and a New Birth, as if till now we had never been in the World: For all that we have done hitherto has been evil and blame-worthy in the ſight of God, though to us all ſeem to be good, through the Blindneſs of our Spirits, in which we have been ſo ſunk, that no Body has ſeen whither he was going, more than we do in a very dark Night.

               <argument>
                  <p> Shews, how a Man must be born again to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: And that he muſt return to a Dependance upon God, which is the only thing that he eſſentially requires of Man.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>How this New Birth could be in thoſe who are already advanc'd in Years and Learning?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, We muſt take up a Life wholly new, as if to day we were newly born: Becauſe all the good that we think we have done heretofore is all evil, or at leaſt good for this Life onely: For all our good Works have ſtill been attended with Self-love, or Humane Reſpects, <note n="m" place="bottom">Mat. 6. 2, 5.</note> which can never be recompenc'd in Eternity, becauſe we have here had their Reward. What we do out of Self-love is recompenc'd by our Satisfaction; and what we do out of Humane reſpects is recompenc'd by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency of Men: So that we can never in Juſtice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any other thing; for we are fully ſatisfied in this World, according to the Pretenſions or Ends we had in doing our good Works. Though they have been covered with a pretence of the Glory of God, or Charity to our Neighbours, yet in effect all this has been but Vanity-Therefore he who deſires to be converted, muſt take up <note n="n" place="bottom">Rom. 6. 4.</note> a Life wholly new, and believe aſſuredly that he has never done ſo much as one Action purely for the Love of God. Which we may abundantly perceive by conſidering all the Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and thoſe which we commit by another, with the Eight Beatitudes, and the other ſolid Vertues. Every one may ſee thereby how far he is from the State of the Bleſſed that Jeſus Chriſt has marked out in the Eight Beatitudes; and if he deſire to recover them, what need he has to take up a Life wholly new, and to become as a new-born Infant, who lets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104476:244"/>
be govern'd by his Heavenly Father. Neither Years nor Learning can hinder the reſigning of our ſelves to God, that he may rule us as it ſhall pleaſe him: For the more we are advanc'd in Years, the more haſte we ought to make to attain to Salvation, becauſe we have no more Time but the ſmall part of our Life that remains. The Converſion of thoſe come to Years ought not to be delay'd one Day, becauſe their Life may be gone, and then there is no Recovery; for after Death <note n="o" place="bottom">Heb. 9. 27.</note> there is no Remiſſion. The Learned ought alſo to conſider, that all their Learning is nothing but Ignorance in the ſight of God, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes often a hindrance to his Grace; and that the Time is come, <note n="p" place="bottom">1 Cor. 1. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>that he will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and aboliſh the prudence of the prudent,</hi> that <hi>all may</hi>

                  <hi>receive the Kingdom of Heaven as little Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>It was very deſirable to be of the number of thoſe true Converts, and that I would be the firſt who would reſign all to God as a little Infant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, No body can be entirely converted if he do not know what is Sin, and alſo true Vertue. Theſe Two Things are neceſſary: For otherwiſe one will think, he is converted while he is yet full of Sins, and has not acquir'd any ſolid Vertues. Therefore I have ſpoken ſo particularly to you, that you may not abide in the darkneſs which ſurrounds all the Men of the World. There may be yet many who deſire to be converted: But few of theſe know their inward Sins, and yet fewer know what is true Vertue. All theſe would make falſe Converſions in the ſight of God: For if one does not know his hidden Sins, he cannot amend them; and if he know not what true Vertue is, he cannot put it in practice. The ignorance of theſe Two Things hinder a Man from being converted to God, or yielding himſelf to be governed by him. This is therefore what he ought firſt of all to learn, to know the ſtate of his own Soul, in what degree of ſin it is, and alſo in what degree of true Vertue. If theſe things were known, there be many who would embrace the Spirit of Penitence, and reſign themſelves to God as little Children: But becauſe they know not the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104476:244"/>
ſtate of their own Conſcience, many do inſenſibly periſh <note n="r" place="bottom">Iſa. 5. 13.</note> not knowing their Miſery. If you deſire, Sir, to be reſign'd to God as a Child, think that all you have done hitherto is worth nothing; and caſt <note n="s" place="bottom">Pſal. 37. 5.</note> your ſelf into the Arms of God, who is your Father, as a Child who cannot ſpeak, that he may teach you all things. He will certainly do it: For he deſires <note n="t" place="bottom">Ezek. 18. 23.</note> our Converſion. When we withdraw from him by our Sins, he ſuffers it, becauſe he will not take back the Free-will that he has once given us: For he is unchangeable <note n="u" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 29.</note> in all his Works: But as ſoon as we return to him by Penitence, he receives us as the Father did his Prodigal Son, owns us for <note n="x" place="bottom">Luke 15. 24.</note> his Children, and the Heirs of his Glory. But if you reſolve to adhere to your own Wiſdom, you will never receive the Holy Spirit. You muſt become ſimple as a Child, and not uſe your own Will any longer, reſigning and committing it wholly into the Hands of God, giving him the Reins of your Will, that he may guide and direct it as it ſhall pleaſe him; and that you may no longer abuſe it, as you have done hitherto: Which you muſt acknowledge with Regret: For if our Will had been govern'd by God, we had never fallen into ſuch Extremities of all Evils.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>I muſt acknowledge my Will had not been govern'd by God, becauſe I knew not as I do now the way how to reſign my ſelf to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, No body can be ſaved who knows not that he muſt be entirely reſigned to God: For this is the firſt and laſt Commandment that he has given to Man: And to ſay better; It is the only thing that God requires of Man. If we would abſolutely depend upon God, we ſhould fulfil all the Law and the Prophets. This is the one thing needful. All that ever I can ſay, Sir, is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in THE DEPENDANCE that we ought to have upon God; for he has never demanded any other thing of Man (nor will he ſo long as the World ſhall laſt) but this Dependance, that he owes to God. It is a very ſmall Matter that he asks of us. 'Tis a great Ingratitude alſo <note n="y" place="bottom">Deut. 32. 6.</note> for us to deny this Dependance upon him; ſince he is the Lord and Creatour of all Things, has created us of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104476:245"/>
Nothing, and gives us all that we have to enjoy in full Liberty, provided only we ſtill acknowledge our Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him in all Things. This Great God could he demand leſs of a ſilly Worm of the Earth, than the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of Dependance upon its God? This is ſo juſt a Thing, that though God had never declared to Man that he deſir'd this of him, he was oblig'd always to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it; ſince all came truly from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he had beſtow'd on him ſo many Favours and Prerogatives, which ſhould oblige him to a continual Gratitude, even though he had never had any thing beyond Natural Reaſon: For it is ſaid, that even Brute and Cruel Beaſts have been ſenſible of a Benefit received from Men all the Days of their Life; and Man endued with ſo accompliſht an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding will not acknowledge the Dependance he has upon God, nor yield up his Will to his, even though he be ſo good <note n="z" place="bottom">Prov. 23. 26.</note> as to deſire it! For if God were not an Exceſs of Goodneſs, he would rather diſdain Men of ſo little Worth, than permit them to unite their Will to his. Nevertheleſs, he permits and deſires it, yea, rejects and threatens thoſe who will not do it; as Jeſus Chriſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned St. <hi>Peter</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">John 3. 8.</note>, when he would not be waſhed by him. If we had but a little of Judgment, we would entreat God, to permit not only that our Will may be united to his; but rather, that ours may be wholly annihilated, and that he may exerciſe his own over us only and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>What ſhe meant by ſaying,</hi> That the Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of our Dependance upon God, was the only Commandment, <hi>ſince God had given us ſo many others?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, There is no Eſſential Commandment but this. All the reſt are Accidental. For when God created <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him all Men, he gave him Power over all Sublunary Things <note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. 8. 7.</note>, having made all the Beaſts ſubject to him, that he might rule over all as a Little God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reſervation, except that he ſhould always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Dependance that he had upon his Creator: Which being done by him, he might rule over all Things as a dependent Deity. And for a Token of this Dependance, he forbad him to eat of the Fruit of one Tree only, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104476:245"/>
him to eat of all the reſt. The meaning of which was, that Man might enjoy, uſe, and rule over all Things, provided always he acknowledg'd his Dependance on the Supream Deity, of whom he held all Things. And if <hi>Adam</hi> had not forgotten himſelf by quitting this Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and deſiring to depend upon himſelf, he ſhould never have received any other Command from God, nor yet any Man after him. But the Righteouſneſs of God oblig'd him to lay other Commands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on Man for the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his Diſobedience. He enjoyn'd him <note n="c" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 17, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>to till the Ground, and to gain his Bread with the ſweat of his Face,</hi> which was the Second Command that God gave to Man, which nevertheleſs was only Accidental through the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and not Eſſential by the Will of God, who lov'd rather to ſee him free, without being ſubjected to any other Thing but Himſelf alone. And his giving the Commands to <hi>Moſes</hi> for the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was alſo Accidental: For if they had not fallen into ſo many different Sins, which took them off from their Dependance upon God, he would never have given them divers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments: But fearing leſt his People ſhould periſh through Ignorance, he ſtill gave them new Commands, that by the help of them they might know their Sins and amend them; elſe God would never have conſtrain'd Man to any other thing, but to acknowledge him as the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour of all Things: For God created him to take <note n="d" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 31.</note> his Delight with him in full liberty and without conſtraint, and was not willing to ſubject him to any other Law <note n="e" place="bottom">Cant. 2. 4.</note> but that of Love. By which we ſee that all the other Commands are but Accidentally appointed, becauſe of the Sins that Men had committed at divers times, who if they would now return to this Dependance upon God, would have no need of any other Precept or Commandment; for all the reſt are only Means to bring us to this Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, and that we may ſee and diſcover all that hinders us from reſigning our Will to God's, and that diſcovering them by the Commands, we may leave them and amend, and ſo may be able to return to this Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance which was firſt enjoyn'd us as the one thing neceſſary for Salvation: And is ſtill ſo now as well as then.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> Shews, That there is one thing only to be done by us that we may be ſaved.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That it was very agreeable to hear, that there was but one thing only to be done in order to Salvation: And that I would gladly take that ſhort way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> No, Sir, 'Tis true, there is but one thing only to be done that we may be ſaved <note n="f" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 42.</note>: But there are many things to be parted with, which do greatly hinder and diſtract us. We neglect to do that which is neceſſary to attain to this Dependance, and we do that which alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates us from it. The Penitence which God enjoyn'd <hi>Adam,</hi> To gain his Bread with the Sweat of his Face, is very little regarded among Men now. Every Body would live without Labour, and they eſteem it a Happineſs to have Riches that they may live in Eaſe. This is indeed to thwart the Means that God has ſo ſavingly taught us. After that <hi>Adam</hi> ſin'd, and all Men in him, of his own free choice he left off this Dependance upon God, that he might become wiſe of himſelf: Thus he render'd himſelf miſerable with all his Poſterity: Becauſe all the Miſeries that we ſuffer are procured by the following our own Wills. We muſt not impute all our Miſeries to <hi>Adam,</hi> but only to the Sins that we our ſelves commit. If we had no other but the Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> we ſhould need nothing but the Pennance of Labour to gain our Bread, and the enduring the Intemperance of the Elements: But our own Sins bring upon us a Thouſand other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sufferings. If we would labour, and ſuffer Cold and Heat, or other Intemperances of the ſaid Elements, and return again to the Dependance of our Wills upon Gods, <note n="g" place="bottom">Pſal. 81. 14, 17.</note> we ſhould be very quickly reſtored to the Bleſſed State wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was created: For our Penitence ſhould be accompliſh'd in this ſhort Life, which by the Mercy of God is much
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104476:246"/>
ſhortned; and then we ſhould enjoy an Eternal Bliſs, which ſhould never end: But ſince our Actual Self will would not depend upon God, but upon its ſelf, bending it ſelf to follow its own Inclinations, it has procured us a great Number of other Evils, which we attribute to God, or to <hi>Adam;</hi> and if we conſider them aright, we will evidently perceive that they derive their dominion from our Self-will, and not from any other thing: For our Diſeaſes are ordinarily procured by our Intemperance in Eating and Drinking, or other Senſual Exceſſes which we commit to ſatisfie our own Will; which oftimes drives us to ſome State that cauſes us a Thouſand Sorrows, or to ſome Employment, or Trade that brings us into great trouble of Law-ſuits, Quarrels, Vexations, or to Poverty and other Miſeries. And the Cauſe of all this is, that we would not ſubmit our Will to Gods, who would have govern'd us, as a good Father does his Son, we having choſen rather to follow our own Will, and to undergo all ſort of Calamities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in this World, and run the hazard of ſuffering far greater hereafter, which ſhall never end: For he who will not be guided by God, can never be ſaved; ſince our own Conduct will lead us to the Abyſs of all ſort of Evils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both Temporal and Eternal: Becauſe our own Will is ignorant, and raſh, never content nor ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, never ſtopping for any ſort of Evil: Even though it diſcover its Miſeries it does not amend them, but imputes them to another, either to <hi>Adam,</hi> or even to God: And thus flattering our ſelves always in our own Will, we perſiſt therein even to death, which gives beginning to a miſerable Eternity: For no Body can be ſaved by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and if we do not yield up our Will to God, from whom can we expect Salvation? 'Tis a great Blindneſs, Sir, not to ſee theſe Truths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are ſo evident, ſince we feel our Weakneſs, and know that we have receiv'd all from God, and that we can hope for nothing but from him. And notwithſtanding of all theſe Conſiderations we will not reſign our Will to his, chooſing rather to be miſerable, and to periſh at laſt by following our own. We are unthankful to God, and cruel to our ſelves: For indeed, 'tis a great Ingratitude to deny God the only thing he demands of us, our own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having given us all other things; and 'tis a great Cruelty to our ſelves to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104476:247"/>
withdraw our Dependance upon God, and ſubject our ſelves to ſo many ſorts of Evils.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>How it was poſſible that Men ſhould deny the yielding up their Will to God, ſince all appertains to him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, All the World does this in effect, and I know not ſo much as one Perſon upon Earth that will depend upon the Will of God: For every one will needs follow his own Will: Neither Small nor Great, none excepted, will reſign their Will to God's, but will all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon their own. Is it a Wonder that I told you formerly, that no body could be ſaved after the way that Men live at preſent? This is an infallible Truth, which none has yet diſcovered becauſe of the Univerſal Darkneſs that is at preſent in the World: Every one imagines that he will reſign himſelf to God, while in the mean time there is no ſuch thing: For if this were true, we ſhould not ſee Men ſo forward to deal in Buſineſs, or Traffick, nor to run through Countries and Cities to heap up Mony, nor to uſe underhand Dealings for Offices, Places, or Benefices: For every one placing his Dependance upon God, would labour to provide only for his Neceſſities and no more, knowing well that this Life is ſhort, and that Neceſſaries ſuffice a Traveller, who ſtudies not to load himſelf with Things ſuperfluous or uſeleſs for his Journey, for they would be a Burden to him. All the Cares, the Toils, the Purſuits of Men for preſent Things, are ſo many Evidences which declare that we will not reſign our Will to God's, but that we will follow our own, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Penitence that God has enjoyn'd us, that we may be advanc'd to Places, Honours, or Dignities, ſeeking to live at our own Eaſe, inſtead of labouring to ſatisfie the Penitence due to our Sins. We Act quite contrary to the Will of God; for we cannot be ignorant that he demands of us this Submiſſion, and this Penitence. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all we ſay by Word, that we are reſign'd to God, and we look on it as a thing impoſſible, that we ſhould deny him our Will! Which ſtill diſcovers the more our Blindneſs.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That there was truly a horrible Darkneſs through the whole World; and that I my ſelf was ſurrounded with it, while I believ'd that I would be reſign'd to God, and in the mean time had many Cares yet for this preſent Life.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:104476:247"/>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, You ſee that your Reſignation is not true, ſo long as your Cares are yet for this Life. This would be a great diſtruſt of God, if after you were reſign'd to his Government, you ſhould yet be careful for Temporal Things. Can God, who created all Things for Man, deny him his Neceſſities, when he ſhall be reſign'd to him? If he <note n="h" place="bottom">Mat. 6. 26.</note> feed the Birds of the Air who do not labour, ſhall he not feed Man when he labours? We are full of falſe Perſwaſions, which flatter us to our Ruine. For it is certain that he who has reſolved to reſign himſelf to God, ſeeks no longer for Earthly Things, but for thoſe which are Eternal. God makes him ſee evidently, that what is here Below is nothing but Tranſitory, which the Servant of God ſhould not touch but by the by; for they are unworthy of a Soul dedicated to God, which cares no longer for any thing but to pleaſe him. And if you be careful for other Things, be aſſuredly perſwaded that you are not yet reſign'd to God: Becauſe this <hi>Reſignation</hi> conſiſts in a <hi>ceſſation from all things to receive God only.</hi> And the leſs we Act our ſelves, the more we receive. There needs no more but TO CEASE AND TO RECEIVE: For all our Cares and Vexations, or Activities for the Things of this Life, are all Hindrances which ſtifle the Operations which God would make in our Soul. We muſt be quiet and reſt, that we may ſuffer the Holy Spirit alone to Act. If our Will be reſign'd to God, he will <note n="i" place="bottom">Pſal. 73. 23, 24.</note> govern it wiſely. Let us leave our Souls to his Government, and labour to accompliſh the Penitence due for our Sins, that we may have the Things needful for the Maintenance of our Body: And then we could truly ſay, that we are reſign'd to God, and not before. For the Offices, Cares and Buſineſs of the World, are all Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances to this Reſignation: And even the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Ways of Devotion that are now practiſed, are all great Hindrances; ſince nothing but this Reſignation alone is neceſſary.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That this little Word,</hi> Reſignation, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended great Things, that nevertheleſs it was the Philoſophers Stone for the Diſcovery of Eternal Treaſures, to which I aſpired.</hi>

That we may be reſtored into Favour with God, entirely converted to him, and out of all ſort of danger, there needs nothing but this Reſignation.

Nevertheleſs, we Rebel againſt all ſort of Rights to adhere to our own Will, which is ſo wicked and inſolent, which precipitates us into ſo many ſorts of Evils; for all the Miſeries which we feel in this Life, proceed from our Self-will: And as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of it to the Will of God <note n="o" place="bottom">Pſal. 37. 5, 7.</note> is the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Good, ſo the Poſſeſſion of it is the <note n="p" place="bottom">Iſa. 65. 3.</note> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of all ſort of Evil: So that he who would be converted, needs only reſign his own Will into God's Hands: In doing this he fulfils all the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; becauſe they Teach us nothing elſe but the Means to attain to this Reſignation.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That this being ſuppoſed, which was moſt true, That if we ſtill acknowledge, that we depend upon God in all things, we have no need of any other Precept or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:104476:248"/>
                  <hi>it was ſtrange that ſhe had taught me ſo many Means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I have told you of the State of the World, and of the Church, that you may no longer truſt to them by a pious implicite Faith. I have told you alſo, that we are fallen into the Reign of Antichriſt, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leaſt you be deceived; and alſo that the World is Judg'd, that you may not flatter your ſelf with falſe Hopes, believing that it will laſt yet, and ſo continue in ſloth. I have alſo ſhewn you true Vertue, that you be not deceived by that which is ſo but in appearance; having alſo declared to you the Sins againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and thoſe which we commit in another, that you may not be ignorant of any thing that can hinder this Reſignation to God: For the Ignorance of Good and Evil would inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ruine us; and whereas we are fallen into the Times of Univerſal Darkneſs, the Common Enemy might very eaſily deceive you, as he does all the World, perſwading you that you are reſign'd to God, when you live yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to your ſelf. Therefore I have explained to you ſo many Things one by one, that you might diſcern aright Truth from Lies; and that you might certainly reſign your ſelf to God according to your deſire. And becauſe you can never do good without departing from Evil <note n="q" place="bottom">Pſal. 34. 15.</note>, nor depart from that without knowing it, I have therefore endeavoured to diſcover to you the Good and Evil that Reigns at preſent in the World, that I might give you the certain Marks whereby to know if you are truly reſign'd to God, or not; and ſince the Commandments of God, and alſo the Law of the Goſpel, are given us to diſcover what hinders us to be reſign'd to him: That by this means we may remove all the Hindrances of our Reſignation to God: Voluntary Poverty ſerving as a Mean to free our Self will from the deſire of periſhing Goods; Chaſtity to free this Will from deſiring Carnal Pleaſures; and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to deliver us from the deſire of fulfilling our own Will; and ſo of all the other Evangelical Counſels which teach us to depart from that which hinders our Reſignation to God: Therefore I judg'd it neceſſary to declare to you all the Things that hinder this Reſignation to God, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:104476:249"/>
thoſe alſo which may ſerve as Means to facilitate this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, which is the only Eſſential Thing that God <note n="r" place="bottom">Joſ. 58. 13.</note> demands of all thoſe who would be ſaved.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>If it will be enough for me, abſolutely to reſolve that henceforth I will depend upon God, and no longer uſe my own Will in any thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> This Reſolution, Sir, is a great Beginning; but 'tis to be feared, that we ſhall not put it effectually in Execution, becauſe of our inveterate Evil Habits. Our Self-will having always born ſway, how can we entirely ſubdue it, except by the Means that Jeſus Chriſt has point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to us in his Goſpel, which are as ſo many Steps to aſcend to this Reſignation? For otherwiſe we might make falſe Suppoſitions, as we have done hitherto. But when we ſhall put in practiſe the Doctrine of the Goſpel, we ſhall thereby diſcover, how far we have advanced in this Reſignation to God: For if our Frailty had not needed theſe Means, God would not have taken Humane Fleſh to come and teach us them: For he can do nothing that is uſeleſs. We muſt therefore fix here, Sir, and receive this Doctrine of the Goſpel in its plain Literal Senſe, which will teach us all things plainly to our Senſes, by following of which we ſhall certainly attain to this Reſignation: For this is the true, the ſhorteſt, and the moſt certain way. Though indeed God ſent at divers times Prophets and holy Perſons to tell Men by what Means they might recover this Reſignation to God, yet none of them has done it ſo perfectly as Jeſus Chriſt did when he was upon Earth: For he has omitted nothing, but has taught all ſo preciſely, that Men will never ſtand in need of any other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: For this is the laſt Mercy that God will ſhew to Men, who muſt not look for any thing after the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt: And what was taught before or ſince, is not at all comparable to this Doctrine of the Goſpel. If we would be ſav'd, we muſt embrace and follow it; for it teaches us all the neceſſary Means for fulfilling the Law of God.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>How this Doctrine of the Goſpel could be the laſt Means that God would give to Men to bring them to Salvation, ſince we look yet for the Holy Spirit, who in theſe laſt Times muſt teach us all Things?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, The Laſt Times began <note n="s" place="bottom">Gal. 4. 4. 1 Cor. 10. 11.</note> when God became Man. He brought along with him upon Earth his Laſt Mercy, teaching Men by Word and Deed all that they ought to do and avoid, without omitting any thing of all that ſhall be neceſſary for them even to the End of the World: So that none have need of any thing elſe to be taught them. It is true, we ſhall have the Holy Spirit <note n="t" place="bottom">John 6. 13.</note> in the End of theſe Laſt Times, into which we are now fallen; and he is already born upon Earth: But he comes not to bring us new Means of Salvation, but only <note n="u" place="bottom">John 14. 26.</note> to lay before us thoſe which Jeſus Chriſt taught us when he was in the World, that we may clearly ſee <note n="x" place="bottom">John 16. 9.</note> how far we are now eſtranged from them, and to give us the Light of Truth, that we may ſee the Way to return, and re-take the ſame Goſpel-means, that we may recover the Dependance of our Will upon that of God, which is his Firſt and Onely Eſſential Command, without which no Body can be ſaved: For this is the leaſt Thing that we owe him; and if we do not fulfil it, our Ingratitude is ſo great, that we cannot in Juſtice be ſaved.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>If the Holy Spirit was born in Fleſh, as Jeſus Chriſt was in his Time? And what things he would teach us more than Jeſus Chriſt has done?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, The Holy Spirit is the ſame <note n="y" place="bottom">1 John 5. 7.</note> God
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104476:250"/>
with Jeſus Chriſt, <note n="z" place="bottom">John 1. 1.</note> who was the Word of God, as the Holy Spirit <note n="a" place="bottom">1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 20. compare 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12.</note> is his Underſtanding. There is but One God only, but there are divers Powers. And as our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding knows more than our Mouth ſpeaks, ſo the Holy Spirit will give more Light <note n="b" place="bottom">John 16. 12, 13.</note> than did the Words of Jeſus Chriſt, though all comes <note n="c" place="bottom">Joh. 16. 14, 15.</note> from one and the ſame God, and one and the ſame Source. What Jeſus Chriſt ſaid was underſtood by Men only in part <note n="d" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13. 9.</note>, and the ſame Things ſhall be underſtood in a perfect and compleat Senſe by this Wiſdom of the Holy Spirit. He needs not take a Body of Fleſh to ſpeak to Men: For Jeſus Chriſt did that ſufficiently; ſo that he needs ſpeak no more: But there is need of more Underſtanding: For the Laſt Times are near their End: And before the World end, God will give the full Underſtanding of all that has been delivered in God's Name from the Beginning of the World, both by the Holy Prophets, and by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or other Saints his Diſciples. Nothing has been fully underſtood of all the Holy Scripture; for even they who pronounc'd it, underſtood it not in its perfect Senſe, but in part only: But now that the Holy Spirit is come upon Earth to give the full Knowledge of them, he needs not for this End a Body of Fleſh; but only to give Men Spiritual Underſtanding, that they may know the Powers of God, the Love he bears to Man, the End for which he created him, and may have the knowledge of True Vertue, and of that which is Falſe. All theſe Things ſhall be known by the Underſtanding of thoſe Men who will receive the Light of Truth which the Holy Spirit brings now into the World. <hi>HE IS BORN</hi> in the midſt of its Univerſal Darkneſs, in which no Body knows the Truth of any Thing, all being falſified or not known. The Holy Spirit comes to clear this by Spiritual Notices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I bleſt my good Fortune, and the Day in which I met with this Pilgrimeſs; for my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding received ſuch Light by her Diſcourſes, that I muſt confeſs my Soul had periſh'd without this Rencounter:</hi> I asked her, <hi>How her Words could have ſuch ſtrong Operations on me?</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:104476:250"/>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, This proceeds from the Holy Spirit, who begins to viſit your Soul by his Light. Receive it with Humility of Heart, and he will enlighten you more: For he is come to fill the Souls of all thoſe who ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Truth. It is by the Operations that you feel that he is born in Souls. He is a Spirit, and he works in the Spirit of all who ſeek and deſire him. We muſt not <note n="e" place="bottom">John 4. 21-24.</note> any longer ſeek for viſible and material Means: For all theſe things are Hindrances to him. Let us only open our Heart and Spirit to receive the Truth, and it will teach us all Things: For nothing but Lies has undone the whole World. The Darkneſs that Men are in, and their forgetfulneſs of God, have come by Lying, which has ſeiz'd on all the World: For none are <note n="f" place="bottom">Hoſ. 4. 1.</note> now in the Truth: The falſe Perſwaſions which they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on Mens Hearts, have made them miſtake God and the State of their own Souls. There is therefore great reaſon to bleſs the Goodneſs of God, who in ſo miſerable a Time ſends us his Holy Spirit to enlighten all thoſe who will receive him. I believe, Sir, you are the firſt; but a great Number will follow you: For as ſoon as the deluſion ſhall be diſcovered, the Eyes of many will be opened, and their Heads lifted up, to return to God, abhorring their Errours, and the Deceit of their blind Guides. They will ſee, that all that they have taught them as Means of bringing them to God, have eſtrang'd them from him; and the Sacraments and other Ceremonies of the Church, inſtead of procuring them the Grace of God to love him and to acquire true Vertue, have given them rather a Contempt of God, and a falſe hypocritical Vertue. This being diſcovered, <note n="g" place="bottom">Hoſ. 6. 1.</note> many will ſeek the Truth, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Lying, which has put their Salvation in ſo great hazard.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>If the Holy Spirit would not become viſible?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> No, Sir; He will not be viſible, but by the Operations which he will make in Souls whom you ſhall ſee diſingaged from the Earth, and cleaving to God alone. We ſhall ſee them poſſeſs Joy, Peace, and Patience, with the other Fruits and Gifts, which will be ſure Evidences that the Holy Spirit will dwell in their Souls, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104476:251"/>
ſhall not be ſeen by the Eyes of the Body in any Material Form or Figure: For the Time is come that <note n="h" place="bottom">1 John 4. 24.</note> God will be worſhipped in Spirit and in Truth, and no longer in Figures, which ſhall all ceaſe becauſe of the Accompliſhment of all Things: And all that was figured in the Old Law ſhall be accompliſhed in full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by the Holy Spirit: For the Time is come, that all the Promiſes which God made to Men from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World ſhall be fulfilled, the Alliance that God <note n="i" place="bottom">Jer. 32. 40.</note> has promis'd to make with Men ſhall have its perfect Accompliſhment: For they ſhall be his People, and he will be their God. This has not come to paſs as yet. Though Men were created to be God's People, nevertheleſs they did not continue ſo; on the contrary, they committed ſo many Infidelities, that he was oblig'd to deſtroy them by a General Deluge; and though the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were God's peculiar People, they forſook him notwithſtanding, and gave themſelves to Idolatry. The <hi>Jews</hi> who were as preciſely God's People, denied him alſo and would not acknowledge him when he became Man, but revil'd him and hang'd him on a Croſs. And now the Chriſtians, who ought more perfectly to be Gods People, deſpiſe him in his Sufferings, and in his Doctrine. So that the Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that God promis'd to make with Man, could not hitherto be accompliſh'd. Of neceſſity the Holy Spirit muſt come upon Earth to enlighten Men, that they may have the Faithfulneſs requiſite for this Alliance of God with Men: For a Marriage cannot be compleat if the Spouſe be not faithful as the Husband is.</p>

                  <p> Speaks of the Alliance that God will make with Men, and of the Coming of Jeſus Chriſt in Glory; and that to have a Share in it, we muſt of neceſſity reſign our Will to God, and return to a Dependance upon him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I entreated her to tell me, <hi>How, and when, and wherein, this Alliance of God with Men ſhall be made?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> This Will be made by the Holy Spirit, who will illuminate Souls, make them know their Errours, and alſo the End for which they were created, which is nothing leſs, than to be joyn'd and united to God, who will take his Delight with Men <note n="k" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 31.</note>: And they perceiving this, ſhall ſeparate themſelves from all Earthly Pretenſions, and reſign themſelves to the Will of God, deſiring no longer to uſe their own Wills, becauſe they have entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd them. Then ſhall they <note n="l" place="bottom">Iſa. 58. 11—14.</note> have ſuch Diſpoſitions as will invite God down to the Earth, to Ally himſelf viſibly and bodily with Men by an inſeparable and indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble Tye. This is the End for which God cloath'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a Humane Body, to make himſelf like to Man, that the Alliance he deſigned to make with him might be wholly perfect and compleat, both in Body and Spirit. What God promis'd <note n="m" place="bottom">Gen. 17. 7.</note> of Old to <hi>Abraham,</hi> could never be accompliſh'd; becauſe Men were never reſign'd to God as they ought, having ſtill us'd their own Free-will without depending upon God, This did ſeparate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce them from the Alliance which he promis'd them. But in this Fulneſs of Time, wherein we live, the Holy Spirit is come down to teach us all Things; and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall hear him, ſhall enjoy the promis'd Alliance: For <note n="n" place="bottom">Rev. 22. 12.</note> Jeſus Chriſt will come very ſhortly upon the Earth in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104476:252"/>
Glory, to Joyn and Allie himſelf with all thoſe who ſhall reſign themſelves to him. I cannot preciſely tell the Day, Sir; but that it will be towards the End of the Plagues, which are now begun. But I can aſſure you that it ſhall be here, upon Earth <note n="o" place="bottom">Rev. 5. 10.</note>, where God with Men ſhall enjoy a perfect Contentment, which ſhall be <note n="p" place="bottom">Rev. 7. 15, 16, 17.</note> Eternal: For the Preſence of God made Man will unite them with ſuch a perfect Love, that they can never again depart from him, though they ſhall ſtill preſerve their Free-will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I felt in my Soul great Conſolation in hearing her ſperk of the Alliance that Gold would make with Man, and ask'd, What I ſhould do to attain to ſuch a Happineſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, You have nothing elſe to do for attaining to an Alliance with God, but to <note n="q" place="bottom">Prov. 23. 26.</note> reſign your own Will to him, that he may diſpoſe of it, This is the One Thing needful. So ſoon as you ſhall depend upon him in all things, you ſhall be betroath'd in order to the promis'd Alliance, and therein you ſhall find ſuch Conſolations as I cannot expreſs to you. You ſhall then be as ſure of this promis'd Alliance, as at leaſt a Maid is to marry her Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth'd, or a Man her whom he has Betroth'd, and much more: For the Promiſes of Men may be diverted by divers Accidents; but thoſe of God are immutable, and will never change. So ſoon as Man reſigns himſelf to him, he receives him <note n="r" place="bottom">Ezck 33. 12. 16.</note>, and treats with him as if he had never offended him, how great a Sinner ſoever he may have been. A Man muſt be void of Judgment, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful for ſuch a Goodneſs of God, when he will not depend upon his Creatour, from whom he has received all Things, and who in requital of ſo many Benefits, demands nothing elſe but to acknowledge, that all he has comes from him? If he did this, he might lawfully enjoy all Things according to his Wiſh. Could God do more to Man than to let him rule over all Things, provided only that he would always acknowledge the Dependance that he had upon his God? And on the contrary, Could Man commit a greater Ingratitude than not to depend upon God, who created him, who preſerves him, and from whom alone he can expect Salvation? We muſt have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:104476:252"/>
loſt our Wits, and become cruel to our ſelves, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our ſelves of ſo great a Happineſs, only that we may enjoy our Free-will, which often precipitates us into diverſe kinds of Evils, that are ſometimes irreparable: Becauſe he who follows his own Will can never be ſaved, and the Miſchief we ſuſtain by Damnation can never be repair'd <note n="s" place="bottom">Mark 8. 36, 37.</note>.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>Never any had taken notice of ſo preciſe a Neceſſity of depending in every thing upon God for Salvation; but they thought that whoſoever died not in a mortal Sin was ſav'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, This Ignorance, not to know that we ought to depend upon God in all Things, is the Cauſe of the Ruine of all Men: Every one imagining that nothing elſe is neceſſary for Salvation but to abſtain outwardly from evil Actions: This God did not declare to <hi>Adam</hi> when he created him for Salvation, but he expreſly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to him that he ought always to depend upon him, and acquieſce in his Will. What God did to <hi>Adam,</hi> he did in him to all Mankind. Therefore it is much better to hold to the Firſt Commandment of God, than to amuſe our ſelves with the Opinions of Men, who with their Studies and Notions give aſſurance of Salvation without any Ground. For all that they call <hi>Mortal or Venial Sins,</hi> are nothing elſe but the Hindrances which we make to this Reſignation to God. Except this, there can be no Sin: For if this Reſignation be not hindred, we are certainly ſaved: For Reſignation in its ſelf is Salvation. This we cannot obſerve, becauſe ſo many other different Things are ſet before us to hinder the Knowledge of this Eternal Truth, to wit, <hi>That God has never demanded, and never will demand in Time coming, any thing elſe of Man, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of his Will to the Will of God.</hi> And when it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, ſteal,</hi> nor <hi>commit fornication,</hi> or other Evils, it is as much as to ſay in one Word, Thou ſhalt not follow thy own Will, but that of God: For the abſtaining from all theſe Evils, is nothing elſe but the leaving off to follow our own Will, which incites us to do theſe Evils: For as ſoon as we ſhall reſign it to the Will of God, he will lead us to all ſort of Good: And
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:104476:253"/>
theſe Evils are particularly forbidden us, that we may thereby perceive when we are not reſign'd to God: For this Reſignation delivers us from all ſorts of Evil, and by following our own Will we do certainly commit them. I wiſh all the World did comprehend this Truth, <hi>That no Body can ever ſin but in following his own Will, and no Body can ever be ſaved but by reſigning his Will to the Will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>It was moſt true, That to be ſav'd we muſt reſign our Will to that of God; and that it was a loſs that this was not taught to all Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, The Devil has now ſuch Power over the Minds of Men, that he leads them wholly at his Will, and has razed out of their Memories the one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which is to reſign their own Will to that of God: And that they may be inſenſible of this Forgetfulneſs, he has invented ſo many Means of Salvation, that no Body thinks of it, nor believes it neceſſary to reſign his Will to that of God, imagining that it is enough for Salvation to go to Church, to frequent the Sacraments, and to get Indulgencies. This Blindneſs ruines all good Men: For none can any longer perceive that this Reſignation is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and not perceiving it, they do not believe it. For this cauſe. No body ſets about it: For we ſee now the beſt Men are addicted to follow their own Wills in every thing, even in Eating and Drinking, and Walking: And generally all they do is regulated by their own Wills; even their Vertues and Devotions are manag'd by their Self-will: And in the mean time they think they are in the way of Salvation: As if God had need of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, or our Prayers; while he will have nothing elſe but the Reſignation of our Wills to his Will. This no Body ſtrives to do: On the contrary, every one, both Small and Great, of whatſoever Condition, follow their own Will. Chriſtians do even train up their Children in the Habit of following their own Wills. In which they bring them up to their Damnation: Becauſe being habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated from their Childhood to follow their own Wills, when they are grown up they can very hardly part with them; and thus every one periſhes without perceiving it. And he who declares theſe Truths, is oppoſed by all thoſe who are infected with this Vice, who have no mind to part with it, perſwading themſelves without ground, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104476:253"/>
this Reſignation is not neceſſary: Thought it be moſt true that God demands nothing elſe of us: For he has no need at all of our Works, nor of our Words, nor Riches, nor Honour, nor any Created Thing, becauſe he contains all in himſelf: But he has choſen our Will for himſelf, that it being united to his own, he might take his delight and pleaſure in it. Conſider a little, Sir, how far we ſtray from the Deſigns of God, while we thus uſe our own Will in all Things, without diſcovering the Wiles of Satan, who under good and pious pretences leads us at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from a Dependance upon God, and yet we do not perceive it.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That it was an Infatuation of Spirit, that no Body ſaw preciſely the neceſſity of this Dependance, but they imagin'd it was enough to believe in the general, that God is our Creatour, and that we have receiv'd all from him.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Faith without Works <note n="t" place="bottom">Jam. 2. 26.</note> is dead. It is not enough that we believe by way of Speculation, <hi>That we have received all from God;</hi> but on the contrary, this belief will render us more guilty: For to believe that God is our Creatour, and that all Things appertain to him, and notwithſtanding of this Belief, to deſire to rule upon Earth as Soveraigns of our own Will, and not to ſubmit it but by conſtraint to all that God permits to befal us againſt our own Inclinations, this is directly oppoſite to our Belief, and ſo is it to believe alſo that we received all that we have from God, and nevertheleſs to uſe all theſe things according to our Appetites and Inclinations, as all the World does. For he who has received a good Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, applies it to acquire Sciences, Offices, or Dignities in this World, forgetting that this Judgment pertains not to him, but God only gave it him that it might be applied to know and love him; and if he apply it to any thing elſe, he muſt render a ſtrict account of it. Nevertheleſs, no Body conſiders this: Every one thinks he is Maſter and Lord of his own Underſtanding, and may diſpoſe of it independently according to his own Will. It is the ſame alſo with him who has Wealth; he makes himſelf Lord and Maſter of it, even as if it belong'd to him in property: He employes it in Glory, Pomp, and Vanity, or other
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104476:254"/>
Pleaſures, of his Body or Mind, or in the Things to which he finds himſelf moſt inclin'd, as if he had created theſe Riches himſelf, and held them of none; and while he ſays by Word, that he has received all from God, yet notwithſtanding he will not uſe them but according to his own Will: And thus by his Deeds <note n="u" place="bottom">Tit. 1. 16.</note> he belies what he ſay; by Word: Thinking to deceive God he deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and is his own Ruine: For while we will uſe our own Will in all things, we withdraw from a Dependance upon God, which is ſo neceſſary for our Salvation.</p>

                  <p> Shews, how every thing muſt be uſed to keep us in a Dependance upon God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>How every thing ought to be uſed, that we may have this entire Dependance upon God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, We muſt firſt conſider for what End we were Created: And ſeeing that it was to Love and Serve God,: we muſt apply our ſelves to nothing elſe, except by the by in neceſſary Things, reſerving all our Affections for him who Created us for theſe Ends: And whether we have Wit, or other Talents of Body or Mind, or Riches, Honours, and Proſperity, we muſt never uſe theſe Things but for the Glory of God: Becauſe all pertains to him, and we are but the Stewards of them, liable to give an Account: And we ought to manage them ſo well, that nothing may be uſed but by the Appointment and Will of God, which we ought always to inquire into and follow, and never our own Will; for it ought ſtill to depend upon him who gave it. Could God demand leſs of us than the Dependance of our Will on his, after he had given us our Body with all its Properties; and our Soul with all its Faculties; and this Beautiful World, with all that is in it,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104476:254"/>
to enjoy them fully at our Wiſh, with Joy and Eaſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding nothing elſe for ſo many Gifts, Graces, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, but the Reſigning of our Wills to his, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of which, Man is ſo ungrateful, unthankful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, as to deny it to his God, his Creatour? This Dependance of our Will, ſo ſmall a Gift that God asks of us, ſhould it be refus'd him, when we know that all comes from him, and that his Goodneſs has ſo advantagiouſly beſtowed Favours on us? Truly, Sir, this Ingratitude deſerves that all the Creatures riſe up againſt Man, to take Vengeance of the Injury he has done his Creatour, in denying him the Dependance of his Free will, and that he will diſpoſe of it himſelf. Even inſenſible Things are obliged by ſtrict Juſtice to avenge ſuch an Ingratitude. Which will be very ſpeedily done: Becauſe the Meaſure is full. All Men harden their Hearts, and ſtop their Ears againſt Gods Demand, <hi>Of reſigning their Wills to his Will:</hi> None will hearken to it any longer. Therefore the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Univerſal Rods is given out, and ſhall not be revoked: Becauſe none will revoke the Reſolution that every one has taken of following their own Will in every thing, and will not depend upon God, as if we were our own Soveraigns.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>There were yet ſome Perſons in the World whoſe Wills were reſign'd to that of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I know none of them: But I do not know all the World. If there be ſome yet ſcattered up and down the World, God will take them into his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Care: But the General Judgment ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed for this: The Plagues ſhall encreaſe ſtill, even till the Conſummation of all Evil; and if they go on leiſurely, it is to give Time and Leiſure to Men of Good Will <note n="w" place="bottom">2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> that they may be converted and repent of their Ingratitude, yeilding up <note n="x" place="bottom">Pſal. 31. 6.</note> to God the Free-will that he ſo freely gave them, to uſe it according to his Will. This is now done by few or none. We hear nothing elſe ſaid, but, <hi>I will be reſign'd to God,</hi> while in effect all the World follow their own Will. Some give themſelves eagerly to Study, ſome to Trade, ſome to the Law, to Offices, Benefices, and that unceſſantly, till every one has obtained their Pretenſions:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104476:255"/>
And we ſettle our ſelves upon Earth as an abiding City, or as if we were created for this Miſerable Life, here we build Tabernacles as if we were to remain in them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <note n="y" place="bottom">Pſal. 49. 12-15.</note>, while we ſee our Friends and Neighbours dye in a little time; and we know that none ſtays here, but every one dyes in his turn, ſome ſooner, and ſome later, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing at what Hour our turn will come. We are born in Miſeries, in which we live and dye; without ſeeing any other End for our ſelves but Death, which may make us ſufficiently comprehend that we are not created for this Life; but we muſt look for another: For God could never have had ſo low an End in creating us as the the Miſeries of this preſent Life, becauſe in this he ſhould have done an ill thing: Which <note n="z" place="bottom">Wiſd. 1. 13, 14.</note> God can never do, ſeeing he is the Source of all Good, from whom no Evil can proceed. But our Self-will alone engenders all the Evils and Miſeries that we ſuffer: For he who beats his Brains in Study, ſuffers for the Self-will or Inclination he has for Studies all the Inconveniences that are in this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: For God never demanded <note n="a" place="bottom">Eccl. 12. 12. Luke 12. 11, 12.</note> Learning of any Body, though Men cover this with the Pretext of the Glory of God, yet there is nothing in it for the moſt part but Curioſity and Vain-glory, or ſome Deſigns of making ſome Fortune in this World. Another by his Self-will gives himſelf to Traffick, or the buſineſs of Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and will therefore endure Cares, Watchings, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues, and Labours, to get a Little Heap of Mony, or other Temporal Goods, which end with him, becauſe he leaves them on the Earth, from whence he took them. One will be a Prieſt, or a Monk; another will Marry, or continue free: In one Word, All Men in the World ſtudy to follow their own Wills in every thing, without being willing to yield them to God, and notwithſtanding, we think to go to Paradiſe while we refuſe to reſign our Will to him, which we ought to do, though he had never required it of Man: It ſhould be offered him in Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of ſo many Benefits received from our God.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>If it was not lawful for every one to chooſe ſome State or Calling by which to gain his Bread?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:104476:255"/>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir, It is expedient that every one Labour, that he may have his Bread; for God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Labour in Penitence for our Sins: It is a Holy and Sacred Thing to Labour, that we may fulfil the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that God himſelf has enjoyn'd us. We are free alſo to chooſe ſome State; that of Marr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſt is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and a Burden to him that would obey God. Therefore all Places, Offices, or Benefices, of what kind ſoever, are great Hindrances to Salvation, becauſe they reſpect only the Earth, and aim at nothing but the Wealth, Honours, or Pleaſures of this World, which Things do certainly withdraw us from God <note n="d" place="bottom">1 Joh. 2. 15.</note>, and even make us often wholly to forget him by the continual Imployments, and Diverſions which theſe Places, Offices, or Benefices, bring along with them, which are not only undertaken, by all means ſought after and deſired, that thereby we may gain our Bread; but very often that we may be rais'd to Honour and Vanities, or that we may take with more Eaſe the Delights of the Body or of the Mind, or alſo that we may heap up Temporal Wealth: All which Things do certainly withdraw us from God. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we ſee Chriſtians now adays do Toil, and Sweat, and Labour to obtain ſome Place, Office, or Benefice; and they ſtudy all their Life-time to purſue what is pleaſant, profitable, or honourable for them; and they believe they are Wiſe in ſo doing: As if their Happineſs did depend upon this preſent Life, and it were needful to make ſome Fortune here. Which is a great Blindneſs of Mind.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>If all Places, Offices, or Benefices, were evil, ſince it ſeem'd neceſſary and expedient that there ſhould be Judges to maintain Order among the People; and alſo Prieſts, to teach what concerns Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:104476:256"/>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, All Places, Offices, or Benefices, are good in themſelves; but the ill uſe that is made of them, renders them evil. If a Perſon ſhould engage in any Office of Juſtice, or any other Secular Station, ſingly with a deſign to Labour to preſerve the People in Peace, and to maintain Juſtice, and the Innocence of thoſe whom others would wrong, this would be a great Charity to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and a great Merit and Satisfaction as to the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that every one is oblig'd to accompliſh during this Miſerable Life: Becauſe in taking the Cares and Labour of the Mind for a Pennance, we ſatisfie God in gaining our Bread by theſe Labours of the Mind; and beſides this, we aſſiſt our Neighbour by good Counſel, and by maintaining him in his Right, and defending him againſt malicious Perſons. He to whom God has given the Spirit and Capacity of doing this, will be doubly recompenced before God, provided he do it in a Spirit of <hi>Penitence</hi> in reſpect of himſelf, and of <hi>Charity</hi> in reſpect of his Neighbour. But it is much to be regretted, that Men now regard neither of theſe Ends: For if they could enjoy a good Penſion due to any Office with little Travel, this is what they would love moſt: They ſeek not the Toils of it, but the Profits: Nor the maintaining of Policy, or Juſtice, but the Honour of Ruling over the People; and if it were only the Zeal of Policy and Juſtice that moved Men to engage into publick Offices, no good Men could ſtay in them any longer in theſe unhappy Times, wherein Policy, and Juſtice, is no longer obſerved. The Laws of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are all made for the burthen of the Common People, and for the Eaſe and Relief of the Great Men, and thoſe in Authority: And by the ſame Breath Juſtice is rurn'd in their Favour. So that Offices, good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are become very evil, by the bad uſe which Men make of them now, who obey not in any thing the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, which are <hi>Penitence,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to our Neighbour. But on the quite contrary, they will enjoy <note n="e" place="bottom">Iſa. 22. 12, 13.</note> inſtead of ſuffering; and take their Pleaſure and Repoſe, inſtead of doing Penitence. If Merchants had the Spirit of Penitence, and Traded on deſign to procure Work to ſuch Neighbours as were more fit for going about
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104476:256"/>
ſome Trade or Handicraft than to Labour the Ground, all this would be done in mutual Charity, accompliſhing their Penitence; the one by working, and the other by taking care to ſend their Merchandiſes to the Places where they might be Retailed: But the Intentions of theſe Men are far from the Deſigns of God: For inſtead of Trading ſingly for their neceſſary Maintenance, they do it only to inrich themſelves, and to encreaſe their Glory and Vanity: So that inſtead of ſatisfying God by the Penitence of the Labours and Travels of our Buſineſs, by undergoing them we but encreaſe our Sins; and inſtead of exerciſing Charity to our Neighbour in giving him Wages for his Entertainment, People take their greateſt Advantages from the Workman, and they give him as little as they can for his Labour. And thus we do not accompliſh Penitence, nor yet exerciſe Charity to our Neighbour; but we Toil and Labour for the Goods of this Miſerable Life as if we were Created for it, though we ought only to paſs through it as Travellers <note n="f" place="bottom">1 Pet. 2. 11.</note> and Pilgrims. But we change all the Orders that God has eſtabliſhed; and inſtead of ſighing here in the Spirit of Penitence, we deſire to Rule at our Pleaſure; and inſtead of loving our Neighbour as our ſelves, we deny him ſometimes Wages for his Labour, that we may enrich our ſelves the more, ſeeking nothing but our own Intereſt, without regarding the Loſs or Inconveniency of our Neighbour: A certain Evidence that Charity is dead among Chriſtians, even among Churchmen, who as the Fathers of Chriſtians, and the Paſtours of their Souls, ſhould undertake Offices and Benefices out of pure Charity, <note n="g" place="bottom">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1, &amp;c.</note> to Teach the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the matter of their Salvation, and alſo to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh their own Penitence, in Labouring and Travelling to gain Souls to God, as the Apoſtles did. But inſtead of doing this, they ſeek after the Benefices that have the greateſt Revenues, and the leaſt Toil; and inſtead of Labouring in the Lord's Vineyard, they ſeek their Reſt and Eaſe, doing as little Penitence as they can to ſatisfie God, as every one is obliged to do for himſelf: For their is neither Prieſt, Religious, Pope, Cardinal, Biſhop, Prebend, nor any other, of whatſoever State or Condition,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104476:257"/>
who is not oblig'd to accompliſh his Penitence here: For all having fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> are ſubject to the Penitence that was enjoyned him, which ought to be known by all Men. The Saints did always Labour; Jeſus Chriſt himſelf did ſo <note n="h" place="bottom">Mark 6. 3.</note>: His Apoſtles and Diſciples never gave themſelves Eaſe while they lived in this Life of Penitence. For that great Biſhop and Father of Chriſtians, the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <note n="i" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. 2. 9.</note> that he was never chargeable to any, but gained his Bread by working with his own Hands, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Travels and Labours which he did undergo <note n="k" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. &amp;c.</note> to Teach the ignorant the Doctrine of the Goſpel, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus <note n="l" place="bottom">Col. 1. 24.</note> his Penitence by his Labour, for his own Sins, and exerciſing Charity to his Neighbour by the Sweat and Labour of Troubleſome Voyages. Conſider, Sir, how far Men are now from obſerving the Ordinances of God? How every one ſtrives to reſiſt them. For neither Small nor Great ſubmits to Labour to perform his Penitence, but all willingly Labour to gain Money, or to take their Pleaſures, or to make themſelves be Honoured in this Miſerable World; regarding more thoſe Things which paſs away, than thoſe which are Eternal, or to ſay better, regarding and obeying more our own Will than the Will and Ordinances of God. Is it a Wonder if ſuch Sins draw down the Vengeance of God upon our guilty Heads, ſince no Body will undergo the Penitence that God has enjoyned to all Mankind, but every one will needs follow his own Will, and Labour to make himſelf happy in this Miſerable Life, which was given us to do Penitence in, and not to take our Pleaſures in it? If ſo many Miſeries befel Men for one only Diſobedience that <hi>Adam</hi> committed, what ought we to expect for ſo many Crimes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the Ordinances of God, which we commit daily? We are aſtoniſhed to ſee the Beginnings of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows by Wars, and alſo Diſorders and Confuſions in States, and in the whole World, and we ought rather to be aſtoniſhed at the Goodneſs of God, that he endures ſo long the Rebellion of his Creature Man, who is come to ſuch a height of Ingratitude that he will no longer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, in any thing, the Dependance that he has
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104476:257"/>
upon his Creatour, but will Enjoy here where he ought to Suffer, and take his Pleaſures where he ought to do Pennance: And yet nevertheleſs, dare lift up his Head, and believe that he ſhall have Eternal Life, notwithſtanding of his Ingratitude, and his Diſobedience to him who alone can ſave him! We would make God to become unjuſt, if we could: For we will not at all depend upon him, but upon our own Will: Neither will we ſuffer and do Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in this World, but rather Enjoy and Reign in it: And notwithſtanding of all theſe Oppoſitions to God, we would oblige him to ſave us! Which would be againſt his Righteouſneſs: Becauſe Salvation belongs only to thoſe who reſign their Wills to that of God, and who do and fulfil the Pennance that God himſelf has enjoyned us. Which no Body does: And all the World ſay, That they ſhall be Saved. In which every one deceives himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For God will ſtill exerciſe his Exact Righteouſneſs without reſpect of Perſons: He cannot ſave thoſe who are not Reſigned to his Will, no more than thoſe who will not not fulfil here the Pennance which Sin has merited: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will ſtill accompliſh his perfect Righteouſneſs: Therefore Jeſus Chriſt ſays, <note n="m" place="bottom">Mat. 7. 21.</note>, <hi>Not every one that ſayes, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he who ſhall do the Will of my Father;</hi> which is no other, but that Man of his own Free-will ſubject his Will to Gods Diſpoſal, who having ordain'd him to gain his Bread by the Sweat of his Face, will never change his Ordinances: For he is unchangeable: And if Man withdraw himſelf from him, God in Reaſon and by an Upright Judgment will reject him; ſince Man has no Right to deny this Dependance upon his God: from whom he has received all Things, and himſelf.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>Whether our Salvation depended only upon this Reſignation of our Will to that of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir, our Salvation <note n="n" place="bottom">Pſal. 31. 6.</note> depends ſolely on this Reſignation of our Will to that of God: For it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all the Laws, and all ſort of Vertues: Becauſe having reſigned our Will to the Will of God, we live no <note n="o" place="bottom">Gal. 2. 20.</note> longer, but God lives in us, who works all his Will without oppoſition. He Acts in us; He Labours in us,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104476:258"/>
and ſatisfies <note n="p" place="bottom">Rom. 8. 26.</note> our Penitence: So that the Soul has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to do, but to receive from God, and delight its ſelf in the Operations which he works in it <note n="q" place="bottom">Heb. 13. 21.</note>; and needs not any longer ſeek for means of its Salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its ſelf, for it poſſeſſes the Giver thereof. The Soul that is reſigned to the Will of God, does poſſeſs all ſort of Vertues, ſince God is pleaſed ſtill to exerciſe his Goodneſs, and to give his Graces where he finds no longer any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. He Adorns the Soul with all ſort of Vertues, which he Infuſes in it with all the Gifts and Fruits of the Holy Spirit: So that the Soul which is Reſign'd to God, has no longer need of any Laws, or Rules, or Means; becauſe God does govern the ſame immediately and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently from all Things. To this Dependance only our Salvation is annex'd, without which we cannot obtain it: Becauſe this is the only Thing that God demands of Man, and he will never demand any other thing to make him eternally happy, neither ſhall he ever obtain Salvation without this Dependance: Becauſe he who denies it to God, is rebellious and unthankful, while he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him from whom he holds all that he has. If he dye in this Ingratitude, he muſt by ſtraight Juſtice go to Hell, ſince he denies God a Thing which is ſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully due to him, as the Dependance of a Creature upon its Creatour. Nothing can ever be demanded that is more equitable, and nothing can be more damnable than to uſe our Free-will in prejudice of the Deſigns that God had, in creating Man Ruler over all, provided he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged his Dependance upon the Will of God. And as <hi>Adam</hi> loſt himſelf by quitting this Dependance, ſo all Men ruine themſelves who do not ſubmit their Will to that of God: Becauſe their Salvation depends on doing this, and not on many other things which they teach us as neceſſary to Salvrtion: All which cannot ſave us without this Dependance: For his Law cannot ſave us, nor all our Devotions and Means, unleſs they bring us to this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of our Wills on the Will of God: All other Things put together cannot ſave us.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That Men were very blind in this Matter, and very far out of the True Way: For they do not ſuppoſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:104476:258"/>
                  <hi>That we muſt have our Will reſigned to God thus independently from our own; but that to be ſaved it is enough, to acknowledge, That God is Soveraign over all, and that alſo we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I greatly pity the Blindneſs of Men: Becauſe they go aſtray under falſe Suppoſitions of their Salvation. This is Faith to believe that God is the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign of all Things: But this Faith is not ſufficient for Salvation: It muſt be <note n="r" place="bottom">Jam. 2. 22, 24, 26.</note> accompanied with the Works of Faith, that according to our Belief, we may give to God the ſoveraign and abſolute Dominion of our Will, and that he may thereby operate his Will in us. This Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is the Work of our Faith: Without this Work we have only a dead Faith, which cannot ſave us, but would ſerve for our greater Condemnation: For <note n="s" place="bottom">Luke 12. 47.</note>, <hi>He who knew his Maſters Will, and did it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> To know that God is the Soveraign of all Things, and not to yield up our Will to be governed by him, is worſe than not to know his Soveraignty: Becauſe this Faith and Belief obliges us to reſign our ſelves wholly to him; whereas the Ignorance of this Faith might in ſome manner excuſe us, for a time, becauſe we are obliged to ſearch and find out all things neceſſary for our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: If we be ignorant of them at one time, we muſt ſtudy to learn them at another: For Ignorance does not excuſe Sin. God has given us an Underſtanding for no other End but to Know and Love him, and to know what is neceſſary for Salvation. If we apply it to other Things we are deceived and amuſed by the Enemy, who is well pleaſed to divert our Underſtandings to Earthly Things, that we may periſh through Ignorance, or by the Straying of our Minds. He who thinks to be ſaved becauſe he has not Killed, Stolen, nor committed the other Sins contained in the Decalogue, is greatly deceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For theſe things are not <note n="t" place="bottom">1 Tim. 1. 9, 10.</note> ſpoken but for Malefactors, who quitted a Dependance upon God to follow their own Wills, in doing which they fell into all the Sins contained in the Ten Commandments: Which moved the Goodneſs of God to give them this Decalogue, that they might
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:104476:259"/>
diſcover their Sins, and abſtain from them in Time coming. For before theſe Sins God never gave any other Law to Man but this of reſigning his Will to the Will of God: So that he who ſhould abſtain from committing the Sins contained in the Decalogue, ſhould not be ſaved if withal he did not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reſign his own Will to that of God: becauſe it is not enough to depart from Evil; we muſt alſo do Good; and having no Good but what comes from God, of neceſſity, that we may do Good, we muſt be reſigned to him, becauſe our own Will leads us always to Evil. By which it appears clearly, that the Reſignation of our Will to that of God is the only Mean of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that no Body ſhall ever obtain it by any other way than by this Reſignation of Will to God.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That this being ſo, it had been deſirable, that never any thing elſe had been Taught Men: And that ſo many other Precepts and Means had made them hope for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation without Ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> It is true, Sir, It had been better never to have been inſtructed in any thing elſe but in the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have to reſign our Will to that of God. This was purely true, and Man could not fall into any Errour by this Doctrine; but it was alſo very good, that after we had quitted our Dependance God gave us the Ten Commandments, that by their Means we might know our Faults, without the knowledge of which we might have periſhed through Ignorance, as every one does now by being ignorant That to be ſaved our Will muſt depend upon God. For every one uſes his own Will at his pleaſure, without conſidering, that in doing this he cannot be ſaved. Even ſo they went on in all the ſorts of ſins contained in the Ten Commandments, and in the mean time believed they were reſigned to God, as we now believe we are, while we follow our own Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe Commandments were neceſſary Means to make us return to a Dependance upon God: For all thoſe Sins do hinder this Dependance, and do oppoſe the Works which God works in us. They muſt be removed before God have the Dominion of our Souls, and ere he can govern them according to his Will: Even ſo we muſt deny our own Will, if we would obtain Salvation: For it is ſtill oppoſed to the Will of God, doing its Works either at the Will of the Devil, or elſe according to our natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:104476:259"/>
Which cannot be but evil. If they had only taught the Commands of God as neceſſary Means to be reſigned to him, this had been a deſirable Thing: For by ſhowing that whoſoever is reſigned to God, does not Kill, nor Steal, nor do any thing contrary to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth of God, they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to all thoſe who did commit ſuch Things that they forſook their Dependance upon God, and followed their own Wills; that the knowledge of this might make them return to God, whom they had forſaken. But many other Means which they have taught as neceſſary for Salvation, prove rather Means to hinder it: Becauſe many outward Devotions, the Ornaments of Churches, Images, Beads, a great many Books and Prayers, with a Thouſand other Practices which neither God nor Jeſus Chriſt taught, prove great Hindrances of the Reſignation of our Will to that of God: For inſtead of having our Spirit free to Jet God Act in it what he ſhall find meet, we fill it with our own Affections, and keep our Will fixt to ſome Image, Prayer, or Devotion, which pleaſes our Humour. And thus our Soul not being empty, God cannot fill it. Thus we live and dye in amuſing our ſelves with the Hopes of Salvation without any ground: Becauſe it ought to be founded only upon the Reſignation of our Will to that of God. That which we leaſt think of is the moſt neceſſary.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>Since this Reſignation of our Will was the only thing needful, we ought to fix upon it, and that neither Books, nor Study, nor any other Means were any longer fit for attaining to Salvation; and that Man was very void of Judgment in burthening himſelf with ſo many other things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Man is truly void of Judgment, while he amuſes himſelf with ſo many different Things, ſince there is but one thing neceſſary <note n="u" place="bottom">Luke 10. 42.</note>. All the reſt is ſuperfluous, and uſeleſs. There is no need of Studies, nor Benefices, that we may reſign our ſelves to God, nor of Honours, nor Riches, nor Places and Dignities: For all this reſpects the Earth only and Humane Accommodations. A little Aliment will ſerve for this ſhort Life. Alas! why ſhould we vex and amuſe our ſelves to make up a Fortune here,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104476:260"/>
which muſt remain on the Earth, and all Humane De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights muſt dye with us! Is it not a great Folly to embroil our ſelves in Places, Offices, and Benefices, for ſo ſhort a Time as this Life laſts, during which we have no need of any thing, but a little Meat and Drink, with ſome Cloaths to cover our Body. No Body has need of any thing elſe, neither King nor Pope, more than others, with all their Wealth and Grandeurs, but this little Aliment; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we leave behind us at death Land or Money, 'tis all the ſame thing. The Body rots in the Ground, and we carry nothing away, the Rich no more than the Poor, the Noble than the Beggar. Death levels all without any Preference. Muſt not a Man be very void of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to deſire Goods which are a Burthen to us, painful to get, troubleſome to preſerve, and grievous to be parted with? What a folly does he commit who from his Youth gives himſelf to the Study of Letters, or other Sciences, on deſign to attain to ſome Office and Dignity, and when he has attain'd it, reckons himſelf happy? As if any Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs could be found in Miſeries! And does not diſcover that truly the Wealthieſt and the Greateſt are the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and ſubject to more Cares and Vexations, to more Fatigues, and greater Accounts to be charged on their Souls and Conſciences: For he who has but a ſmall La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſufficient for the maintenance of his Life, without pretending to more, is a thouſand times happier than a Rich and Great Man in this World, and has alſo a far leſs Account to render to God: For Offices and Riches lay great Obligations on him that poſſeſſes them: So that what we imagine to be a Happineſs, brings upon us great Miſchief, robbing us of our Time, which ought to be employed only in fulfilling our Penitence, and alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing our Souls to many Hazards of their Salvation; and it wholly hinders the Reſignation of our Will to that of God. For he who covets the Offices, Honours, Riches and Grandeurs of this World, <note n="x" place="bottom">1 John 2. 15,</note> cannot be reſigned to God, becauſe all theſe things proceed from our own Will, ſeeing that of God aims at no other thing but Eternity, whereas all that is Temporal and paſſes away, is oppoſite to it. We would laugh to ſee a Pilgrim heap on his Head
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104476:260"/>
or Shoulders the Earth which he ſhould only tread upon, that he may advance in his Journey; and we think we are very wiſe in Loading our ſelves with Gold and Silver, which ſhould only ſerve us for a Foot-ſtool, and we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our Underſtanding with Cares, Studies and ſo many different Diſtractions; whereas we have but one thing only to care for, which is to reſign our VVill to that of God, and <note n="y" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 25, &amp;c.</note> to live without Care in this Reſignation of our Will to his. This is all that God will always demand of Man, without obliging him to any other Thing: And when we amuſe our ſelves with ſo many different Things, we Act againſt the Command of God, and we follow our own Will. For one will covet to become an Attorney, Advocate, or Counſellour; another to be a Merchant, Shop-keeper, or Tradeſman; one becomes a Prieſt, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enters into a Religious Order; another deſires to be a Prebend, Biſhop, Cardinal, or Pope: And when they have attain'd to all theſe Pretenſions, they are only filled with Wind: Becauſe all this paſſes away, <note n="z" place="bottom">Pſal. 146. 3, 4. John 2. 17.</note> as the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour that vaniſhes in the Air: And very often when we think to take our eaſe under the Favour of ſome great Fortune, we immediately go down into the Grave, where Death puts an End to all our Employs, and renders all our Pretenſions vain: For by following our own Will, we can never have acquired any thing for Heaven; and God would not be juſt if he ſhould reward eternally the Works that we do for the Earth, or with reſpect to the Creatures. We are deceived if we believe it; becauſe all that reſpects the Earth is recompenſed on the Earth.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> Shews, How the Reſignation of our Will to that of God, is a Continual Prayer; that it ſupplies all particular Doctrines and Practices; and that the Goſpel directs us only to the removal of the Obstacles which hinder it, the diſcovery of which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>If it was needful to uſe any longer the Means of Devotion when one is reſigned to God? If it was any longer needful to Pray, to Watch, to Faſt, to go to Church, to frequent the Sacraments, to procure Indulgences, to Honour Images, eſpecially that of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>which Devotion they tell us is neceſſary for Salvation, with many other things which ſeem to be good?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, The Reſignation of our Will to that of God ſupplies all Things; and when we are arrived at this Reſignation, we have no longer need of any Means: Becauſe God works then in us what pleaſes him; and we have no longer need to<note n="a" place="bottom">Gal. 2. 20.</note> Act, but to be ſtill and paſſive. Our Devotions are then without ceaſing, and we pray always when we are always reſigned to God: For Prayer is nothing elſe but an Elevation of the Spirit unto him, and it is elevated unto him as long as we receive all from his Hands, and are pleaſed every Moment with what he ordains. This is the continual Prayer which he demands of Man, ſaying, <hi>That we</hi>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:104476:261"/>
alwayes by his Will united to God, and has no need of other Means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe he is arrived at the End, where Means would be a Hindrance to him. He ſtill watches <note n="c" place="bottom">Cant. 5. 2. Luke 12. 35, 36.</note> when he is ready at all times to follow the Will of God. He ſaſts alwayes. when he never takes but what is ſimply neceſſary for him in which God directs him. He is alwayes in the Church when he is continually in the preſence of God. He frequents alſo the Sacraments as long as his Spirit converſes with God, who comprehends in himſelf all that is Holy or Sacred. He has the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Indulgence of all his Sins by the Reſignation that he makes of his Will to that of his God, becauſe he can never attain to this Reſignation without forſaking all ſort of Evil; and this <note n="d" place="bottom">Prov. 28. 13.</note> is true Repentance, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Remiſſion of all Sins. He has no need of Images when his Eye and his Heart is fixt upon the Will of God, which makes him remember whatſoever is good and juſt; and he has no longer need of Interceſſours for his Salvation, ſince he is united to the Will of Him who only can give it.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That I ſaw clearly enough that all our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Happineſs did depend upon this Reſignation of our Will to that of God: But that it was a Loſs that this was not taught to all the World, who believed they were ſure of their Salvation by the Means of Devotions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, It is a Lamentable thing that all the World ſhould periſh for want of knowing the Truth. Secular Perſons think they are good when they Trade and do their Buſineſs without Fraud, though they never conſider that they are ſent into this World to lead a Life of Penitence, and are created to be alwayes united in Will to God. Churchmen or Religions Perſons believe they ſhall be ſaved, provided they go to Church and perform their cuſtomary Devotions, without thinking that to be ſaved they muſt be reſigned to the Will of God. And thus both the one and the other periſh through Ignorance, becauſe all in general are creared to be reſigned in Will to the Will of God, depending immediately upon him; and not on other Things: And though we are obliged to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in this Life, yet this is but accidentally, and to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104476:262"/>
ſatisfie the Penitence due for our Sins; not that God has created us for Labour, but only ordain'd it for Penitence: And inſtead of fulfilling it by our Labour, we encreaſe our Sins by the ſame Means by which we ought to purge them, glorying in our Chains, and rejoycing in our Vallie of Tears: And we will Act, where we ought only to Suffer; and Rule, where we ought to be Subject. This falls out through our Ignorance, for we do not know the True way of Salvation, and we imagine we ſhall find it by Means which divert us from it inſtead of bringing us to it. They go ſometimes to a Cloyſter to find the ſure Means of Salvation, and in the mean time all the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes that muſt be performed are often Diverſions from God: For ſo many outward Rules and Geſtures prove great Hindrances to the Converſation the Soul ought to have with its God; and theſe Studied Devotions are often Hypocriſies. If we bow the Knee to ſhew that we adore and pray to God, while our Thoughts are far from him, this is pure <note n="e" place="bottom">Mat. 7. 8.</note> Hypocriſie: If we give Honour or do Reverence to ſome Image without raiſing our Thoughts to that which it repreſents to us, this is pure Idolatry: If we pray to God with the Lips, and the Heart is far from him, it is a Contempt of God: If we uſe Mortifications of the Body, without the Spirit of Penitence, it is the Pride of Life, for we deſire to be eſteemed more than others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our particular Pennances, when God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed us all in general common Ones which would be much more for our Salvation: For he who willingly ſuffers Heat, Cold, and other Incommodities of the Elements, or of our Body, does merit much more than he who chuſes Faſtings, Watchings, and other things according to his own deſires: Becauſe theſe things are done by our own Will, and will be recompenced only in this VVorld: But the Pennances that are common to all Men are Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and Choſen of God for ſaving Penitences. In which theſe Penitents do greatly deceive themſelves in following their own VVill, and often will not bear patiently with a VVord that contradicts their Behaviour. The Blindneſs of Men now may truly be bewailed; for in all Things they take Falſhood for Truth, and the way
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:104476:262"/>
of Damnation for that of Salvation. Which would be eaſie to make appear to all the World, in caſe they would give Ear to it: For there is but one only thing needful, which is, for Men to reſign their Will to that of God: But they are ſo preoccupied with ſo many different ſorts of Means, which they perſwade them are good Things, that they ſhould think they did Evil in reſigning their Will to that of God, chooſing rather to ſubmit it to a Man ſubject to his Paſſions, having forgotten that the Holy Spirit ſaid, <note n="f" place="bottom">Jer. 17. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Wo to the Man that puts his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Man.</hi> Take, Sir, this Leſſon to your ſelf, and put not your Confidence in any but God. For <note n="g" place="bottom">Pſal. 116. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>all Men are Lyars</hi> and cannot give Salvation to thoſe to whom they promiſe it. We have but one only Saviour, who is Jeſus Chriſt; and one only Eſſential Commandment, which is, to DEPEND UPON GOD IN ALL THINGS: If Men have taught ſo many different Things, and filled the World with Books to ſhew that we muſt depend upon them, do not believe them, <hi>for one thing only is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="bottom">Luke 10. 42</note>.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>Why ſhe had ſhewn me ſo many different things ſince we began</hi> our Conferences, <hi>ſeeing there is one thing only needful, as I am certainly perſwaded?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I never taught you any other Means of Salvation but the Doctrine of the Goſpel, which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to bring back the greateſt Sinners in the World to a Dependance upon God: Becauſe that Doctrine teaches how to remove all that might hinder this Reſignation to God: And when it ſays that <note n="i" place="bottom">Mat. 16. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>we muſt deny our ſelves,</hi> it tells us that we muſt be reſigned to God; and in ſaying that we muſt <hi>take up our Croſs,</hi> it ſhews the Penitence that we are obliged to perform in this World; and when we conſider the whole Life of Jeſus Chriſt, we are thereby ſufficiently taught that we muſt not rule in this World, nor ſeek after Dignities, Offices or Traffick, nor build Cloiſters or other Edifices, nor lay up Riches here: For his whole Life and Converſation was quite another thing, and he has not at all taught us the Cuſtoms that are obſerved at preſent; but Goodneſs <note n="k" place="bottom">Mat. 11. 28.</note>, Humility, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104476:263"/>
                  <note n="l" place="bottom">Mat. 8. 20.</note> Poverty. Theſe Things are the true Means to attain to this Dependance upon God, becauſe they remove the Hindrances of our Soul, that thereafter it may reſign it ſelf the more eaſily and freely unto him. Jeſus Chriſt has taught that we are to forſake many <note n="m" place="bottom">Luke 14. 26, 33.</note> Things which prove Hindrances of this Reſignation to God: For he who loves the Riches, Honours, Pleaſures and Delights of this World, cannot be reſigned to God; nor yet the <note n="n" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> who loves his Father, his Countrey, or even his own Life. By reaſon therefore of the Blindneſs of Men, it was needful that he ſhould manifeſt to them in particular what they ought to forſake that they may be reſigned to God. For if Jeſus Chriſt had only ſaid ſimply that a Man muſt be reſigned to God, every one would have ſaid or imagined, that they lived in this Reſignation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not Faith but in Speculation, for they imagine they are reſigned to God, when they live in a Dependance on their own Will, or that of ſome Perſon to whom they ſubmit: And ſince Jeſus Chriſt came to bring Light into the World, it was neceſſary that he ſhould open our Eyes by all the Means contain'd in his Goſpel, that he might make us ſee how many Obſtacles we put to this DEPENDANCE.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>She had declared to me many things beſides thoſe which are contained in the Goſpel: And ſince Dependance only upon God was ſufficient for Salvation, I might very well have remained ignorant of the Sins of Men, the poor Eſtate of the Church, the Dominion of Antichriſt, with ſo many other things, which do not concern my Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, You imagine that theſe Things do not concern your Salvation, becauſe they do not reſpect it directly, but indirectly. They reſpect it in ſuch a manner, as I believe it would be impoſſible for you to obtain it if you were ignorant of the truth of ſo many dangerous Evils. You would build your Salvation upon falfe. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of being reſigned to God, when there were no ſuch thing; and if you have not the knowledge of Evil, you cannot avoid it, but will be deceived to your Loſs. For the Wickedneſs of Men is now ſo covered over with Vertue, that 'tis hard to diſtinguiſh the one from the other.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104476:263"/>
If you perceive not that Men are deceitful, they will deceive you every Moment; and if you believe not that they have forſaken God, you will imitate them, believing that they do well: This pious Opinion of your Neighbour will make you follow Evil inſenſibly. Thus we muſt not walk blindly in the matter of our Salvation: For you have more need to diſcover Evil, that you may avoid it, than Good, to imitate it: Becauſe if your Will were reſigned to God without knowing the Wickedneſs of Men now, they would certainly draw you back from this Reſignation to make you take your own Will: And this under pious Pretexts: For they will reckon you to be deceived if you do not follow their wayes of Acting; and if you be reſigned to God, you will contract his Qualities of Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth: Which Men will not at all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, but will take your Righteouſneſs to be Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciſeneſs; and your Goodneſs to be Sillineſs and want of Wit; and your Truth will be reckoned Detraction as ſoon as by it you ſhall diſcover their Evils: And all this they ſhall do ſo dexterouſly, that you ſhall be puzled to know, whether you will not do better to follow their Sentiments than the Direction of God. Therefore it is ſo neceſſary that you know the Wickedneſs of Men, that you be not deceived by it. And if I have declared to you the poor Condition in which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is now, I have done it more out of Charity than to make known to you the Works of God: Becauſe ſo long as you believe that this <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the Holy Church, you will take up with a Dependance upon Her inſtead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon God; and will indirectly follow the Devil, while you believe you follow God: And if I had not declared to you that we are now in the Reign of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, you would certainly be deceived, becauſe he Acts his greateſt Villanies under the Cloak of Holineſs, and introduces his Adherents into the moſt Eminent Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Dignities of the Church: That <note n="o" place="bottom">Mat. 24. 24.</note> he may ſeduce the very-Elect, if it were poſſible: For now more than Three Fourths of People are bound to the Devil <note n="p" place="bottom">Rev. 13. 4.</note> by expreſs Covenant. And if you be ignorant of all theſe Truths, by what Means ſhall you avoid their Snares?
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104476:264"/>
As long as the Devil ſhall tempt you by evil Thoughts, you will not be in danger of following his Suggeſtions; but when he has on his Side, the Prieſts and the Religious, the Biſhops and other Prelats of the Church, you will eaſily let your ſelf be governed by them, thinking that they are guided by this Spirit of God, though in effect, by that of the Devil. By all which Things you may ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently diſcover the need you have to be informed of all theſe Evils when you deſire to reſign your ſelf to God, or elſe your Reſignation will not laſt: Becauſe Men, the Church and Antichriſt, would very ſhortly find the Means to draw you back, as they do almoſt all well-diſpoſed Perſons, perſwadeing them, that it is fit ſtill to have a good Opinion of our Neighbour, and that we muſt alſo depend upon the Church, and that the Prieſts and the Religious are true Members of it: Though in the Sight of God there is no ſuch thing: For all Men together are as a Deluge of Vices, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the <hi>Babylon</hi> of Confuſion, and many of her Pillars are the Members of Antichriſt. This being ſuppoſed, Sir, do you not think I had reaſon to declare to you all theſe things in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that you may not be deceived by ſo great an Abyſs of Evils, which would be but too ſufficient to hinder you from this RESIGNATION TO THE WILL OF GOD, which is the only thing neceſſary for Salvation, to which you can never attain without diſcovering and removing all the Hindrances which out of great Charity I have manifeſted unto you?</p>

I have told you <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt will abide upon Earth, to Reign there with all the Juſt for ever:</hi> that the Expectation of this Glorious Coming may give you Strength to bear with patience the Rods and Tribulations which muſt ſhortly fall out, ſuch as the like hath not yet been ſeen. I have told you, <hi>that the World will laſt for ever, and that none of the Creatures ſhall periſh in their Kinds:</hi> that the Hope of your Bleſſedneſs may not be founded upon imaginary Goods, and that you may in ſome manner
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:104476:265"/>
comprehend what Contentment the Souls and Bodies of the Bleſſed ſhall have when all Malignity ſhall be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from every thing, and all the Elements and other Creatures ſhall ſerve for the Delight of Man, who ſhall rule over all, being united to Jeſus Chriſt in Body and Soul: And this, that you may willingly deſpiſe the Delights of this preſent Life, in the Hope of thoſe of which are to come. I have told you, <hi>that the Jews ſhall be converted to God, and ſhall be his People; and that the Catholicks ſhall be caſt off and rejected:</hi> that you may never deſpiſe any Body, ſince the <hi>Jews,</hi> the moſt deſpiſed of all Nations, ſhall be the moſt exalted; and of Stones ſhall be made <note n="s" place="bottom">Matth. 3. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Children of Abraham;</hi> and that you may willingly quit the Maximes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which for her evil Deeds ſhall very ſhortly be rooted out. I have told you, <hi>that Man is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for no other end but to take his delight with God:</hi> that you may no longer ſeek for any thing upon Earth, and that you may deſpiſe all Things, to enjoy this Converſation with God; having told you alſo, <hi>that this preſent Life is only a time of Penitence,</hi> that all your Labours may be done in this Spirit of Penitence, to which God has ſubjected all Men for their Sins. In fine, I have told you, Sir, <hi>That all the Laws, the Prophets, and all Vertues, do conſiſt in the Reſignation of our Will to that of God:</hi> that you may not be diſtracted by ſo many other different things, but may paſs your Life joyfully under this Dependance upon God, which is the leaſt thing we can give to God for ſo many good Things we have received from him, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us to enjoy provided we will depend upon him in all Things. I have alſo ſhewn you, <hi>That ſo many divers Means which the Prieſts, Monks, and the Religious have taught us for working out our Salvation, are things that withdraw us from it, by which we are ſeduced and deceived:</hi> For they make us depend upon Men more than upon God: Which is an Idolatry that has infected all Chriſtendom, in which no Body ſtudies any longer to reſign his Will to that of God, but every one enjoys and diſpoſes of Things at his own Will, as if he were his own Soveraign. One will be Great, and another Rich; one will Rule over others, and will be Obey'd and Serv'd; one goes in a Coach, another
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104476:265"/>
upon Horſe: In ſhort, Every one will follow his Delights and Pleaſures according to his own Inclination, believing notwithſtanding that they work out their Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Prieſts and Monks promiſe it to them. Theſe are new Gods and new Saviours, who have changed the Order eſtabliſhed by God, our Father and Creatour, and the Duties which his Son Jeſus came to reach us They lead us in the Way to Hell, perſwading us that 'tis that to Paradiſe: With theſe Perſwaſions every one ſuffers himſelf to be deceived and ſeduced, there being none now in Chriſtendom who believe that they cannot be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſigning their Will to that of God: This nevertheleſs is an Eternal Truth, that will never change let Man do what he will: If he do not acknowledge the Dependance he has upon God in all Things, he ſhall never be ſaved; and if he do not take up the Counſels of the Goſpel as the true Means taught by God for returning to this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, he ſhall never be ſaved: For God teaches no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is uſeleſs, but only Things preciſely neceſſary, to which all the World ought to ſubmit, This no Body does, for they believe Men more than God: Though the moſt part are Rul'd by the Devil, who gains the moſt part of Men to himſelf by the Means of theſe wild Shepherds, who abandon the Flock to the Power of the Infernal Wolf to deſtroy them with themſelves for ever, taking them off from God to draw them to themſelves. I have told you alſo, <hi>That there are no longer any true Chriſtians upon Earth:</hi> that you may become one, and may not blindly ſuppoſe your ſelf to be ſo: For there can be no Chriſtians, but they who obey the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt: All others are deceived in believing they are: For God does not change upon the Changes of Men: We are now as much obliged to depend upon God, as <hi>Adam,</hi> the Firſt Man, was; and as much obliged to Labour the Ground as he, though we had committed no other Sin but what he did in us: We muſt alſo now follow the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, as the Primitive Chriſtians did, becauſe this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is immutable, and will never change: Therefore he who does not follow it is no true Chriſtian, and cannot be ſaved without becoming ſo. No Body ſhould flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this Matter. We muſt imitate Jeſus Chriſt, or <note n="t" place="bottom">John. 15. 6.</note> periſh
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:104476:266"/>
for ever: Becauſe, both by the Will of <hi>Adam</hi> and by our own, we are all fallen into this Sin of Ingratitude, that we will not depend upon God: And therefore we have need to take up the Law of the Goſpel, that we may return to a Dependance upon God, which is ſo juſt and reaſonable. Though God had never demanded it of Man, he is bound both by Divine and Humane Right to render to God this Submiſſion of his Will; and he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do it if he were not diverted from it by Men like himſelf: Becauſe even Natural reaſon obliges him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him from whom he receives all Things. This, Humane Wiſdom has diverted, having found out ſo many Reaſons and Arguments to favour our Self-will, that all People believe they may lawfully follow it without offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him who has reſerved it for himſelf. Theſe, Sir, are <hi>all blind who lead the blind, and both fall into the ditch</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="bottom">Mat. 15. 14.</note>. See that you never be of that Crew; but believe in the Light that God manifeſts unto you. I have ſpoken TRUTH to you, not out of an Affectation to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or followed, but from a deſign and deſire of your Salvation. All that I have ſaid, is neceſſary for you, if you will uſe it well: Becauſe we cannot Love God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing him, nor follow Vertue without conceiving what it is: In like manner we cannot avoid Deluſion without diſcovering it, nor eſcape the Snares of the Devil without turning away from them. Make a good uſe of all theſe Things, and you ſhall be happy both in this World and the other. I doubt not but my way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be ſomewhat uneaſie, to you, becauſe it agrees not with your Philoſophy, Theology, or other Scholaſtick Sciences: But believe me, I never profeſſed any Humane Sciences: I chooſe rather to be ignorant of them than know them, and if I could learn in a Quarter of an Hour all the Learning of the Schools, I would not employ even that Little Time about them: Becauſe I know that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning is a great Hindrance to the Holy Spirit: and alſo the Time is come that <note n="x" place="bottom">Iſa. 29. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>God will deſtroy the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, and aboliſh the Prudence of the Prudent:</hi> And therefore I cannot uſe fine Diſcourſes, but ſuch only as make the plain Truth be underſtood: Words and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104476:266"/>
Terms may be contended about, but not the real Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is true. I will not diſpute with the Learned, becauſe God will overcome them very ſhortly by the Effects of my Words; nor will I poliſh my Language, becauſe ſimple Plainneſs pleaſes God more than the greateſt Eloquence, which is ſubject to Vanity: For he that ſpeaks that he may talk well, is full of Vain-glory: Renouncing which, I ſeek nothing but plain Words that may expreſs my Thoughts.</p>
               <p>I believe, Sir, you have underſtood me well enough, and I can tell you no more whereby I may co-operate to your Salvation: There remains nothing but to put it in practice. This you will do more eaſily in a Solitude, or Deſert, than elſewhere, becauſe of the Corruption of Men, who prove great Hindrances to us; and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Power the Devil has now over their Minds, whereby he may infatuate all thoſe who are yet ſound and entire. Flee therefore, Sir, to avoid theſe Dangers, and be afraid leſt you be diverted from your good Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and do not look back <note n="y" place="bottom">Gen. 19. 26.</note> like <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, who was changed into a Pillar of Salt. Yet a little Penitence, and then God will deliver you from it, to enter into the Joy that ſhall never end, This is what I wiſh you, and bid you. Adieu.</p>

                  <hi>I was troubled to hear that ſhe would leave me, entreating ſhe would not withdraw from me, ſince I reſolved to follow what ſhe had taught me, which was nothing elſe but the denying of my ſelf, and a dependance upon God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, It will be more for your purity to ſtay alone: Becauſe I am but a Creature as you are, and we muſt cleave to the Creatour only without Interruption: He will lead you at his pleaſure, provided you be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to his Will; you need no more Inſtructions from any. I have told you abundantly what may bring you to an Union with God. To ſpeak more would be hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth but a Repetition of what is already ſaid, which would rob us both of our Time, and that would be better employed in the Practice than in Repetitions. Leave me to my Liberty, and take alſo yours. God did not create us together, He will Save us though we be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:104476:267"/>
ſeparate in Body. True Union conſiſts in a conformity of the Will with God, and not in particular Conferences. I muſt confeſs I have often withdrawn from converſing with God to ſpeak to you of ſo many diverſe Things: But I judg'd them neceſſary for your Salvation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were not uneaſie to me: But now that you know the Truth of many Things, it is not expedient to ſpeak to you any longer. God will ſtill teach you ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, provided you continue faithful to him. He never denied what Men ask of him for their Salvation. You ought to have no other Deſigns. Let the <note n="a" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 3, &amp;c.</note> World be overturned; Let the <hi>Roman</hi> Church periſh; Let the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be moved againſt Sinners; all this cannot touch you, provided you keep firmly united to God. Quit all Things willingly to find this Union. It matters little whether I am with you or not: Provided you be with God, He ſhould ſuffice you: For he only can ſave you, and no Body elſe. There is always a Mixture when the Creature cleaves to its like. I often deſpiſed thoſe who cleave to others, even though it was under ſome pious Pretext. I will not do my ſelf what I deſpiſe in others.</p>

the Holy Spirit will give the perfect Underſtanding of all the Holy Scriptures, which has not been hitherto heard of: For we are fallen into the Fulneſs of Time.

               <p>
                  <hi>I brought her the Text of the Goſpel, promiſing entirely to ſubmit my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding as much as was poſſible, that I might receive the Light of the Holy Spirit.</hi>

We know well enough we cannot ſave our
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104476:268"/>
ſelves, and that our Salvation depends upon God; and yet we hope to be ſaved, though we have quitted our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God, and adhere to our ſelves! This is a falſe Perſwaſion which the Devil and the World ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, to make us inſenſible of our Miſery. For God will never ſave him <note n="o" place="bottom">Pſal. 73. 27.</note> who will not depend upon him. If through Frailty we commit ſome Acts of Independence upon God, and afterwards repent of them, we may yet hope for Pardon: But when we ſee that all Men live and dye in following their own Wills, and will not leave it off, being readier to murmur againſt God than to yield up their Wills to him, he muſt of neceſſity render to them according to their Works. God made no <note n="p" place="bottom">Wiſd. 1. 13, 14.</note> Malignity in the Elements, nor in any other Creatures, having created all good and perfect: But Sin <note n="q" place="bottom">Rom. 5. 12.</note> and the Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of Man has brought a Malignity into all Things: And therefore it belongs to him, as being the Work of his Hands: And if it be juſt to render to each one what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him, it is neceſſary that Man have for his Portion <note n="r" place="bottom">Pſal. 11. 6.</note> the Malignity of all the Creatures to all Eternity, as being the Works of <note n="s" place="bottom">Iſa. 3. 10.</note> his Hands, that the Fire burn him, the Water ſwallow him up, the Wind bluſter, the Earth be Thorns to prick him, the Dogs bite him, the Wolf devour him, the Lion tear him, the Serpent poyſon him; and all the other Creatures ſhall ſpue out their Malignity upon Man, who brought it upon them, by forſaking his Dependance upon God.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That upon this Suppoſition, all ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Becauſe none reſign their Will to God, ſince every one enjoyes it as much as is poſſible for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She replied:</hi> Sir, I have told you long ago, that Paradiſe was ſhut; and that none did any longer enter into it: Becauſe no Body reſigns his Will to that of God. The Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes of the Church have ſo blinded Mens Spirits by ſo many different wayes of Salvation, that none conſider the Obligation that lies on them to reſign their Wills to God. They think to be ſaved by going to Church, frequenting the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though nevertheleſs they follow their own Will in every Thing. This ruines all
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104476:269"/>
the World, and has cauſed the general Judgment: For God having beheld <note n="t" place="bottom">Pſal. 14. 2, 3.</note> all the Earth, found not one who was reſigned to him, nor ſo much as one that did good: All having forſaken <note n="u" place="bottom">Pſal. 81. 12.</note> God to follow their own Wills. And this general Evil has cauſed the general Sentence, which is irrevocable: Becauſe there is Time no longer. If any deſires to be converted, he muſt make haſte: For the Laſt Times are near their End. They began when <note n="x" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 18.</note> Jeſus Chriſt became Man, and by Grace have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till now, to give Man a full Meaſure, and abundance of Time for his Converſion. Time is come to its End. Yet <note n="y" place="bottom">Heb. 10. 37.</note> a little Suffering, and the Judgment will end, and the Wicked ſhall go to the Abyſs of all Evils <note n="z" place="bottom">Matth. 25. 46.</note>, and the Converted to the Enjoyment of all Good, which ſhall never end, and that not only ſpiritual but alſo bodily and <note n="a" place="bottom">1 Pet. 3. 13.</note> material: For all the Creatures will render their Duty to Man, as ſoon as he ſhall pay his Duty to God. They were created to ſerve for the Delight of Man <note n="b" place="bottom">Gen. 1. 26.</note>, as he was created to ſerve <note n="c" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 31.</note> for the Delight of God: And as ſoon as he ſhall be converted, and enter into a Dependance upon his God, <note n="d" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 6, &amp;c.</note> he ſhall experience that the Beaſts and Elements ſhall ſubmit alſo to the Will of Man: For for this they were all created: And if we ſee the Beaſts and Elements rebel againſt Man, this is for no other reaſon but becauſe he rebels againſt his God: For elſe all inferiour Things would be entirely ſubject to Man, if he were entirely ſubject to God, even though it were in this Miſerable Life. We have Examples of this in the Life of many Saints, who becauſe they reſigned their Wills to God, had in this Time of Penitence <note n="g" place="bottom">Heb. 11. 34.</note> the Power to command the Elements, and to be familiar with the Wild Beaſts. One carried Fire without being burnt by it: Another ſtay'd the Sun <note n="h" place="bottom">Joſh. 10. 12.</note>: And ſeveral have tam'd Wild Beaſts, and commanded the Wind and Tempeſts of the Sea, with ſo many other Wonders, playing with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and recreating themſelves with Birds which aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the Command of ſome Servants of God. This
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104476:269"/>
is a certain Proof, that it is Sin only that gives all the Malignity to every Thing; and that nothing but the Rebellion that Man has raiſed againſt his God, renders all the Elements and other Creatures Rebels againſt him. If we would from this time yield up our Will into God's Hands, and ſubmit our ſelves entirely to him, we ſhould immediately find that all Things would ſubject themſelves to us without any conſtraint. How greatly does Man wrong himſelf, when he will needs diſpoſe of his own Will? He makes himſelf miſerable in this World, and far more in that to come: Whereas by being willing to depend upon God, he has all under his Power, together with Eternal Bliſs. What Infatuation of Spirit is it, that we will not do a Thing ſo good, ſo juſt, and ſo reaſonable, as <hi>to reſign our Will to that of God!</hi> If Men were taught this, as they are other frivolous Devotions, it would be impoſſible that any would deny God ſo profitable a Submiſſion. But they let themſelves be amuſed by the Diſcourſes of Men, who propoſe a Salvation, without being able to give it. Theſe are thoſe falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets of whom Jeſus Chriſt has ſo often told, that we muſt <note n="i" place="bottom">Matth. 24. 4, 5. 11. 24.</note> take heed of them, who have deceived all the World, ſo that none think any longer of reſigning themſelves to God, or of doing ſaving Penitence.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>There were yet divers Perſons who deſired to be reſigned to God, and alſo to do Pennance, which cannot be avoided in this World.</hi>

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, You take the Bark often for the Wood: For thoſe who ſay they will be reſigned to God, have nothing but outward Words: For if they were truly ſo, they <note n="k" place="bottom">Pſal. 37. 5. 73. 23, 24.</note> would be governed by God; and would no longer labour for the Earth, but only for Heaven.

others, are infallible Evidences that God does not govern our Will: For he could not move us to make Tabernacles here, ſince he has ſent us hither only to undergo a ſhort Penitence. He could not incite us to build what muſt be ſo quickly deſtroyed. Neither Jeſus Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles and Diſciples built Temples or Houſes, being contented with what was ſimply neceſſary. In which the Heathens will riſe up againſt us in the Day of Judgment, who did ſo deſpiſe the ſhortneſs of this Life, that they would not build Houſes, contenting themſelves with a Tub to cover them from the Injuries of the Seaſon: Others threw their Mony into the Sea, not judging it neceſſary for ſo ſhort a Life, though ſince that Time ours is much ſhortned. Neither can it be true that we are willing to do Pennance, becauſe every one avoids Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as much as he can; and to do ſaving Pennance, it muſt be voluntary, and ſuffered for fulfilling the Will of God: For elſe we may ſuffer much without Meriting, as Robbers and Thieves do.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That this ought to be preached through all the World that they who would periſh through Ignorance might hear the Truth and be converted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, You may do as you pleaſe: As for me I retire: For I am not ſent to preach, but ſimply to declare the Truth, as I have done to you. You may have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently remarked in all my Diſcourſes, and my Life; if there were any Affectations or Paſſions which ſhould move me to tell you theſe Things. I am perſwaded in the ſight of God, that I have no Self-Intereſt in it, nor any deſire to pleaſe or diſpleaſe Men, nor to affect the ſpeaking new or marvellous Things. No, Sir, I am not led by that Spirit, but by that of Jeſus Chriſt, who had ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for Men, that for them he endured a bitter Paſſion and the Death of the Croſs: If you preach theſe Things to Men of good Judgment, and who thirſt after the Truth, they will gladly hear you, and yield themſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God: For they will eaſily ſee, that here is no Flattery for any Body; nor yet Contempt, or ſenſual Animoſity; but pure ſolid Truths, which none can reſiſt but they who are in League with Satan, and love Lyes, and reſiſt the Truth. Thoſe will very hardly receive Truths that are ſo oppoſite to them; they will induce effeminate Spirits to reject theſe Things as evil, perceiving
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104476:270"/>
that the knowledge of theſe will take from their Maſter the Devil the Power to deceive by Falſhood and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; and that he will be forced very quickly to diſcover his Miſchievous Reign <note n="l" place="bottom">Rev. 12. 12, 17. 13. 3, 7, 8.</note>: Becauſe he ſhall not be able to catch Souls any longer under the colour of Piety and Holineſs, as he has done hitherto. And his furious Reign ſhall be far leſs dangerous: For ſo ſoon as he ſhall be known for the Devil, no Body will follow him any longer, except they who wilfully yield up themſelves to him: Whereas at preſent every one follows him blindly: But ſo ſoon as his Malice ſhall be diſcovered, he ſhall have no longer Power over Innocent Souls. Tell the Truth boldly, Sir, to all good Men in Confidence: But beware of the Adherents of the Enemy, and of thoſe <note n="m" place="bottom">Mat. 10. 17.</note> who let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be governed by his Spirit, though they be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in Covenant with the Devil: Becauſe theſe will do you much Miſchief when they think they are doing well: For they who have their Minds infatuated do ſerve the Devil as well as Sorcerers themſelves: The one directly, and the other indirectly. You will ſtill diſcover them by the reſiſtance which they will make to the Truth, for they will not ſo much as hear it: Becauſe they know very well they cannot change the Truth: They endeavour at leaſt to reject and deſpiſe it, that no Body may receve it. This will be the Devils laſt Effort. For as ſoon as the Truth ſhall be known, it will ſtrongly reſiſt him, and at laſt will break his Head. Obſerve ſtill, Sir, the Diſpoſition of thoſe to whom you would declare theſe Truths: And when you find oppoſition from them, leave off ſpeaking to them: For thoſe who ſhall be diſpoſed to profit by the Truth, will give Ear to it willingly, and with Hungry Deſires will ſearch even to the Bottom; that they may diſcover the Eſſence of it: For no good Men can reſiſt the Truth, nor the Things which are propoſed to them, without having examined whether they be Good or Evil: But the Wicked will reſiſt it, before they know it: And if they can catch a Word different from their School Terms, they will take it in a quite contrary Sence. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Sir, do not amuſe your ſelf with Queſtions and Diſputes, For this would be to caſt Roſes before Swine:
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104476:271"/>
Offer them only to thoſe who will take pleaſure to ſmell them, and not to theſe who will caſt them into the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil. All good Men will feel in the Bottom of their Souls that this cannot come from the Devil: For he is the Father of Lyes; and never incites to Self-denial, becauſe he is too proud: Nor to the Love of God, becauſe he hates him: And yet leſs to reſign our Will to that of God, for he catches all Men by their Self-will. All my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes have for their Scope all that is contrary to the Devil, who is never contrary to himſelf.</p>

You will find more Welcome, Sir, among the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> than among the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, who condemn others to Authorize their own Cuſtoms, deſpiſing the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, who ſayes, <note n="u" place="bottom">Matth. 7. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Judge not, and you ſhall not be judged; condemn not, and you ſhall not be condemned.</hi> Theſe Catholicks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all thoſe who do not follow them: This is the cauſe why they are judged, and condemned firſt to be rooted out. They condemn ſo many holy Heathens, who will go before them <note n="x" place="bottom">Mat. 8. 11, 12.</note> in the Day of Judgment, becauſe they were faithful to God though they had not any Laws or Inſtitutions to know Him: Nevertheleſs many reſigned their Wills to that of God, and obeyed the Truth in their Lives; whereas theſe Chriſtians follow Lyes, of which the Devil <note n="y" place="bottom">John 4. 44.</note> is the Father; and none of them will reſign themſelves to God, nor take notice of the Truth which diſcovers the ſhortneſs of this miſerable Life, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of one that ſhall be Eternal. Theſe Heathens knew a God, to whom they reſigned themſelves; and ſeeing the Miſery of this Life, they bewailed it; they laughed when they conſidered the Stupidity of Men who took pleaſure in this Life; and judg'd, that they ought not to be called <hi>Men,</hi> becauſe they did not uſe their Reaſon to diſcover the Truth of Things: For he who went through the City of <hi>Athens</hi> with his Lantern, ſeeking for a Man in the midſt of ſo many Thouſands as were in the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104476:272"/>
could not be ignorant that they who were about him were all Men: But ſeeing they were all occupied, in buying, and ſelling, and Trading for the Earth, he could not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to be Reaſonable Men: Becauſe he who has Reaſon, ought to uſe it for his Eternal Happineſs, elſe he is nothing but a Beaſt: For Reaſon only makes a Man; without which he does not differ from the Brute Beaſts, for they are unreaſonable Animals, and Men are reaſonable ones: Laying aſide which, they are as much Brutes as the Beaſts. This made the Philoſopher ſearch for a Man among ſo great a Number, and could not find one; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all ſpent their Lives in Worldly Buſineſs, inſtead of employing them in the Study of the Knowledge of God, and of the Truth, which is the ſame God. And they condemn thoſe Heathens as damned, and for my part I look upon them as SAINTS, and believe <note n="y" place="bottom">Mat. 8. 4. Rom. 2. 10, 11.</note> they will come to Reign with Jeſus Chriſt upon Earth to condemn the Chriſtians, who beſides the Light of the Heathens, had Lawes and Commandments from God, with the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, which obliged them to a farther Knowledge of God, and the Immortality of their Souls, the Shortneſs and Miſery of this Life, that they might deſpiſe it, and the Vanity of periſhing Goods, that they might abandon them. Nevertheleſs, not one of theſe Chriſtians does any of theſe Things.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>If it was indeed poſſible that not ſo much as one Chriſtian ſhould be reſigned to God, nor have the Vertues of the Heathens?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir: This is moſt true, that <note n="z" place="bottom">Iſa. 59. 16.</note> not ſo much as one Chriſtian is reſigned to God, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands true Vertue, as much as the Heathens did: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none apply themſelves to it. Since they became Idolaters of Men, they have left off to know God, and abondoned themſelves to the Will of their Idols, inſtead of the Will of God. They Preach and Teach through all Chriſtendom, <hi>That we muſt depend upon Men, whom they call the Fathers of the Church; That we muſt believe and follow them, even with a blind Obedience:</hi> In which they prefer themſelves to God, who demands only of Man that he obey him in what he ſhall make known to him; having
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:104476:272"/>
given him Eyes to diſcover this Beautiful Univerſe, <note n="a" place="bottom">Rom. 1. 20.</note> that when he ſees the Heavens, the Earth, the Sun, the Stars, and all the Elements, with ſo many different Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo marvellous and ſo well ordered, he might clearly perceive that all thoſe Things muſt proceed from a God: ſince Men and Nature can make nothing like them. Moreover, when Man conſiders himſelf he diſcovers evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently by his Underſtanding, that his Soul, his Memory, his Underſtanding cannot come but from a God, for no ſuch Thing can come from Nature; no more than his Body, ſince all the Induſtry of Men is not capable to make ſo much as one Hair of our Head. This obliges us to acknowledge a God, by ſo many different Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without being put to know God blindly, no more than to love or follow him blindly; as theſe Chriſtians ſay we muſt obey and follow Men blindly: For when we conſider all the Works of God, and obſerve what he has done for us, it is impoſſible we ſhould ceaſe to love and follow ſuch a Benefactour. If we had but the Light of a Heathen, we would not readily yield this blind Submiſſion to Men: Becauſe they are not our Creatours, nor our Saviours; and our Dependance ought to be upon the Lord who created all Things: But not on frail Man like our ſelves, who can give us nothing but Promiſes without Effects; for they deceive us when they promiſe us Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſince they cannot give it to themſelves: And yet all the World believes they ſhall ſave all Chriſtians, of whom I know not ſo much as one that is in the way of Salvation; becauſe they neither know God, nor true Vertue; but have their Underſtandings blinded by the Diſcourſes of Men, who deſire to love, and be loved by their like; and inſtead of leading them to the knowledge of the true God to love and follow him, they draw them to love themſelves: And by this blind conduct, every one runs to Perdition, while many believe that they are in the way of Salvation. So that I might well travel through all Chriſtendom with a Lantern, to find out ſo much as one Man, as the Philoſophers did through the City of <hi>Athens:</hi> Becauſe no Body any longer uſes his Reaſon, to ſee the Obligation that we have to depend upon the Will
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:104476:273"/>
of God, nor yet to conſider the Miſery and Shortneſs of this Life, nor the Vanity of tranſitory Things; but are in all this as if they were void of Underſtanding, and follow one another blindly, without conſidering any other Thing. For if Man did only uſe his Reaſon, he would ſee clearly that he is obliged to depend upon his God, ſince he has received all from him, and can pretend to nothing but from him: His Natural Inſtinct does ſufficiently encline him to this Dependance. Though they call this a <hi>Heathen</hi> Light, this is not that it is ſimply Natural, but it is an Impreſſion that God makes on our Underſtanding, which leads us to know God, and to ſubmit our ſelves to him: Which if we do, we are happy in whatſoever Nation we be: For God never demanded any other thing of Men but this Reſignation to his Will; and if he has ſince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Laws; this was but by reaſon of Mens Frailty, having never formerly ſubjected them to any Laws but that of depending upon him: As he would not yet, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we would ſubmit to him. This our Chriſtians do not, though they hope to be ſaved,</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That it troubled me much to hear that not ſo much as one Chriſtian was reſigned to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, That you may not believe this blindly, recal to mind a little the Perſons whom you have held for good Men, and conſider narrowly all their Behaviour, that you may ſee, whether they are not guided by their own Wills, even in their pious Works; whether they are not done from their own Inclinations? You will find that this has always been at the Helm to govern all; and that if it were not to pleaſe our ſelves, many good Works would be left undone. For my part, I have remarked this in all the Perſons whom I have known; and I never knew but one Maid <note n="d" place="bottom">This is She who wrote the Two <hi>Letters</hi> in the 42 <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Teſtimony of the Truth.</hi>
                  </note> who was reſigned to God: Nevertheleſs, I have met with thoſe who had the greateſt Reputation for Vertue, and I alwayes perceived, that their Actions, though good, were mingled with Self-love: Which hinders a Reſignation to God: For as long as our Self-will will bear Rule, God cannot have our Submiſſion. <note place="bottom">(b) Pſal. 27. 8. John 1. 9.</note> 
                  <note place="bottom">(c) Acts 10. 34, 35.</note>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:104476:273"/>
Theſe are all dead Works, which ſhall be recompenced only in this World, and not at all in the other. I have ſeen Perſons given to Faſting. Watching, and Prayer, diligent in going to Church, and in relieving the Poor, and yet notwithſtanding of this they ſubjected not their Wills to that of God: But followed their own as much as they could, imagining that they did all for God, while there was no ſuch thing. For if God had govern'd their Wills, they would have done all their Actions, both ſmall and great, in the Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs and Truth of God: From which they were very far eſtranged; and if they had been capable of it, I would have made appear to them, that their beſt Actions were very blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and accompanied with Preſumption, and Self-ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. In this many deceive themſelves, and believe they are in a State of Salvation, though they be very far from it. You muſt not be troubled, Sir, to hear it ſaid, <hi>That there is not ſo much as one Chriſtian in the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> Since it is true, and none are reſigned to God: But we ought to bewail their Blindneſs, and deſire and pray that they may be converted for the Time to come, ſince there is Time for Repentance, and Leiſure to return to God; even to the laſt Moment of our Life. If I ſhould ſay that all Chriſtians are in a State of Salvation, as all theſe falſe Prophets do, their Salvation would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be deſperate: Becauſe every one would reſt on ſuch a dangerous Eſtate. It were far better to tell the Truth, by declaring that they are not in the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that they may ſtrive to recover it, than to flatter them with falſe Words: And it ſhould be more acceptable to them to hear that they are not reſigned to God, if it be moſt true, than to hear that dreadful Sentence, <note n="e" place="bottom">Matth. 25. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>Go ye curſed into Everlaſting Fire,</hi> when they ſhould have thought to hear, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom:</hi> For it will be too late at Death to return to a Dependance upon God: And it is not ſo now. By which you may ſee, Sir, that there is more reaſon to be troubled when we hear them ſay, that Chriſtians are in the way of Salvation, than when they ſay, they are in that of Damnation, when it is true, as it is, becauſe of their Blindneſs: For if I
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:104476:274"/>
did not moſt evidently perceive this, I would not affirm ſuch unpleaſant Things. But I ſhould be without Charity, if I ſhould not declare ſo important Truths, while we are yet living in the Time of Penitence: For I perceive inwardly in my Soul, that the Thoughts, Words, and Actions of Men, are not at all directed by God: For they partake not of his Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth; but on the contrary, they are all full of Self-intereſt, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, or Pleaſures: And notwithſtanding, no Body will willingly be reproved: Every one deſires to continue as he is, without knowing his Fault, and much leſs amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; covering and palliating his Miſeries, and excuſing them as much as he can. So that I ſee no good that can be done for the Converſion of Chriſtians; for they truſt too much to the falſe Perſwaſion of their Salvation. Therefore, I will retire, and bid you Adieu. Not that I am diſpleaſed to be among Men, to whom I am like; but it is becauſe I perceive them to be Enemies of God, and they do not deſire to know it. With which my Heart is very much oppreſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> No Sir, I Act not againſt Charity to my Neighbour: Becauſe I cannot help him, if he will not have Help. I have had but too much Experience of this, that Men will not change their Life, at leaſt the Chriſtians:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104476:274"/>
For I was never acquainted with others, to know if they are as much hardned as thoſe who are called Chriſtians: For thoſe, I ſay, I have done all that could be done to ſhew them the dangerous State in which they live; but I profited very little by it. They love rather to ſee and hear fine Things: But for reſigning themſelves to God, no Body will do it but by Word, which is as far from the Truth as is Heaven from Hell. Every one ſays, that he will be reſigned to God; while in the mean time, no Body will deny his own Will in the leaſt thing; we hear them often ſay. <hi>I will what God wills;</hi> And the leaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction they meet with, does alarum them; and thoſe who promiſe them Salvation, comfort them, and flatter them, ſaying, <hi>That this is to be patient, when they murmur not againſt the Appointments of God, and that they muſt only reſign themſelves, and thereby they ſhall merit much:</hi> As if God were obliged to Recompence their Impatience. For to ſuffer Contradictions, is common and neceſſary, both to the Wicked and to the Good: Becauſe no Body can be free of them in this miſerable World, where every one muſt ſuffer, will he, nill he: But to ſay that we are reſigned to God, when we are only reſigned by force, is a Lie; becauſe this reſignation is a neceſſary thing, when we cannot hinder things to fall out againſt our Will. For to be reſigned to God, we muſt have no more Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, to will this and not to will that: For a Thing that we have reſigned, we do not hold nor poſſeſs it any longer to deſire to uſe it. Reſignation to God, is a total depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon his Diſpoſal, as well for our Soul as for our Body, and for all that concerns us, bridling our own Will in every Thing without willing or deſiring any thing any longer, knowing well that Gods Conduct is always more perfect, than all that we could wiſh for. If it rain, if it be fair, if it be hot, or cold, if we are in Peace, or War, in Adverſity or Proſperity, it matters little, provided we be reſigned to God: It is he who governs all theſe Things, and can never do evil. If our Friends live or dye, what the matter, when God ordains it? Our Life, our Death, muſt not be wiſht for nor deſired by us, becauſe we are not capable enough to judge what is good or evil for us: And to offer to give Laws to God, is to mock him, ſince he underſtands and knows all Things: He ſees far better than we what is good and perfect, becauſe he is the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:104476:275"/>
Wiſdom that cannot be ignorant of any thing, and the Goodneſs that can do no evil, and who orders all Things to a good End, ſo that if we were not void of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, we would not entertain a Thought of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting any Thing that befals us: For all turns to good to him <note n="g" place="bottom">Rom. 8. 28.</note> who is reſigned to God; and though we eſteem it a Happineſs to have good Deſires, yet it is a Thing infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more perfect to have no Deſires, <note n="h" place="bottom">Pſal. 131. 2.</note> with a Dependance upon God: Becauſe a never ſo little mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with this Dependance alwayes hinders the Effect of the Ordinances of God, as if we would be Tutors to him, or give out our Law for doing well. In the mean time we are ſo ſhort ſighted, that we do not diſcern Good from Evil: So that if God ſhould permit that to befal us which we often ask and deſire of him as Good, great Miſchiefs would have come upon us, ſo blind are we in the matter of our Salvation. And yet we will not reſign our Will to that of God but in Word only: So that if I ſhould tell Chriſtians now adays, that they will never be ſaved without reſigning their Wills to that of God, they would ſay, that I damn all the World: For they look on the Salvation and Damnation of Men, as if they could Damn and Save them, whereas it is God only that can Save, and Sin only that can Damn. Therefore by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with Men I will not profit them for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

good obſervance of their Rules; and they thought they did a thing well-pleaſing to God, to maintain the Honour and Profit of their Order; and for my part, I judge this to be ſo far from a Dependance upon God, that I think it is the real Mean to take them off from it: For as long as we are tied to Rules, and Studies to obſerve them well, it is alwayes the Perſon that Acts; and the Care of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Honour and Profit of the Order, is indirectly the ſeeking their own Honour and Profit: Which is not only a Vice, but alſo a falſe Vertue that deceives them to their Ruine; and though I aſſure theſe Perſons that there is no other way of Salvation but that of reſigning their Will to God, yet they will not hear this Note, inſiſting alwayes on the firſt Tune they learned; and they think they are reſigned to God, ſince they have quit the World to enter into a Religious Order, and they apply themſelves to the obſerving of their Rules, they ſay their Offices, and obey their Superiours, chooſing rather to reſign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Men their Equals, than to their God, imagining that he is ſerved with Reverences, Bowings of the Knee, and a great many common Prayers: Without remembring that, 'tis <hi>he who</hi>

outward Geſtures, and will not open his Eyes to diſcover the Truths which would ſave him from Damnation. My Heart is oppreſſed with Grief, Sir, to ſee all the World periſh, and I cannot help it, becauſe they will not receive the Truth. I am very far from deſiring to leave my Neighbour out of diſdain: But I am obliged to leave him becauſe he will not be converted to the Truth, and the Holy Spirit ſayes, We ought not to ſpeak that which does not profit. I ſee the Vice of all Men clear as the Sun, and I do not think that one can be ſaved in the State in which they are at preſent: And yet I cannot ſave them by my Converſation: Becauſe they make not a good uſe of it. If I declare their Vices in particular, they are ill ſatisfied, or at leaſt, they would cover and excuſe them: Which is evidence enough that they will not amend them; and if I point out the Vices indirectly, or in general, then no Body will take it to himſelf, but will excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſome Formality or Reaſoning; and if any one lay them to Heart for a Time, Men and Buſineſs do quickly baniſh theſe good Purpoſes: And ſo nothing is put in practice: My Time is loſt: And my Words are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered uſeleſs, whereas I would be profiting ſomething in converſing with God. Behold theſe are the Cauſes and Reaſons why I will remain alone, not to conceal the Light: For I would have it Lighted for all the World, and I know not a more perfect Contentment in this Life, than the Meeting and Society of many Hearts united in Jeſus Chriſt; as alſo I know nothing more uneaſie than the Conjunction of Perſons of contrary Wills: For I cannot change for them, and they will not change to follow me. This is the Combat.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That at leaſt ſome would change to follow her, and to ſave their Souls.</hi>

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, You would be greatly aſtoniſhed to ſee the way the World would take to change. Every one, forſooth, would reſign his Will to God, provided he govern it according to their own Inclinations. God muſt accommodate himſelf to them, and they will not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themſelves to God. Even ſo, many would indeed follow me, it ſo be withal they may follow alſo their own Will. Which cannot be done: For he who follows it, <note n="n" place="bottom">Rom. 8. 8.</note>

is the Enemy of God, and if I am his Friend, how could I dwell with thoſe who are his Enemies without a continual Conſtraint, Contradiction and Debate? All their Actions proceeding from this Self-love would be blameable. If I do not reprove them, I am unfaithful to God; and if I reprove them, I become their Enemy; and withal they will not amend, but will become rather worſe, applying themſelves to remark if they can find any defects in my Actions for a Revenge; and if they do not find any, they will endeavour at leaſt to deſpiſe my Intentions by meaſuring them according to their Line, and interpreting them according to their Sentiments. And thus they will offend God, and trouble my Repoſe without any profit. Therefore I foreſeeing this, would do very ill to aſſociate with any Body, unleſs I had aſſurance before-hand that they would reſign themſelves truly to God: For elſe this would be to render my ſelf a Slave, and others miſerable, without any Contentment: And as God takes his delight and pleaſure with Souls whoſe Wills are united to his, ſo he thruſts behind him thoſe who are not in the Unity of his Divine Will; even ſo ought I to thruſt away from me thoſe who will not truly reſign their Wills to that of God; becauſe it is a kind of Martyrdom to live together bodily being divided in Will: As it would be a Paradiſe of Delights to live with Perſons who have their Wills equally reſigned to that of God. Which makes the true Paradiſe and perfect Contentment: For God <note n="o" place="bottom">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note> and theſe Souls would be but one and the ſame Thing.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That ſhe ought to aſſociate her ſelf with ſincere Perſons; and that her Company would be of great Advantage to them for attaining to this Reſignation to God.</hi>

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> It is true, Sir, in caſe their Will were truly good: But all that I remark in theſe Perſons who would follow me and be ſaved, is nothing but <hi>Wouldings,</hi> not <hi>abſolute Wills.</hi> They ſay, they would be converted, they would follow me, and be reſigned to God; while in effect they do neither the one nor the other before God: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Wouldings proceed only from their own Will. They would be converted, being afraid of Damnation;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104476:277"/>
they would follow me that they may be ſaved; and reſign themſelves to God only in Word; or as long as the Will of God goes along with theirs. Lo this is the good Will that I have experienced in thoſe who would follow me, and even at preſent I know no other: For I perceive very often that they aim yet at their own Intereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Honour, or Pleaſures. So that it they were with me, I would reprove all their Actions, none excepted: Which would be very irkſome to me, and troubleſom to them, yea even inſupportable. For ſo long as they are not truly deſigned to God, they live ſtill according to their Natural Senſes, which will not ſuffer Reproofs; and Nature is ſo Proud, that it will not acknowledge its Fault, nor ſuffer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem, preſuming to be more wiſe and accompliſhed than its equals; ſo that all that I ſhould do to theſe Perſons, would only be to diſquiet and vex them, becauſe they are ſo in love with their Vices and Imperfections, that they even deſpiſe thoſe that do not follow them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that I ſhould live in a continual Conſtraint among others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I could not ſpeak according to my Sentiments: For they are not capable of them; and I could not ſhew them their Faults, becauſe they preſume to be as wiſe as I, neither could I be profitable in their Company, when they will not follow the Spirit that guides me, but every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in their own Senſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will not ſubmit themſelves to the Truth, without which Submiſſion no Body can attain to this Reſignation. The neceſſity of this Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance muſt be known, or elſe they will not ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it: For if they ſee not the neceſſity of doing this, every one will believe he is in a State of Salvation in whatſoever Condition he be; and thus every one will inſenſibly periſh; and my Company could not ſave them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſince God has given me Liberty, wherefore ſhould I continue a Slave to Men, when I cannot be profitable to them for the Glory of God?</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That God was pleaſed to undergo the Slavery of our humane Nature for the Salvation of his Creatures, and that ſhe ought to be furniſhed with the ſame Spirit that Jeſus Chriſt had.</hi>

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, By his Grace I am ſo, and I do ſo earneſtly deſire to ſee all Men ſaved, that I would willingly dye for every one of them, if I had as many Lives: But I am well aſſured that my Converſation, my Words, and my

Life cannot ſave them if they do not reſign themſelves of their own free Will to the Will of God. Though all the <note n="p" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 11. &amp; 15. 1.</note> Saints, both Angels and Men pray together, they will never procure the Salvation of ſo much as one Soul, unleſs it reſign its Will to God. For this is a neceſſary Thing: The Saints may indeed pray, and the Angels ſolicite, and all Men help any who has withdrawn from God to obtain this Dependance upon him: But all this will avail him nothing if he do not of his own Free-will truly yield up his Will to God, and deny his Self-will. Very few comprehend this: Nevertheleſs, this is an Eternal Truth that will never change: For God created Man only for this.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That I my ſelf did not well comprehend this Neceſſity of Depending upon God; entreating that ſhe would explain it to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Be attentive, and conſider my Diſcourſe well: Perhaps it will give you ſome Light in this Matter. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider firſt that God ſaid, <note n="q" place="bottom">Gen. 1. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Let us make Man after our Image and Likeneſs:</hi> This was not ſaid in vain, but it had its full effect, and Man <note n="r" place="bottom">Gen. 1. 27.</note> was made after the Image and Likeneſs of God. Conſider a little, Sir, wherein you ſhall find the Likeneſs of God in Man? It is not in his Natural Body: For God is a pure Spirit; and has nothing that reſembles a Body: Neither can this Likeneſs to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be found in the Animal Soul of Man; becauſe this Animal Soul has no more than the Beaſts, ſo far is it from reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling God; for it extends no farther than to give Life to the Body for a certain Time; whereas the Life of God is Eternal, without Beginning, and without End; and a Temporal Thing cannot reſemble an Eternal. Therefore this Likeneſs of Man to God, cannot be found in the Animal Soul of Man, no more than in his Body: And if one would ſeek for it in the Faculties of the Soul, which are the Memory, the Underſtanding, the Will, we ſhall find that theſe Three Faculties have no reſemblance to God: For they are imperfect and limited: Which God cannot be: Our Memory is very frail, and ſometimes does not remember on the Morrow what we did the preceding
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:104476:278"/>
Day: Our Underſtanding is in like manner ſubject to great defects, taking Falſe Things often for True: And our Will is ſometimes ſo inſolent, that if it were not bridled by Reaſon, it would often precipitate us into irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Miſcheifs. All which Things are in nothing like to God, ſince he is without any Imperfections or Defects, perfect in all Things, and without Bounds or Limits, whereas the Faculties of our Soul are all limited, as the Faculties of the Souls of Beaſts are, who have ſometimes a better Memory than Men: For if a Dog or a Horſe be ill uſed in any Place, he will remember it for a long time: They have alſo a Will to do, and to leave what they are naturally enclined to, though it be bounded and limited as well as that of Man; for neither the one nor the other can put their Will in Execution, becauſe they have not the power to do all that they can deſire: Which God can do in all Things. By which we ſee that Man is not in any of theſe Things like to God: For his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is not capable of comprehending any thing but what he ſees, or hears, as are the Beaſts alſo. So that by the Faculties of the Soul of Man we cannot perceive that he is like to God, ſince he has an Eternal Memory, an unlimited Underſtanding, and an unchangeable Will: To which the Faculties of the Souls of Men are not at all to be compared. Wherein then can it be ſaid that God has made Man like to himſelf? Search into it with me, Sir: You will find that he is like to God in nothing, but in his Free-will: And as God has this Free Power over all Things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo he gave to Man this Free Power over his own Will, that he might diſpoſe of it as it ſhould pleaſe him; in this alone, he is the Image of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Becauſe this Liberty is to him Eternal and Independent: As God is Soveraign, independent from all Things: So Man is Soveraign of his own Free-will, independent from all Things, except that he acknowledge that this Liberty is given him of God, that he neither has nor holds it of himſelf: As God has and holds all Things of himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Otherwiſe, Man is a Deity by his Free-will, for by it he can do and leave any thing: For God <note n="s" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 29.</note> never retakes what he has once given, neither will he ever retake the Free-will of Man; but will let them enjoy it to all Eternity, as being an Eternal Gift:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:104476:278"/>
It will never end as long as God ſhall be God: Man ſhall have his free Will, both during this Life, and alſo in the other in Paradiſe or Hell. He ſhall have through all this Divine Quality of a Free-will which God gave him when he created him. He ſhall not take it from him in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; becauſe this is the only quality that Man has, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is capable of being united to God, all the reſt being only bounded and natural, are not at all-capable of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching a ſupream Deity.</p>

                  <p> Speaks of the Free-will of Man; in which alone he is like to God: That God has given it to Man for ever: That he has annexed to it all his future Graces: And that never any Good nor any Evil will befal any Body, in Time or in Eternity, but by Free-will, according as we ſhall yield it up or not, to a Dependance upon and Reſignation to God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That we had been taught, That Man had indeed Free-will when he was created: But that by Sin it was ſo loſt, that he could not uſe it any longer to do good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Free-will ſhall never be diminiſhed, but will continue alwayes ſuch as it was given to the firſt Man in his Creation: For God can never repent of the Works <note n="t" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 29.</note> that he has made. If Man feel that he is unable to do good, this is not the defect of his Free-will, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to him ſtill entire; but the defect is, that his Sins have taken from him the power to do good, by <note n="u" place="bottom">Eph. 4. 18.</note> the Blindneſs they have brought into his Soul, which hinders the Diſcovery of the Means how to depart from evil and to do good. The Soul being blinded by its Sin, loſt the Light of Truth; and in this darkneſs cannot find the way
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:104476:279"/>
to return to good. This ſhe attributed to the Weakneſs of her Free-will, flattering her ſelf to excuſe her own Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, or indirectly to accuſe God that he does not give her ſufficient Grace to do well. Which is a great Calumny againſt God, who never beſtowed ſo many Graces upon any Creature as he did on Man, having made him alone a depending Deity, becauſe he would have one kind of Creature with whom he might <hi>take his delight</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 31.</note>: Therefore he endued him with this Divine Liberty, that his Delight might be compleat on the ſide of both the Lovers. This is not a ſmall Grace which would be ſufficient to enable a Man to do well. For if all Men whatſoever would return to a Dependance upon God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would certainly recover the ſame Grace and Liberty that <hi>Adam</hi> had before his Sin: Becauſe God continues ſtill in the ſame Will to take his Delight with Men, that he had when he created them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Becauſe he never <note n="x" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 17.</note> changes: For he is immutable.

                  <hi>I admired this Diſcourſe,</hi> That God would grant to any Man whatſoever the ſame Graces that he gave to <hi>Adam</hi> in his Creation, provided he reſigned his Will to that of God, <hi>asking her how this was poſſible ſince the Curſe of Sin?</hi>

It is ſaid indeed, that the Grace of God is loſt by ſinning: Not that this Grace is taken from Man on Gods part; but only that Man, of his Free-will, will not ſubject himſelf to God, but will be at his own diſpoſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And by this Mean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he falls into all ſort of Evils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from which he ſhould be delivered, if he would yield up to God this Free-will, repenting that he himſelf had uſed it.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> It is true, Sir, all good comes from God; and there can be no other good but he. All the <note n="e" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 17.</note> good that Men can do, muſt come from him; but know this, that ſince the firſt Graces which he gave Man in creating him, he will give him no other <note n="f" place="bottom">Iſa. 1. 19.</note> but as far as Man of his Free-will ſhall depend upon his God, and no farther. If he will wholly depend upon him, he ſhall have Graces in abundance; and if he will onely in part depend upon God, he ſhall ſtill have Graces in part in proportion to his Dependance. For Example: One will depend upon God as to his Health; and aſſuredly he will ſuffer his Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Diſeaſes with Patience: Which will be the Grace he has merited by yielding up his Will to God as to his Health: Another will ſubmit to God as to Temporal Goods; and he ſhall have the Grace of Poverty of Spirit: Another will ſubmit to God in the Matter of his Honour; and he ſhall have the Grace to ſuffer Contempt willing: And ſo of the reſt. Since God gave the firſt Graces to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104476:280"/>
                  <hi>Adam,</hi> he will not encreaſe them to him but ſo far as his Free-will ſhall be ſubjected to God, and no farther: Becauſe he has ſhewn the effect of his Goodneſs and Almighty Power towards Man in creating him ſo full of Graces and Prerogatives, taking him out of <hi>Nothing,</hi> where he could have merited nothing. God having abſolute Dominion over this <hi>Nothing,</hi> beſtows on him all the Graces that he pleaſed, becauſe he found no reſiſtance; and ſo he lead his Will to good, having engraven in his Soul a good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and a reaſonable Underſtanding to know the Dependance he had upon God, from whom he ſaw he had received Being, and all Things. An Inſtinct to good, and the Love of his God, were engraven in the Marrow of his Bones, Theſe are the Qualities that God gave Man before he was capable of reſiſting God: But ſince he reſiſted ſo many Graces, and would retake to himſelf the Free-will that God had given him, to uſe it independently from God, he has loſt his Graces, and obliged him not to beſtow more upon him, but as far as he will yield up his own Will to God, having by this Mean bounded the Grace of God at his Will. Not that Man is capable of regulating or bounding the Graces of God, who is ſtill abſolute Soveraign of all Things; but becauſe it was his abſolute Deſire to give to Man his Free-will <note n="h" place="bottom">Pſal. 110. 3.</note>, which alone renders him capable of being united to God: And if he had received only a Limited Will, he would have had no Divine Quality for God to take his Delight with him: For that Two Things may find Contentment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, there muſt ſtill be a Proportion or Sympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. A Horſe cannot be contented or pleaſed with a piece of Iron; nor a Dog with Marble, nor a Swine with a Precious Stone: Becauſe all theſe Things are diſproportioned to the Nature of theſe Beaſts, who cannot Love nor take Pleaſure in Objects ſo unlike their Natures. Even ſo God cannot take his Delight with any Creature of a bounded Will, he being an infinite God, There muſt be in Man ſome infinite Quality by which he may unite himſelf to God: And if he had not given him this Will eternally Free, Man ſhould have had nothing in him ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetical with God, who nevertheleſs would make a<note place="bottom">(<hi>g</hi>) <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 14.</note>

Creature with whom he might take <note n="i" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 31.</note> his pleaſure: Therefore he gave him this Divine and Reaſonable Soul with <note n="k" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 29.</note> an Eternal <note n="l" place="bottom">Eccl. 15. 14—17.</note> Liberty, which ſhall never be taken from him, do Man what he pleaſes: Becauſe God never changes his Decrees <note n="m" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 17.</note>; and if he forced Man to good after he had given him this Liberty, he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain that which he would have to be free, and ſhould renverſe the Order that he had ſo wiſely Eſtabliſhed, and ſhould take from Man the moſt Precious Thing he had received: For laying aſide this Free-will, he would be but like the Beaſts. Therefore God will never direct our Will, but when we ſhall yield it up to him: though he be Almighty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I entreated her to tell me, How our Will ſhall be eternal; and if we ſhall even be free to do evil in Paradiſe, or good in Hell?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> No, Sir, we can never do evil in Paradiſe: Becauſe there we ſhall enjoy the continual Preſence of God, during which we can never ſin, though it were even in this Miſerable Life: As long as our Soul abides there in the Preſence of God, it can no more ſin than if it had no Liberty: And if ſome Saints have fallen into Sins, this has certainly been when they have ſtrayed from this Preſence of God; and during this wandering, they might ſin: Becauſe the Objects of Evil were yet preſent with them, and they reſting on them, might eaſily fall. But in Paradiſe our Spirit can no more wander, or be diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from God; becauſe he ſhall be continually and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with us, ſenſibly and viſibly, without any interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neither can we be diverted by evil Objects, becauſe all that ſhall be in Paradiſe ſhall be holy; and all the Bleſſed ſhall viſibly and ſenſibly poſſeſs God, ſo that we ſhall ſee God in every one of them. All theſe Things will render us impeccable; and though we ſhall ſtill have Free-will, yet it ſhall never be led to evil in the midſt of ſuch Good; and God to whom we ſhall entirely yield it up, will ſtraitly <note n="o" place="bottom">John 17. 21, 23.</note> unite it to his own, ſo that it can no more be led to evil than that of God is, for it ſhall be<note place="bottom">(<hi>n</hi>) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 8.</note>

united to his in ſo indiſſoluble a Bond of Love that it will be impoſſible to ſeparate it for ſo much as one Moment, they being no longer but one and the ſame Thing. Thus ſhall our Free-will rule in Paradiſe. Even ſo in Hell our Will ſhall never be bounded; becauſe God having given it free; it ſhall eternally perſiſt in its Liberty: But whereas this Will would not ſubmit to God in this Life, but was led to evil of our own Will, and ſince Death, remains in the ſame deſire of doing evil; we continue in theſe deſires to all Eternity, without ever having the Will to do good: Becauſe we are farther removed than ever from all ſorts of good Objects, but joyned and attended with all ſorts evils. The continual Preſence of Devils prompts our Wills continually and without intermiſſion to do Evil; and the Company of ſo great a number of damned Souls who uſe their Free-will to do all manner of evil, doth continually draw us to imitate and follow them: So that having never any thought towards good, we can never have the Will to do good, even as the Devils cannot, who have alſo retained their Free-will, which ſerves continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to encreaſe their Evils, their Will being engaged to perſiſt in doing all the evil they can: For this cauſe they tempt Men ſo ſtrongly that they may have them in their damnable Company: Not that they hope the number of the Damned will eaſe their Pains, on the contrary, they well know, that it will encraſe them the more; but becauſe their Free-will is bent to evil; and this Free-will being eternal, is eternally bent to do evil: For a free Quality, ſuch as Free-will is, will always act in good or evil; according to the Object towards which it bends. And their Evils are ſo far from being bounded by Damnation that they encreaſe eternally; becauſe of their eternal Will, which cannot be bounded. This Free-will which is bent to evil, has given a Malignity to all the Creatures, which Malignity ſhall remain alſo <note n="p" place="bottom">Mat. 25. 46.</note> eternally: Becauſe this Malignant Free-will, being a Divine and Eternal Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, of neceſſity makes its Works eternal: So that theſe miſerable Souls ſhall have upon them all the Malignity of all the Creatures to all Eternity, as being the Work of their Hands.</p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:104476:282"/>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>If the Devils had alſo their Free-will, and if God could not bound them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir, the Devils ſhall have their Free-will to all Eternity as well as Men: For God <note n="q" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 29.</note> never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts what he has once given. The Angels were intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Beings capable of being united to God, which Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city could not be given them but by a Divine Quality, which is that Eternal Liberty, without which they could not have Sympathy with God: For Angels as well as Men are but ſimple Creatures, who can have no proportion with their Creator: Therefore he has given both to the one and the other of theſe Creatures a Divine Soul and an Eternal Free-will, that by theſe Divine Qualities, they might have a Capacity of Loving an Eternal God. Now the wretched Inclination of this Free-will reſiſting the Deſigns that God had in bleſſing them ſo advantagiouſly with Divine Gifts, would needs uſe this Liberty to apply it to the doing evil inſtead of following the good for which this Liberty was given them. Notwithſtanding, God will never retake thoſe Divine Qualities that he has once given them: The Divine Soul, and Eternal Liberty, will never end: For all that is Divine is Eternal; and God cannot bound them, becauſe he cannot be changeable in his Gifts, nor can he take away what he has been pleaſed to give. If it be Eſtabliſhed among Men to lay no longer claim to a Thing given, how much more ought we to hold that God lays no claim to the Free-will of Devils and Men, to whom he voluntarily gave it. This Gift only makes the Souls of Men and alſo thoſe of Devils to be immortal: For otherwiſe both the one and the other would have been reduced to nothing as ſoon as they ſinned; for God being the Source of all good, can never do evil, nor give eternal Pains: But the great Bleſſings which he gave his Creatures in giving them a Divine Soul and Free-will, have ſerved the Devil for his Eternal Miſery, as they will do to wicked Men, who if they will apply this Divine Liberty to do Evil, they ſhall bring upon themſelves all the evil they ſhall do, which will be eternal, as proceeding from their eternal Will. If Man had had only an Animal Soul, and a Limited Will, their Evils would have ended with themſelves, as thoſe of the Beaſts do, who do evil or good by their
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104476:282"/>
bounded Will, and all their Works, ſuch as they are, do end with their Animal Soul, which is nothing but tranſient and temporal, If Men had not a Divine Soul and an Eternal Will, they would wholly do the ſame: For they are not in Qualities different from the Beaſts, except by their Divine Qualities, which render them Immortal and Eternal: For ſince God eſtabliſhed them in a Divine Soul and Will, they can never end, being Eternities, as God, except that they had a Beginning, and God was incomprehenſibly without Beginning, and to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>If the Souls of the Bleſſed in Paradiſe could do as much good as they would; and in like manner, if the Souls of Devils and of the Damned could do as much evil as they would?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir, For their Wills have no Bounds, neither the one nor the other. Have you never heard ſay, that in Paradiſe there are infinite Goods? That is to ſay, That thoſe Free-wills which are in Paradiſe will never ceaſe to do good, even infinitely: For there can be no Barenneſs with God; but a production of continual Goods, which ſhall never have an end: Thus the Bleſſed ſhall produce all the Good that their Free-will ſhall deſire. And in like manner the Wills of Devils and Damned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men ſhall produce as much Evil as their Free-will ſhall deſire. They ſhall not be able to do evil according to their Wills to the Men yet Living on the Earth; much leſs to the Bleſſed in Heaven: Becauſe theſe can reſiſt them by their Free-will, which is enclined to good: The Free-will of the Good having as much power to do well, as the Free-will of the Wicked to do evil. They are both free to do in themſelves all the good and evil that they will; but the Evil cannot take hold of the good Wills of others no more than the good of the Good can profit the Wicked: and the evil of the Wicked cannot hurt the Good; but in ſo far as both the one and the other give the Conſent of their Free-will: Which indeed may be done during this Life: Becauſe Man is yet in an uncertain State of Salvation or Damnation; and even to his Laſt Breath his Will may be led to good and to evil. Therefore it is ſaid, that <note n="r" place="bottom">Mat. 11. 11.</note> the leaſt in Paradiſe is greater than the moſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:104476:283"/>
holy among Men; becauſe of the uncertainty of their Bleſſedneſs; they being ſtill in danger of conſenting to the evil Suggeſtion of the Devil, or the Example of ſome wicked Man, being here alwayes in peril, for we are ſtill encompaſſed with our <note n="s" place="bottom">1 Pet. 5. 8.</note> Enemies, who do all the evil they pleaſe by their Free-will: But we may alſo reſiſt it by ours: For neither Devils nor any wicked Men whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can ever have power over our Free-will: For it will ſtill be left free to us, and we may conſent to or reject the Temptations of the Devil and wicked Men, they not being able to hurt us without our Conſent. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder them to tempt us, ſince they have their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and they cannot hinder us to reſiſt them, for we in like manner have our Free-will. But the Souls of Devils and the Damned do certainly as much evil as they can, becauſe they have let paſs all occaſions of doing good, and cannot now have any good Will, for they have deſtin'd it to evil: But the Souls of the Bleſſed cannot be moleſted by the Devils and wicked Men: For their Will is abſolutely deſtinated to good, which deſtination is an oppoſition to all ſort of Evil. So that the <note n="t" place="bottom">Luke 16. 25, 26.</note> good of the Bleſſed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not touch the evils of the Miſerable, nor theſe on the other hand the goods of the Bleſſed: For every one has made a choice of good and evil for Eternity; and cannot repent of it, ſince they are paſſed out of this World. For in whatſoevr <note n="u" place="bottom">Eccleſ. 11. 3.</note> State Man ſhall dye, he ſhall abide in it: If he dye in the eternal Reſolution of good, he ſhall do good to all Eternity; and if he dye in the Reſolution of doing evil, he ſhall do evil to all Eternity. And he muſt look for no other Sentence but what he has made up for himſelf by his own Free-will.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That many holy Perſons were ſometimes abuſed by Devils and wicked Men, though they had not contributed to Evil by their Free will: And it is ordinarily ſaid, that the Devil has no more Power than God gives him; nor yet wicked Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> No body in the World has hitherto under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Works of God; but every one judges of his Works according to their ſhort Sight: But now that we are
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:104476:283"/>
arrived at the Fulneſs of Time, <note n="x" place="bottom">Jer. 31. 24.</note> he will give the Knowledge of his Procedure as to Men. You ſhall be perſwaded of this, if you take good heed to my Diſcourſe, and peruſe a little the Holy Fathers who ſpoke of the Grace of God, and of all his Works. You muſt confeſs that the Diſcourſes of a Child are much more clear and intelligible than all the Doctrines of theſe great Men: Becauſe the Hour is now come that all theſe Things ſhall be fully manifeſted, and nothing ſhall be any longer hid from Men of the Deſigns that God has concerning them. You tell me that many Saints have been abuſed by the Devil and the Wicked, without having contributed to it by their Free-will: Which is true: For God holding the Will of theſe Saints in his Power, becauſe they had yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up their Free-will to God, he enclines their Will to good or neceſſary Sufferings. Not that God gives the Devil, or the Wicked, this Power to abuſe his Servants, by his independent Permiſſion, out of his abſolute Power; but he permits <note n="y" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 1. 12. &amp; 2. 6.</note> the Devil and the Wicked to tempt the Saints <note n="z" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 1. 21. &amp; 2. 10.</note> with their Conſent: For they having yielded up their Free-will into Gods Hand, he leads it alwayes to good. And ſeeing that Temptations and Perſecution were good for ſome of the ſaid Saints, he enclined their Will to deſire them, and willingly to ſuffer them: Though in the ſenſual part they felt ſome Repugnance, the Divine Soul and Free-will were <note n="a" place="bottom">2 Cor. 12. 10.</note> joyful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with them, ſeeing theſe Evils befel them by the Will of God, to which theirs was united and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable: And thus they ſuffered with their Free-will: Not that God permits the Devil to do evil to follow his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: For he can never conſent <note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. 5. 5. Syr. 15. 21.</note> to any evil; but he permits him for the purging or honouring of his Servants, who deſire with all their Heart to be purged or honoured that they may be made ſo much the more agreeable to God when he permits theſe Sufferings <note n="c" place="bottom">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note> as the true Means of their Perfection: For when there is no need of them for their Perfection, the Evils which Devils and wicked Men would do them cannot touch them, as it has
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:104476:284"/>
often fallen out that Poyſon <note n="d" place="bottom">Mark 16. 18.</note>, or other Miſchiefs done to Saints, has done them no hurt, To ſhew that the Devil and the Wicked are ſtill free on their part to do evil, without any other Permiſſion from God but the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will that he had once given them; but that the Free-will of the good may alwayes reſiſt them, and hinder any from coming near them, except it be expedient for the Glory of God, or their own Perfection: Then, though the Soul abandoned to God ſhould not ſee the evils that the Wicked would do it, and ſhould not formally oppoſe it ſelf to them; God who ſtill <note n="e" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 18. &amp; 121. 4.</note> watches for the good of his true Children, will never permit any evil to befal them, but what is expedient for them: Not that he will bound the Will of thoſe Malignant ones that they may not be able to do evil to the good; but he will move the Wills of the good to withdraw from them, or to ſhun the Places and Occaſions where the evil may befal them, or he will give ſo lively a Faith, that Poiſon or other Evils ſhall not take hold to hurt his Servants, whom he <note n="f" place="bottom">Pſal. 17. 8.</note> keeps as the Apple of his Eyes. Thus it is that God carries as to us, doing alwayes good, and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to evil, nor yet limiting the Free-will that he gave to Angels, and Devils, and Men, both good and bad, every one ſhall enjoy it to all Eternity without hindrance, either in the good or in the wicked. Therefore on all occaſions we judge amiſs of the Works of God, when we believe that he permits <note n="g" place="bottom">Eccl. 15. 21.</note> evil in any whoſoever. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from our ignorance of the Excellency of the free choice and the Dignity of the Free-will that God has given to Men; imagining that he governs them as Slaves, by force, or by his abſolute Authority: Which is not at all ſo: For if he gave to all Creatures that are ſubjected to Man, when he created them, an amiable Inclination to acquieſce in and follow alwayes the Will of Man, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, that he might ſerve him with agreeable Delight; wherefore ſhould he not incline Man to follow the Will of God freely and without conſtraint?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> Speaks of the Diſputes that are about Free-will and Predeſtination.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That this Point of the Free-will of Man was debated: That all acknowledged he was created in full Liberty; but that ſince his Sin he could no longer do good without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Grace from God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I believe I have told you many times, that God never changes: Whether Men ſin or not, he is not therefore moved. Free-will has remained with Men ſince his Sin <note n="h" place="bottom">Deut. 30. 19.</note> as well as before it. If he deprived not the Devils nor damned Souls of it, why ſhould he take it from Man ſince his Sin, eſpecially ſince he would pardon him, and yet take his Delight with him? Muſt he not after his Sin have had the ſame Divine Soul and Free-will as before <note n="i" place="bottom">Pſal. 110. 3.</note>? For elſe he could never more have been led to good, nor be united to God if this Divine Quality were taken from him or diminiſhed. What more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Grace could be given him than to let him enjoy his Free-will after his Sin? A greater Grace could not be given him than this Divine Liberty, with which he might accompliſh his Penitence, and do all other kind of good: For if his Penitence had not been accompanied with this Free-will, it could never have ſatisfied an offended God. This Divine Quality was needful to ſatisfie for the Offence done to his Divinity: And without having the Liberty to do good, by what means could he recover the Grace of God? If God had not left Man to his Liberty to do good, never any Perſon would have been ſaved, neither <hi>Adam,</hi> nor any others: For without this Liberty of doing good <hi>Adam</hi> could never have repented, nor all Men who have fallen in him. For none who are born ſince would have been free to do good, or to beg the Grace of God for fulfilling their Penitence, but every one would have been bent to Evil; ſince they had no other Liberty but to do evil: Of neceſſity they muſt have given themſelves to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:104476:285"/>
evil, ſince they would not have had the Liberty to do good. I am an Enemy to all theſe Diſputes; and would wiſh that all Men would ſubmit their Judgment to the Works of God.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That theſe Diſputes were not ended; but many held that God had decreed one Maſſe of Elect, and another of Reprobates, and that it will fall out ſo, do Men what they pleaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> How cruel is it to hear, Sir! That God ſhould deſtinate a Maſſe of Reprobates! This is as if they would ſay, that God is wicked from the Creation of Men; for if he were not he would not have created a Maſſe of Reprobates to be miſerable to all Eternity do what they will. This neceſſity of being damned reflects upon God. For if he had not created them to Damnation, they could not be miſerable to all Eternity: And God could not create them for Damnation but out of pure Malice; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide this, he would rather have left them in nothing, than to create them for Reprobation. Truly, Sir, a greater Blaſphemy cannot be uttered againſt God than this; for it ſhocks all his Qualities of Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth, which are his Eternal Qualities <note n="q" place="bottom">Pſal. 33. 4, 5. Pſal. 89. 15.</note> without which he can never do any thing. If he had created one part of Men for Damnation, he ſhould not have done a juſt thing; ſince theſe Reprobates did not merit Damnation before they had a Being, and could not in Juſtice be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated without having deſerved it. Neither could God exerciſe his Goodneſs in determining the Damnation of any: Since this Damnation is the greateſt Evil in the World: How ſhould he be good in doing ſo great evil to Men? And how ſhould he be true in reprobating thoſe of whom he ſayes, that <note n="m" place="bottom">Prov. 8. 31.</note> his delight is to be with them ſince they are the Children of Men? He muſt want Judgment and Reaſon who believes that God created a Maſſe of damned. The Superſtition of Chriſtians muſt have invented this blaſpheming againſt God to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe their Authority, and to ſhew that God alſo uſes Authority over Men as they will uſe it over their like: This is againſt Truth: For God is not partial, nor will he ever uſe Paſſion towards any. All theſe Words and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes

                  <hi>the Whore in the Revelation</hi> is full: For I do not believe that any other Sect or Nation ſayes that Reprobation is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined of God.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>What I ought to believe in this Matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I might not blaſpheme againſt God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, We ought to go to the Original of Man, and ſee in his Beginning, how he was created. God took not two Maſſes of Earth to create the one of them for Salvation, and the other for Damnation: But only one Maſſe of Earth, with which he created one Man only for Salvation <note n="o" place="bottom">Wiſd. 11. 25. 4 Eſdr. 8. 59.</note>, creating in him all the Men that ever were or ſhall be: He created them all in general in the State of Innocence and Salvation, and for this end gave abundance of Graces, both Spiritual and Bodily, and that equally to all, without exception of any; giving to all a Divine Soul and a Free-will, that they might be capable to do all manner of good: And ſeeing God created all Men in <hi>Adam,</hi> he could not have created any for Reprobation; but all for Salvation, none excepted. This being ſo, as it truly is, no Body could be created for Damnation, as they would very unreaſonably make it be believed: For if ſome muſt be neceſſarily Damned or Saved, they ſhould not have Free-will: Which none can deny: For all Men received a Divine Soul and Free-will in <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the firſt of the Elect, and after him all his Poſterity. For God never will'd <note n="p" place="bottom">2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> that any ſhould periſh, but that they Live. And ſeeing he wills that they Live, how could he create them for Reprobation; ſince there can never be any Contradiction in God? Never believe, Sir, that any was created for Damnation: But if any damn themſelves, it is <note n="q" place="bottom">Prov. 1. 25.</note> contrary to the Deſigns of God, and becauſe <note n="r" place="bottom">Pſal. 81. 12, 13, 14.</note> they will needs uſe their Free-will to apply it to evil: For if they followed the Will of God, and the good <note n="s" place="bottom">Prov. 4. 23.</note> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that he has given them, they could never damn or deſtroy themſelves, even though they had ſinned: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God deſires not <note n="t" place="bottom">Ezek. 33. 11.</note> the Death of a Sinner, but that he ſhould be Converted and Live. By which we ſee that God does not Reprobate the Sinner more than the Juſt;

but deſires that all ſhould be Saved, and none Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as they Maintain. But Men now <note n="u" place="bottom">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2, 3, &amp;c.</note> being full of Vices and Paſſions of Love and Hatred, without any thing of Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Truth, they would fain give Authority to their Malice by making a God <note n="x" place="bottom">Exod. 31. 1.</note> to go before them in the Matter of their Paſſions. And as they in taking Dominon over Men, do according to their Inclinations diſgrace or favour them; they would make God as partial, as they know they are themſelves, ſaying, that he damns ſome and ſaves others according to his Pleaſure. Which will never be. For God is no more ſubject to Paſſions than to change. We ought alwayes to come to the Truth, and retake the Original and the Eſſence of Things, without amuſing our ſelves with the Diſcourſes of Men, who ſay and do according to their Advantages; and if they are not enclined to uſe their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will aright, they would fain lay the blame on God, ſaying, <hi>They have not his Grace,</hi> or, <hi>They are not of the Number of thoſe who are predeſtinated to his Salvation:</hi> Which makes a great many periſh through Sloth, or Negligence, ſaying, If they are Elected they ſhall certainly be ſaved; and if they are Reprobated, they ſhall certainly be damned, do what they will. This is contrary to the Truth. For God did not create<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Man a kind of limited Creature. And though it ſeems ſometimes as if God determined good or evil Fortunes, yet nevertheleſs it is not true. For he will not determine againſt the Free-will of Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who ſhall ſtill be capable of uſing it well or ill. But becauſe our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is bounded, it can comprehend only the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents it ſees, without diſcovering their Sources or Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. For Example: We ſee a Man become poor though he Labour, and is no Prodigal. We ſay immediately; it is God that afflicts him by evil Fortune; while it is for want of Foreſight or Management in his Affairs.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That it was not believed that God created Man for Damnation; but that God Reprobated Man after his Sin, which had undone them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, You will find this abſurd: For if all Men were created in <hi>Adam,</hi> they are all <note n="y" place="bottom">Rom. 5. 12.</note> alſo fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> and conſequently there could not be a Maſſe of Predeſtinated after Sin: Becauſe all in general were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:104476:286"/>
and Damned by the ſame Sin of <hi>Adam:</hi> He having ſinned with his Free-will, there was no longer any thing ſound in it: For if he had not given a full Conſent of his Will to Sin, none would have been Damned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Imperfection of his full Conſent; as we do not commit a Mortal Sin when our Will does not give full Conſent to Evil; and no Body doubts but <hi>Adam</hi> gave the full conſent of his Will in diſobeying God; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he is damned, and all Men with him, none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: For he could not have a divided Will, nor one part ſound, and another damn'd: Becauſe there was but one Man only; and he had but one Will, in which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Will of all Men that ſhould ever ariſe from him. So that God could not pitch in him upon one Maſſe of Reprobates, and one of Saved: Becauſe there was no longer Salvation in him after his Sin, nor in all other Men his Poſterity. All were reduced into this damned Maſſe, without any exception: And as none could be damned before Sin, ſo none could be ſaved after it: Becauſe in <hi>Adam</hi> all Men in general were contained, who have ſtill ſhared in his Happineſs and Miſeries, his Favours and Diſgraces, his Pleaſures and his Penitence: All Men being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably united to the will of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Father of all living.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>How it could be that ſome Men are damned and ſome ſaved, ſince there was ſo ſtrait an union between the Will of Adam and that of other Men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> This comes to paſs, Sir, when every Man comes to the uſe of Reaſon. He goes out of the Power and Will of <hi>Adam,</hi> and is put into his own full Liberty, as <hi>Adam</hi> was at his Creation, with this difference only, that Men have in them the Malignity of Sin: Which <hi>Adam</hi> had not when he was created; but only an Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to good: As to the reſt, all Men in general, are put, (when they are capable of Reaſon) into the ſame Eſtate wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was created, with the ſame Divine Soul, wholly free and reaſonable, capable of being led to good or evil, as <hi>Adam</hi> was. But that ſome are ſaved or damned, is not by any Neceſſity or Predeſtination; but only by every ones Free-will, who are led to good or to evil according to <note n="a" place="bottom">Deut. 30. 19. Iſa. 66. 3, 4.</note> the Choice they make of the one or the other: Becauſe on Gods part, Man is left free and<note place="bottom">(<hi>z</hi>) <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37.</note>

entire, as he was before Sin: For God never changes his Works. He has not for ſin changed any thing in the Earth, nor in the Heavens, nor in the Elements, nor in the Beaſts, nor in the other Creatures, but has continued them all ſuch as he created them, without any change, but Sin has brought Malignity upon each of them, whereas before the ſaid Sin all Things were good, <note n="b" place="bottom">Wiſd. 1. 13, 14.</note> without any evil. Even ſo God has changed nothing in Man ſince his Sin. He remainsentire in all his Qualities, both Bodily and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, except that by Sin he has contracted a Malignity <note n="c" place="bottom">Gen. 8. 21.</note>, and an Inclination to evil: Which before he had not, but a bent and inclination to all ſort of good Behold this is the only change that Sin made in Man, without his being neceſſitated to evil, far leſs predeſtinated to Damnation: Since all Men received in <hi>Adam</hi> the Pardon of this Diſobedience, having alſo received in him the Penitence, which was accepted for all Men in <hi>Adam</hi> ſo long as a Man is unable to uſe his own Reaſon: For then he is ſet at Liberty from the Power of <hi>Adam</hi> and that of his own Parents, in whoſe Will he remain'd till then: And coming out of this, he is free to chooſe good and evil, and neither God nor Men can conſtrain him to Salvation or Damnation: And that any is ſaved or damned, can proceed from nothing but the free choice that every one makes of following good or evil, and not at all from Predeſtination, as they very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly do imagine: For God will never deprive Man of his Graces how wicked ſoever he be, ſo long as he ſhall Live in this World. He will never take back the Graces which he gave him in <hi>Adam.</hi> They ſhall be ſtill communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him, if he will make a good uſe of them. The Pardon which he granted to <hi>Adam,</hi> he granted to all Men, and no Body can believe without Sin that God ſhould Reprobate him for the Sin of <hi>Adam:</hi> For by his Grace he forgave all <note n="d" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 16. 1 Cor. 7. 14.</note> when he forgave <hi>Adam</hi> his Sin. He cannot retract the Remiſſion which he then gave to all Men, to Reprobate them upon the ſame account of <hi>Adams</hi> Sin: For God never repents him of what by his Mercy he has once done, unleſs Man of his Free-will come to offend God by other new Sins: Which he is free to do. All
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:104476:287"/>
Men were created in the State of Innocence in <hi>Adam;</hi> and all Men ſinn'd in <hi>Adam,</hi> and alſo received the Pardon of this Sin in <hi>Adam:</hi> So that all they who dye in <hi>Adam</hi> are certainly ſaved by the Mercy of God upon the Pardon that he gave to <hi>Adam:</hi> But if his Children being come to the uſe of Reaſon do of their own Free-will turn to evil, they then fall again into Gods diſpleaſure, and begetting Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the ſame diſpleaſure, they are in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation with their Fathers, as being united with them till they come to the uſe of their own Reaſon: For then they begin to have a Being by themſelves, whereas before they were reckoned to be one and the ſame thing with their Parents, becauſe of the Sympathy there is in the Union of the Father with the Child, whoſe Will he holds in his Power, as <hi>Adam</hi> held the Will of all Men till they attain the uſe of their own Reaſon, ſo that till then they may be predeſtinated to Salvation or Damnation by the good or ill Will of their Parents, and not by the Decree of God, who cannot and will not deſtroy any Body, having certainly created and forgiven all the World, that all might be ſaved, and none Reprobated: For if he had preciſely decreed ſome for Damnation, he ſhould not have had ſo much Righteouſneſs in himſelf as what he demands of Men: For he ſayes to them, <note n="e" place="bottom">Mat. 5. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>Love your Enemies, and do good to them that perſecute you.</hi> This Counſel would have had no Authority if he himſelf had Reprobated thoſe who are become his Enemies. This abſolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation would not be good, but the greateſt evil that ever could be imagined: How could he command Men to do good to their Enemies, when he himſelf would do ſo great and eternal an Evil for the Fault they had committed againſt him, and that while they were yet in a ſtate of Penitence, as they are during this Life, where Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation ſhall never have place, ſince till the very laſt Inſtant they may find Mercy and Pardon? This Reprobation muſt only operate after Death, and not during this Life: Becauſe this is <note n="f" place="bottom">2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> the Time of Penitence, in which they who ſhall be certainly Reprobated can have no part; and it would be a very rigorous and unjuſt Thing, that God ſhould oblige thoſe to Penitence whom he abſolutely reſolves to damn. I believe, Sir, they confound the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:104476:288"/>
Times when they ſpeak of Predeſtination, and take the preſent for the Time to come: For at the Judgment, God will then take Two Maſſes, the One of Elect, and the Other of Reprobates, who do what they will ſhall aſſuredly be damned: Becauſe the Time of Penitence will then be paſt: But during this Life there can be no predeſtinated Reprobates.</p>
               <p>I told her, <hi>That well-meaning Perſons did believe there was in this Life Predeſtination; and that God had here Veſſels of Election and Reprobation, and both neceſſarily ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> This is, Sir, becauſe theſe Perſons, though well-meaning, do not diſcover the Goodneſs, and the Righteouſneſs of God; and they judge only according to the Appearance of Things, and not according to the Reality: For God can never Reprobate any after that he has created all for Salvation; and he cannot damn them for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin after he has pardoned it, and Man has undertaken the Penitence that God enjoyned him on that occaſion. If there were any Reprobated for this Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> in ſtrict Juſtice <hi>Adam</hi> ought to be firſt of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, ſince he firſt committed the Sin. 'Tis ſad to ſee and hear how Men <note n="g" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 2. &amp; 82. 5.</note> miſtake the Qualities of God, making him paſs as unjuſt and evil, like themſelves. I am ſorry, Sir, that I muſt be ſo prolix in this Matter, but the Thing requires it: Becauſe it is a moſt important Point that regards the Glory of God and the Salvation of Men; and therefore I cannot ſpeak too much of it. Be not you more weary to hear than I am to ſpeak of it. I have ſtill had ſtrange Contradictions in my Spirit when I heard Perſons of Sincerity aiming to maintain the Truth, and yet notwithſtanding very far from knowing it, and taking the Sentiments of Men for infallible Truths, though very often they perſiſt in their Ignorance which is ſo great and ſo prejudicial to the Salvation of many: For he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves he is predeſtinated to Salvation will not be at the pains to procure it; and though he fall into Sins, he will not repent of them, believing that he cannot be damned, and that he ſhall one Day Repent, though it were but the Laſt of his Life. Conſider a little, Sir, what ſloth this occaſions in thoſe well-meaning Perſons, and in what
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:104476:288"/>
hazard they put their Salvation! For it is a Deluſion to believe, that we ſhall be Saved by God's Predeſtination, Live as we pleaſe; for God will never Save any ſince <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, but thoſe who of their Free-will ſhall reſign themſelves to the Will of God. Though his Goodneſs Sav'd all Men in creating them, without any Co-operation of theirs, yet he will Save none without it, after they have their Free-wils to make choice of good or evil. God could indeed Save them before they made Reſiſtance, and while he was abſolute Lord of all Things: But ſince he gave them this Free-will to govern themſelves and ſo many other Things, he cannot Save them without them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Therefore no Body ſhould flatter himſelf to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he ſhall be Saved if he be predeſtinated; ſeeing this Predeſtination can have no more place ſince the Sin of <hi>Adam.</hi> Every one muſt <note n="h" place="bottom">Phil. 2. 12.</note> exerciſe himſelf to work out his Salvation: Becauſe no Body ſhall obtain it but he who of his own Free-will ſhall yield up <note n="i" place="bottom">Pſal. 31. 6.</note> into God's Hands the Free Liberty that he gave him: Theſe are the Elect: Becauſe they being yielded up unto God, none can pluck <note n="l" place="bottom">John. 10. 28.</note> them out of his Hands, unleſs the Perſon himſelf ſhould yet <note n="m" place="bottom">Heb. 10. 38.</note> withdraw from God: Which is almoſt impoſſible: Becauſe God ſtill directing him, his Will can no more be led to evil, than that of God is, unto which it is joyned and united. The Goodneſs of God repleniſhes it with ſo many Graces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <note n="n" place="bottom">Cant. 1. 4.</note> that it is impoſſible not to follow them. How could the ſame Goodneſs or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, that any ſhould be Reprobated, ſince nothing that is evil can proceed from it? Muſt not the Reprobation of Men of neceſſity come from their evil Will? Since it is impoſſible for God to do evil, it is conſequently impoſſible for him to Reprobate ſo much as one Soul. If it be, it is ſtill its own Fault only, and not at all a Predeſtination to Damnation: Becauſe God damns no <note n="p" place="bottom">Hoſ. 13. 9.</note> Body, not even at the Laſt Day of Judgment. For they who ſhall be then abſolute Reprobates, ſhall condemn <note n="q" place="bottom">

them to Hell as the juſt Merit of their Iniquities, and not at all as the Decree of God.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>It was very probable, that God can damn no Body, ſince he is all good, and can do no Evil; that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this, we ſee according to our ſhort Proſpect of Effects as if Men were Predeſtinated to good and evil: As in the</hi> Converſion of St. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="bottom">Acts 9. 3.</note>, <hi>and</hi> of <note n="s" place="bottom">Luke 7. 37.</note> Mary Magdalen; <hi>and on the contrary, in</hi> the Reprobation <note n="t" place="bottom">John 17. 12.</note> of Judas, <hi>and</hi> 
                  <note n="u" place="bottom">Luke 23. 39.</note> of the wicked Thief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Theſe different Accidents are not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in their Source; but only ſuperficially gone over, and judg'd according to Humane Sentiments, which does not penetrate the Righteouſneſs of God: St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not only a Choſen Veſſel on God's part, but alſo on the part of his own Free will: For after he had the uſe of Reaſon, he was alwayes <note n="x" place="bottom">Phil. 3. 6.</note> zealous of the Law of God, and 'tis very probable he had reſigned his Free-will to God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Knowledge, becauſe all that moved him to perſecute the Chriſtians was only a deſire to maintain his Law, which he believed was more perfect, as being given by God; and imagining that the Chriſtians aimed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, he would maintain it, and believe that by doing this he greatly pleaſed God, who ſeeing this good Deſire <note n="z" place="bottom">1 Tim. 1. 13.</note> would needs draw him out of his Ignorance in an outward and extraordinary manner: Becauſe it is God's Property to abound in Grace, and to prevent Men of good Will by ſuch Means as whereby they may diſcover that he favours them. Therefore he appeared viſibly to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by ſome Light, and made him blind, asking him, <hi>wherefore he perſecured him?</hi> Making him underſtand by theſe outward Signs the State of his Soul; by the Light he ſhews him, that he was in darkneſs; by the Blindneſs of his Eyes, the Blindneſs of his Mind, which muſt be directed to ſome one who might make him ſee the Truth; and by the Queſtion, <hi>Wherefore he perſecuted him?</hi> to ſhew him how much he was deceived, in Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Chriſtians who were the People of God. This he knew not, all theſe Things fell out not becauſe God<note place="bottom">(y) Gal. 1. 14.</note>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:104476:289"/>
had partially choſen St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be his Apoſtle: But becauſe he had of his own Free-will choſen to follow Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to reſign himſelf to God. But whereas Men ſee only theſe outward Things, they believe God acts by Paſſion as they do, and that he prefers one of his Creatures to another: Which he does not at all: For he loves them all equally, as being all his Children, and nevertheleſs gives more Grace to thoſe who are moſt reſigned to him: And this with Reaſon: For a Son who does his Fathers Pleaſure, and is dedicated to his Will, is more worthy of Favours than another who reſiſts and deſpiſes the Will of the ſame Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Magdalen</hi> received alſo the Grace of Converſion though ſhe was a Sinner: But if we conſider well her inward Diſpoſition, we ſhall clearly perceive that ſhe was truly diſpoſed to reſign her ſelf to God notwithſtanding her Sins: For ſhe no ſooner heard the Truth from her Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Mouth, but ſhe quitted her Sins <note n="a" place="bottom">Luke 7. 38.</note> and bewailed them bitterly, deteſted her Vanities, and followed Jeſus Chriſt through all. How many other Perſons heard the ſame Truth, without reſolving to follow him? A Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Perſons followed Jeſus Chriſt bodily, and heard the ſame Words, but produced not the ſame Effects. This cannot come from God, who has ſtill the ſame Efficacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But it proceeds from the Indiſpoſition of Souls who do not receive it effectually. And Men not being able to dive into the Interiour, imagine that this is done by God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently. In this, they are greatly deceived: Which they ſhall ſee at the Laſt Day of Judgment, wherein many ſhall be Saints who were deſpiſed and condemned in this World; and many others ſhall be Reprobated, who here were held for Saints: Becauſe Men regard only the outſide: But God <note n="c" place="bottom">Rev. 2. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>tries the Reins,</hi> and examines the Conſcience, which is known to him alone. Therefore Men ought never to judge nor diſpute of the Works of God: Becauſe they are blind and ignorant in his Matters; and when they ſay that he Saved and Reprobated ſome in this World, they calumniate him, and blaſpheme againſt his Qualities of Righteouſneſs and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:104476:290"/>That <hi>Judas</hi> was damned, was by his own Free-will, and not by the Decree of God, who ſpoke more to him to convert him than ever he did to St. <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Magdalen;</hi> and that the wicked Thief is damned, was by his obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in Sin: For if he had acknowledged his Fault, he would have been ſaved as well as the other.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That no Body thought it a Blaſphemy againſt God to ſay, That none can be ſaved without the particular Grace of God, and that ſome have it, and ſome have it not; and that he gives it to whom he pleaſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Theſe Terms of ſpeaking, Sir, make nothing as to the reality of the Thing. It may indeed be ſaid truly, that none can be ſaved without the <hi>particular Grace of God:</hi> But to ſay that God gives it only to whom he pleaſes, and to underſtand thereby that he gives it to ſome and denies it to others with reſpect of Perſons, is Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy: Becauſe he beſtows it alwayes according <note n="d" place="bottom">Pſal. 111. 7, 8.</note> to his Righteouſneſs, not according to his own Choice: For this is only the way of paſſionate Men, to favour thoſe for whom they have an Inclination: God gives indeed more Grace to ſome than to others; but alwayes <note n="e" place="bottom">Matth. 25. 15.</note> in proportion as each one does more reſign himſelf to his Will: For he ſayes; <note n="f" place="bottom">ver. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Be ye faithful in little things, and I will place you over great things:</hi> To ſhew that he encreaſes his Grace alwayes according to our Fidelity. That par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Grace which we ſtand in need of to be ſaved, was given to us all in the Creation of <hi>Adam:</hi> For he could not create us to Salvation without enduing with ſuitable Grace for it; and the Grace of raiſing us up again after Sin was alſo given us in <hi>Adam,</hi> which we might enjoy yet provided we uſe the ſame Means of his Penitence: And if we have ſinned after him by our own Will, it ſhall be forgiven us provided we take up the ſame Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which conſiſts, <note n="g" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8, &amp;c.</note> in the <hi>Shame</hi> and Confuſion that <hi>Adam</hi> had, in the <hi>Fear</hi> he had of God, not daring to appear before him, and <hi>in the Accepting of the Pennance</hi> of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring the Ground and gaining his Bread with the Sweat of his Face. Many Men now ſay they have not Grace that they might get rid of their Sins: And if they would
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:104476:290"/>
examine their Conſciences well, they would find it is becauſe they have no Repentance nor Confuſion for having committed them; nor yet the fear of God, nor a deſire to do Pennance for them: And that they may not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſo great Faults, they ſay, they have not the Grace of God that they might amend. This is to blame God for their own Wickedneſs. For very often they love their Sins, and are only afraid of the Chaſtiſements which theſe have deſerved: So that if God had not a Hell to chaſtiſe them, they would never forſake them, ſo far would they be from deſiring to do Penitence for them. And yet notwithſtanding of all this they are bold to ſay, that they have not the <hi>ſufficient,</hi> or <hi>effectual</hi> Grace of God, according to their conn'd Terms, upon which they build great Diſputes, which being well examined, we ſhall find them to be founded only upon Words; and that the Truth is alwayes true; and that God gave Graces to Man in <hi>Adam</hi> but too ſufficient for Salvation, and even generally to all Men <note n="h" place="bottom">Eccl. 18. 9—12. 2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> for obtaining the Pardon of their Sins. This being ſo, why ſhould we attribute the Loſs of our Salvation, or the not amending of our Lives, to the want of Gods Grace? Is it not a particular Grace when every one as to his own particular has received ſufficient <note n="i" place="bottom">Iſa. 5. 4.</note> to forſake his Sin if he will, and to work out his Salvation? Whether God gave theſe Graces at the Beginning, or if he gives them only at preſent, they are ſtill from the ſame God, the Giver of all good, as well in one Seaſon as in another. What needs diſputing whether theſe Graces are given now, or if they have continued with us ſince <hi>Adam?</hi> It is enough that we have them, and may encreaſe them by our Fidelity: For it pleaſes God alwayes <note n="l" place="bottom">Mat. 5. 48.</note> that we be perfect, and he is more deſirous <note n="m" place="bottom">Pſal. 81. 11, 14.

               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That there was much Ignorance in theſe Diſputes: That every one maintained his own Opinion as good; and that the beſt believed Predeſtination, becauſe others attribute too much to the Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I believe that no Body has hitherto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Truth as to the Grace of God: For it cannot be true that God has predeſtinated any to Damnation, for the Reaſons I have told you; nor yet that Man has the Power to ſave himſelf when he pleaſes: Becauſe the Habit of Sin is as another Nature, from whence we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver our ſelves. Even as the Souls which are in Hell, though they have their Free-will cannot uſe it in good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have given looſe Reins to Evil, they cannot any more have the Will to quit it; and being tied and united to all ſort of evil Objects, they cannot find the means to do well, even though they ſhould have the Will; Even ſo in proportion, thoſe who are yet in this Life, who would not reſign themſelves to God, but have followed their own Wills, are ſo habituated to evil, that they cannot have the Will to do well, but with great endeavours, and much force and violence to pull themſelves out of the occaſions of their Evils: With this difference nevertheleſs, that Sinners may yet in this World obtain Gods Grace, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of their Sins: Which damned Souls can never do: Becauſe their Sins have brought on the Sentence of their Eternal Reprobation. Men are ignorant of many Things through the Preſumption of their Wiſdom. If they would become Children, and be converted to God, they would be far more wiſe. For <note n="q" place="bottom">Mat. 11. 25.</note> God reveals his Secrets to Little ones, and hides them from the Great and the Wiſe. I wiſh all the Books about theſe Diſputes were burnt, and that every one would return into the primitive Dependance upon God, which comprehends all Divine Sciences: For he who is reſigned to God, is <note n="r" place="bottom">Pſal. 119. 99, 100.</note> more Learned than all the Doctours of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:104476:291"/>What can be aſcribed to the Creature, ſince it has <note n="s" place="bottom">1 Cor. 4. 7.</note> nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it has not received of God? There was a Time when it was not; and when it came to be, it's God who gave it being, and all the Powers of Soul and Body: The Inſtinct to do well, and the Liberty to love God come alſo of his Free Gift; if the Creature has a good Thought, <note n="t" place="bottom">2 Cor. 3. 5.</note> it comes from him. What can be aſcribed to the Creature, ſince it is come of nothing, and can do no good thing without God? If he gave it that Inclination to good, or that good Thought when he created it, or if he gives them as yet, is it not ſtill the ſame Giver, or the ſame God, who works Salvation in his Creature? Where is their place for diſputing to know whether Man can ſave himſelf, ſince he is nothing <note n="u" place="bottom">2 Cor. 12. 11.</note>, and has nothing <note n="x" place="bottom">John 3. 27.</note> that he has not received? And this is an Eternal Truth; that Salvation and all other good <note n="y" place="bottom">Hoſ. 13. 9.</note>, comes from God; and that all Evil and Damnation comes from Man; and he who is ſaved <note n="z" place="bottom">Pſal. 72. 28.</note> cleaves to the Grace of God; and he who is damned reſiſts it. What Argument will they bring yet in the Diſpute about Grace after ſo clear and convincing Reaſons? If Man may ſave himſelf when he will, it is alwayes by the Grace of God, who created him for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and imprinted in him this Inclination to good, and this deſire to be ſaved. How can they attribute any thing to the Creature, even though it ſhould be ſaid, that he may ſave himſelf when he will; ſince this Will was given him by God? He cannot aſcribe it to himſelf. Whether it was given him in his Creation, or at the Hour that he is Converted, this ſhould not cauſe ſo many Diſputes, ſo little profitable either to the one or the other Party: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he who holds that his Salvation depends upon the Predeſtination of God does certainly conceive a Sloth to Good, being perſwaded that his Salvation is decreed, do what he will; and on the contrary, he who believes he may ſave himſelf when he pleaſes, would not be at much trouble to advance in Vertue; ſince he believes his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends on his own Will, he will imagine that he ſhall come ſtill in time to be ſaved, though it ſhould be at the end of his Llife. And hereby theſe Diſputes inſtead of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:104476:292"/>
bringing any good to Souls, do cauſe them great Miſchiefs of Sloth and Negligence as to Salvation, and Miſtakes of God: For the more we will needs know him by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, the more we ſink into Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That all the Schools then ought to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, ſince the Diſputes which they reckon the moſt ſaving make us to miſtake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God and to neglect our Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Truly, Sir, this is very deſirable, that Men would abandon all their Studies that they might reſign themſelves to the Will of God: ſince this is the one thing neceſſary, upon which our Salvation depends. To what purpoſe is it to make ſo many Books, ſo many Studies, ſo many Diſputes, ſince all Perfection, the Law, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſiſt in the RESIGNING of our Will to that of God! All other Things are vain or uſeleſs: For we are created for no other thing but for ever to take our Delight with God. For what end ſhould we amuſe our ſelves, with ſo many different Things, and fill our Minds with Studies, Sciences, and Diſputes, which are only for this tranſient Life, and in the mean time give great Hindran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the RESIGNATION that we ought to make of our Will to that of God? For as long as Man is buſied in Studies, Sciences, and Diſputes, he acts alwayes by his own Motion: Becauſe thoſe who are reſigned to God, do nothing but receive from him, and while they do not affect any Sciences, <note n="a" place="bottom">Phil. 3. 7, 8.</note> they poſſeſs more of them than all they can Learn in the Schools, which are alwayes full of many Defects, becauſe every one is alwayes concern'd in his own Opinion, which can be only Humane, Limited, and Ignorant: And all theſe ſo imperfect Things hinder the Light of the Holy Spirit, which only enlightens Souls according as they are <note n="b" place="bottom">Wiſ. 1. 4, 5.</note> emptied of all Earthly Objects of which Studies and Diſputes are the moſt Lively to fill the Faculties of the Soul. This has occaſioned the Holy Doctours to continne in many Errours touching God's Dealings: Becauſe the Pre-occupation of their Studies has hindred the Light of the Holy Spirit, by which they might diſcover all Things, if the diſturbance of their Humane Learning had been removed: For this hindered them from ſeeing the ſimple Purity of Divine Things,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:104476:292"/>
and the one thing needful for our Salvation, which is, the RESIGNATION of our ſelves to GOD.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That at leaſt Divines would be needful, to expound the Scriptures to the People, and to teach them ſaving Truths: Since we are born in ignorance we cannot know but what is taught us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Theſe Doctours of the Law put to death Jeſus Chriſt; and thoſe who have followed them, have taught many Errours to the People: So that I believe if many of them had been Heathens, or brought up in unhabited Deſerts, without being inſtructed by any, they would have attained to a greater Knowledge of God, than what they have acquired by the Inſtruction of all theſe Doctors, who have often taught the Doctrines of Men, inſtead of that of God: And if theſe Perſons were not full of theſe Doctrines, they would certainly be at more Liberty to reſign themſelves to God: So many Laws and Means which they have taught them, are ſo many Ropes and Chains which withdraw them from it. For it is certain that one who has been taught nothing, will ſtill have a natural Bent and Inclination to Good: Becauſe all that is Good, is Lovely; and if he ſhall apply himſelf never ſo little to conſider the Works of God, he muſt of neceſſity be brought to Love him: For he would ſee that all that he made, is Good: By ſeeing the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, and all the Heavens, he muſt confeſs that the Authour of all theſe Things is perfect; and looking on the Earth, the Trees, the Plants and Elements, he muſt diſcover an incomprehenſible Divinity, who had the Skill to make all theſe admirable Things. Which obliges all that are Reaſonable to Love him. And when Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders himſelf, and ſees the Art there is in the Fabrick of his Body, in the Faculties of his Soul, in the Subtilty of his Spirit, he muſt confeſs that there is a God the Authour of all this, to whom all Things ought to be aſcribed: Becauſe no Creature is able to do any ſuch thing. By all which things <note n="c" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 1, &amp;c.</note>, a Man comes more perfectly to the Knowledge of God, than by Sciences and the Expoſitions of all the Doctors of the World, who have nothing but Limited Sciences.</p>

               <head>The Twentieth and Third Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Shews, That it is by Faith only that we can be Saved, which coming from God works ſtill Reſignation: Even among the Heathens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That all this Knowledge of God was nothing but</hi> the Faith of a Heathen, <hi>that it was not capable to work Salvation, that to be ſaved we muſt have a</hi> Divine Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, You are ignorant yet of a great many Things, For that Faith which you call <hi>Heathen</hi> is <hi>Divine;</hi> becauſe it comes immediately from God, who has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the Soul of all Men this Divine Light <note n="d" place="bottom">Prov. 20. 27. John 1. 9.</note> that leads them to the Knowledge of the true God. This is a Grace infuſed without the Concurrence of any Men, which is much more perfect then the Faith we give to the Things they propoſe to be believed by us in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, many of which are very abſurd, and neither reſpect the Glory of God, nor our Salvation. They give us for an Article of Faith, That there are Three Perſons in God: Though nevertheleſs no Creature can comprehend what is in God, but by his Operations which we ſee with our Eyes, as that he is Almighty, that he is All<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> juſt, all Good, and True: Becauſe all that we ſee he operates in us, and in other Creatures, bear theſe Three Qualities: But to know if there be Three Divine Perſons in God, this ſurpaſſes our Capacity: Becauſe God is an incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible <note n="e" place="bottom">1 Tim. 6. 16.</note> Being, and was never diſcovered by any ſo as to know what there is in his Divinity. They propoſe alſo to us many Things for Articles of Faith, which are not of its true Eſſence; ſeeing no Body can be ſaved without Faith, and they continually propoſe to us new Things
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:104476:293"/>
for Articles of this Faith, which our Forefathers never believed as ſuch: And if we cannot have true Faith now without believing them, it were to be feared that our Forefathers were not Saved, ſince they did not believe thoſe new Things which are now propoſed to us as Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith. They never believed that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was conceived without Original Sin; and now they would make this Belief to paſs for an Article of Faith: Though nevertheleſs, there is no appearance of Truth in it: For the Virgin came out of the Maſſe of <hi>Adam,</hi> as all the reſt of Men: And ſhe did alſo undergo the Penitence common to all the Children of <hi>Adam,</hi> having gained her Bread by Bodily Labour, and ſuffered the Malignity of all the Elements; and her Son Jeſus himſelf ſhiver'd for Cold in the Stable of <hi>Bethelem,</hi> ſhewing that he was a real Man deſcended from <hi>Adam,</hi> ſubjecting himſelf to the ſame Penitence that our Firſt Father had received and accepted from God in the Remiſſion of his Sin. Why ſhould they now lay it before us as an Article of Faith, that the Virgin was conceived without Sin, ſince all Humane Creatures which are born of Parents who live under the Dependance of God, having accepted the Penitence that God enjoyn'd <hi>Adam,</hi> are all born in the Indulgence that God gave to <hi>Adam?</hi> Wherefore ſhould there be a particular Article of Faith for the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin; as alſo for the Infallibility of the Pope; ſeeing all theſe Things have no reſpect to the true Faith, which muſt work out our Salvation? For if the Virgins Conception was Immaculate, or if the Pope be infallible, this makes nothing for our Salvation, nor as to the Knowledge we ought to have of a God upon whom all Things depend. This Light infuſed in my Soul, is true Faith; and the Dependance that I deſire to have upon the ſame God, is the Work of my Faith. What need is there to add yet to this the believing that the Pope is infallible, ſince I have the ſame Light of Faith, that tells me, No Man can be infallible? Since <hi>Adam</hi> created in Innocence, and endued with all the Grace and Holineſs that can be met with in any Man, did fall, and by failing ſo groſly ſhew that he was not infallible; may not a Man who is a Sinner, fail or err? All theſe Faiths and Beliefs are not divinely infuſed by God into our Soul, as that Faith is which
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:104476:294"/>
makes us know <note n="f" place="bottom">Heb. 11. 6.</note> a God above all Things, All good, All-juſt, All-mighty, but Incomprehenſible. This Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir, which you call <hi>Heathen,</hi> is the True Faith, which is able to work Salvation in all thoſe who in conſequence of it do through Love reſign themſelves to the ſame God.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>If ſhe believed the Heathens would be ſaved, ſince they are not baptized?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir, All the <hi>Heathens</hi> who knew God by his Works, and reſigned their Will to him, ſhall aſſuredly be ſaved: For they had operating Faith, True Faith, in believing that there is One Almighty God, who created the Heaven, the Earth, and all Things, and they had the Works of Faith, when they were reſign'd to the Will of the ſame God. Which appeared in all thoſe who deſpiſed the Things of this Life for that which is to come. They could not have done this but by a Divine Light, that God infuſed into their Souls: Becauſe the Brutiſh Senſes cannot deſpiſe the Pleaſures of this Life: For they know no other; and Nature cannot betray it ſelf by deſpiſing what is good for it, to chooſe what is evil for it. When we ſee one who may have Honours, Riches and Pleaſures in this Life, and who yet quits them to be diſpiſed, poor and afflicted, we may well believe that he has the Light of Faith infuſed by God into his Soul: Becauſe neither the Devil, nor Nature would ever induce him to do ſuch Things: For no Body hates his own Fleſh; and the Devil incites alwayes to ſatisfie Nature. And if we ſee one whom we call a <hi>Heathen,</hi> quit the Converſation of Men, and retire into a Solitude, we may well believe that he has the true Light of Faith, which makes Nature break off converſing with its like: For Society is a moſt Lovely Thing: Man is a Sociable Creature above all the other Animals; and if the Beaſts are ſad when they are alone, how much more muſt Man be ſo when he Lives according to Nature, unleſs it be ſome half-broken ſpirit, who through Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loves rather to be alone to give the more Liberty to its Black Humours? This is not to be found in thoſe who deſpiſe Converſation the better to wait on God, and to be delivered from the Troubles they have to live among thoſe who know not God, but offend him every Moment.<note place="bottom">(g) Mat. 12. 33. 35.</note>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:104476:294"/>
How could I believe, Sir, that theſe Souls ſo excelling in Vertue ſhould not be ſaved, even though they are not Baptized; ſince Baptiſm is only an outward Sign of the INWARD RESIGNATION which they have made of their Will to that of God? That God, <hi>who</hi> 
                  <note n="h" place="bottom">Jer. 17. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>tries the Reins,</hi> would he not ſave them, for not having obſerved this outward Formality, which is done in the ſight of Men? We have not a Political God who has need of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Men when he ſees the Eſſence of Faith living in our Inward Parts. I reckon ſuch Heathens to be more SAINTS, than many of thoſe who are Canonized by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and wiſh, Sir, that you had attained to their ſolid Vertues? that you had a perfect Contempt of this Life, aſpiring after another which will deliver us from ſo many Miſeries; and alſo an entire Reſignation of your Will to that of God, in which alone our Salvation conſiſts, and not in ſo many ſorts of Means which they ſet before us as neceſſary Things, or a Blind Faith of Things which often reſpect neither God, nor our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For though indeed it be Faith to believe that which <note n="i" place="bottom">Heb. 11. 1.</note> we do not ſee, nevertheleſs that is not to ſay that we muſt blindly believe all that they would perſwade us: For God has given us an Underſtanding to comprehend what is comprehenſible of the Works of our Faith. For Example: We muſt believe in God Almighty, who crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Heaven and the Earth. We do not ſo ſee this God in whom we believe; but nevertheleſs, we ſee evidently that there muſt be an Almighty God, when we conſider the Works that he has done by his Almighty Power; and therefore our Faith is not blind, ſince it gives Light to ſee the Works of him in whom we believe. But diverſe of theſe Things which they propoſe to us as Articles of Faith, are without any appearance of Truth, as is, the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Pope.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>If one might be ſaved without believing all the Articles of Faith in particular?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Yes, Sir, we may be ſaved by the General Belief <note n="l" place="bottom">Heb. 11. 6. Pſal. 36. 6, 7, 8.</note> that there is one only God the Creatour of all Things, provided that this Belief beget in us the reſigning
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:104476:295"/>
of our Will to God in whom we believe: Becauſe in this all Things are comprehended: ſince by being <note n="m" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 8. &amp; 73. 23, 24.</note> reſigned to God, we fulfil all the Articles of Faith, all the Commandments of the Law, and the Evangelical Counſels. And whereas it is ſaid that all Chriſtians are obliged to Learn the chief Points of our Belief, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs this is not that they muſt Learn this by Rote or by Words: For it is enough to know the ſubſtance of them, that we may obſerve them; for this obſerving of them is more than to be able to tell them by Rote; it is the ſame as to all the Articles of our Faith in particular. It is of little moment that we have a particular Belief of ſo many Points, if we do not obſerve them all in general by the reſigning of our Will to that of God. We have no need of doing any other thing to work out our ſalvation; for if we had not quitted this Dependance upon God, we ſhould never have had the other Commandments, nor the other Articles of Faith. Our ſins alone have occaſioned all theſe Articles, and all theſe Commandments, and other Means: And ſin ceaſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſhould have no need of other Laws. So that our ſins alone have engendered the Law and the Articles of Faith, which were given us only to reduce our Underſtanding to a DEPENDANCE upon God. The firſt thing that God did to bring back <hi>Adam</hi> to this Dependance from whence he had withdrawn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf while he would needs become wiſe in himſelf, he asks him, <note n="n" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Adam where are thou?</hi> Not that God could be ignorant where <hi>Adam</hi> was, ſince he knows all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But it was to recal his Underſtanding to the Conſideration of what he had done in diſobeying God, that he might conſider the miſerable ſtate to which he had brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf while he would needs depend upon himſelf. The firſt Precept that God gave Man, was to make him know the ſtate of his Soul, asking him, <hi>Where art thou?</hi> To make him re-enter into himſelf, and recollect his Senſes, that he might ſee whither he had ſtrayed from a Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon his God, in which if he had continued, there would have been no need of asking, where he was; ſince he would have been ſtill in his preſence: But ſince he had withdrawn himſelf, it was needful that God ſhould call
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:104476:295"/>
him back again by asking him, where he was. But as ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> acknowledged his fault, and offered himſelf to God, ſaying, Here am I, Lord, all confuſed and trembling, not daring to appear before him, but hiding himſelf as a Criminal before the face of his Judge, then God gives him the ſecond Precept, ſaying, <hi>That he ſhould Till the Ground, and gain his Bread in the ſweat of his Face.</hi> This was the Penitence enjoyned to ſatisfie for his ſin, which being through Grace remitted to him, he ought nevertheleſs to ſuffer ſome temporal Puniſhments; and this in Juſtice: For God had not only beſtowed on Man a Divine and Reaſonable Soul, and a Free-will to love him; but alſo many Natural and material Graces: Therefore it was not enough for Man that God had granted him the Remiſſion of his Treſpaſſes againſt him, in reſtoring him by a ſecond Grace his Reaſon and his Free-will; but he ought alſo to ſatisfie for the Natural and material Graces, which things have not eſſentially the goodneſs of God to pardon this Injury received from Man. God, who is good, pardons him the Offence he had committed againſt his Majeſty, and even makes him a garment to cover his Nakedneſs, that he might leſſen his Confuſion, he takes care alſo to thruſt him out of Paradiſe, for fear he ſhould come to eat of the Tree of Life, and by this means live alwayes miſerable. All theſe Favours come from the Divine Goodneſs. But the Elements, the Earth, and the other Creatures, not having in them this goodneſs, ſet themſelves againſt Man, and make him ſuffer, that by Penitence he might pay for the Rebellion he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt their Creator. This the Juſtice of God own'd, by ordaining <hi>Adam</hi> to undergo the Pains that all theſe Earthly Creatures ſhould give him: Becauſe they are juſtly irritated againſt Man, who was conſtituted their Lord to whom they ought to be ſubject and to obey: But ſince he was a Rebel againſt his God, they ought in like manner to rebel againſt him; and being Creatures uncapable of Mercy, of neceſſity Man muſt ſatisfie them by a corporeal and material Penitence like unto their Nature. This was ordained by God, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:104476:296"/>
not been for this, he would have confined Man to Hell for his firſt Diſobedience: But his infinite Goodneſs has at all times exerciſed Mercy; and according as he ſaw Man ſtray from him, and quit his DEPENDANCE, he called him back ſtill by Precepts, which were like ſo many Voices that cried, <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> For when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> gave themſelves to Idolatry and other ſins, he gave them Ten Commandments, to let them ſee, that all the Things contained in them are thoſe which withdraw Man from a Dependance upon his God. And afterwards when he would yet ſtray further from God, by covering Temporal goods, or Bodily pleaſures, or by coveting the Honours <note n="o" place="bottom">
                     <hi>John</hi> 5. 44. &amp; 12. 42, 43.</note> which Men render one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, more than to God, he then was ſo good as to take a Humane Body that he might teach us palpably that all theſe things did withdraw us from a Dependance upon God, ſetting before us all the Evangelical Precepts as means to return into this Dependance, wherein our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation conſiſts: For he who lives in this DEPENDANCE, fulſils all the Laws, which cannot ſave us without this Dependance. For Faith alone operating can ſave us, but not the Laws, which are given us only to diſcover our ſins. Faith working is that <note n="p" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. per totum.</note> which makes us know God and reſign our ſelves to him, and it contains in it in practice all the Laws and the Articles of Faith: For he who has reſigned his Will to God, knows well where <note n="q" place="bottom">Gal. 2. 20.</note> he is, and will alſo willingly ſatisfie <note n="r" place="bottom">Luke 23. 41.</note> his juſt Penitence: He takes good heed alſo not to commit the things which are forbidden by the Ten Commandments, and not to omit the things therein commanded, and he punctually follows the Counſels of the Goſpel; for he who is reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, cannot any longer have affection for Father, Mother, Brother, Siſter, Land, Houſe, or any other thing; ſince God who holds our Will has no need of Earthly Poſſeſſions, but requires only from us the Divine Things which he beſtowed on us, which are proportioned to his Divine Nature; he can be no more ſatisfied with Temporal things than a Horſe can be fed with ſtones, which are not a food ſuitable to his Nature. In ſhort,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:104476:296"/>
He who has yielded up and reſigned his Free-will to that of God, has no need of obſerving in particular the Articles of Faith: Becauſe he is reſtored unto the firſt Eſſential Ordinance of God; and while he continues in this, he has need of no other things; becauſe God would never have demanded more of us, and even at preſent <note n="s" place="bottom">Prov. 23. 26.</note> demands no more of thoſe who will yield up themſelves to him. Is it not ſad, Sir, that Men now are ſo far from this One Thing neceſſary, and that they are ſubjected to ſo many ſeveral Laws by their ſins? Were it not better to take this firſt Liberty that God gave us, and to yield it up into his Hands, than to ſubject our ſelves to ſo many Laws, and ſo many particular Creeds, which do nothing but fill our Underſtandings, which ought only to be applied to know one Almighty God, the Creatour of all Things, and to be reſigned wholly to him? For our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not given us by God for the ſtudy of Letters, nor for Trafficking in Buſineſs: Becauſe God has nothing to do with all theſe Things, he having created us for no other end but to take his delight with us, which can never have its compleat Joy but by the reſigning of our Will to his; this is what he requires of all Men.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That we find it not written that God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely demanded of Man the Dependance of his Free-will; which he ought to do, in caſe it were ſo neceſſary for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> How, Sir! Would you make more reckoning of it if this were written upon Paper, or carved on a Stone, than if it were engraven in our <note n="t" place="bottom">Deut. 30. 14. Rom. 10. 8.</note> Heart? Who is there in the World that has not engraven within himthe neceſſity there is to depend upon God, ſince all know they have received their Being and all Things from him? Is there any of never ſo little Reaſon who call in queſtion whether to be ſaved we ought neceſſarily to depend upon God? Becauſe none can give us Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but he only, and if we withdraw from him, and ſubject our Divine Free-will unto our Paſſions, this is to follow our Animal Part, which has no other Salvation but the affording us a little Beaſtly Senſuality. Even Natural Reaſon it ſelf may abundantly ſhew us the need we have of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:104476:297"/>
depending upon God: Becauſe all that we are appertains to him. Can we in good Reaſon deny a Perſon what belongs to him in property? Much leſs can we deny God the Dependance that we owe him. It is true he gave us our Free-will to uſe it to good or evil; but with this condition, that in caſe we ſhould turn it to evil we ſhould ſuffer the Pains that our Evils engendered. And who could ever imagine that Man ſhould be ſuch an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to himſelf as to withdraw from his Dependance upon God, upon whom depends all his Happineſs, to ſubject himſelf under the Dependance of his own Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is ſo vicious, and capable only of rendring us miſerable both in this Life and in the other? A Man muſt have loſt his Judgment if he do not know the Obligation he has to continue in a Dependance upon God for his Salvation, even though God had not preciſely teſtified or ſaid, That if we would be ſaved we muſt be ſubject to his Will; ſince Reaſon, Juſtice, and Truth, do dictate to us a Thing ſo reaſonable, and the Brute Beaſts themſelves <note n="u" place="bottom">Iſa. 1. 3.</note> teach us, to ſubmit to their Benefactours, ſome of which have ſometimes acknowledged all the Dayes of their Life ſome particular Benefits received from Men. Muſt God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to them by Writ the Obligation they have to ſubject their Wills to his? He abandantly teſtified that ſuch was his Will when he forbad <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of the Fruit of one Tree only, permitting him to eat of all the reſt. Muſt he ſay preciſely, that he would have Man to ſubmit his Will to his? Nature, Reaſon, and Underſtanding were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable enough to comprehend that God would ſtill reſerve this Dependance upon himſelf, reſerving for an outward Sign the Fruit of one Tree only. All the World knows well enough that God has no need of any Fruit, and that this Prohibition was the ſecret Commandment that God gave him not to withdraw from his Dependance: Even as he did not bid <hi>Adam</hi> in expreſs terms, reflect upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and conſider the Miſery into which he had plunged himſelf; but he ſayes only, <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> Theſe few Words were but too ſufficient to make <hi>Adam</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he would do well to examine himſelf: Juſt ſo it was not needful that he ſhould ſay in expreſs Words,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:104476:297"/>
It is my Will that you ſubmit your Will to mine. This ought to be underſtood ſufficiently when he ſayes, <hi>I forbid thee to eat of this Tree.</hi> Man in himſelf had no other Fruit worthy of God, but the Diſpoſal of his Free-will; for all his other Things were either Humane, or Material. This Free-will alone was Divine: The uſe of which ought to be reſerved for God alone: Even though he had never declared that he would have it for himſelf, yet Man was certainly obliged both by Divine and Humane Right voluntarily to offer it to him.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>There was nothing more reaſonable, nor more juſt, or perfect, than for Man to reſign his Will to that of God, asking her, why Men had difficulty to do this?</hi>

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, There is nothing better for Man than to reſign his Will to that of God, and we ſee nothing leſs practiſed than this: Becauſe no Body applies his Spirit to conſider this Obligation. One diverts himſelf by his Studies; another by his Offices; another by his Trade: Juſt as if every one had been created only for ſuch Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys. They Rule on Earth as Little Gods, without thinking on this DEPENDANCE; and when God ſhall come at the Hour of our Death, he will deride the Men who have lived thus, as he did <hi>Adam,</hi> when he cloathed him with a garment of Skins, ſaying to him, <note n="y" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold Adam is become a God like us!</hi> Men now may indeed at Death look for the like Reproaches: Becauſe God has placed them in this Valley of Miſery to do Penitence;<note place="bottom">(<hi>x</hi>) <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 26.</note>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:104476:298"/>
and they will needs Rule and take their pleaſures in it as in a Paradiſe, forgetting that they ought to depend upon God, and ſubmit their Wills to his: And inſtead of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, they will needs govern themſelves, and follow their own Inclinations. Theſe evil Habits make it ſeem difficult for Men now to abandon their Wills to God, becauſe they have poſſeſſed them till this preſent Time: And ſeeing all that has Life is in a continual Motion if we live to our Senſes, we advance alwayes in Brutiſhneſs: And if we live to the Devil, we advance alwayes in Malice; but if we live to God, we advance alwayes in the Divine Nature. The difficulty that we find to reſign our Will to that of God, proceeds certainly from this, that we are habituated not to depend on the Will of God, and that we have debaſed this Divine Quality, that he has given us, even to the Earth, or to Hell. When we leave it to the power of the Devil to Rule over our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, we then render our Divine Souls, Devils; and when we let it be Ruled by our Brutiſh Paſſions, we then render our Divine Soul, Beaſtly. What Injury does Man to himſelf that he will not yield up his Free-will into Gods Hand, who would render it wholly Divine! This is the One Thing neceſſary, and we do not apprehend it! Nevertheleſs, we cannot be ſaved by any other Means, ſince this is the only Way that leads to Salvation, we muſt of neceſſity retake it, or we ſhall all periſh. We muſt be born again, and re-enter into the Original State in which God created us: For he has changed nothing in Man by Sin; no more than he has done, in the Earth, the Beaſts, and Elements, except that all theſe Things have contracted ſome Malignity in themſelves, which Man muſt correct by reſiſting his own Will, in which this Malignity reſides: For as long as we ſhall follow our own Will, we ſhall ſtill grow worſe: Becauſe this Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that is in our Will, encreaſes according as we follow it. By which we may evidently ſee that he who will not yield up his own Will to God cannot be ſaved: For this Divine Quality which is in us, being become brutiſh, produces all ſorts of Evils; even as the Devils ſince they applied their Divine Qualities to do evil, have an inſatiable appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite<note place="bottom">(<hi>z</hi>) <hi>John</hi> 3. 3.</note>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:104476:298"/>
to Evil. But when this our Will is yielded up into Gods Hand, it is in its: Center, and produces all ſort of good: Of neceſſity therefore we muſt retake our <note n="a" place="bottom">Judg. 8. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Original,</hi> and the firſt eſſential Commandment that God gave us, which is, a DEPENDANCE upon his Will. It is this that Jeſus Chriſt ſayes, <note n="b" place="bottom">Luke 13. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Except you repent, you ſhall all periſh.</hi> The trouble that we ſhall have to reſign our Will to God, will purge our Souls; and by this Violence we ſhall poſſeſs them.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That none had ever ſearched ſo deep into the neceſſity of this Dependance upon God as ſhe had deduc'd it: Which notwithſtanding was ſo clear and true, that no Body could doubt of it: That Man owed all to God, ſince he had received all from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, The cauſe why they do not penetrate the neceſſity of this Dependance upon God, is, the Blindneſs of Men, who being diverted by their Worldly Affairs and Buſineſs, do not apply themſelves to that which concerns their Eternal Happineſs; contenting themſelves with this, to believe blindly what is laid before them, that is, the Reaſons and Sentiments of Men; without ſearching into the Eſſence of the Thing, or the Truth of their Original. It is in this that Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, <note n="c" place="bottom">Matth. 15. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>If the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the ditch.</hi> They teach in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church a great many Lawes and Commands, Counſels, Rules, Means, Caſes of Conſcience, and a Thouſand ſorts of Inventions, to pleaſe God, which of themſelves are not capable of ſaving ſo much as one Soul: While in the mean time all the World build their Salvation upon theſe Things: But they are deceived, ſince nothing can obtain it but a DEPENDANCE UPON GOD; And as near as we come to this Dependance, we come as near to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and as far as we are eſtranged from it, we are as near our Damnation. We ought not to go by Four Ways when there is but one that is ſtraight. The taking ſo many different Methods to go to God, are only By-ways, ſince there is but One only that can unite us to him. That is the DEPENDANCE of our Will upon his, all being comprehended in it; becauſe this is the Eſſence of all
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:104476:299"/>
Good: Since nothing is good <note n="d" place="bottom">Mat. 19. 17.</note> but God, no good can come but from him <note n="e" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 17.</note> alone, who does alwayes well, and never ill. Nevertheleſs he will not act in us any good but in ſo far <note n="f" place="bottom">Pſal. 81. 12—15.</note> as our Free-will is reſigned to him. He does alwayes good where he meets with no oppoſition, and he will never do it <note n="g" place="bottom">Matth. 23. 37.</note> where our Will oppoſes it ſelf: Becauſe it is he who gave this Liberty to the Soul; and he will never repent of any of the Works that he has done. If we could ſpeak of God as we would do of a Man, we would ſay, that he is very ſorry, when Man withdraws himſelf from him, and damns himſelf, but that he cannot hinder it. Not that the Almighty Power of God does not reach all Things, or that his Power is limited; but it is becauſe it pleaſed him to give Man this Free-will when he created him, that with it he might love him; and Man nevertheleſs turns away from loving Him to love ſome Creatures that are unworthy of him. This is an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for him to repent <note n="h" place="bottom">Gen. 6. 6.</note>, to ſpeak in our Gibberiſh, But God can never have any kind of Repentance, or any other Paſſions: Becauſe he is <note n="i" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 17.</note> unchangeable, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts what he <note n="k" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 29.</note> has once done. The firſt and laſt Thing that he demands of Man is, that he acknowledge in all things the Dependance that he has upon God; and that he ſo love him, as to yield up the Free-will he gave us, into his power. Lo this is all that God requires of Man. All the other Precepts, Counſels and Commands, are only acceſſory and caſual, not at all neceſſary for him that fulfils this only eſſential Commandment, which Men now have forgot becauſe of the Traditions of Men, which has ſo filled their Spirits that no Body penetrates now into the Eſſence of Vertue, and they know not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it conſiſts. Which is very deplorable.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>How it was poſſible that Man ſhould come to ſuch an Ignorance of God, and of himſelf, and to ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs of his Salvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> The Reaſon is, Sir, that whereas Men ought to apply their Reaſon and Underſtanding to know the Works of God, they have applyed them to Earthly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:104476:299"/>
Things; and pried into the Works of God to apply them to Evil. For Example: We ſee ſome Rod or Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment befal us: We immediately ſay; that God is angry, and that he afflicts us. Theſe are the Sentiments of the moſt pious, and they are much better than thoſe who aſcribe this to Fortune, or Second Cauſes, for there is no Solidity in this; whereas the firſt has ſome regard of God, yet nevertheleſs it is ſo imperfect, that it is injurious to him, inſtead of being honourable. For if we ſpeak truly of God, it cannot be ſaid that he is angry, becauſe he is not ſubject to any Paſſion, no more to Wrath than other Paſſions: Neither does he afflict us; becauſe no Evil or Afflictions can come from him, as being the Source of all Good, from which no Evil can be derived: But theſe Terms are uſed even in the Holy Scripture, to make us underſtand ſomething of God according to our Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: And if it were ſaid, that any other thing than God afflicts us, it would induce Men, being ſo imperfect, to Vengeance, inſtead of Repentance. It is better therefore to uſe Terms which do rather excite us to Vertue, as the Scripture way of ſpeaking does wiſely; but we muſt not infer from this that theſe Terms are in effect true; but only to give us ſome ſignification, that is leſs evil, of the things that we ought to underſtand. And nevertheleſs, they inſiſt ſometimes upon certain Terms, and thereon build Diſputes, and Queſtions, which amuſe the World, and turn them away from the knowledge of God, and of themſelves, and of Eternal Salvation, as the Debate about the Grace of God, or Predeſtination has done. They found it upon this, that God in ſeveral places of the Sacred Text has ſaid <note n="l" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. &amp;c.</note>; that he has <hi>elected</hi> one, and <hi>reprobated</hi> another, or that he <hi>forſook</hi> his People, or hardened <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Heart. Theſe are all Terms accommodated to our Capacity, but it does not follow that they are ſo really: For God Elected all Men that were or ſhall be to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="m" place="bottom">1 Tim. 2. 4.</note>, and none to Reprobation: Becauſe God <note n="n" place="bottom">Mat. 5. 45.</note> does always good to all, without reſpect of Perſons, or regard of Mens Merit or Demerit, for he reſpects him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only that he may ſtill exerciſe his Goodneſs, from which there cannot proceed ſo much as the Reprobation of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:104476:300"/>
one Soul: For where there is nothing but all good, there no evil can be found; and Reprobation is the greateſt Evil in the World, which never can come from God, who is all good. And to believe that God gives his Graces only to whom he pleaſes, is alſo to render him partial and paſſionate, favouring one more than another. Which cannot be found in God, who is always juſt as well as always good, and never favours any out of Preference? Though the Scripture uſes theſe Terms, nevertheleſs the Favours of God are ſtill enlarged according as the Soul reſigns its ſelf to his Will, and no farther: Becauſe his Goodneſs is ſtill accompanied with Righteouſneſs. He ſtill abounds in Graces, and denies them to none: If any do not feel the Operations of them, it is becauſe he uſes them according to his own Will, applying them to evil; as is done in Nature, when they abuſe their Beauty, Health, Wealth, or Honours to offend God; who notwithſtanding does not withdraw theſe Natural Graces becauſe of their Abuſe, no more than he does his Spiritual Graces; which his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtill beſtows, though we abuſe them: For God can never ceaſe to do well. And when 'tis ſaid that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes his People, this is alſo but a way of ſpeaking: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God never forſakes any thing, ſince he comprehends in himſelf all things. He cannot quit or abandon any thing, no more than he can harden the Hearts of any: For this would be to do an ill thing: But theſe are all Terms uſed in the Scriptures that Men may not interpret to an evil Senſe the Works which they ſee fall out without their knowledge: For if the Text ſaid that Men have the Grace of God, and alſo their Salvation at their will; they ſo love themſelves, that they would not any longer acknowledge God, but would aſcribe to themſelves the Power of ſaving themſelves; which would be a greater Evil than to ſay, that our Salvation depends immediately upon the Grace of God: Becauſe this is true, but not in the way that Men take it, when they ſay, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved without the Grace of God, as if God had not given his Graces to all Men from their Creation, which, whatever a Man do, will never be taken back or retracted. If he hardens his Heart to evil, this is when he will irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilably withdraw his Free-will from a Dependance upon God: Then the Juſtice of God cuts ſhort this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. So that it may be indirectly ſaid, that God
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:104476:300"/>
hardens Hearts, even as we would ſay that the Fire has burnt the Wood that was put into it, this would be a true thing: For the Fire conſumes all that is capable of that Element; but if nothing be put into it for its Aliment, it would conſume its ſelf, inſtead of conſuming any other thing. Even ſo is it as to the Juſtice of God, <note n="o" place="bottom">Iſa. 27. 4.</note> which devours all that is oppoſed to it: Unjuſt Hearts are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Juſtice of God, which like a Fire devours all that is thrown into it. When a wicked Man has deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to run to evil, he falls into God's Juſtice, and his Heart is hardned; becauſe he has caſt himſelf into the devouring Fire of this Juſtice.</p>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:104476:301"/>
Sentiments of Men which have been given them for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Truths: And you may eaſily perceive, Sir, that they are not ſuch, nor founded upon the Wiſdom of God, which is alwayes the ſame. If you conſider thoſe who have ſpoken of the Grace and Works of God, you will find them different in Sentiments, though divers of them were Saints. This may be an Evidence to you that their Wiſdom was not Divine, and that their Learning has darkned the Light of Truth, which can never change nor contradict it ſelf in any thing: And becauſe this Learning is a Hindrance to the Holy Spirit who comes now to illuminate the Souls of Men of good Will, of neceſſity this Learning muſt be deſtroyed in them.

Get out of it, for all is corrupted there. Keep your ſelf ſolitary; for the World at preſent is a Temporal Hell, wherein nothing is to be ſeen but Objects which incite to evil. God is not any longer known nor loved there: Nothing is to be heard there but Blaſphemies: The moſt Holy will ſay that they have not the Grace to do well, and that God has predeſtinated whom he pleaſed; that all theſe Decrees will come to paſs do what they will; with many other Calumnies which they utter againſt God: And as his Name is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed in the Eternal Hell; ſo is it in this World which is a Temporal Hell, where St. <hi>John</hi> has well ſaid in his <hi>Revelation,</hi>

               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That I was altogether convinced; and that I perceived very clearly that all the Wiſe were greatly ignorant of the Wiſdom of God; that all Studies and Diſputes were founded only upon Terms and Words, or upon the Sentiments of Men.</hi>

                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> I bleſs God, Sir, that he gives you theſe Lights. Do not look back any longer: For Men are deceived, and do deceive one another. They have long agoe quitted the Light of Truth; and the more they thought to find it, by Humane Reaſons or Arguments, the farther they have been removed from it: Becauſe the ſame Wiſdom is needful <note n="x" place="bottom">1 Cor. 2. 11, 12.</note> for underſtanding the Holy Scriptures that did at firſt dictate them; and the Men who are wiſe in this World are very ſeldome humble <note n="y" place="bottom">1 Cor. 8. 1.</note>, and God <note n="z" place="bottom">1 Pet. 5. 5.</note> reſiſts the Proud, and gives his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note n="a" place="bottom">Matth. 11. 25.</note> to the Humble and the Little Ones. Therefore the Wiſe continue ignorant of the Wiſdom of God, and are only Wiſe in themſelves, and ſuch Wiſdom is <note n="b" place="bottom">1 Cor. 3. 19.</note> Fooliſhneſs before God; for it is of no uſe for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Eternal Things; and the World paſs will away with all its Sciences; ſo that all the Wiſdom of Men is nothing but Vanity <note n="c" place="bottom">Rom. 1. 22.</note>, upon which we ought never to build our Salvation, ſince it is written, <note n="d" place="bottom">Jer. 17. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Wo to the Man that puts his confidence in Man!</hi> Which nevertheleſs all Men almoſt do now: For it ſeems, for a Man to be ſure of his Salvation it is enough to follow the Sentiment of ſome Author, or ſome Saint; though all Men may err and fail, even though they were canonized for Saints: This is not a ſolid Bottom whereupon to found our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lielf and Salvation; becauſe there is but one only Truth, which is God; and he who is not united to this Truth, is in Errour and Lies; and ſtill walking in Darkneſs, he knows not whither he goes. Learning has led Men into great Preſumption and Pride, which eſtranges them from God: So that they ſhall never know the Truth but by becoming Children, re-entering into the Womb of their Mother, which is the Original and the State of their Creation. They muſt re-take their firſt Aims if they would diſcover the Secrets of God's Grace, the Power of Free-will, the Qualities of God, the Love that he bears to Men, and the way how he Rules and governs them. Nothing of all this has been known hitherto.</p>

               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That we had been for a long time in Errour; that it was a wonder God had permitted ſuch Ignorance in his Church.</hi>

Yea, not only deſpiſed, but even ſhock'd and perſecuted: For it is ordinary for the Wicked to perſecute thoſe who do not follow their Iniquities; and for Fools to deſpiſe what they underſtand not, or what they cannot comprehend.

               </argument>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>How it was poſſible for a Man to quit all the Sciences acquired after the manner of Men, that he may become a Child,</hi> when he is come to Age?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, If you do it not, you ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Jeſus Chriſt <note n="m" place="bottom">Matth. 18. 3.</note> tells this: And he cannot lye: But he preſſes this neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Child by threatning that otherwiſe we ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; which would be the greateſt evil that could befal a Man. It were better never to be born than not to be ſaved: And ſince we cannot be ſaved without becoming Children, we ought to become ſo at what Price ſoever. Would you, Sir, eſteem more the Honour of the World, or your acquired Sciences, than the Kingdom of Heaven? This would be very lamentable; ſince all the Things of this World paſs away like a Bird that cleaves the Air, and leaves no Mark of its Way: So when we ſhall have paſt through this World, nothing ſhall remain to us of our Sciences and Learning, nor yet of our Honour and Reputation: All ends with us; and if ſome retain ſtill an eſteem of our Wiſdom, after Death we are inſenſible of it. If we pleaſed our ſelves
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:104476:303"/>
while we lived here, the ſuffering for theſe Complacencies wait for us in the other World: And our having been wiſe here is ſo ſar from making us happy, that 'tis a great unhappineſs to have loſt the Kingdom of Heaven by this Wiſdom. Lay aſide, Sir, all theſe Humane Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and become a Child, though you be aged. You have need to make the more haſte; for fear leſt Time and Life fail you. Never adviſe <note n="n" place="bottom">Gal. 1. 16.</note> with Fleſh and Blood; for they deceive and corrupt us. Let us only conſult with our Divine Soul, which is reaſonable, and it will tell you, that there is nothing better or more reaſonable than to reſign our Free-will to God, who gave us it; and to ſubmit it to his government as a Little Child: That on this our Eternal Happineſs depends; and that nothing elſe can ſave us; becauſe without this Dependance there is no Salvation.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That I perceived this Truth moſt clearly, that there was no Salvation without a Dependance upon God: asking, how I might now become ignorant of the Sciences which I had heretofore acquired, ſince I could not make my ſelf not to have them?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Nothing can hurt you, if all be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to God. You cannot be ignorant of what you know by means of your Studies: But you can ſubmit all theſe Sciences to God, and look upon them as Ignorances, as in effect they are. Do not apply your Mind any longer to the Study of Sciences; and believe that they are all vain in reſpect of the Wiſdom of God. You ſhall know that you are reſigned to his Will <note n="p" place="bottom">Pſal. 73. 25, 26.</note> when you ſeek no longer for any thing upon Earth, neither Learning, nor Wiſdom, nor a deſire to know any other thing but what may render you well pleaſing to God. For he who is reſigned to him without guile, is not moved with any thing but what concerns his Glory: No other thing touches him. Whether he be learned or ignorant, is all one to him. He makes uſe of Learning in what reſpects God's Glory, and not at all to rule on the Earth: knowing well that he who is reſigned to God without Learning is as great as he who is ſo with much Learning. And even<note place="bottom">(o) Eccleſ. 37. 17, 18.</note>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:104476:304"/>
as one may be poor in Spirit, though he poſſeſſes Riches; ſo he may have much Learning, and yet for all this be ſimple in Spirit. When he ſubmits all his Learning to God, he makes uſe of it as ſeems good to him: But as long as we think to profit by it, we are not yet become Children to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. And ſince God makes appear to you, Sir, that there is no Salvation without this Dependance, let about it quickly, without conſidering whether you have Sciences or any other thing: Becauſe God can make all work together for good. A Man muſt not regard himſelf; but the Will of God, who deſires, that all Men, of what condition ſoever, keep themſelves in a Dependance upon him, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Free-wills under his Power, without deſiring to uſe them themſelves.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That abſolutely and irrevocably I reſigned my ſelf to God to be a true Child; but that I found yet ſome difficulty to forſake the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Soft, ſoft, Sir, You muſt never renounce the Holy Church. Rather die than do ſo: You muſt only renounce the Abomination which is crept into the <hi>Roman</hi> Church now. Do you not ſee that ſhe has falſified her Faith to her Lawful Husband Jeſus Chriſt, and that ſhe has not continued faithful to Him. I would be well pleaſed if you could ſhew me ſo much as one Point that ſhe obſerves of the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, or ſo much as one thing that ſhe practiſes which is not directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Life and Doctrine of her Lawful Husband, who came down from Heaven to Earth to teach her them, both by Word and Deed: All which Things are deſpiſed by her who ought to be his Spouſe. I have often ſpoke to you of her Exceſſes and her Adulteries. Would you yet hold her for the Holy Church ſince the Devil <note n="q" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. 2. 4.</note> has plac'd his Throne in her? What Weakneſs of Spirit is it, to feel a Repugnance to renounce a Thing ſo wicked, under frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Perſwaſions that ſhe is Holy? When God gave us Underſtanding and Reaſon, this was for no other end, but to make us diſcern good from evil, that we might not periſh blindfold: And now you would change the Deſigns of God by ſtifling your Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:104476:304"/>
that you may follow evil blindly: And when you ſee it ſo plainly evil you form ſome fooliſh Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that nevertheleſs it is good! This muſt needs come from a pure Infatuation of Spirit: For even Natural Reaſon diſcovers to us manifeſtly enough that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church now is not the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe ſhe does not follow her Husband in any thing; and two ſo diſtant Things cannot make an Alliance. How can you have a Repugnance to quit her who has abandoned her God? If the Beaſts and inſenſible Creatures, and all the Elements, did riſe up againſt Man when he quitted his Dependance upon his God; How ſhould not Man, who is ſo reaſonable, riſe up againſt that Church, who has quitted the Dependance upon her God becauſe ſhe will not depend any longer but upon her ſelf. One ſhould rather have a Repugnancy to remain under her, than to quit her: Or elſe we have leſs Reſentment of the Offence that is done our Creatour than the Elements and the Beaſts, or inanimate Things, who have ſtill reſented the Wrong that was done their Creatour, even at the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, <note n="r" place="bottom">Matth. 27. 51.</note> the Rocks rent, and the Sun was darkened. Have you leſs affection, Sir, for your God, than theſe Stones, that you do not reſent the continual Injuries which the Church does to God? It a beautiful Angel became a Devil for having deſired in his Heart to be equal to God, what ſhall ſhe become who prefers her ſelf to the ſame God without deſiring to give deference to him in any thing? I do even bewail, Sir, your Blindneſs in this Point; and I cannot believe that your Repugnancy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from your Reaſoning; but from ſome Habitual Concern that you have for the Church: For if you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied your Underſtanding to conſider the Original of this Repugnancy, you would ſee clearly that it proceeds from the pious affection that you have for the Church; but that you do not take her where ſhe is: For we amuſe our ſelves in this, as in other Things, with Terms and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Men: And when we hear them call the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, <hi>the Holy Church,</hi> this Word begets in us an affection for her, without diſcovering, if it be ſhe of whom they ſpeak. When they would beguile a Child, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:104476:305"/>
make him afraid of his Father, they put his Cloak and Hat upon a Stick in ſome obſcure Place; which the Infant perceiving, believes it is truly he; and fears and reſpects him. But if he draw nearer, and take by the Cloak, he perceives eaſily that he is beguiled, and that what he took for his Father, was but a Piece of Wood. Truly, Sir, in the Darkneſs in which we live at preſent, they make us ſee juſt the like, by covering <hi>Rome</hi> with the Cloak of the Holy Church, and muffling her with the Head of Jeſus Chriſt; we Fear and Reverence her, as if ſhe were our True Mother the Holy Church, Authoriſed by Jeſus Chriſt, and his Lawful Bride: But when we approach nearer, and lift up this Cloak, we ſhall ſee clearly, that 'tis nothing but Wood, inſtead of Holineſs, which can be of no uſe to us, except to warm us in the Winter Seaſon. Truly, Sir, we ought not to be ſo much Children in what regards our Eternal Salvation. We ought not to walk blindly in ſo important an Affair. If Men apply their Minds wholly to make a Stocking, or a Shoe, why ſhould not we apply them more to ſave our Souls? It is good to have <note n="s" place="bottom">Mat. 10. 16.</note> the Simplicity of the Dove with reſpect to God: For he who is reſigned to him, ought to do nothing but let himſelf be guided by him as a Little Child: But we muſt have the Prudence of the Serpent, to take heed of Men, who may deceive, or be deceived: And when they ſay, <hi>Lo the Holy Church,</hi> we muſt remark narrowly, if ſhe be truly ſo, or if it be a Fagot covered with her Garment. It is for this only that God gave us Underſtanding, that we might ſtill diſcern true Good from what is falſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in the matter of our Salvation: Becauſe all other Things are vain and periſhing, unworthy of a ſerious Application of Spirit; ſince it ought to apply it ſelf only to Eternal Things, for which we were created: And our Miſery ariſes from this that we make more ſerious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries to diſcover the Turnings and Windings of the Affairs of the World than thoſe of our Salvation. In which the Scripture has reaſon to ſay, that <note n="u" place="bottom">Luke 16. 8.</note> the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this World are wiſer than the Children of the Kingdom: Becauſe before we engage in any Place, Office or Traffick, we ſtill ſearch narrowly if it is profitable <note place="bottom">(<hi>t</hi>) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 15.</note>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:104476:305"/>
and advantagious for us: And we would take heed not to truſt to Mens Words, or to believe blindly that a Thing is good without having firſt made the Experiment of it. If we have ſo much Foreſight in what reſpects the Earth, how much more ought we to have it for that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects Heaven? We truſt our Salvation blindly to what they tell us that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is our Mother the Holy Church; and we do not dive into this Affair which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us ſo much, to know, if really ſhe has the Quality of our true Mother, and if ſhe be allied with our true Father, who is unchangeable in all his Qualities, to whom this Spouſe ought to be alwayes conformable. We muſt ſee if what they call our Mother, has the Spirit and the Works of our Father; and if we find no Likeneſs in her, we muſt renounce her, and hold her as a Deceiver and a Liar, unworthy of our Affection.</p>

                  <note n="z" place="bottom">1 Cor. 6. 15.</note>. God is the Bridegroom, and the Soul is the Bride: As it is ſaid concerning <hi>Adam;</hi>

                  <hi>Let us make Man after our own Likeneſs,</hi> becauſe it was found meet that God ſhould delight himſelf with ſomething that was like to him. For this cauſe he created the Divine and Eternal Soul, and plac'd it in the Body and Underſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Man, that it might multiply and communicate it ſelf: For it is the Property of Good to be communicative. This Divine Soul being form'd in Time, muſt live for ever, elſe it ſhould not have been Divine, nor capable of being united and ally'd to God, who created it for theſe ends. And as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> ought to have been united in Heart, Body and Will; ſo the Soul ought to be united in Love, Underſtanding, and Will with God: Not that Natural Love, nor that Humane Underſtanding, no more than our bounded Will: Becauſe all this has no Sympathy with God, and they are but the Caſe wherein God has ſhut up this Divine Soul, which is Free and Eternal, as God. This Divine Reaſon and Free-will, make the Church by the Alliance that God makes with it, which is much more ſtrait than the Alliance that this Divine Soul makes with the Animal Soul of Man, which do ſo nearly approach one another, that no Humane Spirit is able to diſtinguiſh them, no more than any can diſtinguiſh the Free and Rational VVill from God himſelf: Becauſe he has ſo ſtraitly united them, that <note n="c" place="bottom">John 17. 23. 1 Cor. 6. 15.</note> the Soul is God, and God is the Soul; as the VVill of <hi>Eve</hi> was that of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo the VVill of the Soul is that of God. By which you may ſtill diſcover, Sir, where the Spouſe of God, or the True Church is: Becauſe where ſhe is to be found, ſhe carries ſtill along with her the ſame Qualities of her VVell beloved; and when you do not find them in thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who call themſelves the Church, believe firmly that they are all Cheats: For the Spouſe of God will be alwayes comely, and there can be no Blemiſh in her: Becauſe ſhe ſhall never be parted
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:104476:306"/>
from the Qualities of her Husband, alwayes Juſt, Good, True, and All-powerful. And when you ſhall ſee <hi>Sion, Jeruſalem, Judea,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuch as you call the Church, to be fallen away from theſe Qualities, never believe that ſhe is your Mother the Holy Church. Upon theſe Accounts Jeſus Chriſt has ſo often <note n="d" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. &amp; 24. 4, 5, 11, 24, 25.</note> warned you to beware of falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets: For they come to delude and deceive many. Do not let your ſelf be deluded, Sir: For there ſhall never be but one True Church, which ſhall be united to God: VVhoſoever has not this Unity, is not the Church; but they are Seducers of the People; who under this Cloak of God's Spouſe, do ſeduce many. You muſt lift up your Head, and look on high, to ſee whence the Church took her Original; and you will perceive that the Church is no other but the Alliance that God made with the Divine Soul of Man, which he made his Spouſe, though ſhe was unworthy of it. He ſo ennobled her that he would joyn himſelf to her, and ally with her by an indiſſoluble Alliance, which can never end, for the Two Parties are Immortal, to wit, God and the Divine Soul: But to take for the Spouſe of God Perſons who are no wayes in the Spirit of God, nor in Union with him, and to reverence them as the Church, is to wrong the Honour that we owe to God. To ſee a Church ſeek the Honours, Pleaſures, and Riches of this VVorld, and to believe that ſhe is the Spouſe of God; is to derogate from her Divine Quality, and to aſcribe the Honour to Vice, that is due only to True Vertue. VVe ſhould not thus let them cover our Eyes as they do to thoſe who are going to be hanged that they may not ſee their doleful End. VVe muſt take off this Bandage, that we may look about us, and learn, where the True Church is, which can ſave us; and not ſuffer our ſelves to be led on blind-fold to Eternal Death by VVords or falſe Appearances; ſince Truth only is capable to ſave us.</p>

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:104476:307"/>
than a Woman can be the Spouſe of a Man who has never approached her. We muſt not believe that the Church conſiſts in wearing a Garment of Purple, or Red, or Fine Linnen. Theſe are rather the Marks of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the <note n="e" place="bottom">Luke 16. 19.</note> falſely Rich Man, who was buried in Hell, and the Scripture brings no other cauſe of his Damnation than theſe Faſhions of Apparel, and that he was Rich, and a Feaſter. If all theſe Things were Marks of his Damnation, why ſhould they be now a dayes the Marks of the Holy Church? God is not changeable. He cannot now unite to himſelf what he then Reprobated and Condemned. No, no, Sir; the Spouſe of God will never be vain, nor proud, nor polluted with any ſin. For ſhe <note n="f" place="bottom">Cant. 4. 7.</note> is all pure, Do not think that you are in the Church, when you are under Perſons who ſeek Riches of this World; for ſuch Souls are Adultereſſes, and have abandoned their lawful Husband, and live in Adultery <note n="g" place="bottom">Rev. 17. 2.</note> with the Kings of the Earth. Which ought to make you abhor her, inſtead of cleaving to her. If you have never met with Souls reſigned to God, you have never found the True Church: Becauſe there never was any other, and never will be hereafter. She muſt notwithſtanding be ſomewhere in the World, though ſhe were but in one only Soul: Becauſe the Works of God can never periſh. He has made this Alliance with the Soul of Man, and he will never retract it. There have been in all Times ſome who have been his True Spouſes, and reſigned to him; but at preſent they are very rare. Strive, Sir, ſo to do as that yours may be ſo, and then you ſhall not need to ſeek the Church without you. For as ſoon as your Will is reſigned to God, he unites it to himſelf, and makes your Soul his Spouſe. Whether others whom you know be ſo or not, concerns you little: And though all the Souls of Men were God's Spouſe, if yours be not, you loſe all.</p>
               <p>I asked her, <hi>Whether God had not had a True Spouſe ſtill ſince the Creation of</hi> Adam; <hi>and if the People of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the</hi> Jews, <hi>or the</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>were not his Spouſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, There have been in all Times ſome Souls among theſe People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who were reſigned to the Will of God. Theſe in particular were the True Church; but
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:104476:307"/>
not all that People: Though indeed they all called them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the People of God, yet nevertheleſs they were not ſo: For it is ſaid ſomewhere, <note n="h" place="bottom">John 8. 39.</note> If you were the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham,</hi> you would do the Works of <hi>Abraham:</hi> To ſhew, that all God's Children are not his Church or his Spouſe; but thoſe only who do the Works of the Spouſe: That is to ſay, who are joyned by a Reſignation of their Will to that of God. Thoſe are the only Spouſes of the ſame God.</p>
               <p>This Alliance of God with Man was firſt of all made when Man was created. The Soul of <hi>Adam</hi> made an Alliance with God, and became his Spouſe: But being afterwards in the Earthly Paradiſe, the Soul of <hi>Adam,</hi> though Divine, falſified its Faith to its Husband; and inſtead of taking its delight only with its God, for whom it was created, it joyned it ſelf in affection to the Creatures, and did eat of a Fruit of which God had forbidden him to eat. But as a good Husband does not ſtill put away his Wife for One Fault that ſhe has committed; ſo alſo God, the Fountain of all Goodneſs, does not caſt off the Soul of his Alliance, though ſhe had but too much merited it. On the contrary he ſeeks Her, and calls upon Her to make her return to his Friendſhip. He cries, <note n="h" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Wherefore haſt thou forſaken me? He ſhews him alſo that he lov'd him, by covering him with a Garment, to leſſen his Confuſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was aſhamed and repented, God forgives him his Fault, and enjoynes him only a ſhort Penance, to wit, That he ſhould be deprived of his Preſence, during this Life, during which he muſt labour for his Bread. But he does not at all break the Alliance he had made with him. His Soul remains ſtill the Spouſe of God, except that it is deprived for a certain time of its wonted ſight of Him, being reſtored as to other things into his Grace and Friendſhip: For God will never deſtroy <note n="i" place="bottom">Pſal. 138. 8.</note> the Works that he has made: And the Alliance he made with the Soul of Man was not broken off by his Sin: Becauſe the Mercy of God <note n="l" place="bottom">Pſal. 145. 9.</note> ſurpaſſes all his other Qualities. His Juſtice might have condemn'd Man; and his Goodneſs ordains him only Penitence for his Sin: In which he ſhews
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:104476:308"/>
the Exceſſe of his Mercie and the Love he bears to Souls, leaving them all in <hi>Adam</hi> free to be his Spouſes, none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: For he could not forgive <hi>Adam,</hi> without forgiving all his Poſterity. Becauſe he held the Wills of all Men in his: And being yet but one Man only, and one Will only, he could not pardon one without another: For neither the Body, nor Will of <hi>Adam</hi> were divided, that one part might be pardoned, and another reprobated.</p>
               <p>I ſpoke to you of this already, Sir; but it ſeems you did not ſufficiently conceive it. Therefore I curſorily repeat it, that I may the better ſhew you how God has always had a Spouſe or Church: For if he had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given <hi>Adam,</hi> none could have been the Spouſe of God: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all were become his Enemies by his ſin: Which if they had continued to be, he would not have been ſo unjuſt as to thruſt Man out of the Earthly Paradiſe, and oblige him to ſo hard a Penitence only to damn him at laſt, as Men now affirm, That God Reprobated ſome after the Sin of <hi>Adam.</hi> If this were true, he would certainly have confined them to Hell from the Moment of their Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, inſtead of ſending them yet into this World to produce a perverſe and reprobate Generation. God could not be good nor juſt in doing this: But really cruel and partial towards thoſe Reprobates, who might juſtly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure againſt him with more reaſon than the Labourers <note n="m" place="bottom">Matth. 1. 1, 15.</note> who received no more for the Work of a whole Day, than they who had wrought but for One, Two or Three Hours: For they had no reaſon; becauſe they received what was due to them, and what they had agreed for; but theſe Reprobated have Laboured as much as thoſe Elect, ſince they have all equally performed the Penitence enjoyned to <hi>Adam.</hi> And if the Father of the Family gives as much to the Laſt Comers as to the Firſt, it is not that he is partial, or that he ſavours one more than another; but that he exerciſes his Goodneſs towards the Laſt becauſe they had been no ſooner called to Work, of which they themſelves complain, ſaying, <hi>Lord, No body has employed us.</hi> So that God exerciſes towards them both Goodneſs and Juſtice. But if out of the Maſſe of <hi>Adam</hi> he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained ſome Elect, and others Reprobate; he ſhould
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:104476:308"/>
have done againſt both the one and the other of theſe Qualities. Which he cannot do: And the Goodneſs and Mercy of God <note n="n" place="bottom">Pſal. 145. 9.</note> ſpreading themſelves alwayes over all his Works; he did aſſuredly Elect and Pardon all Men in general in <hi>Adam:</hi> So that after him all they who will reſign their Free-will to his, are all his Spouſes and his Church. Therefore in all Times and in all Ages he has ſtill had a Church upon Earth, and will have till all Evil be at an end. Since <hi>Adam,</hi> many Souls have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the Will of God, as he himſelf was after his Sin, having never more re-taken their own Free-will, but left it ſtill to be governed by God, ſubjecting themſelves voluntarily to the Penitence that was enjoyn'd him. Theſe have been the Church and the Spouſes of God. <hi>Adam, Eve,</hi> and their Children until they had the uſe of their Reaſon, were the Firſt Church; and afterwards <hi>Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi> and others who in like manner reſigned their Will to God were at that Time the Second Church; and thus going on from Time to Time, this Church has always continued, either of many Souls united to the Will of God, or of few. This makes nothing to the firſt Deſign, that God had to Ally himſelf with the Soul of Man. It is ſtill his Spouſe though there were but one Soul only, as there was but one when <hi>Adam</hi> was created alone. This Number of many only makes thoſe Bleſſed who are of the Number: For God on his part, takes as much delight with one Soul only that is reſigned to Him as He would do with a Hundred Millions: For there is nothing to do with Quantity when the Buſineſs is about Quality. If an Hundred Millions of Souls are reſigned to God, they make altogether but one only Church, which could conſiſt as well in one Soul only, as in this great Number: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spouſe of God <note n="o" place="bottom">John 17. 21, 23.</note> is One: And as in Nature a Man may have as much Contentment in Marrying a Wife who is Little and Tender, as one that is Big and Lumpiſh: Without compariſon God is as much Honoured, though there were but one Soul only in the World that were reſigned to him, as if all Men in general were ſo; who only can receive themſelves the Honour of their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, every one for his own particular: For nothing can<note place="bottom">(n) <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 9.</note>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:104476:309"/>
be taken away nor added as to God, who is and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all Things. His Alliance that he has made with the Soul of Man, is not encreas'd or diminiſhed by the great or ſmall Body of his Church. He will ſtill have his Spouſe, with whom he will take his delight in the kind that he created, which was but one Man alone. She ſhall ſtill be preſerved as the Roſe among Thorns. How wicked ſoever the World may become his Church will ſtill remain there in her kind. The Church will always have her Beauty and her Qualities, as much in one Soul alone as in an Hundred Millions, which altogether would make <note n="q" place="bottom">2 Cor. 2. 6. 17, 18.</note> but one, no more than if there were but one alone. After this manner God in all Ages has had his Church upon Earth: But in how many Souls it conſiſted, is known only to God. The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were called the People of God, among whom there were aſſuredly Souls reſigned unto him. Theſe made up the Church in their Time, and no others. Even ſo among the Jewiſh People, and alſo the Catholicks. The Church of God has alwayes been among them, ſince Gods Alliance with Man could never fail: But to believe that all that Maſſe of People who call'd themſelves the People of God were the Church, is to deceive our ſelves: Becauſe there never will be any other but the Souls which of their Free-will do reſign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Will of God. All others are only Carnal and Material Churches.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That we ſtrayed much, and greatly erred, in believing that all who are called</hi> the People of God <hi>do make up</hi> the Church, <hi>and that at preſent ſhe conſiſted of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which Jeſus Chriſt authoriſed, and ſaid, that</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="bottom">Matth. 16. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>what ſhe did on Earth, ſhould be done in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Men are blind, and walk where they ſee nothing. I believe that the Spouſe of God reſides among Chriſtian People, though it were no more but in one Soul alone: But to believe that this Church conſiſts of that great Number of Perſons who are called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> is greatly to deceive our ſelves: Becauſe of them God may ſay truly, <note n="s" place="bottom">Jer. 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>My People have forſaken me:</hi> Which appears by the whole Behaviour of theſe Chriſtians now,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:104476:309"/>
who live wholly as if there were no God, every one being ſo wedded to his own Will, as if it had only been given him to ſatisfie himſelf; and uſing the Authority that God gave his Church as if they were Soveraigns and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon him. All which things are inconſiſtent with the Spouſe of God, which moves not but by the Motion of her Husband, of whom ſhe knows ſhe holds all things, and ſhe never aſcribes any thing to her ſelf. How ſhould this Maſſe of Chriſtians compoſe the Church, ſince among them we do not obſerve almoſt any who will reſign their Wills to the Will of God? And thoſe who make their Profit of the Authority that Jeſus Chriſt gave his Church are Robbers, and take what belongs to another: For when Jeſus Chriſt ſaid: <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall do here on Earth I will do in Heaven,</hi> He ſpoke to his Spouſe, and not to his Enemies, as thoſe Perſons are who cleave to their own Wills, who do very impertinently uſurp the Title of the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Spouſe of God:</hi> For his True Spouſe is in nothing contrary to her Husband: Being united by a Holy and Divine Will: So that they cannot diſclaim one another, and therefore what ſhe ſhall do on Earth ſhall be done alſo in Heaven, by their Unity of Wills, which are ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable: Though this Will be wrapt up in the Spirit and Body of the Spouſe which is yet on Earth, it is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs united to that of her Husband which is in Heaven: And therefore what the one does, the other approves: Becauſe one and the ſame thing cannot be againſt it ſelf.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her: <hi>That this Quality of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Will to that of God, was a Divine Thing, and inviſible to Bodily Eyes; asking her, how I might diſcover and know the True Church and Spouſe of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, You will perceive it ſufficiently, even by the Eyes of the Body, if you ſeriouſly apply your Spirit to diſcover her Qualities: For St. <hi>John</hi> in his <hi>Revelation</hi> paints out all her Qualities, under the Figure of a Woman who ſits in the Sun, and has the Moon under her Feet, and upon her Head Twelve Stars. This Woman is the True Church, and the only Spouſe of God. She is firſt <hi>ſeated in the Sun,</hi> that is, that the Spouſe of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:104476:310"/>
alwayes in the Light of Truth, and never turns aſide from it; that ſhe does not walk therein as a Paſſenger, but ſits in it as in her Place of Repoſe. Secondly, that ſhe has <hi>the Moon under her Feet:</hi> That is, that all Things that are mutable and changeable as the Moon, ſuch are the Goods, the Riches, the Honours and Pleaſures of this World, are all trod under feet by the Church or Spouſe of God. Thirdly, That ſhe bears <hi>on her Head Twelve Stars:</hi> Theſe are the Twelve Fruits of the Holy Spirit, with which the Spouſe of God is ſtill inſeparably adorned, becauſe the Spirit of God where he reſides is never barren: There he always brings forth his Fruits, and there alſo he ſtill beſtows his Gifts. By which, Sir, you may ſufficiently diſcover in what Soul the Church reſides. If you do not find all this Furniture, never believe blindly that the Church is in thoſe who do not poſſeſs theſe Qualities or Conditions, which are the True Marks of the Church, without which you can never own that ſhe is the True Spouſe of God: For theſe Marks are inſeparable from Her; and where you ſhall not find them, you muſt immediately deſiſt from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that you have found the Church: Becauſe there can be nothing but Deluſion where they ſay ſhe is without theſe Qualities: For ſhe never goes without them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be not amuſed, though they ſay to you, This is the Church here, or there. Do not believe it; no more than if they ſaid to you, <note n="u" place="bottom">Matth. 24. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Lo here is Chriſt, or there; go not out:</hi> For where ever He is, He operates all theſe Vertues with which you ſee the Woman in the <hi>Revelation</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That if all theſe Qualities were required in the Spouſe of God, I muſt ingenuouſly declare, that I do not know the Church: Becauſe I know no Body who has theſe Qualities of the Woman in the</hi> Revelation; <hi>and that the</hi> Roman <hi>Church was directly oppoſite thereto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, So far as you ſee the <hi>Roman</hi> Church oppoſite to them, ſo far you ſee her removed from being the Spouſe of God, which never goes <note n="x" place="bottom">Pſal. 45. 10, 14, 15.</note> without theſe Ornaments. She is always true, and theſe <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are in many Lyes. They often condemn Saints for Hereticks: And if they knew me, I ſhould be in the ſame condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:104476:310"/>
For they cannot endure the Truth that reproves them; but they would continue to Rule as the Spouſe of God, though they have quitted the Truth, ſaying; VVhat they bind and looſe, ſhall be ſo done in Heaven: Even as if they had continued the Spouſe of God, and united to his Will! From which they are far removed: For they have nothing before their Eyes but their own Glory. They are alſo very far from having the Moon under their Feet: For Honour pleaſes them; and they wear it rather on their Head, than tread it under Feet; and they delight in Pleaſures, of which they will not deprive themſelves; as far as they can poſſeſs them, they will not put them under their Feet; no more than Riches, which they carry rather in their Hearts than make them their Footſtool. By which you may aſſuredly judge that the Church of God cannot reſide there; but the Whore, who has falſified her Faith to her Lawful Husband: For while ſhe bears the Name of the Church, ſhe lives in continual Adulteries, which ſhe knows how to cover ſo well with Things lawful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that it ſeems to all who have no good Judgment, that theſe Whoredoms are Vertues. Muſt not one have loſt his Judgment if he have a Repugnance to quit this Infamous Strumpet, who has for ſo long time by-gone wallowed in all ſort of Filthineſs under the colour of Holineſs, and of the Spouſe of God, without having diſcovered her Infamies, which would be ſo manifeſt to all the VVorld if they had removed that Bandage of blind Obedience which has ſo cloſely ſhut their Eyes? If you know none, Sir, who has the Qualities of the VVoman in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> you may ſay in truth that you do not know the Church; and pray to God that he may let you know Her.</p>

               </argument>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, The Goſpel is your Mother; becauſe it proceeded from the Wiſdom of God, this is what you ought to follow, without ſeeking for an imaginary Church among Men, The Word of God is the Nouriſhment of our Soul: The Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt is the Rule that we muſt follow to become the Spouſe of God. This is the Seed that begets that Spouſe. Do not ſearch <note n="y" place="bottom">Cant. 3. 2, 3.</note> through the Streets or Corners of the City for your Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved; for you will be beaten by the Souldiers that ſtand there.

True Spouſe, and his Holy Church, which is the ſame thing. The Spouſe of God is the Church, and the Church is the Spouſe of God; and nothing can be it but they who have abandoned their Free-will to the Will of God. Therefore I conjure you never to tye your ſelf to any other Thing: For God ſtill forms his Spouſes by <note n="z" place="bottom">1 Pet. 1. 22.</note> his Word. When <hi>Adam</hi> offended, he re-called him by his Word; which being by him heard and followed, he thereby returned into a Dependance upon God. And all the World having ſhaken off their Dependance upon God, he preſerved <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family therein by his Word; which being heard and followed, they were ſaved from the Waters of the Deluge: And the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who heard this Word, and followed it, eſcaped the being drowned in the Red-Sea: And thoſe among the <hi>Jews</hi> who heard the Words of Jeſus Chriſt became his Spouſes: Whom we alſo may imitate: Becauſe the ſame Word is left us in Writing, and we may become the Church, or Spouſe of God, if we will hear and follow it. We need not turn here or there; but rather take the Thing in its Source, and ſee the Obligation we have of being reſigned to God; and having through our Perverſeneſs quitted this SELF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RESIGNATION, the Means of recovering it are marked out in the Goſpel, which Jeſus Chriſt has brought us upon Earth. It is this, Sir, that you muſt follow.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt in his Goſpel had not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly taught this Dependance of our Will upon that of God, as ſhe deduc'd it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt had no other Scope in all his Doctrines but to bring back the Soul of Man into that Dependance upon God, from whence he had turned away; and that if he taught any other Thing it was only to diſcover to Men the Things they had done, or might do in Time coming, which hindred this Dependance: For otherwiſe, He would never have taught any other Thing, but that we ought directly to ſubject our Will to that of God: But ſeeing He found Men ſo far from this Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; and that they were diſtracted from it by ſo many different Means, it was neceſſary that He ſhould let them ſee in particular the Things that withdrew them from
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:104476:312"/>
this Dependance upon God: For they had Lorded it with their own Wills, therefore he tells them, that <note n="a" place="bottom">Luke 14. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>they who do not deny themſelves cannot be his Diſciples,</hi> that no Body might flatter himſelf in believing he might be ſaved though he ſhould follow his own Will: And ſeeing that every one ſet their Affections upon the periſhing Goods of this World, he ſayes to them, <note n="b" place="bottom">Matth. 19. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Sell all that you have, and follow me:</hi> Becauſe he knew no Body could be reſigned to God while their Affections were ſet on Earthly Things: Becauſe the Love of God is incompatible with the Love of Riches. And ſeeing that Men had ſuch Natural Affections towards Father and Mother, Siſters, or Brethren, or Lands and Houſes, he ſayes, <note n="c" place="bottom">Matth. 19. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>He that quits all theſe things for my Name, ſhall have a hundred fold and Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting:</hi> To make us underſtand, that he who ſhould abandon all theſe things, would be well diſpoſed to reſign himſelf to the Will of God, which Self-reſignation would aſſuredly give him Life Eternal. Thus of all the other Evangelical Counſels. They were taught for no other end but to diſcover to Man all theſe Things which might remove him from this <hi>SELF-RESIGNATION.</hi> For if it had not been neceſſary to make known all theſe Things in particular by which Man was entirely withdrawn from God; He himſelf would not have come upon the Earth; but would have cauſed tell by ſome Prophet in few Words, That to be ſaved Man muſt reſign his Will to that of God; as he had often ſpoke in this manner in paſt Times by the Mouth of his Prophets. But the Compaſſion of God was ſo abundant towards the Miſery of Sinners that He reſolves to become Man Himſelf, that he might pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably teach him all he muſt do and avoid to attain to this RESIGNATION of our Will to that of God, which was the only Thing eſſentially neceſſary: For all the Commands of God, all the Prophets, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel, are no other thing but Voices which cry, <hi>That to be ſaved we muſt reſign our Will to that of God,</hi> though by accident they teach the particular Means to attain to this <hi>Self-Reſignation.</hi> I adviſe you, Sir, to take up in their plain Literal Sence theſe Counſels of the Goſpel, which
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:104476:312"/>
will certainly make you attain to this ſo much deſired Dependance upon God; for they are given only to ſerve as moſt profitable Means to bring us to this End. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member alwayes that this is the Firſt and Only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that God gave us, and the only End for which we are created: For if we have not reſigned our Will to the Will of God, we can never be his Spouſes, nor take our delight with him: Becauſe our Self-will does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reſiſt His, and can never enter in a perfect Union, ſince it only aims at and reſpects the Earth; and the Will of God only tends to and aims at Eternal Things. There can never be a Sympathy and Reſemblance between Two ſo diſtant Objects, as Time and Eternity are. By which you may ſee, Sir, that all the Doctrine of Jeſus, with all the other Laws, have no other Scope, but to make Men return to a Dependance upon God, after they have turned away from it. And though Jeſus Chriſt does not ſay directly that to be ſaved we muſt thus depend upon God; yet He ſayes it indirectly by His Words and Works: ſince they ſhew what we muſt do and avoid to attain to this Dependance, which is the only Eſſential Commandment.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>It was very deſirable that all the Men of the World ſhould hear this Leſſon, That to be ſaved we need only reſign our Free-will to God: That it were good to lay aſide all theſe other Means of Salvation, Precepts and Laws, even that of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> It were very good, Sir, that all the World knew that only Dependance upon God is neceſſary to Salvation; that no Body might any longer take the Means for the End: But to lay aſide all Laws, and even that of the Goſpel, is not at all adviſable: Becauſe God did not give them unprofitably; but as True Means that lead to this Dependance. Make a little Experiment on your ſelf, Sir, to ſee if you can come to this Dependance without any Means. I fear greatly you ſhould come too ſhort to leap ſo far all at one Leap. If you do it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in a good time: you have no need of other Things; but you muſt take good heed, that you be not deceived: Becauſe we are ordinarily enclined to believe well of our ſelves. One will ſometimes think he is reſigned to God when yet he has ſtill ſome Earthly Affection. For this cauſe it is better to make a Tryal of it: For you cannot tell if your Affections be ſet upon your Parents, Friends,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:104476:313"/>
Land, Houſe, Wealth, if you cannot quit them without Trouble. This would be as a Touchſtone if you feel your Heart ſo diſingaged from all theſe Things, that you can willingly loſe them: For in effect, when a Soul is truly reſigned unto God, all theſe Things are a Burthen to it, and become often a Hindrance; and in his Heart he wiſhes to be delivered from them, if ſuch were the Will of God: But ſo long as he does not truly feel theſe Diſpoſitions in the Bottom of his Soul, it were better for him to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace every one of the Evangelical Counſels, and to force himſelf to practice them: Not as the End; but as the true Means that lead to the End. If we underſtood aright the Commandments of God, the Firſt of all is, To love God with all our Heart. This LOVE is that neceſſary DEPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DANCE, to which we will not ſubmit but by this Love. For to Depend, to Love, and to Adore God, or to be Reſigned to Him, is all the ſame Thing. We can never reſign our ſelves to God, without loving and eſteeming Him, and alſo we cannot love and adore Him without reſigning our ſelves to Him, ſince He deſires it: For we willingly give our ſelves to Him whom we love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. So that the obſerving the Commandments of God does certainly lead us to this Self-Reſignation, as the Counſels of the Goſpel do alſo; for he that denies himſelf and all that he poſſeſſes, muſt of neceſſity depend upon God: Becauſe our Heart cannot be without loving ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and if we no longer love any Created Thing, we ſhall certainly love our Creator, and if we love Him, we ſhall voluntarily reſign our ſelves unto Him. So that he who obſerves the Commands of God and the Evangelical Law, is certainly reſigned to the Will of God; and he who lives in this Self-Reſignation, does aſſuredly obſerve the Commandments of God, and the Doctrine of the Goſpel, even though he ſhould not Cull them out in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and ſhould not fix preciſely upon each of them. But the Miſery of Men now is, that they neither do the one nor the other. They do not obſerve the Commandment of loving God with all their Heart, nor yet the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Counſels. And in the mean time they are all ready to raiſe Quarrels and Diſputes about this Word Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, becauſe it is not preciſely ſet down in the Scripture: As if our Salvation depended upon Words and Terms, and not upon the Eſſence of the Thing, which in it ſelf
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:104476:313"/>
comprehends all the Terms that can ſignifie it: For when it is ſaid that our Will muſt be ſubjected and depend upon that of God, it is as much as if they ſaid, that we muſt obſerve the Commandments of God, and alſo the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Goſpel: Becauſe both of theſe conſiſt in the Reſignation of our Will to God. But Men are ſo dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate in this Age, that they are enclined more to diſpute than to diſcover the Eſſence of that which is neceſſary for their Salvation. If this were not the Unhappineſs of Men now, no Body would call in queſtion whether Man ought to reſign his Will to that of God if he deſire to be ſaved: Becauſe there is nothing more reaſonable, nor better, nor more juſt, than that a Creature reſign himſelf to the Will of its Creatour, and depend upon him from whom it has received All.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That there was no debate to be made about ſo certain Truths: That every one ought to ſubmit their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this Dependance upon God, which aſſuredly was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in all Ages and under all Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, Man has nothing in him that is worthy of God but his Divine Soul, which conſiſts in Reaſon, and Free-will: And if we do not yield it up to the Will of God, what is it that we can offer or give Him? He has no need of Gold, or Silver or Land, or Fleſh, or any Thing that is Natural: Becauſe his Being is wholly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. He could not therefore demand any other thing of Man but this Reaſon and Free-will: As in effect he has not demanded, and will not demand any other thing. When he ſaid in his Commandments, that we muſt not Kill, nor Steal, and ſo forth, this was only to draw Man from his Self-love, which led him to all theſe Things: And when He taught ſo particularly by the Goſpel what we ought to do and avoid, it was becauſe Man followed his own Will in ſo many divers things: It was needful to point out to him every particular wherein he went aſtray, and that for this End only, that he might return to this Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Will of God: For otherwiſe, many Things that Man had were not evil in themſelves, as Father, Mother, Brother, Siſters, Lands, Houſes, Riches; all which Things might be very well poſſeſt, if there were a Dependance of his Will upon that of God. For God did not forbid them by the Ten Commandments; becauſe Men were not then ſo abſolutely Maſters of their own
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:104476:314"/>
Wills as they became ſince, for they are not ſatisfied now to uſe and follow their own Wills during ſome Paſſion of Anger, or Swearing, or the like; but they follow them in all Things, loving Father, Mother, and the reſt, out of pure Self-love: For if this were not Self-love, Jeſus Chriſt would draw no Body from it: ſince he ſayes, That we ought to love our Neighbour as our ſelves: And ſeveral other times he exhorts, that we <note n="d" place="bottom">John 13. 34.</note> love one another: By which it appears evidently that he would only hinder us from following our Self-will in all theſe Things: becauſe all ſorts of Sins conſiſt in the following our own Wills; as all Vertue conſiſts in reſigning our Will to that of God. Theſe are the Two Things which can Save and Damn us: Though they be explained all at length by the Doctrine of the Goſpel, yet they are all abridged by <hi>the reſigning of our own Will to God;</hi> or <hi>by the following our own Will.</hi> In this all Good and Evil does conſiſt: Of which we are free to make a Choice, and to follow the one or the other. For there is no Salvation without reſigning our Will to God, and no Damnation without following our own Will. Let them grow old in Study, and turn over all the Books of the World, and let them treaſure up all the Sciences, they can never find a Truth more clear, than, <hi>That all Vertues and Salvation conſiſt in the Reſignation of our Will to that of God;</hi> and that, <hi>All Sins and Damnation conſiſt in following our own Will.</hi> This is an Eternal. Truth which will never change. Every one ſhould lay it to Heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it concerns him: For it is a general Rule, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects every one, Rich, Poor, Learned, Ignorant. Let us Work, and Faſt, and Pray, and do all that we can; if withal we follow our own Will, aſſuredly we ſhall be damned: And on the other hand, Let us take reſt, and Eat, and Drink, and do every other thing in a Dependance upon the Will of God, we ſhall certainly be ſaved: For God has nothing to do with the Offerings of Metals, but that of our Free-will, which he has reſerved for himſelf: Of which he gave a Figure by the forbidding <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of One Tree only; Jeſus Chriſt gave us this Concluſion alſo when after ſo many Inſtructions he ſaid, <note n="e" place="bottom">John 6. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>I came not to do mine own Will, but the Will of him that ſent me.</hi> If
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:104476:314"/>
Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who was the Word of God, lays down his own Will, and ſayes that he came not into this World to follow it, but that of his Father; what then ought to be done and ſaid by the Reaſonable Creature who deſires to ſave its Soul, ſince it is the Will of God that it ſhould be ſaved? Nevertheleſs it will not be ſaved without this Self-RESIGNATION.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to her, <hi>That I wiſh'd from the Bottom of my Soul, that never any Body had taught any other thing but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance that we owe to God; ſince in truth all is comprehended in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She ſaid:</hi> Sir, I hope your Wiſh ſhall very ſhortly be accompliſhed, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt promiſed it by a Parable where it is ſaid: <note n="f" place="bottom">Matth. 13. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Kingdom of Heaven is like to Leaven which a Woman took, and put into Three Meaſures of Meal till the whole was leavened.</hi> And becauſe now we are not far from the Kingdom of Heaven, God makes us to underſtand all that he ſaid in former Times by Parables, for then the Time was not come to make theſe Things be manifeſtly underſtood, becauſe the World who then liv'd did not ſee the Things ſignified by all theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables. But at preſent, we are arrived at the end <note n="g" place="bottom">1 Cor. 10. 11.</note> of the Laſt Times, and <note n="h" place="bottom">Jer. 31. 24.</note> ſhall ſee the Things fulfilled which are uttered by Similitudes. He ſayes firſt, <hi>That the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is like to Leaven,</hi> which a Woman took; as if he had ſaid, The Kingdom of Heaven will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by a Woman, who taking the Old, the Firſt and only Eſſential Commandment OF RESIGNING OUR WILL to that of God, ſhe will put it in the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in the Written <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Law, and in the Evangelical Law; which are <hi>the Three Meaſures of Meal;</hi> and that God ſent his Word, theſe Three ſeveral Times, to ſerve for Bread and Nouriſhment to our Souls. And it ſeems this Word, though ſent after different wayes, has not been converted into Bread; becauſe ſo few have nouriſhed their Souls by it; and this Food has remained in the Meal even till now. Very few reſigned themſelves to God, during the Law of Nature; ſince at the Time of the Deluge, <hi>Noah</hi> only with his Family were ſaved, and only <note n="i" place="bottom">1 Pet. 3. 20.</note>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:104476:315"/>
Eight Perſons of all the World eſcaped the Flood. And in the Written Law how few alſo were abandoned to God? Since <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo ſuddenly broke <note n="l" place="bottom">Exod. 32. 19.</note> the Stone becauſe he ſaw that few would obſerve the Commandments which were written in it. And in the Goſpel-Law, how few have followed the Word of God? Twelve Apoſtles: Among whom one forſook it to go hang himſelf; and ſome Diſciples, among whom divers <note n="m" place="bottom">John 6. 66.</note> alſo abandoned Jeſus Chriſt. So that this Divine Word has ſerved for Nouriſhment for few Perſons. But in the Fulneſs of Time in which we enter at preſent, this Divine Word ſhall have its full <note n="n" place="bottom">Iſa. 55. 10, 11.</note> effect, and the Holy Spirit <note n="o" place="bottom">Joel 2. 28.</note> ſhall be poured out upon all Fleſh, Young and Old, Great and Small, ſo that all ſhall Propheſie, and ſpeak Languages, and do more Wonders <note n="p" place="bottom">Iſa. 35.</note> than <hi>Moſes</hi> did with all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Prophets, who altogether were but <note n="q" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6. &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1.</note> Figures of the Things figured which we ſhall ſee very ſhortly come to paſs, which will be more perfect than all that the Apoſtles and their Diſciples did, yea even Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; becauſe we are arrived at the Fulneſs of Time, of which the Apoſtles ſays, <note n="t" place="bottom">1 Cor. 13. 10, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>That they ſhall underſtand and propheſie in full perfection.</hi> What they only did in part, ſhall be in Fulneſs and Accompliſhment; becauſe then <note n="u" place="bottom">Jer. 31. 3, 4. Zach. 13. 8, 9.</note> all Men in general who ſhall remain on the Earth ſhall ſubject their Wills to that of God, who will govern <note n="x" place="bottom">Iſa. 33. 2. Zach. 14. 9.</note> them according to his pleaſure and without the contradiction of their own Wills. Then there will be no longer need of <note n="y" place="bottom">Jer. 31. 34. Rev. 21. 22.</note> Laws, no more Conſtraint, no more Commands, no more Churches of Stone, no more Sacraments, no more Prayers, no more Deſires and Aſpirations, becauſe the Souls of all Men ſhall be filled with the Will of God, and ſhall have nothing more to ask Him by Prayer, nor have any more need of the Sacraments to obtain his Graces, which are all contained in the Accompliſhment of his Will, which will operate in them without having need to go to Church, their Soul being the True Temple where the Will of God<note place="bottom">(<hi>r</hi>) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9.</note> 
                  <note place="bottom">(<hi>s</hi>) <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 12.</note>

reſides, which has no need of Law or Commandment, the Will of God being a Law to it ſelf, by Pure Love, without any conſtraint. Lo this is the Eſtate of Bleſſed Souls who ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. This <note n="z" place="bottom">Matth. 13. 44.</note> is that Hidden Treaſure of the Kingdom of Heaven, and he that diſcovers it ought to ſell all that he has to obtain it. It is to be bought very eaſily. There is no need of being Rich or of Noble Blood: No need of Learning many Languages, nor of paſſing the Degrees of the Schools and Univerſities: No need to enter into Cloyſters of ſtrict Obſervance, nor to cruſh the Body with hard Diſcipline, Watchings, Faſtings and other Bodily Mortifications: No need to learn to Read, Write, or any other Curious Art: Nor yet is there need of peruſing ſo many Spiritual Books with which the World is now full, which Teach ſo many Methods of Perfection, ſo many Steps to aſcend to Vertue, ſo many Means to find God. No, Sir, all theſe Things are not neceſſary; becauſe there is but ONE THING ONLY ſo, which is, TO RESIGN OUR WILL TO THE WILL OF GOD. Lo this is <hi>the Leaven that leavens the whole Lump</hi> of the Law of Nature, that of the Jews and that of the Goſpel: Becauſe this Subjection of our Will to God comprehends all in it, and gives us an Entry into the Kingdom of Heaven. Lo this is all I have to ſay to you, and bid you Adieu for ever, Remaining your very Affectionate in a Dependance on the Will of God.</p>
