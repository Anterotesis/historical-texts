            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O thintente good children that you maye the better vnderstande the lawe of the tenne commaundemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, you muste firste of all knowe, that God gaue to Moses the ten commaundementes, writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in two tables of stone, wherfore they be diuided in two partes. In the first table were written the three firste commaundementes, pertaynynge to God, whiche teache vs howe we shoulde behaue our selues toward God, as well inwardelye in harte and mynde, as outwardly in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and deades. In thother table were grauen seuen preceptes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teynynge to oure neyghboures, whiche teache vs howe we oughte to ordre our selues towardes our Prynces, magistrates and rulers,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:9778:15"/>
towardes oure wyues children &amp; seruauntes and towardes all sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of men, teachynge vs that we shoulde not be dysobedient, that we do wronge to no man, that we hurt no man, that we ley not in wayte to kyll anye man, that we defloure not other mennes wyfes, and to be shorte, that we hurte not our neighboures, neither in body, goods nor good name.</p>
               <p>But nowe let vs consyder the first commaundement, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claracion of the same. I am the Lorde thy God, thou shalte haue none other goddes but me. This commaundemente good children, teacheth vs howe we ought to vse oure hartes towarde God. Firste that we ought to acknoulege with all our harte, that God made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earthe and all thinges conteyned therin, and to take hym
<pb facs="tcp:9778:16"/>
onely to be the true God and to be our God. Secondarely this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement teacheth vs to feare him, as a lyuyng God, because he doeth punyshe the vngodlye, and to cleaue vnto him with a sure faith, because he is true and faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full and doeth not deceyue vs in any thing, whiche he hath spoken or promysed. Thyrdly this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement teacheth vs to loue him with all our heart, for of him we receiue oure lyfe, oure breath, oure health, and all other gyftes both bodyly and goostly. And we haue not the least of his giftes by our desertes, but he poureth them all vpon vs frely, through his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodnes and endles mercy. Contrarywise we ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue into our hertes as God any creature eyther in heauen or in earth, that is to saye, we oughte to
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:9778:16"/>
feare no creature neither in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor in earth so much as God, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought we to put such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce &amp; truste in any thynge, neyther should we so hartily loue any crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture as our Lorde God omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. For yf we attribute to anye creature so much feare, trust, loue as apperteyneth only to him that made all creatures, by and by we make that creature our God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of it we frame to oure selues an Ydoll. The whiche is a very hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, an abominable &amp; horrible sinne, directly against the first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the first and chefest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God. Therefore suche greate offences the trewe and lyuinge Lorde God will not leaue vnpunished, for he hymselfe sayeth: I am the Lorde, my title &amp; my name is the Lorde, I wyl not gyue my glorye to another: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
<pb facs="tcp:9778:17"/>
therby that he wyll not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that any other thinge shoulde be estemed as God besydes hymselfe, or that we shoulde gyue godly honoure in heart, affection woorde or deede to anye creature, but onely to hym that was neuer created, and yet dyd create all thinges.</p>
               <p>But here peraduenture you wil muse good children, askyng this question: How can we haue other goddes before the Lorde, seeynge there is but one God, one Lorde, whiche hathe made heauen and yearth. To thys I aunswere that in deede there is none other God but that most excellent and omnipotent Lorde. Ley sure hold on this article w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a stedfast faithe good children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beleue this, dowb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nothing therin, cleaue surely to this rocke. But yet this not
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:9778:17"/>
withstandyng, fooles, infidels, &amp; vngodlye men, take some other thing for theyr God, the which in dede is not god, nor can be by any meanes. For lyke as many times we take some men for honest, riche or noble, whiche be not so in dede: so oftentimes we feare something asmuche as we do God, whiche is not God in dede. And of creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res we make goddes thre manner of wayes,</p>
               <p>The fyrst is, when a man fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth anye creature, and thynketh thus with himself, yf such a thing be taken away from me, yf such a greate man be angrye wyth me, yf I escape not suche a daungier: then I am vtterly vndone, then I knowe not whether to runne for ayde and succoure, whether then shall I goo? who shall saue or helpe me? yf thou haue anye suche
<pb facs="tcp:9778:18"/>
thought of any creature, trewly in thine harte thou makest it a God, althoughe with thy mouthe thou doest not call it God. And this affeccion lieth lurckynge so deap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hydde within manye mens har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that they theimselfes scaselye feale or perceaue it. But this feare oughte to be remoued farre from vs. For we must cleaue stedfastly by faithe to the trew and lyuynge God, and in all kynde of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie reason on this faschion. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe men of greate power be myne enemyes, althoughe this or that perrell doeth presse me verye sore, although I see nothinge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore myne eyes but present deathe or dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, yet wyl I not despaire, yet will I not mystrust God, yet wyl I not hurt my soule w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sinne. For I am sure that this creature whiche so sore persecuteth, vexeth
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:9778:18"/>
or troubleth me, is no God, but is vnder the hand &amp; power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trew lyuinge God: I knowe that one heere of my heade can not be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away from me, without the wil of hym, that is onelye and alone the trew liuing god. He is my maker my lord &amp; my god, him wil I feare more then the mighty power of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, more then the crafty ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of myne enemyes; yea more then any creature in heauen or in earthe. Yf I be wrongfully entreated, and do suffer iniustli, he can easely delyuer me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue me, that no parrel shal touch me.</p>
               <p>The second way is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men put their hole confidence in other thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges than in God, and haue these or suche lyke thoughtes wythin themselfes. I woulde I hadde suche riches or landes, I woulde

suche a man were my frende, then shoulde I be ryche, happye and blessed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should I be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended and armed agaynste all chaunces that maye happen vnto me in thys worlde. They that thinke thus, haue such riches landes and creatures for a God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although with their tongue they say not so, yea althoughe thys af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection lye hidde in our hearte so secretly, that we our selfes shoulde scantly knowe of it. But the godly maye not suffer any such though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to entre in to their heartes, but ought thus to reason with theim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Althoughe I haue veraye great aboundance of frendes and riches, although I flowe in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures honor and glorye, and in all worldely thynges whyche a man can desire, yet by these thynges I haue not true saluation. For these
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:9778:20"/>
creatures are not God, wherfore they can not saue me, neither dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me from the tyrannie of the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyll or the wrath of God. But the lorde is God alone. Yf I shal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please him, he is able to take al my frendes and riches away from me, or elles otherwayes to brynge to passe that all these thynges shall worke my distructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore he alone is to be feared, and in hym alone we must fasten the anker of our trust and confidence.</p>
               <p>The thirde way is when a man so hartly loueth and delighteth in any thyng besydes God, that for it he doeth and suffereth willingly all thynges that are to be done or suffered, not greatly regardynge whether it pleaseth or dyspleaseth God, then this man maketh thys creature (whiche he so feruently lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth) his god, although in wordes
<pb facs="tcp:9778:21"/>
he doth not vtter it.</p>
               <p>But let Christian people weede out from the botome of their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes the rootes of suche inordinate loue of any creature. And let them thinke after thys sorte, wherefore shoulde I offende God for this or that thing, I know that this lucre or this honor vpon the whiche I am tempted and do somuch set my harte, is not God, it is but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which can not saue me, nether delyuer me from death, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduersite. Wherefore I wyll loue only my God wyth all myne harte, I wyll do all thynges for his sake chiefly, and I wyll onely aboue all thynges obey him.</p>
               <p>Hytherto you haue herde how by these thre waies, by fearing, by trustyng, and by louyng, we maie easely make a God of a creature, whiche in dede is no God but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="xiiii" facs="tcp:9778:21"/>
an ydoll, set vp by oure awne phantasie. But this is an horrible sinne against the first commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, and so muche the more parrellous, because it lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the corners of mannes hart most secretly. The worlde is ful of this synne, and specially they that haue hypocrite hartes, for all their paynted holynes, are infected with the rustenes of these vices. And to thentent that you maye the better knowe these haynous offenses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the first commaundemente and the soner eschewe them, I will declare them vnto you, by a fewe and shorte examples.

do threaten commen plages or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, by and by they tremble for feare, and not castynge theyre hope and trust in God, they be soo amased that they can not tel whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to runne to auoyde the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Other ther be that thinke, that when the Sonne, Moone, or any other planetes is in this or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> signe, it is an vnlucky thinge to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryse this or that, and vpon suche dismolde daies (as they call them) they wyll begyn no new enterprise, because they thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it shulde not haue good successe or prosperous ende. And many lyke kyndes of y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrye is vsed euen among chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten people. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet Hiere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie doth expressely forbyd this in the .x. chapter, sayng. Feare not the signes of the skie, as the hethen do. Furthermore manye there be that stande in suche awe to tyrannes
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:9778:22"/>
that for feare of them they denye the trew word of God. These me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take tyrannes, and rulers of this worlde for goddes. For they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyne, that yf suche men fauoure them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei shalbe safe for euer. But the prophete Dauid in the .cxlvi. psalme doth gyue contrarie counsel sayng thus. Put not your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in princes, in the sonnes of men, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is no saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>Some men also put their hole affiaunce in money, and phantesie that they whiche haue plentye of money can lacke nothing. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they gyue themselfes holye to couetusnes &amp; to the desier to hurd vp riches, they set their minde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on filthy lucre, they scratche what they can, not regardynge whether they get by right or by wrong. Suche men wurship their riches for their God. But saint Paule in
<pb facs="tcp:9778:23"/>
the .iii. chapter to the Colossians saieth. Forsake couetusnes whiche is a seruice to ydolles.</p>
               <p>Some set their trust in their owne wourkes, thinkyng that by them they may be deliuered from synne, reconcyled to the fauour of God, iustified before him, and by them also to atteyne eternal saluacion. These haue their merites &amp; wour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes in the steade of God. This is the greatest ydolatrie that can be vnder the sunne, and a playne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall of the fayth in christ, as here after it shall be declared vnto you at large in the treatise of fayth. Other ther be that be seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to their owne belyes gyuynge theim selues holly to eatynge and dryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, &amp; bodely pleasures, somuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bodily pleasures they eyther dispise or elles forget God. Such men make their belie
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:9778:23"/>
their God, as saint Paule writeth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saying. Some therbe which sellyng the wourde of God do tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che peruersely whose God is their belye. But that thinge where in they do nowe glorye, shalbe their confusion. By these examples you maye easelye perceaue, howe by to muche fearing, trusting and louyng, we make a God of a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, which in dede is not God. And besydes these abuses, ther is an other that maketh an ydoll of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> trew and lyuynge God. And that is when we imagyn by oure owne heades an other forme or shape of god &amp; his wil, than is true in dede, and otherwise tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he himself hath declared to vs in his wourde. As for an example, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we beleue that God is a bodely thynge hauynge handes, fete &amp; other membres lyke a man, or that he is more pleased
<pb facs="tcp:9778:24"/>
wyth wearynge of a graye fryars coule or halowed garmentes, than with any other semely apparel, or that he delighte with our wilwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes and worshyppynges, whyche he neuer commaunded, but we of our braynes haue deuysed theym. Suche phantasie and false opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I saye, maketh an ydoll of the trewe God, &amp; it is a great offence against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first &amp; chiefe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But of thys you shal heare more in other sermons.</p>
               <p>Wherfore good children take hede of suche ymaginations that you frame not to your selfes with in the temple of youre hartes anye straunge god or ydoll. But suffer the lorde to be your God, for he doeth offer himself very louingly and with a fatherly affection, to be your God. Therfore he sayeth to eache of you, I am the Lorde thy
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:9778:24"/>
God, that is to saye, I am youre lorde and your father, &amp; I woulde fayne that you should take me for your veray God onely. Yf I am your Lorde, where is the feare dewe vnto me? Onely feare me as your Lorde, obey me with al your hart, trust in me, praye to me, call vpon me, and loue me good children as your father.</p>
               <p>Yt were our bounden dewtye, to praye vnto him with most feruent desier, that he woulde vouchesafe to be our God. But his goodnes is somuche inclyned towarde vs, that he preuentethe vs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we desiere hym, he offereth himselfe to vs, saying. I am the Lorde thy God, onely acknowlege me for God. When he sayth I am thy God, it is asmuche as yf he shoulde saye, I wil powre all kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of benefites vpon thee, what

               <p>Now good children, dyligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learne ye this lesson, and graue it into youre memories: So you shal loue God, and put your trust in him. For this is the meanynge of this first commaundement that we ought to feare &amp; loue the Lord God, aboue all thing, &amp; fasten our hope in him. Wherfore good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with all dilygence learne you this rule. And when this question shalbe demaunded of you, how do you vndrestand the first commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement? then shal ye answer thus. In this precept we be commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to feare and loue God with al

oure harte, and to put oure whole trust and confidence in him.</p>

                  <p>Now ye haue hearde good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in a briefe summe, the trewe sincere and playne exposition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first commaundement, beare away I praye you this doctrine, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlye recorde it, walke in the feare of the Lorde, that you trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse not these commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dementes. For what soeuer God byddeth, that is right, iust, good and holye, what soeuer he forbiddeth, that is wrong, vniust, euil and synne. He himselfe requireth of vs, to kepe his commaundementes, and not dispise them. For he saith. I am the Lorde thy God,<note place="margin">Exo. xx.</note> a stronge and a ielous God, whiche do punyshe the children y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> do hate me, euen to the thirde &amp; fourth generacion, for the iniquite of their parentes. And
<pb facs="tcp:9778:26"/>
contrariwyse, I do shewe mercy to a thousande generacions of them that loue me &amp; kepe my commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes. In these wourdes God dothe threaten greuous punyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to all them that breake these commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, wherefore it is our dewtie, to feare his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation &amp; punishment &amp; not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke his wrathe vpon vs by oure disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

                     <pb facs="tcp:9778:27"/>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E haue herd good children in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sermon, that all maner of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie is forbyd by this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thou shalt haue none other Gods but me. Where also it was declared vnto you, howe you may commit spirituall ydolatrie, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer muche fearyng, trustynge and louyng of creatures. But nowe I wyll speake of the moost grosse y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, whiche standeth in wour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppynge of ymages, eyther of creatures or of God himselfe. And this ydolatrye is forbyde by expresse wordes in this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, where God sayeth thus.</p>
                  <q>¶Thou shalt make the no graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ymage / nor any lykenesse of anye thynge
<pb facs="tcp:9778:27"/>
which is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue / or in earth benethe / or in the water vnder the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the. Thou shalt not bow downe vnto it / nor wour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship it.</q>
                  <p>These wordes (by most interpre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tors of late tyme belonge to the first commaundement, althoughe after the interpretation of manye au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient autors they be the seconde commaundement) in whiche wour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des it is to be noted, that it is not withoute greate cause, that God with so playne and expresse words doth forbydde wourshyppynge of ymages. For he sawe that mans corrupte nature fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firste tyme that he fell from God, hathe euer ben enclined and redy to ydolatry, and to bowe downe to creatures,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:28"/>
rather than to looke vp to God that made him. Wherfore he inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth all occations of the same. God did also forsee, that in the lat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter dayes men should come which woulde maynteine worshyppyng of images. Not onlye with pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted colors, but also with paynted wordes, saying. We kneele not to the ymage, but before the ymage, we worshippe not the ymage, but the thing which is represented by the ymage, we worshippe not the creatures, but the creatore in the creatures. And suche lyke excuses the greatest ydolaters dyd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies pretend. But to thentente they shoulde not so deceyue you, God doeth oftentymes in holye scripture call vpon you sayinge. Thou shalte not make to the any grauen ymage or lykenes of any creature, thou shalt not kneele, nor
<pb facs="tcp:9778:28"/>
bow thy selfe downe to it.</p>
                  <p>For what can be more contrarie to the dignitie of man, then he, whom God hathe made Lorde ouer all creatures to kneele or to doe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the image of a creature. God hath so fashioned man, that he hath gyuen him a bodye stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge streighte vp, and a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce to loke vpwarde into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And why then shoulde he bow himself downward to the earth, or to creatures made of earthe, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch be rather to be troden vnder his fete, then to be worshipped of him. There is nothynge more againste reason, then that he whiche hathe lyfe, sense, and reason, should wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppe that thinge, which can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther see, feele, moue, heare nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande. Wherefore God saieth plainly, thou shalt not worshyppe ymages, that is to saye, thou shalte
<pb facs="tcp:9778:29"/>
not gylte them, and set them in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlye tabernacles, and decke theim with coates or shertes, thou shalte not sense them, make vowes or pil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gremages to them, sette candelles before them, and offer vnto them, thou shalt not kysse their feete, and bowe downe vnto them.</p>
                  <p>For God sayeth I am a ielouse God, and will not gyue my honour to any creature, but wyll greuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye punyshe them that breake this my commaundemente. Yea I wyll punyshe their children and poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie vnto the thirde and fourthe generation.</p>
                  <p>And this indignation of god a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst ydolaters, hath at sundrye tymes be shewed by greuouse pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishementes for our examples. For Salomons idolatrie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Israell and Iuda were deuyded, and thereof dyd ensue a
<pb facs="tcp:9778:29"/>
continuall dyscorde betwene these two kyngdomes. And for ydola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trye God commaunded Moses to hange the capitaines of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and of the people were slayne xxiiii. thousande. And the bokes of the Iudges, Kynges, and the Prophetes be ful of like histories, howe almyghtye God for ydola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie was offended with the Israeli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, and gaue theim into the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of their enemies, and into the subiection and bondage of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about them, which did perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute &amp; kyl them. And when they in their afflictions cried vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde, he refused them saying. Go and crie to the gods whiche you haue chosen, they wyll saue you in the time of youre necessitie.</p>
                  <p>What greater punyshemente can there be then this? to be cast awaye from God, when we haue mooste
<pb facs="tcp:9778:30"/>
neede of his helpe and comforte? And in Deuteronomie almygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye God commaunded by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Moses, saying. Cursed be he, that shall make a grauen or mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ymage, abhominable before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde, the worke of an artificers hande, and shall set it in a secrete place. And all the people shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere and say. Amen.</p>
                  <p>Here you see how he is accursed of god, that setteth but one ymage in a secret corner of his owne house to wourshippe it. But muche more daunger it is, to set vp ymages in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of God which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> open &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men place to honore the only ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing god. But peraduenture some will saye, that we are forbydden to worship ymages, but not to haue ymages. To this I answer. First as touchynge the ymage of God, that whan God spake vnto the
<pb facs="tcp:9778:30"/>
children of Israell in the mount of Oreb they heard a voice, but they saw no maner of ymage or lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of any creature. And the cause was this. Lest if he had appeared in the similitude of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or of any beast vpon earthe, or of any birde in the ayer, or fishe in the water, or of any other creature, the ignoraunt people would parad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture haue made an ymage like therto, and haue worshipped it. Therfore they did se no maner of ymage, because they shoulde make no ymage of God. Least that yf they had made any ymage of god, they would also haue worshipped it. And forasmuche as God is a goste not onely inuisible but also inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehensible, therfore he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be made w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> handes, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed by wit, nether is it possible, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing made by mannes hande
<pb facs="tcp:9778:31"/>
shoulde represent God vnto vs, as his ymage, so far those two be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke, God, and an ymage made by man. For God is a goste, without ende, without measure, withoute mixture, without corruption and most perfecte. But an ymage is a body, hathe an ende, maye be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed and measured, it is myxed, corruptible and vnparfit. God is lyfe in him selfe, of whom al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges haue lyfe, but ymages can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heare, see, nor moue, nor haue neither reason, vnderstanding nor lyfe. Therefore sayeth God hym selfe by his prophet Esaie, that no similitude nor ymage, can be made of him. God shewed himselfe vnto the people in the mount of Oreb, but in a clowde, smoke and fyer, declaring thereby that no man can come to the parfite knowledge of God, as he is in him selfe. The
<pb facs="tcp:9778:31"/>
Propiciatorie also, whereby God was signified, was hidde and not sene, aswel for that it stode in san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta sanctorum where the people ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer came, as also for because the Cherubynes couered it with their wynges. But in case any paynter or caruer were so connyng, that he cold make an ymage, which shuld perfytly represent vnto vs God, (which is impossible) yet he ought to make no suche ymage. And if it wer made, it ought to be destroied, because god hathe forbyd anye y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to be made of hym.</p>
                  <p>For as it is forbydde to haue any straunge goddes, so it is also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide to haue any ymage of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true lyuing God. And yf any wil say, that it is forbyde to make an y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, to thintent to wour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe it, but I doo not worshippe it, nor haue it for that intent, but
<pb facs="tcp:9778:32"/>
onely that it may stere me to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce &amp; knowlege of God. To this I aunswer, that God did forbide the making of his ymage. least this parrell shoulde followe, that thou shouldest worshippe it. Therefore thou doest offende, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou doest not worshippe it, and that not only, because thou doest againste goddes worde and commaundement, but also because thou putteste thy selfe wilfully in very great peril and dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally seyng that of our corrupte na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wee be moost highly enclyned to Idolatry &amp; superstition, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience from tyme to tyme hathe taught vs, euen from the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the worlde. And here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> abuse of our tyme, which folowing rather the phantasye of caruers or paynters, than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of God haue set vp in churches the
<pb facs="tcp:9778:32"/>
ymage (as thei cal it) of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Trinitie, where they portured God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father lyke an olde man with a long hore berd. And what can symple people learne herby, but errore, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? Haue not mani thought that God the father is a bodyly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce, &amp; that he hath a face, and berd, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, and fete, because they see him so painted? And for this consideracion saith sainte Austen, it is a detestable thing for Christen men to haue any suche ymage of God in the church, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that in sainct Austens ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, ther wer no suche ymages in christen churches, but that it is an inuention of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papistes broughte in of later yeres, whiche bryngeth vs not vnto the true knowledge of god, but leadeth vs into errors and ignoraunce of God.</p>
                  <p>But if you wil lyfte vp your min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb facs="tcp:9778:33"/>
to god good children, to know his diuine maiestye, hys infinite power, wysedome, goodnes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his godlye perfections, loke not vpon a deafe, domme, blynde, lame, and deade ymage, made by a painter or caruers handes, but loke vpon heauen and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, made by goddes awne han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy worke, loke vpon man who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> speake, see, smell, heare, feale, and go and hath lyfe, wyl, and reason, and whome no man but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe made to be his lyuely image and similitude.</p>
                  <p>We haue also y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy scriptures whiche declare vnto vs the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful workes of God, by which thynges wee maye be ledde to the knowledge of God without pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or carued ymages. Now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture some wil say that Christ hathe a bodye, and lykewyse haue
<pb facs="tcp:9778:33"/>
saintes, &amp; therfore of them we may haue ymages althoughe of God there can be made no ymage. And further they wil say, that the cause why ymages wer forbid, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryl of ydolatry, and worshipping of theym. So that where there is no suche peril, we may haue yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                  <p>Yet as I will not vtterly deny but they may be had, so I thincke it more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on that they shuld be taken out of Christen mens churches, then that they shoulde be placed in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. And of this my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I wil shewe you certaine good groundes, to thintente that whan you be demaunded, why we En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyshe men haue no ymages in our churches, you maye be able to make therunto a reasonable aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, and that also in time to come

you may declare to your children what abuses haue crepte into the church by the occasion of ymages. That if anye man shall hereafter god about craftily to brynge in y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages agayne for hys owne lucre sake, they maye the soner perceyue hys Iuglynge, and so the better auoide the perill and daunger. Fyrst it is certaine, that we neither haue commaundement, counsell nor example of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor of the primatiue churche in thapostilles time, nor many ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res after to set vp ymages in our churches. As it maye appeare by the holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Epiphanius Bishop of Cypres, a man of great estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an .xi. hundreth yeres passed, for his great lernyng and vertue, and by whom not only in his lyfe tyme, but also after his death, god wrought many miracles. He in an
<pb facs="tcp:9778:34"/>
epistle which he wrote to the Bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe of Hierusalem (whiche e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle saint Hierome did translate out of Greke into Latine) writeth, that as he passed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrey about Hierusalem, he founde in a church a cloth painted, hauing the image of Christ, or of a saynte. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I saw (saied he) an ymage of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hang in the church of Christe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the authoritie of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, I cut it in peces, &amp; counseled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to buri some pore dead ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>in. And after he wrote to the Bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Hierusalem, that he shuld commaunde al the priestes, not to suffer suche images, beynge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our religion, to hange in the church of christ. Wherby it ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peareth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in those dayes ymages were not alowed to be sette vp in churches amonge christen menne (yea al thoughe it were the ymage
<pb facs="tcp:9778:35"/>
of Christe or any sayncte) but that the vsage of ymages beganne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that tyme.</p>
                  <p>And yf we wyl beleue au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, ymages wer brought into churches, by the pollicye and force of the Byshoppes of Rome, many good christian Emperors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the same to their power. But Idolatrie by the byshoppes of Rome preuailed, and seduced many Christen Realmes.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer many images teache nothyng elles but erronious and supersticiouse doctrine. For what reachethe the picture of sayncte Mychael waying soules, and our lady putting her beades in the ba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>launce. Forsoth nothing els, but superstitiousnes of beades, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fidence in oure owne merites, and the merites of saincts, &amp; nothynge in the merites of Christe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:9778:35"/>For wheras oure good workes be not able to way against the deuel, our lady muste laye her beades in balau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that is to say, wil workes diuised of oure awne braynes not commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of God, and by them to saue vs. Which doctrine is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry false and iniuriouse to Christe. What did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ymage of saint Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye teache? But that Sondaye was an holye man, accordynge to the which teaching, beggers asked their almes for saynct Sondayes sake. But I wyll leaue to speake of the euell doctrine whiche was taught by Images, and I wyll declare vnto you y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ymages haue bene so abused, that all the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes whiche myght come by theym, was neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable to the great ignoraunce and blyndnes, the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and idolatrie, whiche haue been brought in and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:9778:36"/>
by meanes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The whiche abuses good children, your owne fathers, yf you aske theym, can well declare vnto you. For they themselfes wer greatly seduced by certayne famouse and notoriouse ymages, as by our lady of walsin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gham, oure ladye of Ippeswiche, Saynt Thomas of Canterbury, Sainct Anne of Buckestone, the roode of Grace, and suche lyke, whom many of your parentes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litide yerely, leauinge their owne houses and familyes. To the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they made vowes &amp; pilgrimages, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng that God would heare their prayers in that place rather than in another place. They kissed their feete deuoutrly, and to theim they offred candles and ymages of waxe, rynges, beades, gold, and syluer, aboundantly. And because they that so taught them had ther
<pb facs="tcp:9778:36"/>
by great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, they maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the same with fayned myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and erroniouse doctrine, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the people that God would heare their prayers made before this image, rather than before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ymage, or in another place, wheras the Prophete Esay sayth, that God doeth heare those that be truely penitent in euery place a lyke. But peraduenture some wyl saye, they dyd neuer teache vs to kneele to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ymage, but before the image. But who I pray you gaue them commission to teache you to kneele before the ymage, yf you make youre praiers to God, why lyfte you not bothe your eyes and handes to heauen where God is, why loke you rather vpon the wal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les, vpon stockes and stones, then thitherward where you knowe he is, to whome you make your pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers.
<pb facs="tcp:9778:37"/>
What nedest thou which arte the ymage of God, to kneele be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ymage of man.</p>
                  <p>Again they that be greued with takyng downe of ymages out of the churches, will parchaunce say. We worshipped not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image but the sainct, whome the ymage dyd signifye. And who I praye you commaundeth you after this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion to worship any sainct, why shoulde wee geue that honoure to sainctes nowe after their deathe, whiche they themselfes, whan they were on lyue dyd vtterly refuse? Yf a Christen man althoughe in dede he were a very holy man, and a lyuing saint, should set himself vpon an aulter in the church, you would say to him come down syr, that is no place for you to stande in. And why shoulde than do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me ymages stande there, whan they
<pb facs="tcp:9778:37"/>
be deade, wher thou canst not suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fre the true ymages &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres of Christ &amp; liuely sainctes to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? Peter refused to be wourship<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped of Cornelius, &amp; likewyse dyd Paule and Barnabas to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of men, and the aungel also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to be honored of a man for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuche as speciall honoure and seruice, appertaineth only to god. Neuerthelesse in ciuile honor and seruyce, we be subiecte to kynges, princes, parentes, maisters, and al superiors, to honoure and serue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of duety as God of vs requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. But al these thinges cesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death, &amp; they that wil say, that they nether worship ymages, nor the sainctes in ymages, but God onelye in the sainctes and y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, they pretende the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse that the heathen Idolatrers did. For they sayd lykewyse, that
<pb facs="tcp:9778:38"/>
they worshypped not blockes nor stones, but God in theym, and yet thei wer great ydolatrers. But these men that pretende so manye excuses for their ydolatrye (as all ydolatrers euer haue done) yet in very dede they worship not onely creatures but also the ymages of creatures. Whan they knele, kysse, &amp; sense them. For whan they see an ymage of the Crucyfyx, or of a saint by the way, doo they not bow downe, and put of their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes vnto it. But they do that (say they) not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ymage but to Christ But why than doo they it, whan they se the ymage, and not before? Marye (saye they) for the ymage putteth vs in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of christ But let them truly aunswer this, as they thinke in their hartes. As often tymes as they remembre Christe before they see the ymage,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:38"/>
doo they bowe downe and put of their cappes or no? Certayne it is that thei do not, but assone as thei come to the ymage they doo. And therefore in veraye dede, they doo that honor to the ymage, and not to Christ, nor to the saint, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they pretende. But they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasy som holines or vertue to be in the ymages, specially whan they be set vpon high in the churche, the commen place to honor god alone, and therefore they ronne rather to one churche than to another, and honor one Image rather than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for elles why are not the y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages in the caruers and painters shoppe as wel kneled vnto &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped as they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be set in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church And yf they dyd their reuerence to christ &amp; not to the image, seing that Christ is in heauen, to heauen they shuld loke vp, wher christ hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> self is,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:39"/>
and not gase vpon an ymage. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng therefore that it is an horrible ydolatry, to wurshyp the Sunne, which is a most goodly creature of God, and representeth vnto vs the wonderfull worke of God. Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man consydre how diuilyshe ydolatry it is, to worship our awne ymages made by our awn handes.</p>
                  <p>Yt is not also taught you in all the scripture that you shoulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre saincte Rocke to preserue you from the pestilence, to pray to saint Barbara to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de you from thon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre or gonneshot, to offer to saincte Loy an horse of waxe, a pigge to sainct Anthonye, a candel to sainct Sithe. But I shoulde be to longe yf I shoulde reherse vnto you all the superstitions that haue growe out of the inuocation and praying to saintes departed, wherwith men haue been seduced, and goddes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure
<pb facs="tcp:9778:39"/>
geuen to creatures.</p>
                  <p>This was also no smal abuse, that wee called the ymages by the names of the thinges, whome they did represent. For we were wont to say. This is saincte Annes aulter, my father is goone a pylgrymage to our lady of walsyngame, in our churche sainct Iames standeth on the right hand of the highe aulter. These speches, we wer wont to vse, although they be not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For sainct Austen in thexposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the .cxiii. psalme affirmeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they, who do call suche ymages as the carpenter hath made, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of those thinges whiche God hath made, do chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the truth of god into a ly. It is not also taught you in all scripture. Thus good children I haue declared how wee wer wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to abuse ymages, not that hereby I condempne your fathers,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:40"/>
who were men of greate deuotion, and had an ernest loue towarde God, altoughe their zeale in all pointes was not ruled and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by true knowledge, but they were seduced and blynded, partely by the commen ignorance that ray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned in their tyme partely by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetuousnes of their teachers, who abused the simplicity of the vnler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned people to the mayntenaunce of their awne lucre and glorye. But this haue I spoken to shewe you how crafty the deuil and his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters haue been euen of late tyme to allure Christen me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Idolatry vnder the pretence and title of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocion, holynes, and religion, that you being warned of suche abuses may the better knowe and auoyde them incase at any tyme Satan or his messengers woulde entyse you vnto suche superstition again. For
<pb facs="tcp:9778:40"/>
yf mariners y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue passed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the seas, and are safelye entred into the haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be naturally moued to shewe to suche as sayle to those places, from whence they came, what parrelles they shall passe by, and howe also they maye auoid the same. Howe muche more ought we that haue already passed the diepe seas and daungers of superstition, to warne you good children, of these perrelles, and to teache you whiche are nowe (as it were) entring into the troublesome seas of this worlde how you maye auoyde these so great daungyers. And it is veray necessary for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers at all tymes to admonyshe, exhorte, and cal vpon you to auoid this most haynouse and detestable synne of ydolatrye. For not onelye the prophetes in tholde testamente wer very ernest to cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
<pb facs="tcp:9778:41"/>
to eschewe this synne of ydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, but thappostles also be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diligent to disswade Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. And we haue to much experience in the worlde that of y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages commeth, worshippyng of them and ydolatry. For sainct Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten vpon the .cxiii. psalme affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that simple men be more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and stirred to bowe downe to ymages and worship the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because they haue mouthes, eyes, eares, noses, handes and feet then they be moued to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, althoughe they perceiue they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither speke, see, smell, feale, nor goo.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be sayde that yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges be necessarie, for then we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempne the appostilles, and al the holy men in the primatiue church, yea and Christe hymselfe also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they vsed no suche thynge, nor yet that they be profitable, for
<pb facs="tcp:9778:41"/>
yf they had, either Christe woulde haue taughte it or the holy goste woulde haue reueled it, vnto the appostles whiche they dyd not. And yf they dyd, the appostilles, were very neelygente that woulde not make some mention of it, and speake some good word for yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, seyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they speake so manye against them. And by this meanes Antichriste and his holy papistes, had more knowledge or feruente zeale to geue vs godlye thynges, and profitable for vs, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had the veray holy saintes of Christe, yea more than Christ himselfe, and the holy goost. Now forasmuch good children, as ymages be neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary nor profitable in our chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, nor were not vsed at the begynnynge in Christe nor thapostilles tyme, nor many yeres after, and that at length they were
<pb facs="tcp:9778:42"/>
brought in by Byshoppes of Rome maugre The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perours tethe, &amp; seing also that they be veri slaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derous to Christes relygion, for by them the name of God is blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed among the infideles, Tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes, and Iewes, whiche be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of oure ymages do call chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten religion Idolatry and wour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of ymages. And for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche also as they haue bene so wonderfully abused within this Ralme, to the highe contumelye and dyshonor of God, and haue been great cause of blyndnes, and of muche contention amonge the kinges maiesties louing subiectes, and were lyke so to be still yf they shoulde remayne, and chiefly seyng goddes worde speaketh somuche against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. You may herby right well consydre, what greate causes and groundes the kinges maiestie
<pb facs="tcp:9778:42"/>
had, to take them away within his Realme, folowing herin the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the godly kinge Ezechias, who brake downe the brasen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, whan he sawe it worshypped and was therefore greatly praysed of God, not withstandynge at the firste, the same was made and set vp by goddes commaundemente, and was not only a remembrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of goddes benefites, before recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but also a figure of Christ to come. And not onely Ezechias, but also Manasses, and Iosophat and Iosias the best kynges that were of the Iewes, did pull doune yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the tyme of their Reygne. Consider than howe Godlye an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acte is this to take away so manye ymages, not made by goddes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, wherunto contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to goddes commaundementes and his honor wer so manye Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries

So good children you haue herde the true meanyng of these wordes. Thou shalt make to the no graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ymage, thou shalt not bowe downe &amp; worship y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, the which I pray you graue depe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in your memories, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you be demaunded, what is ment by the wordes heretofore rehersed, you may answer.

<pb facs="tcp:9778:45"/>
that we in our hartes do reuerentlye and humbly feare, magnifie and worship God &amp; his holy name. For by this oure good example other men are prouoked and encoraged to glorifye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of God. And contrariwyse when in scoffynge &amp; iestyng we be lighte to abuse the name of God, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are offended, &amp; therby also are made more vnreuerent toward God and lesse passe of god &amp; godly thinges, and so by this meanes we burden oure selues with an other mans synne. For Christe sayeth in the ghospel of Mathew the .xviii. chapter.<note place="margin">Mat. xviii</note> He that gyueth cause of offence to anye of the weake bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne, it were better for him that a mil stone wer hanged aboute his necke, &amp; so drowned in the botome of the sea.

               <p>The first is when men gyue the title &amp; name of God, to those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges whiche are not God in dede.

                  </note> And this (good children) is so hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous a faulte, that God in the olde testamente commaunded him to suffre death that shoulde committe this synne, and yf anye citie had so offended, he willed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same cytie to be burned and vtterly destroyed,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:46"/>
and all that were founde therin to be kylled. Therefore let vs dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently eschew this offence, or elles God wyll horriblye punyshe vs.</p>
               <p>The seconde waye of takynge the name of God in vayne, is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we forswere oure selues, or sweare deceiptfully, other in commen iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, or in oure dayly affaires and communicacion, entendynge thereby to deceiue our neighbour. Wherefore you muste diligentlye take hede that you vse not to swer lyghtly thorough an euell custome but do as Christ teacheth vs. Let your communicacion be yea,<note place="margin">Math. vi.</note> yea, and nay, nay. But when necessite dryueth you to an othe, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke officer commaundeth you to sweare, then be not forsworne, but speake the trueth and faithfullye perfourme and obserue that thing that you haue sworne. And yf it

               <p>Thirdely we abuse the name of God not onely in vayne but also very vngodly, when with horrible cursyng &amp; bannynge by the name of God we wyshe to other the ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaunce of God. The whiche syn now in our time is moche vsed.

By goddes soule I woulde I hadde neuer been borne, or I woulde the grounde shoulde open and swalowe me vp. By Goddes body I woulde thou wert hanged, by goddes passion I woulde the deuell had the, by goddes woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des I woulde it were on a wylde fire, or suche other lyke deuylyshe cursiges, &amp; wishi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges which offence is not onelye abominable before god, but also so shamefull before the worlde that it abhorreth good christen eares to heare suche hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous blasphemie. For sainct Paul in the seconde chapter of thepistle to the Philippians writeth thus. In the name of God all knees do bowe downe, bothe in heauen in earthe and vnder the yearth, that is to saye. Not onelye Aungelles
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:9778:47"/>
and men do wourship oure Lorde and God Iesus, Christe, but also the damned spirites and deuelles in hell, do quake at his name, and by their tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blyng do declare that they most reuerently acknowlege the name of hys maiestye.. But these more then deuylishe swerers banners and cursers, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to the mooste honorable name of God, without curtesye or bowing to him, who with a becke maketh all the worlde to shake, do blowe &amp; bluster oute of theyr vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly mouthes suche blasphemies as by the same they do not onelye hyghly dishonour God, but also do wyshe to their neighbours, all kinde of miseries, plages and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities that can be imagined, whereas oure dutye is to loue our neyghbour &amp; wishe wel to him, as to ourselfes. Nowe consyder what
<pb facs="tcp:9778:48"/>
a great wickednesse it is, to wyshe euyll thinges to men by the name of God, seyng that by thys name we ought to desier and praye for all good thinges, bothe to oure sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues and to oure neyghbours. Wherfore when ye heare ani man vsing suche spytefull curses and blasphemies of gods name, doute not but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> deede is wurse then the deuyll himselfe. For the deuil when he heareth god named trembleth therat, and dateth not so vnreuerently behaue hymselfe to that moste holy mane where as these wretched and most vngodly persones, do shewe no feare nor reuerence thereto at all. But ye good children take hede for gods sake, that you accustome not your selfes to suche kynde of blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And when you shall heare other outragyng with suche hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

               <p>Fourthly the name of God is taken in vayne, when men do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use the worde of God purposelye makynge false expositions vpon holy scripture, and wrestynge the same fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true sense to their euil purpose, or whan men make a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle or a lawghynge sporte of the wordes of holy scripture as these papistes do whiche say that thys verse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Psalme.

               <p>Fyftly they do misuse the name of God, whiche do abuse it to char<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes, witchcraft, sorceries, nicroma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cies, inchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iuringes. And this is not onely a great syn, but a thynge of hys owne nature moste vayne and folishe. For per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade your selfes this thynge for a suertie, good chyldren, that all kynd of witchecraft is of hys own nature nothing elles but lies, gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and subtilenes, to deceaue yg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt and simple me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as manye haue proued by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to theyr great losse and vtter vndowynge. Wherfore beware of them, beleue them not, do not learne them, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:9778:49"/>
feare that an nother mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntementes are hable to hurte you. For they be nothing els but the deuils instrumentes, by the whiche he doeth prouoke men to horrible synnes, that the name of God may be blasphemed dyuerse wayes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may defile our soules with detestable ydolatrie, that one man may suspecte an other, that anger, enuy and hatred myght be sowen amonge men, and that out of thys roote myght sprynge vp backbytyng slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deryng &amp; al mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.

               <p>Wherfore good childeren, feare the Lorde, and take not hys holy name in vayne, beware of y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrye forsware not, absteine
<pb facs="tcp:9778:50"/>
from othes and curses, refrayne your tongues, from al vntruthes, raylynges, skoffes and iestes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you talke of holy scripture or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers concernyng religion, flye fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all kynde of wytchecrafte and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntementes. For to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t god hath added a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all threatenynge, saynige thus. He shall not be giltles before the lord that taketh his name in vayne. Beleue surely good children, that these be veray weyghty wourdes and of great importaunce, and thinke not thus with your selfes, what? is this so great a mater? I spake not these wourdes in ernest, but in borde. I pray you for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes sake do not defende your fault with such excuses, but beware that you take not in vaine the name of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nether in ernest nor in sport. For the holy name of God is to be
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:9778:50"/>
wourshipped with all honor and religion and he that doth not obey thys commaundemente, hym the lorde shall not count gyltles but shall punishe him greuously. And when God punisheth, he sendeth amonge vs sycknesses, pestilence, hungre, derth, battel, robberies, se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dition, manslaughter, &amp; suche lyke, with these plages he taketh ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on oure sinnes. Therfore we ought to feare his wrath, and not to take his name in vayne. Hither to you haue hearde fyue wayes wherby we may take the name of God in vaine, nowe it shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto you howe you shoulde rightly and duely vse the name of God. Considre that we be profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in to our religion, and baptised by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of God, wherfore good childerne listen diligently to this lesson, and lerne that we ought to

vse the name of God thre wayes, by inuocation and callynge vpon him, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of his name and his wourd, &amp; by thankes gyuyng.</p>
               <p>As touchinge the firste, we be bounde in all our necessities and parrels to call vpon the name of God, to flye to hym for succoure, with all our hope and confidence, and not to runne to witchecraftes, charmes, sorceries, and suche lyke vanities, for God himselfe saieth, cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day of thy tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I wil deliuer the, and thou shalt glorifye me.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> soeuer we praie, before we aske any new benefite, we ought to tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke him for tholde, &amp; to glorifye his name for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great treasures of giftes heretofore geuen vnto vs.</p>
               <p>And by this meanes both he wyll be the more willyng to heare oure prayers and also oure faithe shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be the more strengthened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.

we be therby moued lesse to doubt of his goodnes, and stedfastlye to hope, that he nowe also, wyll be as merciful vnto vs, as he was wont to be in tymes passed. Therfore sayeth the prophete Dauid, I wyl call vpon the Lord praysyng him, and he wyll saue me from myne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes. Now therefore good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ye shall learne this lesson and practise it dilygently, firste of al to prayse and thanke God for al hys benefites, and afterwarde to call vpon him in all youre necessities: So God wyll be the more redye to heare youre peticions, and youre faith also thereby shall be the more nourished and increased.

But yet note good children, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you heare say that God hath commaunded to reste from wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, you must not gather herof, that you shoulde cesse from suche good workes by the whiche your neyghbour is releued, as to gyue almes to the poore, to preache the worde of God, to instruct y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt and suche like (for god hath commaunded suche workes to be donne, &amp; he doth ernestly require them of vs) but although we do these workes neuer so dilygently, yet by theym we onlye serue and healpe oure neyghbour for God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des sake. But when we wyll serue God onely with suche a kynde of worke that perteyneth not to our

               <p>And now good children li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten vnto me and you shall know the cause why god doth thus. He is so riche a God and his maiestie is so mighty, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath no nede of our outwarde workes nor wour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppinges. Againe he is so gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, lyberal and mercyfull, that of his awne accorde he desireth to do good to all men, wherby his name is praysed and honored. Therfore he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil do pure seruice &amp; honor to God, let hym gyue himselfe to rest and quietnes, not workyng to be made holy by his owne outwarde workes, but let hym kepe holy

day, let him suffer the benefites of God to be powred lyberally and frely vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym. For to beleue that we receaue all good thinges frely from God, &amp; to acknowlege them with a trew fayth, and gladly to prayse &amp; thanke God for thesame, is the most excellente and highest honor, that can be yelded to him in this life. But it is not sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for vs to kepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sabboth day. But the Lorde saith, Thou shalte san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Sabboth day, that is to saye, we shall bestowe that day about holy heuenly &amp; godly thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>Now yf ye desier to knowe with what holye workes you shoulde passe away this day, you shal vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de that we can do no geater holy workes tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of god and to learne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trew feare of God, &amp; the right faith in him, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:9778:57"/>
to prepare our selfes that we may worthely be partakers of the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des table, therby to receyue great comfort to the quiet of our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences &amp; confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of oure fayth. And moreouer on such dayes che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flye we ought in faythe and spirite feruently to praye to God, to gyue vs all good thinges that we lacke and haue nede of, and to defende and deliuer vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all yl thynges. And thus praing we shal not faile to be hearde.</p>
               <p>These be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe holy daye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, by the whiche God rather ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and worketh for vs then we for him. For when he by hys my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters causeth his wourde to be preached vnto vs, when he distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth to vs ineffable gyftes of hys sacramentes, when he heareth our prayers, he is rather benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al vnto vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be to him.

For I haue no nede of your labour and workes. Come hyther I wyll teache you what ye ought to beleue and to do, I wil comforte you wyth the meruelous giftes of my sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, I wil heare your praiers, you can not giue to me greater honor, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repayre to me, and to suffer me y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I maye powre my benefites vpon you, that you may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege me to be your father, that you may cast your hole affiance in me, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you maye loue me as chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren loueth their fathers and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But of this matter you shal heare more in the Crede or articles
<pb facs="tcp:9778:58"/>
of the faith.</p>
               <p>In the meane tyme you shall spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially marke, that althoughe euery man hath nede to labour daily for his dayly fode, yet God hath gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs Sabboth dayes or resting tymes, in the whiche he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded not onelye the maisters themselues but also their seruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and cattel to cesse from bodily labores. And yet on those dayes he fedeth vs aswel as on the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge dayes. By the whiche, he signifieth vnto vs, that althoughe we toyle not continually vntil we be wery, yet he wil gyue vs abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly all thinges necessarie, when we obey his will, &amp; first of all, seke the kyngdome of God, that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges maye be gyuen vs.</p>
               <p>Hytherto good children you haue bene taughte in what holy workes you ought to spende the Sabboth
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:9778:58"/>
day, now it shall be declared vnto you, how great a sinne it is, not to sanctifye the same. The whiche synne is then committed when we vpon the holye dayes do not heare with greate dilygence and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, sermons &amp; the most frutefull woorde of God, when we do not gyue our myndes to prayer, and other Godly workes, but to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, eatinge, drynkynge, banket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, dauncynge, lechery, dicing, cardynge, backebytynge, slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng and other vngodly workes. For the which abuse of holy daies God is grieuously prouoked and punisheth vs greuouslye with dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse kyndes of plages, but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with nede and pouertie. For so God threateneth in the .xxviii. chapter of Deuteronomie,<note place="margin">deu. xxvi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall labour and toyle bothe daye and nyght, and yet shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:9778:59"/>
to worke themselues out of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie. And it is no meruell. For when God gyueth them restynge dayes, they doo not sanctifie the same, they do not heare the worde of God, nor pray to him, but wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly dispise God and his honor, spendyng the sabboth daye in the aboue named synfull and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lyfe. wherfore God iustly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth them with pouertie. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture you wyl say God doth not punishe all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breakers of this commaundemente with nede and pouertie. Trueth it is in deede, some there be whiche God doeth not punishe in this lyfe, but deffer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth theyr punishement vntill the houre of death, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye forsaken of hym, (whiche is a payne most horrible) and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styngly condemned if they amend not in due tyme. Therfore good
<pb n="xxxvi" facs="tcp:9778:59"/>
children eschewe these synnes, that be so heynous in the sight of god, sanctifie youre Sabboth daye, be desirouse to heare the woorde of God, praye continually, and gyue thankes to God for all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites. In so doyng you shall sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye please hym, and he shall sende you his grace, fauour &amp; blessynge that all thing maye prosper wyth you, that you maye with ioye and gladnes serue youre Lorde God, and enioy manye sabbothes or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng dayes. For God is wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that we haue many restynge dayes, so that we spende them wel in holy and godlye exercises, and cause not only oure bodyes to rest from labours, but also oure myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des from synne. For we must kepe the Sabbothe daye not onelye with our bodye but also with oure hartes and myndes, which we do,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:60"/>
when we bridle our owne wil and fleshely lustes, and with all reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence humble our selues to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des wyll, so that when we reherse the Lordes prayer, we maye saye trewly and hertely: Thy wyll be donne in earth as it is in heauen. For so God testifieth by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Esaie in the .lviii. chapiter saying,<note place="margin">Esa. lviii.</note> yf thou wilt absteyne from doyng thy wyll on my holy daye, then thou shalt be called a pleasa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Sabboth day, that is to saie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we submit our wyl to the holy wil of God, and patiently suffre those thinges whiche he worketh in vs and willeth vs to suffre, then we shall trewlye kepe the Sabboth daye and therein laude and praise our Lorde God. For this is no true kepyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sabboth daye, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodye cesseth from labors, and in the meane season a mans
<pb n="xxxvii" facs="tcp:9778:60"/>
mynde is holly occupyed howe he maye deceaue his neighboure, how he maye obtayne hys pleasures, howe he maye reuenge him self on his enemyes. Or els when a mans herte boyleth with murmurynge, grudgynge and impatiencie, and doth not obediently bende himselfe to the wyll of God, nor pacientlye suffereth his workes, but tosseth and turmoyleth himselfe with hys awne cares, thoughtes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passynges. For when shall suche an herte kepe a Sabboth or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting day, or earnestly prayse God? wherfore let vs learne to kepe holy day not onely from bodily labors, but also from all euell thoughtes and carnall desiers. But these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (good chyldren) paraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth passe your capacities. For men haue busynes ynough all their lyfe tyme, perfytely to learne
<pb facs="tcp:9778:61"/>
and practyse this lesson, wherefore at this time I wil require no more of you good children, but onely to beare away this plaine and shorte instruction, that the cheuest wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippyng of God standeth not in outwarde workes, but when we keape the Sabbothe daye aswell with mynde as with bodye, when we heare the worde of God, when by praier we call vpon his name, and be partakers of his sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. By whiche thinges we be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, instructed, stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthened and defended to be the more constante in our faith. And this is the trewe sense &amp; meanyng of this precepte. Wherfore good children marke it wel I praye you, and when it shall chaunce you to be demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, how vnderstande you the thirde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente?

many hygh and great benefites, wherby we be most streyghtly bound to honor them &amp; not to dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise them. But when we do not feare them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we lightly regard them, when they be angrye wyth vs, then we dispise them. And this is a verye haynous synne before God.

Also when we do not obey the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyllynglye, then also we dyspyse them, for he that doth not obei his father &amp; mother, he is a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous person, and thinketh hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe wiser or better then they, and this is a greate contempt and an heynous synne before god.

For when we do any pleasure to other men, we loke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shoulde thanke vs for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same.

And forasmuche as God hymselfe is inuisible to vs here in earth, whome we neyther se bodily nor heare hys voyce, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hathe appoynted oure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers in hys stede to talke wyth vs, and to teache vs what we ought to do, and what to eschewe. Euen as the scholemaster doth oftentymes commyt hys scho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lers to hys vscher, that he in the scholemasters absence maye teache and gouerne them, and hym they ought to reuerence and obey. And as the scholemaster doth sharpely correcte &amp; chastiseth those schollers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wyl not be ruled by his vscher, so God wil greuously punyshe those children, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doeth not obey their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; mothers. For he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted them to be his deputies &amp;
<pb n="xliiii" facs="tcp:9778:67"/>
vschers in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; gouerna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of vs his children. For God is the chefeste worker and maker of all thynges, he is the hyghest schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, and our fathers &amp; mothers are the instrumentes and toyles, wherby God doth worke vs, make vs and fashyoneth vs. For God is the eternall and mooste marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous creator, and he daylye doeth create. But when he entendeth to make ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he maketh him not now of a glod of earth (as he did whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he first made Adam) but he vseth our pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to this straunge &amp; wondre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full worke &amp; maketh vs by theym. And this is the firste and greatest benefite, that God by oure paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, doth gyue vs bothe bodye and sowle. And after that yonge chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne be borne into this world, we se how they lye certen yeres crying in their cradels, not able to helpe
<pb facs="tcp:9778:68"/>
themselues. At what tyme excepte God did nouryshe vs by oure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers, ther wer no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we muste neades pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryshe. And when god doth entend to feade vs in our cradels he doth not sende downe breade from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen (as he did Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na) but he won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derfully fylleth our mothers dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges full of mylke, wherwyth she may gyue sucke to vs, and also he sendeth to oure fathers sufficiente riches wherby they maye brynge vp their children. And this is the seconde benefite, that God, by our parentes doth nurse vs, feade vs, and bryng vs vp, more tendrely then the henne doth her yong che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyns. Furthermore God sendeth vs Christian pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, which cause vs to be baptised and grafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, and to be made the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. For yf our parentes
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:9778:68"/>
were not christened we were lyke to be wrapped in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and errours. (For you see no Iewes children come to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) and if we should haue heathen parentes &amp; dye without baptisme, we should be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned euerlastingly And in case we died not in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, yet we shoulde be vngodly brought vp in thouses of Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and vnchristened parentes, and should be taughte euen from oure tendre age, to hate and dispise the trew faith of Christ as we may see an example by Turkes &amp; Iewes children, whiche vehemently hate the fayth of Christ, &amp; among tenne thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of them, scase one desireth to be baptised. And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third great benefit, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God by our pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes doth bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs to baptisme, &amp; to Christ his church, &amp; doth plant in our hertes an ernest loue towards
<pb facs="tcp:9778:69"/>
Christes religion, that wyllynglye and gladly we become Christians.</p>
               <p>Besides this when we be growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to suche age, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is tyme for vs to go to schole, then god teacheth vs by our parentes his most excellent doctrine that is to saye, tharticles of our faythe, the ten commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, &amp; the Lordes prayer. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore oure parentes do teache vs the nourture and ciuilitie of good maners, that we maye proue gentle, quiet and faire co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditioned, and suche with whom, honest men wyll be gladde to kepe companye. From our parentes we haue oure countrey, (then whyche nothynge is more pleasant vnto vs) and the fredome fraunchesies and lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie in the whiche we wer borne. Our parentes also leaue vnto vs ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times great plentie of riches and landes for oure inhery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:9778:69"/>
They also teache vs dyuerse wayes of marchaundise, mani han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dycraftes and all kyndes of scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, by the which we may honestly and in the waye of treuth get oure lyuyng here in this world. And al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>though they be compelled of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, oftentymes to vse the ayde and helpe of scholemasters, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther connyng men in dyuerse kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of faculties, yet because all these thinges be done at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente, costes and charges of our pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, therfore we ought chiefely to thanke theym for all these benefites. And this is the fourth benefite, that God by oure parentes doth teache vs the trewe knowledge of him and his worde.</p>
               <p>Now these be the chiefest causes good children, why God hath com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded vs to honoure oure pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes. And suerly they be cruell
<pb facs="tcp:9778:70"/>
children, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> do not this, seynge that they haue receyued of their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes so great an heape of benefites. And trewly they wer wourthye to be stoned to deathe as stubburne childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wer wont to be in the olde testamente. Wherfore good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, obserue diligently this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement that you be not disobedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nor vnkynde, but honor your fathers and mothers. And here you muste not thynke that you owe this subiection onely to your fathers and mothers, but the same obedience and honor is dewe also to all the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whose helpe and labour your parentes doeth oftentymes vse in gouernyng and teachynge you. Of the whiche sorte be youre tutors, scholemasters, preachers, pastors, &amp; curates, youre masters that teache you your craftes, and also the magestrates, and commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:9778:70"/>
officers. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy scripture doth call all these fathers. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God sayth: honour thy father and mother, he comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth within the boundes of thys commaundemente, all those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons before rehersed. And this is done for these consideracions, For when the parentes do ley on theyr death bed then in theyr laste wil or testament they assigne and appoynt to theyr chyldren y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be of nonage tutors, gardians, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they resigne all theyr iurisdiction, which they had of God gyuen vnto theym ouer theyr children. To suche tutors or gouernours children ought to be obedient and honor them. For suche be lefte vnto theym in the steade of theyr parentes and they nouryshed theyr pupylles or wardes and make much of them,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:71"/>
&amp; se that they be honestly brought vp in vertue and lernynge, and shall make a rekenyng for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same both before God and the worlde. Furthermore when that oure pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes eyther be not able suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlye to teache vs in their owne parsons, or haue not conuenient leysure to do the same, then they committe vs to scholemaisters, preachers, pastors and curates, and make theym theyr deputies. Therfore it is the deutie of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, reuerently to obey theyr tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and curates. For saynt Paule sayeth. The elders that rule well, are worthye of double honour, specialli they that labour in the worde and teaching.<note place="margin">i. Tim. v.</note> And saynt Peter sayeth. Obey them that are appoynted to gouerne you, for they do wake and watche for your soules as men that shall
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:9778:71"/>
make an accompt for the same.</p>
               <p>Also it happeneth oftentymes, that pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes do put theyr children to other, either because they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are not able to fynde them, or teache theym handye craftes, or the arte of marchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyse, and when this chaunseth, then it is the offyce of chyldren to obey in all thynges and to honour euen as theyr parentes, those to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted &amp; with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they dwel. For vnto such theyr fathers and mothers haue geuen theyr power and autoritie. Therfore saynte Paule sayeth. Seruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes be obedient vnto youre may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters as vnto God, and so forth. But when children grow to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes age,<note place="margin">Ephe. vi.</note> and then refuse to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, masters, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and curates, and begynne to waxe wyld and wanton &amp; to hurte,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:72"/>
other, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> officers ought to chastise them. And the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates &amp; superiour powers ought to be honored and feared, euen as our fathers and mothers. For by theim we be defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded from our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, of theim we receaue lawes and statutes wherby we may liue in peace and quietnes, wherefore we ought to be glad and willynge to paye to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tribute, taxes, tolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges &amp; subsidies, whereby they may be the better able to maintaine the tranquillitye of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commen welth. Learne therfore good childerne. that they be not onely called oure parentes, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are begotten and borne, but they also be called to the honor &amp; tytle of this name, whiche helpe them to bryng vs vp in vertue and learning. Suche be they whom we cal our tutors or gardians, teachers, masters, cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
<pb n="xlix" facs="tcp:9778:72"/>
and officers. Also this worde, honor, doth not onely containe the outwarde gesture of making cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey and puttyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cap, but they do trewly honour their parentes, whiche do feare and loue them, highly esteme them, gyue place to them, and rendre vnto theim all kynde of gentilnes &amp; liberalitie, &amp; yet do not obbrayd them, or cast their gyftes in their teath, but do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stil thei be in their paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes dette, and as yet do owe them greater thinges. And this is a great poynt of wisedome, yea in worldly pollicie, to acknowlege y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of bounden deutie we owe to these persons aboue rehersed honor and reuerence, and that God is highly pleased with this kynde of sacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And that he doth sende vnto vs by these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> innumerable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, wherefore yf you wil be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:9778:73"/>
good and godly childerne, and please God, then kepe this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, obey your parentes and euery commen officer, feare them, be obedient to their lawes and statutes, be subiecte vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in all thinges. Notwithstandyng yf the commen officer do byd you do any thinge expressely agaynst god, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you may not obey hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but say with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle Peter, we must obey god rather then men.<note place="margin">Actes. v.</note> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware good children y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you dispise not your parentes, or vncurtesely entreat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, because perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thei be simple men, rude, vnlerned, poore, weake, feable and impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reason of their olde age. For of what soeuer state condition or qualitie they be, yet by them God hath gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs our lyfe, he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them to be our gouernors, &amp; (as I haue declared heretofore)
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:9778:73"/>
by theym he hath sent vs infinite benefites, wherfore we ought to honor them, obey them, to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng and redy both to learne and do that whiche they commaunde vs, &amp; to eschew those thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges which they forbid vs. For this obedience pleaseth God and is a most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table honoring of him. Take hede also y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you refuse not nor grudge to do such thinges as thei shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde you, nether that you play the truantes or runne away from your teachers, maysters or other artificers into whose house tuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and custodie your fathers and mothers shall committe you. For this is a great synne before God, the which shal not escape vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. But specially you must eschew this most detestable kynde of disobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (which now a daies is very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men) that you intangle
<pb facs="tcp:9778:74"/>
not your selues w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mariage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowlege and consente of your pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. For this is a pointe not only of notable dysobedience, but also of great folyshenes. For what is more myserable or can trouble a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more in this world, then a mariage euel matched and vnmetly coupled. This is that grefe and punishement that dayly troubleth &amp; scourgeth vs all oure lyfe tyme, from the whiche there is no meanes to escape but by death onely. And it is to be feared, when we go about to marie oureselues, not makynge our parentes priuie to suche contractes or bargaynes but contemnyng theyr authoritie, that God wil not prosper such ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riages, nor giue therto his fauour and blessyng. But if you wil kepe gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dementes, &amp; honoure your parents, then God wyl loue
<pb n="li" facs="tcp:9778:74"/>
you, and powre hys gyftes vpon you most abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly. Now good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue herde what you ought to do, I praye you be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to performe that thing, which your bounden dewtie requireth of you. For saincte Paul saieth, that this is the first or chiefe commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente hauynge a promyse an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto it.<note place="margin">Ephes. v.</note> For herin god doth promyse, that he whiche doeth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his father and mother, shall lyue a long lyfe, and shal abyde in his natiue countrey. And he that doeth not honoure theym, shalbe dryuen out of his countrey, &amp; shal shortely dye. And surely this we proue to be true by dayly expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For when childerne be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, wilde stiffenecked, stubburne, and refuse to be ruled by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and scholemasters, or do not serue their maisters truelye, when
<pb facs="tcp:9778:75"/>
thei wyl not haue in reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce their preachers and curates, or do not obey the common rulers, then God scourgeth theym, some wyth one punishment, some with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Some is maymed, some lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth an eye, one hathe suche a fall from an horse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he lyeth for starke deade, an other is drowned.

But yf perchaunce these dysobedyente childerne escape punyshmente in theyr yought, yet when they come to mans state, and kepe howses of their awne, then commonly suche children do not auoide this threat and indignation of God. For then many times they runne into suche dette, that they be compelled to forsake their natiue countrey, and
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:9778:75"/>
to flye into sanctuarie, or elles to wandre in straunge regions lyke banyshed menne, farre from their kynsfolkes acquaintau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, where no man doth helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, trust them, or hath pitie of theym.</p>
               <p>And many of them, whilest they go aboute to auoyde extreme po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie by lying, stelyng, robbyng, &amp; other ill meanes are cast in pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and afterward hanged. These and such lyke paynes men do wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thely suffer in their age, whiche in theyr youth dysdayned to folowe the counsell of theyr parentes.</p>
               <p>Wherfore good children, obey youre parentes and magistrates, then you shall proue wise men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to helpe both your selues and other. Then God shall blesse you, that you may longe continewe in the contrey wherin you wer borne and bredde, and dwell amonge

Then extreme pouertie shall not oppresse you, whereby you should be compelled to leaue your countrey, neyther the rages or partels of warre shal driue you out from thense. So manye and so great benefites hath God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysed to obedyent chyldren. And there is no doubt, but that he will perfourme that thinge whiche he hath promised. As we feale by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as long as we obey oure parentes, and suffer our selues to be gouerned accordynge to Gods wyll, so long we be brought vp in the feare of God, to our great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Here you see good children, that Christ doeth as ernestly forbydde hathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, angre and enuye, as he doeth bloudy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slaughter. For he that is angry with his neyghbour, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth hys neyghbour in harte and
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:9778:78"/>
wyll and breketh this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente of God, thou shalte not kyll. And marke well good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that he sayeth not, thy hande shall not kyl, or thy sworde, spere, or gunne shall not slaye. But he sayeth, thou shalt not kyll, that is to saye, thou whiche arte made of bodie and soule, shalte neyther kil with any of thy bodely members, neyther yet with thy inward mind or wyll, neyther wyth woorde nor deede. But here paraduenture some wyll saye. What thinke you syr of traytors, commen theues, robbers and murtherers oughte not suche to be kylled? I answere that they ought to be kylled, but yet God saieth, thou shalt not kil, thou shalt kepe peace with all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Who then shall kyll suche male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors? Leaue punisheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to me (sayeth God) and I will reuenge.
<pb facs="tcp:9778:79"/>
God himself wyl do execution vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on suche open tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgressors of hys lawes. And therfore here in this world, God hath ordeyned vnder him kinges, princes and other ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gistrates, and hathe gyuen theim their swordes to this vse, that thei should be his deputies in kylling such offenders. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men gouernours do their office in punishyng open malefactors, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they do a true honour and seruice to god, &amp; ar his ministers, as saint Paul sayth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaynes.<note place="margin">Rom. xiii.</note> The magistrate is Gods officer. And when the publike minister doethe kil an ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> transgressor, we oughte to thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God kylleth hym, for asmuche as the officer doethe the same by the commaundement and ordynance of God. Wherfore good children, althoughe menne do neuer so greate wronge vnto
<pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:9778:79"/>
you, and hurte you ether in your bodies or goodes, yet take it paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, refrayne your handes from bloudshedyng, strike no man vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, but committe the matier to God. For he hath saied, leaue ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to me and I wil reuenge. But ye in no wise shall kil, nether in will, worde, nor dede. For there be diuerse wayes to commit mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The first is when with any kynde of weapon, or violence we slay our neyghbour, as theues do be the hyghe wayes. Also yf we gyue any commaundement or counsell, that oure neyghboure shoulde be slayne by other, or yf we spreade abrode any euel brute or slaunder of any man, by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he is put to death. Furthermore we kill, when ether with worde or dede, we maye, and do not, delyuer hym whome other
<pb facs="tcp:9778:80"/>
men entende to kyll. And when we see our neyghbour in perryll of lyfe, and do not helpe him, but suffer hym to dye for hunger, to be drowned, or burned. Besides this we be manquellers when we beare angre, hatred and malyce, agaynste oure neyghbours, and when with greate angre and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye we do rayle on him, curse him, and wishe vengeaunce to lyghte vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. For whersoeuer angre, hatred, enuye, and malycyousnes reygneth, there is manslaughter, whiche althoughe it be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in dede with the hande &amp; sword, yet it is done in hart, mind and wyll. For as fyre kyndled with a litle sparke, doeth oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes greate hurte and damage, &amp; can not easely be que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched, so wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sparkes of angre, hatred and enuye do set on fyre mans hearte
<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:9778:80"/>
they do oftentimes prouoke more hurte than euer a man thoughte, and some time they styrre to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte suche offences, as in all his lyfe he neuer thought vpon, and for the whiche afterwarde he so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth all the dayes of his lyfe. So that the wel &amp; spring of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaughter, is malice and enuye. And therfore sayncte Iohn in his Epistle sayeth. He that hateth his brother is a manqueller. And Christ saieth. He that is angrye wyth his brother is worthy to be iudged. For to be angrye is with the herte to kyll. Wherfore that commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that sayeth, thou shalt not kyll, doeth also forbyd to be angry. Furthermore Christ sayeth, he that sayeth to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Racha, that is to saye, he that with voice or gesture sheweth anye token of an angry herte, is
<pb facs="tcp:9778:81"/>
worthye the sessyons, but he that sayeth, thou foole is worthy the fyre of hel. In these sentences our master Christ teacheth vs, that in wordes is manslaughter commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when we vtter the poyson of our herte with any suche wordes wherby the venome of our herte is perceyued. But when we burst out into suche raylynge, slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse and contumelious wordes agaynst any man, that he maye lese therby his estimation or good name, then we be more heynous murtherers. And here also Christ teacheth vs, how greuouslye we shall be punished both in this life and in the life to come, yf we dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise this commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of god. For he doeth not only say, he that kylleth, but he also that is angrye with his brother, is worthy iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, that is to saye, is gyltye
<pb n="lviii" facs="tcp:9778:81"/>
before God of so great a cryme, that he hath deserued to be arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, violentlye to be drawen in to the place of iudgement, and there ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly to be accused and arrayned of the same. But he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with voyce or gesture dothe vtter the malice of his hert, is worthy the sessions, that is to saye, he hath committed so greuous an offence in the sight of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not nowe necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to empanel a quest to inquire whether he hath deserued punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or no, forasmuche as his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is manyfest, but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the synne hath onely neede of a sessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or a numbre of iudges, to determine how greuously such an offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ought to be punished. But he whiche inflamed with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre calleth his neighbour by such approbrius wordes, that his esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macion and good nameis hurte
<pb facs="tcp:9778:82"/>
and decayed, he is worthye hell fyre, that is to saye, he hath synned so heynously, that he hathe deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued tormentes both in this world and in an other worlde, except he repent in tyme, and obteyne hym pardone by the passion of Chrste. But most of all, kyllyng with the hande and effusion of bloud shall be punished wyth moste greuous paynes, bothe in this lyfe and in the lyfe to come. As oure Lorde God declared to Noe saynge.<note place="margin">Genes. ix</note> I wyll requyre youre bloode of the handes of all beastes, and of the handes of man. For who so euer shedeth mans bloode, his bloode shall be shed agayne. And in case the manqueller escape mans han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and punishment of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men offycer, or yf they that haue Goddes sworde in theyr handes, be neglygent in doynge theyr of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="lix" facs="tcp:9778:82"/>
or wyl be blynded with affecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons and corrupted wyth monye, yet God wyll not let manslaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to escape vnpunished. For he hath sayde, that he hymselfe wyll inquire of bloodshedynge and syt in iudgement vpon manquellers. As it is playnly declared vnto vs by the horryble example of Cain, who kylled his brother Abell.</p>
               <p>For not onelye in this lyfe God dyd so sore punyshe hym, that hys conscience was vexed with suche vnquietnes and horryble feare, that all hys bodye shooke and trembled mooste pitifully, and he coulde abid or rest in no place but lyke a banyshed man or runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate wandered euerne where, but also now after this lyfe he is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of God, and damned for euer. This fearfull payne (good chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) ought to warne vs to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
<pb facs="tcp:9778:83"/>
in kepyng this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that we kyll not, neyther in wil, worde nor dede, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywyse to endeuour oure selfes to practise Christes lessons, who hath taught vs gentylnes, mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, long sufferance and pacience. For he saith. Blessed ar they, that suffer persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for rightousnes, for theyrs is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyngdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of heauen. Wherfore good children, marke ernestly what God here commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Ye shal not (saieth he) be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye, but loue your enemies, ye shal not slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dre or backbite other, but speake wel euen of those that hate you, accordyng to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Christ. Yf a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> strike y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> on the cheke, resist not, but whosoeuer shall gyue the a blow on the ryght cheke, turne to hym the other also. And if any man wil sue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, &amp; take away thy coat, let him haue
<pb n="lx" facs="tcp:9778:83"/>
thy clooke also. And whosoeuer will compell the to go one myle, go with him twayne. Do good to them that hate you, pray for them that hurte and persecute you, that ye maye be the children of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whiche is in heauen. All these are the wordes of Christ. And yf perchaunce we haue donne any manne wronge, or prouoked oure neyghboure to angre, then with great diligence we ought to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure, that in al hast and spede we maye be reconciled. For Christ saieth. Yf thou offrest thy gyft at the aulter, &amp; there remembrest that thy brother hath any thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g against the, leaue there thyne offering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aulter, go thy waye, &amp; first be reconciled to thy brother, &amp; then come &amp; offre thy gyft. Oblations and sacrifices wer in tholde testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a very commendable and an
<pb facs="tcp:9778:84"/>
highe kynde of worshipping god. (For asmuche as he hymselfe dyd appointe and commaunde them). And yet Christ here teacheth, that God is better honoured with ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng his commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dementes, than with our offeringes. And to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consiled to our neighbour is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice more acceptable vnto him, then to offer oblacions.</p>
               <p>Furthermore the keping of these commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dementes, helpeth muche to mayntayne the tranquillite, peace and quietnes of the comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth. For Christe sayeth. Agree wyth thyne aduersarie quickely, whiles thou arte in the waye with him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to saye, we must refrayne our selfe from discorde, variance, hatred &amp; contencion and asmuche as lyeth in vs, seke peace, concord and quietnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lest we be caste into priso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, from whence we shall not be
<pb n="lxi" facs="tcp:9778:84"/>
deliuered except we pay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vtmost farthynge. And in these ciuile and worldlye courtes, althoughe oure cause be good and rightfull, yet is it possible that iudgemente be gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against vs. And in case that at the length we haue sentence on our side, yet the sute therof shal be so chargeable vnto vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we shal, for the moste parte, spende more mony in waginge of the law, than we shall gayne by the sentence. Wherfore ther is nothyng better or more profitable, then to seke for concorde and peace, as muche as is possible. And as it is our parte to lyue in peace with all men, so it is our dutie also, to make them at one which be at variaunce. For Christ saieth. Blessed be the peace makers, for they shal be called the children of God. Wherfore good children, printe wel in your reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:85"/>
that God hath commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Thou shalt not kyll, and that we can not offer a more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sacrifice to God, then to kepe his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. Make your selfes strong therfore patiently to suffre all thynges, reuenge not your selues but leaue al punyshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God, and he wyll reuenge your quarrelles. Be not inflamed wyth angre, hatred or enuye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your neighbor, do no wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to hym, beare with his weakenesse and forbeare hym, hurte hym not, but rather defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de him from hurt, sow, and norishe vnitie, peace and frendshyp betwene all men, make agrementes &amp; loue daies betwene them that be fallen at discorde, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde all occasyons of angre or displeasure, as braggynge, boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng, reuilynge, tawntynge, scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, dicynge, bankettyng, riote
<pb n="lxii" facs="tcp:9778:85"/>
and suche lyke offences. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise loue your neighbour, do good to all men as farre as youre abilitie wil serue you, speake well of euery bodye, and laboure with all youre power to saue the lyfe of youre neyghbour. For this is the dutie of all godlye menne, to preserue and defende their neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, frendely to admonyshe him of his faultes, to instruct him and to comforte him. For we be bound to healpe oure neyghboure in hys necessitie, to lende hym money, to gyue to him when he asketh, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshe his hunger with meate and drynke, to clothe his nakednes, to receaue into oure house the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourles, to comforte hym when he is sicke. For all these offices and effectes of trew humanitie, loue and charitie God commaunded, when he said, Thou shalt not kil.
<pb facs="tcp:9778:86"/>
And this is the trew meanyng of the fifth precepte. Wherfore good children marke it well, and when you be asked, howe vnderstande you the fifthe commaundemente? you shall aunswere, we oughte to loue and dreade oure Lorde God aboue all thinges, so that for hys sake we hurt not our neighboure, nether in his name, goodes, cattel, life or body, but that we aide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte and succoure hym in all hys necessities troubles and afflycti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

Thou shalt not committe adulterye, the whiche teacheth vs, howe we shoulde order our selues towardes oure wyfes, that we shoulde loue theym, not forsake theym or breake the promyse of wedlocke with theim, but louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kepe theym companye. Also that we should not luste after an other mans wyfe, neyther wyth faire wordes or gyftes intyse her away from her husbande, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure with all diligence that we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men both maried and vnmaryed maye kepe their chastitie vndefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For God himself did institute and ordeine mariage, &amp; did halow it with his awne blessyng. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we maye be sure, that this state of lyfe pleaseth god, and that it is his wyll, to haue it kept with out pollucion or dishonestie. For god after that he had made Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb n="lxiiii" facs="tcp:9778:87"/>
he sayde thus. It is not good, that Adam shoulde be alone, lette vs make for him an helpe. And when Adam was a sleape, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde toke one of his ribbes, and made a woman of the Rybbe, whiche he had taken from Adam. And he brought her to Adam, and Adam sayd.

For thys cause a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall leaue hys father and mother &amp; shall be ioyned with his wife, &amp; they shall be twayne in one fleshe. And the Lorde God blessed theym sayeng. Growe and increace, and replenishe the earth, &amp; tyll it. By this you maye learne good children, that God hymselfe dyd institute mariage wyth hys owne worde. Wherefore there is no doubte, but that thys kinde of lyfe is holy, and doeth hyghlye please God. As thapostell Paule
<pb facs="tcp:9778:88"/>
writeth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrues. Wedlocke is honourable &amp; the bed therin is vnspotted, but adulterers, and fornicatours god doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne. Furthermore god saith. Grow &amp; increase. Here he declareth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fruyt of wedlocke, that is to say, children, are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gifte of God. For yf he had not commaunded thys thing by his worde, then maried folkes could haue had no childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Wherefore ye shall by these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des chefely learne, that there is a great difference betwene wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke and the vnlawfull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panye betwixt man and woman. For in mariage the acte of generatyon betwene the husbande and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wife is no synne (for God hath orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, &amp; it pleaseth him) but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication &amp; adulterye be sin which God hath forbid, and thei highly displease him.

But where adulterye raigneth, wher yought doth both heare and see vnchastnes, there the infection of vncleanes sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth abrode, and doth poyson the multitude, and God at the length doth punyshe suche synnes with hunger, famyne, battayle, pesty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,

&amp; suche lyke, vntill he hathe vtterly destroyed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole realme or citie. Furthermore marke thys also diligently, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lorde saieth. Growe, increace, replenyshe the earth &amp; digge it. Manye absteyne from mariage, because they be to careful how they shal liue, yf they wer maried. Therfore oure Lorde God doth here plainly shewe, that he wyll minister plentyfullye to maried folkes, all thynges neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to the maintenaunce of their lyfe, yf they put their trust in him, and apply their labours diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For he saieth, dygge, plowe or tyll the earth, as who shoulde say, I haue made for youre sake all thynges that growe vpon the earthe, I haue gyuen to you all kyndes of heastes, fishes, foules, that lyueth in the worlde, onely laboure you that you maye pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase

and possesse those my ryches truely and honestly. Nowe good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> consider this, that it is not in youre awne lybertie, whether you wyll be maried or not.

for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> causes aboue rehersed, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God with this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as with a stronge bulwerke or fortresse hathe defended wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke, saying.

And to thente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we mighte the better vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, what our Lorde God meante by this commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, Christ him selfe did expounde it, saying. Ye haue hearde howe it was sayd to them of tholde lawe. Thou shalt committe no adultery. But I say vnto you. He that loketh vpon a woman to lust after her, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy committed adulterye in hys hart. For it is not ynough to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steyne from carnal copulation w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an other mans wyfe, but we must absteyne also frome all wanton communicacion, all vncleane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and thoughtes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Thou
<pb facs="tcp:9778:91"/>
shalt committe none adulterie, is asmuche to say, as thou shalt not offende with thy neyghboures wife, neyther in acte, nor vncleane wourdes, nor in lokes, wynkes, beckes, or other vnhonest gestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and sygnes, neyther in affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; priuie motion of thy harte. But I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the (saieth God) that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> be shamefast, chast, pure &amp; vndefiled, whether thou be a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, wydow or maried. For these thre states of lyfe be holy &amp; pure. Herein also we be commaunded, that we giue none aide nor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, cause or occasion to other to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit adulterie, nor gyue house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome harbour or lodging to such offenders, but as we ought to kepe our awne soules cleane from all suche vyces, so it is our deutie also to monyshe and dissuad al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from suche shameful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises,

               <p>And thinke not good children, that in this commaundemente, only wedlocke breakyng is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byd, &amp; that other whordome or le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie is not forbyd, as some fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do thinke, that single for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication betwene vnmaried par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons is not forbyd, because God in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement speaketh in expresse wordes onely of adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers or wedlocke breakers, But take hede good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ye erre not with these vngodlye wicked parsons, but know ye for a suertie, that fornication, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, lecherie and all kynde of vncleanes, by what so euer name or title it be called, is synne, and highly displeaseth god. For Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

Wherfore if you wyl kepe this commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t trewly, you must order yourselues after this maner. Fyrst of all and chefelye you must beware, that you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte not lecheri in acte and dede, but you muste lyue chastely and continently, vntyll suche tyme as by the healpe of God, consente of youre parentes, and counsell of your frendes, you may be maried lawfully. And then see that you obserue truly the fayth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made in matrimony. Wowe not other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes wyfes, but kepe companye with youre owne with

The woman hathe not power or lybertie of her owne bodye, but her husbande, lykewyse the husbande hathe not power or lybertie of hys owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, but the wyfe. And let not one maried person be absent from the other, wythoute an vrgente and weyghty cause, neither let the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande suffer hys wife in peril and daungier to sytte alone wythout his company or comforte, nor the wyfe her husbande lykewyse.

you muste not craftely go aboute with flatery and louynge wordes to deceyue the simplicitie of yong women, you must not with fayre promyses or gyftes entise them to foly, neyther with wanton songes or vnhonest dalyance kyndle the fire of lecherie, but asmoche as is possible, you shall auoid all wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton lokes and vnchaste gestures, to muche nysenes in trymmynge and deckynge youre bodyes, and apparellyng them to gorgiously, and all kyndes of craftye entyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, whiche louers do vse to please y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eyes and myndes of their peramoures, whereby they maye allure them to loue and lechery. Thyrdly you must eschew all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane myndes and thoughtes. For althoughe the worlde doethe neyther see nor punishe the synnes of our thoughtes, yet God which

sercheth mens hertes and raynes, doeth both see, and punishe them. Therfore Christe sayth. He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> seeth a woman to lust after her, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redye committed adultery in hys harte.

               <p>For Christe in this sermon of adultery sayeth. Yf thy ryght eye gyue the an occasion to synne, pul it out and cast it from the.

Muche more then, yf surfetynge, banke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng or suche other lyke, do giue you occasion of synne, you ought diligently to eschew them, lest you fal into so perrellous a daungier.

               <p>And here note good children, that this worde, thefte, doeth not onely signifie open robberies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torcions and manyfest poollyng but also all maner of craftes, and subtile wayes by the whyche we conuey our neyghbours goodes from him, contrarye to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or wyll althoughe the gyle haue neuer so fayre a coloure of
<pb n="lxxv" facs="tcp:9778:96"/>
vertue and honesty. And to then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente you maye the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande this thinge, I shall declare it vnto you by certen examples. And fyrste I wyll begynne wyth Magistrates or commen officers. God hathe commaunded vs to paye to prynces and gouernours of the commen wealth, rentes, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, tributes, customes, toll, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidies, pensions and other yerelye reuenewes, wherby they maye be the more able to susteine and beare the charges of the commen admy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, and also to punyshe theim that be yll, and to defende those that be good. But when the magistrates do ouercharge theyr subiectes, and exacte more of them then is nedefull to the maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of the commen charges, and so empouerishe and oppresse them, whome they ought from all
<pb facs="tcp:9778:97"/>
iniury and wronge to saue and defende, then thys sore exaction is a notable and haynouse kynde of thefte, in the sight of God. Lykewise it is wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they do wring monye out of theyr subiectes han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vniustly and agaynste theyr wylles. And tributes or subsidyes yf they take none but suche onely as of ryght are due vnto them, yet yf they bestowe not the same as they ought to do, but wastfullye spende that monye whiche was gathered for the maintenaunce of the comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charges, and consume it in riot and vnlawful pleasures than they committe thefte before God. Also God shall iudge them theues, when for couetuousnesse they leaue suche thinges vndone, whiche be necessarie to be done for the commen profite. As when thei appoynt not good and mete men
<pb n="lxxvi" facs="tcp:9778:97"/>
to be rulers vnder them, byshop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, persons, curates, and schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maysters, because they grudge to gyue theym an honest and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lyuyng, but wyll take out of the commen sort to minister suche hygh offices, those that will serue for lest monie. And rulers of cities be theues when they suffer the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie buildinges of the citie, as churches, yelde halles, the towne walles, commen brydges, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductes or suche lyke to decaye or fall to ruyne. For so thorow their neglygence or couetousnesse the commen money is not employed to such vses, for the whiche it was gathered.</p>
               <p>Also Byshoppes, pastors, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and curates be theues, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for mennes fauour and their owne lucre they hydde the truethe of Goddes woorde, and teache lyes
<pb facs="tcp:9778:98"/>
and theyr owne dreames, and sell all thinges for monie. As of late tyme here in Englande, manye of theym had great gaynes by diri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, seruices to synge for sowles, trentals, pylgrimages, pardons and suche lyke deceytes. This kynde of deceyte, in vttryng false ware for good, is thefte before God. For menne therby be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, whiche woulde gyue no monye at all for suche marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, yf they were taught and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of theyr abuses.</p>
               <p>Likewise Lawers, aduocates, sergeants, attorneis and procters are theues before God, when they for their owne gaynes do coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell a man to wage the lawe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge hym to beleue that hys mater is good, when in dede they thinke it naught. Or when for mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye they wil so craftely handle or
<pb n="lxxvii" facs="tcp:9778:98"/>
plead a matter, that thei with their shiftes and colors will purposely hyde the trueth, and make a good cause to seme bad, and a bad cause to appeare good: wherwyth they shal so deceyue the iudge that they wyll cause hym vniustely to gyue sentence on theyr syde. And the iudge himselfe is a thefe before God, when he for brybes or anye corrupcion doth wittingly &amp; wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly gyue wronge iudgemente.</p>
               <p>For he taketh from the partie that hath the good cause, hys iust title and interest, and gyueth it to the other partie that hath no right to it at all. And thys is also no small theft, when men craftely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the trew heyres of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, or forge false testamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and wyll not brynge to lyghte the trewe wyll, but hyd and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9778:99"/>Furthermore marchaunt men, brokers, chapmen, marchauntes factors, are theues, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire vnreasonable gaynes, in sellyng of their marchaundyse, or when they vtter corrupte and naughty ware for good, when thei deceiue their neyghboure w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> false weyght and measure, when with forged letters and fayned newes they perswade other to be hasty to sell that kynde of ware good chepe, whiche they knowe wyll be dere shortely after, or elles by suche lyke crafte, entice men to bye of them great plentye of that kynde of marchaundyse, of the whiche they knowe that the pryce wil shortely after decay. Or when wyth their lyes and periuries they cause a man to gyue more monye for any stuffe, then he wold haue donne yf that he had kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
<pb n="lxxviii" facs="tcp:9778:99"/>
that they had lyed. Also when the riche marchaunte men and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serers, haue the heads of the poore handy craftes men so bounde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their girddels, that the poore men of necessitie are compelled to brynge their ware to theim, and when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> handy craftes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do come to them and offer their stuffe than they fayne that they haue no nede of suche wares at that tyme, and by suche meanes compell theym to sell their wares better chepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be able to aforde theim, not regardyng what greate losse theyr poore neyghbore doth suffer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Also when by forstallynge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratyng, agrementes in haules to rayse the price of thinges, ingros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge of marchaundise, when one man or one companye getteth all in their awne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, that no man maye haue gayne but they onely,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:100"/>
when by these or suche lyke decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes they compell the poore to bye at their own price, suche wares as they must nedes occupie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be arrant theues before God. For by suche fraude they begyle theyr poore neyghbors, &amp; poolle theym of their monie agaynst theyr wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. The handycraftes men and daylye laborers also are theues, when they do not applye theyr wourke diligently and faythful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but sell counterfeyted &amp; slyght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought wares for substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al stuffe, or require more for their labor and paynes then they haue deserued.</p>
               <p>Lyke wyse it is of husbande men in the countrey, to whome Lordes and gentle men let theyr lande to ferme to thentente y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should plowe and tyl it, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the commen welthe maye haue
<pb n="lxxix" facs="tcp:9778:100"/>
plentye of corne, and dearth maye be auoided: than if they be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or slouthful in plowyng the grounde, or sel their corne, cattal or other vitayle, at vnreasonable prices, to enriche themselues ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, they be veraye theues before the face of God. For Kynges lordes and gentle me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do not giue to their fermors the proprietie or inheritaunce of their landes, but onely for certein rentes and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices do let their grounde out by lease, for this entent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that the fermors should tyl the same. And the fermour or husbande man, to whome suche lease is made, is nothynge elles but a seruaunt appointed by the lorde so to occupie his grounde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther by the commen people may be fedde &amp; nourished. Now ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yf he do not diligently plowe
<pb facs="tcp:9778:101"/>
and sow the ground as he is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, or elles yf he set so exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue a price vpon hys corne that the multitude (whome his deutye is to feade) is not able to bye it, then he his gyltie of thefte before God. For yf fermers and hus<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>band men were so owners of their fermes and landes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might chose whether they woulde plowe them or no, then they shoulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be able to pay theyr rent due vnto their landlordes, &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men people shoulde perchaunce dye for hunger.</p>
               <p>Lykewyse this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is to be vnderstand of house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, whether they be men or women prentises, iourney men, or hyred labourers. For all these receaue wages for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente, that they shoulde laboure and wourke for their maysters
<pb n="lxxx" facs="tcp:9778:101"/>
profyte, and helpe their maysters in true gettyng, and faithfull ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng of their goodes, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their householde. But when suche serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes be vntrusty, negligent or slouthful in doynge their dutie, when they wastfullye spende or consume their masters goodes, when they require grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wages then they be worthye to haue, when they start or runne from their maisters, or tarye not so longe as they were bounde by their couenant, then they breake this commaundemente. Thou shalte not steale, for asmuche as thei withdrawe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their maisters that profyt, whiche of dewtie they owe vnto them, and do asmuche as lyeth in them to empoueryshe and vndo their maisters. And to be shorte, they that paye not to their seruauntes or wourkemen
<pb facs="tcp:9778:102"/>
their wages in dew tyme, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to their couenante. They which wil not at the day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted restore that monye which thei haue borowed. They which can, and wil not pay their dettes, for their awne lucre. They y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> do not render thinges whiche they haue found, as farre as they can come to knowlege of the trew owners. They that do not gyue agayne suche thinges as be committed to their custodie for a tyme. And generally all they that do hawke and ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te for other mens goodes against the wil of the owners, or do hurte them in any parte of the same, or elles yf they seke not their neighbours profyte, as thei ought to do. Al these (I saye) are theues before God, although the worlde dothe not so iudge them, nor punyshe them for the same.
<pb n="lxxxi" facs="tcp:9778:102"/>
Hereby you maye perceaue good children, howe great misery reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in this wretched worlde, and that men swimme (as it wer) in a floode of synne. For the worlde is full of priuie theues, and there is almoste no state or kynde of lyfe, from the highest to the lowest, of the whiche there be not manye that haue broken this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente. And yet we counte it a villanie, to be called a thefe, and not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out good cause. For thefes be punyshed with most shamefull death, hangynge on the galowes or gybbyt. And althoughe they escape hangynge in this worlde, yet many tymes God punysheth them, so that they lyue wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all their lyfe tyme.

<pb facs="tcp:9778:108"/>
and did see when this man lent him this summe of monye, (wheras he saw no suche thinge in deade) then this false witnesse doth to his neyghboure double iniurye. For first he causeth that his neyghboure is compelled to pay that monye, whiche he neuer borowed.

The whiche thing when it chaunceth, the partie of whome this euel brute is sprede, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done in this world, and suffereth greater damage by the losse of his name, then yf he shoulde lese

al his riches. Wherfore it is not without a cause, that God so er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlye forbyddeth vs to beare false witnes. For as by trew wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes bearyng, discorde, strife and contention is ended, both in the lawe and out of the lawe, so by false testimonies, strife, discorde and variaunce is sowen and sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and wrong thereby great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mainteined. Wherfore God in this commaundemente forbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, that with lies we slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre not our neyghboure, that we gyue no occasion to hatred, dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde or debate, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we studye to speake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truthe, and (asmuche as it shall lie in vs) to reconcyle men together. For this is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vertue, which highly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God. For Christ saith in the gospel. Blessed are they that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke peace, for they shall be called
<pb facs="tcp:9778:109"/>
the childerne of God. Wherfore good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, beware chiefly, that you be no liers, nor false witnes berers, but for any occasion you spare not to speake the trueth at all tymes and places, and specy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when you be brought for witnesses into commen courtes or open iudgementes. For God hymselfe hath ordeyned lawes, courtes and officers, to defende the good, and to punyshe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euel, without the whiche, there can be no peace or quietnes in this worlde. They be the succour and sanctuarie of fatherles and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therles children, of widowes and of all oppressed persons. And he that shoulde go about to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne this commen refuge of all persons that suffre wrong, it can not otherwayes be, but he muste nedes synne against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordinance
<pb n="lxxxvii" facs="tcp:9778:109"/>
of God, and greuously hurt hys neyghboure. But no man doth peruerte and ouerturne iustyce, courtes, and iudgementes, more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a false wytnes, wherfore this is a very heynous synne before God. For a false wytnes doth forsweare himselfe againste the seconde commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, he doth as much as lieth in him to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and destroye courtes and iudgements, founded and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyshed by God, he despiseth and deceueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge, he hurteth hys neyghbor both in his name and goods, he stoppeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peace, fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp and agremente, the whiche shoulde haue ben made betwene the parties by the iudges trewe iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he mainteineth wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, and continueth hathred, debate and contention, of the whiche fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth brawlyng, fyghtyng and
<pb facs="tcp:9778:110"/>
oftentymes manslaughter. The whiche heynous synnes God wil not suffer to escape vnscourged, but horribly will punishe theim. Wherfore let euery man auoyde false witnes bearyng, as they would flye the plage or poyson. By this commaundemente also God wythdraweth vs, from all euel suspicions, that we thynke not euel of our neyghbor, nether expounde his wordes or deades to the wourst, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we suspecte hym not without a cause nor vtter to other our suspicions conceyued against any man, as long as we knowe not certaynly the truth. For they which groundyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vpon suspicions, do rayse euel tales or vntrue brutes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their neighboure, they do beare false witnes against hym, and do more hurte then open ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
<pb n="lxxxviii" facs="tcp:9778:110"/>
For they that lye openly, or that in the face of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courte beare false witnes against a man, may be accused &amp; punyshed for theyr offence. But me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not so easely auoyde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> venomie of suche per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whiche secretly by poysened wordes, or other meanes, causeth his neyghboure to be suspected.</p>
               <p>For they so secretly handle the matier, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they bryng their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure in slaunder, and yet they wyl not be knowne that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by theim. And this is no small offense, contrarie to thys eight commaundement. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vtterly exchewe this vice, &amp; be not suspicious of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, takynge all thynges that you heare or see in theim to the worste, but rather to the beste. For this is the nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of Christen charitie as
<pb facs="tcp:9778:111"/>
sayncte Paule saieth. Charitie thinketh none euel.<note place="margin">1. Cor xiii,</note> And for the better vnderstanding of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good children, marke wel this, that by this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement are forbidden al speakyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges and communication, whiche be against charitie to the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our neyghboure. For what so euer we talke agaynste charitie, is synne, althoughe we speake nothynge but the trueth. Therfore our lord Iesus Christ saieth, men shall make an acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of euery idle worde. Now yf we must make a rekeni<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of idle wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des, much more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we shal reke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our slaunderous wourdes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste our neighours. Whiche synne although it raigne in the worlde to commonly, yet it is an horrible and haynous offense. Wherof many euils &amp; harmes,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:111"/>
but no good thinge doth aryse. For when mens synnes be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshed and spreade abrode, many therby take occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of synne, and thinke on this fashion. Yf thys and that man haue donne thys thynge, why maye not I do it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, seyng it is a faute commenlye practised in the worlde. Therfore sainct Paul saieth. Whoredome &amp; couetousnes let it be not ones named amonge you.<note place="margin">Ephes. v.</note> And Christe saieth of hym that gyueth occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of synne. It wer better for him, that a mylstone wer hanged about his necke and he to be cast into the botome of the sea. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, when we vse thus rashely to slaunder men, it chaunceth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes, that the parties whiche be slaundered, be made therby paste shame, vnrepentaunte and more obstinate to continew in their wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:9778:112"/>
lyfe. For by malicious slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many offenders be prouoked to rage, and often times brust out into these woordes. I wyll do it agayne, because men talke of it. What haue they to do wyth my dedes? and such lyke wordes. And some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be the worser in deede, continuynge in their synnes al the dayes of theyr lyfe. Where as yf they were gentely, secretlye and frendly admonyshed, they mighte be wonne &amp; brought to the righte waye againe. Wherefore make not the wourste of mens faultes, neyther be desyrouse to tell theym abrode, althoughe you knowe the thynges to be trew.<note place="margin">Mat. xviii</note> But kepe the rule of Christ which sayth. Yf thy brother trespace against the, go, &amp; tell hym his faulte betwene hym and the alone, yf he heare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, thou haste wonne thy brother. But yf
<pb n="lxxxix" facs="tcp:9778:112"/>
he heare the not, then take wyth the one or two, that in the mouthe of two or three wytnesses euerye mater may stande, yf he heare not them, tell it vnto the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

This is the best and moste honest waye to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat synners, and to handle other mennes faultes. And he that wyll not vse this waye, lette hym holde his tongue. For bacbytynge and yl reportyng doth more hurt then good. And it is not ynoughe for vs to refrayne oure owne tongue from euyll reportes, but we must also take heede, that we gyue no occasion to other so to do, that is to say, we must nether mainteyne, reioyce nor comforte theim, that speake euyl of their neyghbours, but bothe with oure countenance

For the whiche cause all men are synners, and there is not one man innocent before God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saying of S. Paul.

And these appetites &amp; desires we maye perceaue to be euen in infantes which lye in their cradel.

playne and euident tokens, that infantes newly borne, be giuen to their owne willes and appetites, and are synners, for asmuche as thei transgresse this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thou shalt not desire. And it is much necessary for you good children, to marke dilygently and to beare away this lesson, to then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you maye therby acknowlege your awne synne. And let not the sayinges of certen vnlerned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons moue you, whiche affirme that infantes and suche as be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeres of discretion, are pure, innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and cleane without sinne. For this opinion is not true, nor agreable to holye scripture. And they that say so, deceaue both the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and other. For infantes are baptised for this purpose, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they by the same maye enioy remission of their synnes. And in case they

neded not forgyuenes of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had no nede to be Christened. But ther be fewe that vnderstandeth this doctrine. For mans reason can not attayne to it, neither can it comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, how infantes should be synners by the reason of lustes &amp; desiers, called concupiscence in the whiche they be conceiued and borne, but they that leane to their naturall witte iudgeth yong babes to be innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and voyde of synne, because they committe no outwarde offence or actual synne. But we in this case must not iudge after our reason, but according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of God, whiche euidently declareth vnto vs, that concupiscence is synne. For yf we were in dede cleane, fawtles and innocente, then oure nature woulde not so vehemently seke for those thinges whiche are
<pb facs="tcp:9778:117"/>
pleasaunt to oure appetites, but woulde be contente with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which God shoulde sende vnto vs, and whatsoeuer thing did please God, that also should please vs. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer we shulde not so much desire to auoide suche thinges as be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant to the flesh, as we should desire to auoyde those thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges that be forbydde by gods law. Also we shoulde be more willyng to suffre all kynde of afflyctions, paynes and miseries (yf it were gods will that we should so do) then contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his wil, to hauke and hunte for pleasures, to seke to liue idely, to hurde vp riches, purchase lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des or other commodities. But now we feale in oure selues, that euen from our tendre age and in our cradels also, we be cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary mynded. For we begynne to couet and lust for pleasant thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="xcvi" facs="tcp:9778:117"/>
lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before we know whether God wyll gyue them vnto vs, or no. Also we abhorre and be werye of displeasant thinges, longe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we know whether it be gods will that we shoulde be relyued of the same or no. Yea although we knowe gods wil neuer so wel, yet we longe and lust for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And this is surely a great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. For gods will ought to be fulfylled and not ours, as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier in the Lordes prayer. And to knowe this thing, good chyldren, is a point of high wisedom, to the which euery man doth not attain For thapostle Paule doeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that he had not knowen this synne, yf the lawe had not gyuen him warnyng of it. For he sayeth, I had not knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concupiscence, yf the lawe had not sayed: Thou shalt not desire or lust. Wherfore
<pb facs="tcp:9778:118"/>
good children, locke vp this lesso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the cofer of your memories, by the whiche you shall learne trulye to feare God. For we oughte not then only to dreade God, when by outwarde acte or worke we breke his lawes, but also as often as we feale in vs these yll lustes &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal desiers. And althoughe these lustes do for a time, as it wer slepe in vs, and do not sturre or moue vs, yet not withstandynge theyr quiet rest, we ought to knowe that they lye hyde in the priuye corners of our hartes, and that for al their slomberyng they be synnes before God. For yf God had not taken them for synnes, then he woulde not haue forbide them by this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement. Thou shalt not long or lust. For as sainct Paule saith. The lawe was not gyuen to the iust ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">i. Timo. i.</note> nor doth forbid any thing
<pb n="xcv" facs="tcp:9778:118"/>
but synne only. Wherefore (good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) forasmuche as we knowe, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cupiscence lust or longyng is synne, we ought to eschewe and bridle it (asmuche as we maye) by gods grace. And it is our parte chiefly to take hede, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent not to the request of oure yll lustes, nor fulfyl in outwarde acte the desiers of the fleshe. And that you maye the better attayne to the vnderstandyng of this commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, I wyll declare vnto you the other wordes of this commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, thou shalt not desire thy neyghbours house. Where you shall note, that this worde, house, doth not onely signifye the house wherin men do dwell, but it beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth al the hole householde, and the whole state of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> householder, and all thinges that belong vnto him. Some tyme it is taken for a
<pb facs="tcp:9778:119"/>
stocke or kynrede. As when we say, he &amp; I come out of one house, meanyng thereby that we be both of one stocke or kyndrede. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is the perfit sense of this commaundemente. When thy neighbour is a noble man borne, and hath goodly manors, greate cupbordes of plate, costlye hanginges of cloth of arris, great plenty of riches and aboundance of all thynges as apperteyne to suche a housholde, then thou shalt not desier his house, that is to say, thou shalte in no wyse wyshe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might lese any of these thinges, to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou myghtes haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nor couetousnes or worldly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er oughte not so to rauyshe thy minde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou woldest be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> state of lyfe that he is in, but let that kynde of lyuyng please the, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto it hath pleased God to call
<pb n="cxvii" facs="tcp:9778:119"/>
the. Wherfore good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lerne without booke (I praye you) this short lesson, and put it daylye in execution. Couet not, nor longe not for a more noble or welthy state, then God hathe already gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto you. But let euery man be content with his proginie, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, callyng, state and degree, for so ye shall please God, and obey hys wyll.</p>
               <p>Furthermore they breake this commaundemente, that be desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to put theyr neyghbour out of his house or lande, to thentente that they maye haue the same. Also thou offendest herein, when thou arte glad to see thy neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour fall in decaye, &amp; in hys nede dost offre to lende hym monye, to the entent he maye runne so farre in thy delte, that at length he shall be compelled to offre to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce
<pb facs="tcp:9778:120"/>
to be solde, now in this case if thou bie thesame, thou dost synne, yea although thou paye as moche money as the lande is worth. For thou oughtest to loue thy neyghboure as thyne owne selfe, and to wyshe vnto hym as good chaunce and great prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as thou wouldest to thy self. Nowe thou wouldest not gladlye be put from thyn owne patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, thou wouldest not be oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with dette or pouertie. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou mayest not wyshe or do to thy neyghbour, that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dest not other men shoulde do to the. Therefore thou mayste not hauke or hunte for his patrymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, thou mayst make no traynes to brynge him in to thy snare, and to cause him to sell the same, but thou oughtest rather to helpe thy neyghbour both with thy counsel
<pb n="xcviii" facs="tcp:9778:120"/>
and wyth thy money, to kepe still hys inherytaunce and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraude his heyres or posteritie of those landes, whiche hys aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters by longe succession haue left to him and his heires. Now good children you haue hearde the true meanynge of the nynth precepte, and because it teacheth you, howe to ordre your herte, I praye you learne it by harte, that when you be demaunded, how vnderstande you the nynth commaundement, you maye answere we oughte to feare and loue oure Lorde God aboue all thynges, and for hys sake so to chastice oure eyes and lustes, that we desyer not oure neyghboures house, nor other thynge belongynge vnto hym, that we putte hym not frome hys possessyons or goodes but helpe him (asmuche as shall lye in vs)

the one perfitely, shal easely perteyue the other, for they bothe haue one purpose and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to clense the inwarde manne, and to purge the hearte from all yll affections and lustes. But wheras the former commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente dyd forbydde vs, that we or shuld not wishe to succede our neyghbour in his la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, honours dignities, a carnall man woulde peraduenture reason on this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion.

For he hathe greate plentye of all these thinges, and maye spare one or two of them without any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraunce or great losse. And that whyche doeth hym but small ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
<pb n="c" facs="tcp:9778:122"/>
by reason of hys greate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundaunce, woulde do me moch pleasure, and greatly releaue my necessitie. To this obiection God himselfe doth answere in this last commaundemente, saying. Thou shalte not desire thy neyghbours wife, seruaunte, mayde, Oxe or Asse, no thou shalt desire no thing that is thy neyghbours. For god is the maker of all thynges, and Lorde of all creatures and he gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaseth hym. Wherfore yf he haue gyuen anye thynge to thy neyghbour, whiche he hathe not sente to thee, enuye not thy neyghbour therefore, nor go about to conuey it from hym, but thynke this. Yf it were God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des pleasure, that I shoulde pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse suche a thynge, or yf he knew that it wer for my welthe, to haue it, he woulde haue sente it to me,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:123"/>
aswell as to my neyghboure. For surely good chyldren, these rauenynge woulfes, that be euer thryftynge after other mennes goodes, lacke the benediction of God and therefore they can not long prosper, no not in this world For other they bryng nothyng to passe wyth all theyr gapyng gle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng and carefulnesse, or yf they obteyne theyr purpose, yet verely (all thynges accompte) theyr losse is greater then theyr gaynes. For in this worlde they lese y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure both of God and man, they lese their good name &amp; fame, &amp; ar called of euery man extorcioners, brybers pollers &amp; piellers, deuou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rers of widowes houses, &amp; oppres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sers of fatherles and motherles children. And what a gaynyng is it I praye you, by purchasynge of a lytle lande herein this lyfe to
<pb n="ci" facs="tcp:9778:123"/>
purchase therwithal euerlastynge damnacion in hel? What profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it a man (sayeth Christ) yf he wynne all the worlde and lese hys awne soulle? what dyd Dauid wynne, when he lusted after the wyfe of Urie, &amp; had his pleasure of her? did not God therfore so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshe him, that he hymselfe lost all his awne wifes? For his sonne Absolon in the sight of al the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple entred vnto his fathers wyfe, and defloured them all in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers owne house, and after dyd purswe his father Dauid eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto death. What did it profit Achab, that he slewe Naboth &amp; toke pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of his vyneyarde? Ueryly God did punyshe him therfore in such sorte, that he caused him to be slayne in the next battayle that he went vnto and toke the kyngdom from al his succession, &amp; destroyed
<pb facs="tcp:9778:124"/>
all hys lynage, and lefte not one man alyue, and beside all this, the dogges licked Achabes bloude in the same place wher he caused Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>both to be slayne. What gayned Iudas, when he solde oure Lorde Iesus Christ for thirtie peaces of syluer? verilye he was punyshed of God therefore, and was so tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the horrible feare of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, that he ran to the halter for succour, and hanged himselfe. Wherwith as he ended y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miseries of this life, so he began, the paines of the other lyfe.

<pb n="cii" facs="tcp:9778:124"/>
and euel endes. Wherefore good children let this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement deapely synke into youre hartes, and considre wel, that it is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor creature, but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> saith vnto you, Thou shalt not desier thy neyghbours wyfe, his man seruant, woman seruant, oxe, asse, or any other thing that is hys. For to desier these thinges, is a very heynous synne, &amp; God will not suffre it to escape vnpunished. And althoughe men now a dayes take it but for a trifle whan a man hath a true and diligent seruant, to entice him awaye by all craftes and meanes, yet surely God wyl punishe the same sharpely. For as they entice their neyghbours ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts from theim, so god suffreth other men to alure their seruantes awaye lykewise. And moreouer this inconuenience co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth herby,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:125"/>
that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seruantes perceaue men to sue for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they waxe so hawte and stubburne, that they wyll be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with no meane wages, and be so proude, that they regarde not their maysters, nor stande in awe of theim, but whan so euer theyr olde maysters, do displease theim, by and by they wil seke for a newe. And when they be not conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with their olde wages, they desiermore. And this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint of seruantes is now a dayes al most in euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mouthe, and yet it is not redressed, because it is the iust punyshment of God, wherewith he scourgeth theim, that allure their neyghbors seruantes from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And God doth not punyshe onely suche as entice other mennes serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes from them but also all those that go about to gette anye other parte of their neyghbours goodes or cattel. For
<pb n="ciii" facs="tcp:9778:125"/>
yf thou take thy neyghbors house ouer his hed, or put him out of his house by any crafty conueyance, then manye tymes God taketh ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geance with syckenes or losse of thy goodes. Yf thou conuey awaye his cattell, commonly they prosper not, but dye of some kynd of moirrein. And whatsoeuer thinge we thus purchase and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to godds commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, it lacketh the blessynge of God, wherfore it can not long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure or prosper. Therfore I pray you good childe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, frame your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and lyues accordyng to this rule. Be content that euery man may enioy and kepe to hymselfe, that thing which God hath giuen him. When gods pleasure shall so be, he wyll also sende to you, that whiche you desier. And he is able so to gyue it you, that your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure
<pb facs="tcp:9778:126"/>
therby shal suffre no losse or damage. Couet not youre neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours wife, house, seruaunt or any thynge that is his, except it be by his wil and consent. And yf it shal chaunce any of you, to be couenant seruaunts with any man, then let no craftye or malicious felowes persuade you, to forsake youre maysters, but do them faythfull seruice (as youre dutie is.) And trust not suche flateryng or slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous tongues, as go aboute to entice you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your maysters. For suche men are the dyuels messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which entende nothing elles but to allure you to synne, and to brynge you into miserie. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue this good children, as a moost sure article of your faith, that our God is the true lorde of all thing, he is the gouerner and maister of all the worlde, and all is but his
<pb n="ciiii" facs="tcp:9778:126"/>
owne householde. He first made vs, and from tyme to tyme doth daylye nouryshe vs. He doth set all thinges in ordre in his familie, he it is, that doth cal euery man to that office, state, ordre, degre and kynde of lyuyng, in the whiche it pleaseth hym to set theim. He wyll gyue to euery man, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing which he hath nede of, so that we with all our hartes obey him. Wherefore ther is no cause whythou shuldest couet thy neighbors goods, or by any subtyl conueyance get them into thy handes. For this thinge wanteth the blessyng of God, yea it deserueth his curse &amp; maledyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For scripture saith.

to learne the christian faythe and the articles of the same. For you haue hearde that without it there is nothing able to reconcile vs to God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, to pacifie his wrath and to bringe vs to the lyfe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyng. For althoughe the tenne commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dementes are an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t godly and heauenly doctrine, yet we can not be saued or iustifyed by theym. For we be not able of our owne strength and power to fulfyll the lawe and goddes holy commaundementes. But by theym, we onelye do learne what God requireth of vs, and so be brought to the knowledge of our synne.<note place="margin">Roma. iii.</note> For this is the office of the lawe (as saincte Paule sayeth) to teache vs our offences and to set before our eyes the great feare of God and the indignation whiche we haue deserued by breakynge
<pb n="cvi" facs="tcp:9778:128"/>
his commaundementes, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that we acknowledgyng our owne weakenesse, shoulde flye to Goddes grace and mercye.</p>
               <p>This feare of God is learned in the ten commaundementes, and it is the begynnyng of wysedome But the holy christian fayth is a muche more hyghe and excellente knowledge and wysedome, as sayncte Paule wytnesseth saying.<note place="margin">i. Cori. ii</note> We speake wysedome amonge theym that are perfecte, such wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as is not of thys worlde, nor of the rulers of thys worlde, whiche be mortall, but we teache the wysedome of God, whiche is secret and hyd, which God ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before the worlde vnto oure glorye, whiche wysedome none of the rulers of this worlde dyd knowe. These be the wordes of sayncte Paule, whereby he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb facs="tcp:9778:129"/>
that the science of fayth pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth al other sciences, and teacheth heauenly and eternall wisedome that excedeth all mennes philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phye. For by faythe we learne to knowe God, what he is, and what loue he beareth towarde vs, and howe great benefites he hath hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vpon vs. For by fayth we be made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, and he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto vs the holy goost, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che doeth lyghten and kyndle our hartes, that we maye begynne to kepe hys lawe, whiche els of our owne strengthe we were not able to kepe and fulfyll. Wherfore good children it is necessarie for you to learne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of faithe, for without it we can not be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or brought agayne into gods fauour. For no man is iust or rightuous before God, that hath not the holy gost, and he that will

receyue the holy gooste, muste be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in Christe (for by faith we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the holy goost) therefore by faith we be iustified. Agayne yf we wyll be saued, we must knowe God and our Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Ioh. xv</note> as it is written Iohn the .xvii.

He is present in euery place, he seeth and beholdeth all thinges, whiche we do, speake, or thynke, and yet he is not measured with any ende, tyme or place. And forasmuche as mannes witte coulde not serche or fynde out the knowlege of thys highe misterie of the substaunce of God, Christ himselfe the sonne of God dyd open to vs that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in hym what God is. That is to say, that there is God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God the sonne, and God the holy goste, three persones, and yet one true and euerlastyng God. And it is your bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dutie (good children) diligently to learne thys lesson. And although these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges passe all mennes capacities,
<pb n="cx" facs="tcp:9778:132"/>
and is a doctrine harde for you to learne, yet in tyme to come you shal heare more of this matier. In the meane season beare awaye (I praye you) thys one lesson, that there is one true and euerlastinge God, and yet three persones, the father, the sonne and the holy gost And this we call the Trinitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these thre, the father, the son and the holy goost are one godlye substaunce. And it is a great shame for you that be christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not to learne this lesson. For all you were baptised in the name of the father, and of the sonne and of the holy goost, and thereby you were made christen and the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, and obteyned remission of youre synnes. Wherfore it is your dutie to learne &amp; knowe, in whose name you ar baptised, that so you maye truly know God and youre
<pb facs="tcp:9778:133"/>
father which you haue in heauen. And this doth plainly and shortly teache vnto you the Crede. For in the Crede wherin we saye thus: I beleue in God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye. And I beleue in Iesus Christ his onely sonne, and last of all we saye. I beleue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy gost, these thre sentences be asmuche to saye, as I beleue in God, whiche is the father, the sonne, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy gost. Infidels and vngodly people do not knowe this, nor can vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the same. But Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men haue this mysterye so openlye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto them, in the worde of God, that babes and yong childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may heare and learne this lesson, almost as soone as they be able to crepe out of their cradell. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de hartely to tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke God, which hath opened vnto vs so great wisedome and mysteries.
<pb n="cxxvii" facs="tcp:9778:133"/>
Hereby you perceaue (good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne) that in this shorte treatice called the Crede (as I said before) we be taught what God is, that is to saye, God the father, God the sonne and God the holy gost. Also herby we learne what great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytes God hath gyuen vnto vs, and howe tenderly he loueth and fauoreth vs lyke a moost gentle and mercifull father. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche knowlege, consisteth our felicitie, and blessednes. For yf we did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowe, what God were, &amp; dyd know nothing of his wil towarde vs, whether he were our frende or foo, fauourable or angrie, pleased or displeased with vs, then oure conscience beynge waueryng and doutful, shoulde be destitute and voide of comforte. Wherfore lysten to me dilygently good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne, that you maye knowe what
<pb facs="tcp:9778:134"/>
benefites those be which god hath gyuen among you, what loue he beareth towarde you, and what is the hope of euerlastynge lyfe to the whiche we be called. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of God towarde vs be infy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and innumerable, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles as God himself is thre per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the father, the sonne and the holy gost, so there be thre specyall workes whereby he hath declared his singular loue towarde vs. The first is, that God the father hath creat &amp; made vs of nothing, and gyuen to vs bodye and soule, and all thinges necessarye to the maintenaunce of our lyues, and hath made vs lordes ouer al erth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creatures. The seconde is, that whan we were all borne in synne, God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne dyd redeme vs from our synnes and wicked lyfe. The thirde is that the holy gooste
<pb n="cxii" facs="tcp:9778:134"/>
doth renewe our hartes, sanctifye vs, and make vs the temples of God. And in these thre benefytes, gyuen vnto vs by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thre parsons of the most blessed Trinitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth the matier and effecte of the hole Crede. For this is the briefe summe of the Crede, to saye. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in God the father, whiche did creat and make me. I beleue in God the sonne, whiche did redeme me. And I beleue in the holy gost, whiche hath sanctifyed and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me. For the whiche consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations we entende to deuyde this our exposition made vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Crede, into thre partes, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which the first shalbe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Creation, the second of the Redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the third of Sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And first we will entreat of the Creation, which is expressed in these wordes I beleue in God the father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:135"/>
maker of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth. Where note good children, that this worde (I beleue) signifyeth asmuche in this place, as I truste. So that this sentence I beleue in God the father, is asmuch to saye, as I trust in God the father, and loke assuredly to receaue all good thinges at his hande. Wherefore this is the meanyng of the forsaid artycle that we ought to put oure trust in no creature, but in the true and liuing god only. For no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do vs any good or harme without the wil of him. We oure selues made not oure selues (as it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the psalme) nor we can nether saue ourselfes, nether dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs from any perrel. Therfore we ought to put our trust in God only, sticke fast to him, hang vpon hym, and to loke for al good thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at his hande. They therfore
<pb n="cxiii" facs="tcp:9778:135"/>
that trust in men, in theyr fauour or fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dship, they that trust in their owne learnyng, wysedome, riches, power, frendes, or any such thing, they do not truely beleue in God, truly &amp; holly trust in him, nor loke for al good thinges from him, but rather dispise him, and worship for theyr God and make an ydole of that thynge, wherin they put their trust, and so greuously offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d god. Wherfore it must nedes be, that at the length thei must be brought to confusion and ruine that they may lerne by their owne fal and decay, that those wer but vaine thynges, wherin they put their truste &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and that onely God is the sure rocke and staye, vpon whome who so euer leaneth, shall not be deceyued nor confounded. For it is the Lord god, whiche daily pou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rethe vpon vs infinite benefites
<pb facs="tcp:9778:136"/>
whiche giueth vs al thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue nede of, &amp; defendeth vs from all thinges y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may hurt vs ether in body or in soule. And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue whiche he bereth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vs, to do al goodnes toward vs, without our merites or deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynges. Wherefore we ought to trust in him, yelde our selfes holly into his protection to loke for all good thinges at his hande, &amp; with a mery harte and constant faith to cleaue to his goodnes in all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And this is the highest and chiefest sacrifice wher with God is pleased &amp; worshipped. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer beleueth in him after thys sort, those he taketh for his welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louyd children and in all thynges he declareth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he is their louyng father. Wherefore (good children) let vs not put our trust in any creature, or in any worldly
<pb n="cxiiii" facs="tcp:9778:136"/>
thing, but at all tymes let vs faste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oure sure trust in our Lord God. So we shalbe made his children, and enioy lyfe euerlastinge.</p>
               <p>Nowe considre good chyldren what a God he is, in whome we beleue, and in whome we put oure trust. He is God the father, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghtye maker of heauen and earthe. And these woordes good children ought not slyghtly to be passed ouer, for they be of greate weight and importaunce. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I pray you as it were in ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance to wey them dyligently and learne to vnderstande theym. For these wordes conteine not in them worldly phylosophye or mannes sapience, but heauenly and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wysedome. Wherfore I praye you gyue good eare whiles I do declare them to you.</p>
               <p>First this article teacheth vs
<pb facs="tcp:9778:137"/>
that God is almyghtye, that is to saye, that he hath power to worke &amp; do all thinges whatsoeuer plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth hym, and no creature in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or earth is able to let or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande him, and that no thynge is vnpossible vnto him. And this is the foundacion and begynnynge of christian knowledge and faith, to beleue that God is almyghtye. The whiche many men do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, and yet neuertheles they will be counted christen men, or rather great clarkes. In thys number be they, that do not beleue the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of Christ truely to be gyuen in the Lordes supper, to theym that receyue the sacramente, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe Christe hymselfe sayeth playnely. Take eate thys is my bodye. And why do they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue this? verely because they dyd neuer trulye beleue thys article,
<pb n="cxv" facs="tcp:9778:137"/>
that God is almyghtye, but they thynke that God is not able to work or do that thing, which they can not compasse with their awne wit, and reason.</p>
               <p>But you good children folowe not suche, but beleue you, with all youre hearte, that God is almyghtye, that he is able to worke and do all thynge that he wylleth and perfourme all thing that he speaketh or promiseth. And in so doyng you shall fynde great peace and quietnes in your consciences. For this is an exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng comforte for vs, stedfastly to beleue this article, that God is almyghty. For hereby we be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, in all perels and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities to put our trust in him, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmoche as he is able to delyuer vs out of al troubles and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, although they seme to mans
<pb facs="tcp:9778:138"/>
reason remediles. Hereby also we be taught, to humble oure selues before God, and not to be proude, neyther to dyspyse or forget hym when all thynges goeth after our owne wyll, but to consyder that God is almightie, and able with a becke to ouerturne kingdomes, to cast downe the ryche, to exalte the poore, to punyshe the wicked, and to destroy vs yf we prouoke him to angre. Wherefore good children marke well this worde. Almighty, whiche is as muche to saye as this. No man is so sore sycke, but God is able to heale hym. No man is so poore but God can make hym riche. No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is so symple or dul wytted, whom he is not able to make wyse. No man is so vyle or lytle regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but he is able to promote him to highe honours. No man is so
<pb n="cxvi" facs="tcp:9778:138"/>
greate a synner but he is able to iustifye him. Wherefore in all chaunces we must put our truste in God onelye. For he is able to do what soeuer he willeth, and all thynge is subiecte vnder hys dominion.</p>
               <p>Furthermore in this article God is called maker of heauen and earth, that is to saye, God made heauen and earthe and all thynge contayned therein of no thynge. For God made not these thynges as a carpenter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an house, (whiche can not woorke yf he lacke hys toyles &amp; stuffe.) But he onelye sayde, lette it be done, and by and by all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were done. And therefore he hathe a newe title whiche was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer herde among all the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, beynge called the creatour of the worlde, that is to saye, that
<pb facs="tcp:9778:139"/>
by his woorde he wonderfullye made all thynges of nothynge. And as soone as he did speake, by and by al the worlde stode vp and was made.</p>
               <p>Thus he made manne, and gaue hym bodye and soule, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and wysedome, and dyd sette vnder his gouernaunce the yerth and all thyng that groweth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as all kynde of trees wyth their fruytes, all kyndes of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes and floures, all fyshes of the sea, foules of the ayer and al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of beastes tame or wylde, and he made man Lorde ouer all these creatures, that he myghte vse theym partely to his norishement and foode, and partely to hys ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell and ornament of hys bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, in so muche that he made the Sunne Moone and all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sterres for thys ende, that they shoulde
<pb n="cxvii" facs="tcp:9778:139"/>
serue ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And (that is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte to vs of all) he made al these creatures before he did creat ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, declaryng therby, that he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs and prouydeth suche thinges as we haue nede of, yea before we be borne.</p>
               <p>Wherefore good children let vs be of good chere, and putting our trust in God let vs reason on this fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For asmuch as God made heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and earth, it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that he is Lorde and mayster of the same, and that all thynges aswell in heauen as in earthe are donne accordyng to his wil. And forasmuche as he made all thynge for vs, it is also manyfest therby, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he willeth all creatures to do vs seruice, let vs therfore fo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> counsel of Christ who saith.<note place="margin">Mat. vi.</note> Be not careful for your life what ye shall eate or drynke, nor yet for
<pb facs="tcp:9778:140"/>
your bodye what raiment ye shal put on. Is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyfe more worth then meat? and the bodye, more of value then rayment? Beholde the foules of the ayer, the whiche do neyther sowe nor reape nor carye into the barnes, and yet your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father doth feade theim. Are not you much better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei? Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the lilies of the feld, how they growe. They labour not, thei spynne not. And yet I saye vnto you, that Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himselfe (when he was in his most gorgious roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie and glorye) was not appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled lyke one of these. Nowe yf God dothe so apparell a floure (which althoughe it florysheth to day, yet to morow it wythereth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way &amp; is cast into a fournas) shal he not muche more do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same for you, o ye men of litle faith? These be the wordes of Christ good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

<pb facs="tcp:9778:144"/>
Wherfore now I will vttre vnto you the great mistery of our redempcion, whiche is conteyned in these wordes of the Crede.
<q>I beleue in Iesus Christ his only begotten sonne / our Lorde / whiche was conceyued by the holye goost / borne of the virgin Marie / suffered vnder Ponce Pilate / was cruci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fied / dead and buried. He descended into hell. The thirde daye he rose from death. He asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. He sytteth on the ryghte hande of God the father almyghtie. From thense he shall come to
<pb n="cxxii" facs="tcp:9778:144"/>
iudge the quicke and the dead.</q>
In this seconde part of the Crede we may learne to know the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de person in trinitie, the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of god, Iesus christ our lord. And as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first article ye haue learned what benefytes we receyue of God the father to the sustentation &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this temporal &amp; transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie lyfe, so in this seconde parte we shall lerne to know, how great treasures and ryche gyftes we haue receyued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of God Iesus Christ, to the atteinyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfect &amp; euerlasti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g lyfe. And here you may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how great was the miserie, &amp; how hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible was the indignation of God whiche we were brought vnto by Adam. So great it was, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther golde nor syluer nor anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thynge was able to bye vs
<pb facs="tcp:9778:145"/>
out of the same, but onely Iesus Christ y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of God &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by hys death &amp; effusion of hys moost pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious blod. And of this great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and indignation of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde vs this was the cause. At what tyme God had made Adam and Eue, and set the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in paradyse, he intreated them lyke a most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng and gentle father. For he made theym lordes ouer al liuely creatures, both beastes fyshe and fowle, and did giue vnto them al trees y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bare fruit, that thei might feade thereon. Onely he forbad theym that they shoulde not eate of the tree of knowlege of good &amp; ylle. And yet he gaue theym war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great losse &amp; damage that they should suffer if they eat of that tree saying. When soeuer you shall tast of the fruyt of that tree, you shalbe made mortal and
<pb n="cxxiii" facs="tcp:9778:145"/>
shall dye. Their dutie had bene vnto so gentle a God and so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull a father, in their hartes to haue beleued him, trusted him, &amp; loued him, to haue obeyed hym, and to kepe all his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes gladly. But our most craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye enemy Satan, enuying mans felicitie, spake to Eue by the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and sayde. No, you shall not dye, but you shall be lyke Gods, knowyng both good &amp; euell. And with these most poysened wordes perswaded Eue, to eate of the fruyt whiche was forbydde. And Eue gaue of the same to Adam, who also did eat therof and so did breake gods commaundemente. Nowe I praye you marke good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what thei lost by this their disobedience. First when Adam and Eue wer thus deceyued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> serpent, and perswaded that God
<pb facs="tcp:9778:146"/>
dyd not fauoure theym but had enuye at theim, that they shoulde haue knowledge of good and yll, (and that for enuye he forbad the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eate of that fruit, that shoulde gyue to them so great knowlege) they did no more trust God, but beganne to trust themselues, and did study to care &amp; prouide for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues. Secondarily whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they no more trusted God they coulde no more finde in their hartes to loue hym, but began to dote vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them selues, &amp; to thynke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had no better frende neither in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor earth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their awn selfes. And af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei had thus put their trust and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in themselues, and dotyngly loued all that was their awne, by &amp; by folowed feare and concupiscence. For by an by they beganne to hate and eschewe all thinges, that wer paynful or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant
<pb n="cxxiiii" facs="tcp:9778:146"/>
to the fleshe and dotyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to lust &amp; long for such thinges as wer delectable and pleasant to the fleshe. Hereby you perceiue good children, how our first pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes Adam and Eue, poisened with the venome of the serpente, were cast into .iiii. horrible vices or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases. The firste is, that they dyd not trust in God. The second, that they dyd not loue God. The third that they did not feare him, but as a cruell tyranne. The fourth, that they were replenished with concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence and euyll desiers lustes and appetites. And these be the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of originall synne, oute of the whiche all other synnes do spryng and growe. So Adam and Eue had a very great fal, that fel from gods benediction fauoure &amp; loue, in to gods curse angre &amp; dysplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that fel from original iustyce
<pb facs="tcp:9778:147"/>
into original syn, by the which fal al the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and powers both of their bodyes and soules were sore decaied &amp; corrupted. And as oure firste parentes Adam &amp; Eue were infected and corrupted euen so be we that be their children. For as we see by dayly experience, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menly gowtie parentes begetteth gowtie children. And yf the father and the mother be infected with the leprie, we se commenly that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> borne betwene them haue the same dysease: So lykewyse as our first pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes Adam and Eue, dyd not put their trust in God, no more do they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be carnally borne of theim. And as they loued not God, so their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loue him not. And as they folowed their owne concupiscence lustes and appety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and not the wil of God, euen so do all their yssue. So that all
<pb n="cxxv" facs="tcp:9778:147"/>
their posteritie vpon earth be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners euen in their mothers wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes. For thei haue not their truste in God, they loue not God, they haue not a fatherly feare vnto hym, they be ful of yl lustes appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites &amp; desiers as you haue herde good children in the .ix. and tenth commaundementes. And for this cause the scripture dothe say,<note place="margin">Psal. li.</note> that all we are conceyued and borne in synne. And sainct Paule sayeth, that by nature we be the children of Gods wrathe.<note place="margin">Ephes. ii.</note> So that we all shuld euerlastingly be damned, yf Christ by his death had not rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs.</p>
               <p>Wherfore good children marke well this parte of youre Crede, that teacheth you bothe to knowe Christe, and by what meanes he dyd redeme you. For firste in the Crede he is called, the only sonne,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:148"/>
or onely begotten sonne of God. Whereof it muste nedes folowe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is very God by nature, borne of God the father, before the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion of the worlde was layde. He is the euerlastyng wisedome, and worde of God, by the whiche God the father made all thinges. That he is also verye man, it is euidently expressed in these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. I beleue in Iesus Christe, whiche was conceyued by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gooste, borne of the virgyne Marye, suffered vnder Ponce Pilate, was crucified deade and buried. And these .ii. forsaide thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges I can not comprehende more shortely nor aptely, than by these wordes. Christ our Lorde is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye God and very man. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learne this also, by what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Christ dyd redeme vs. For what soeuer God hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="cxxvi" facs="tcp:9778:148"/>
in the ten commaundementes whiche we haue not fulfylled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we be all synners, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christe himselfe hathe fulfylled for vs. And what soeuer punishment we haue deserued to suffre of God for oure synnes and offences, that Christe hath taken vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himself &amp; suffered for vs. By this you may perceyue howe requisite it was, that Christ God and man, should be conceyued by the holy gooste, and borne of a pure virgyn. For if Christ shoulde redeme vs, and satisfye for our synnes, than must he nedes be holy &amp; without synne. For yf he had bene gyltye and a synner, then coulde not he haue holpen his owne selfe, but he must nedes haue had an other Sauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and Redemer for him, aswel as we haue for vs. For what soeuer he had done or suffred, shuld haue
<pb facs="tcp:9778:149"/>
bene worthely for hys owne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, &amp; yet could he not haue sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for hym selfe, muche lesse then he coulde haue satysfyed for other. Wherfore it was necessary (yf he should satisfye for vs) that he should be conceyued of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gooste, and borne of a virgyn, that his natyuitie myght be pure wythout synne and not corrupte, as ours is. That oure corrupte and damnable natiuitie, myghte be purified and made holy by the holy and pure natiuitie of Christ. Therfore we say in the Crede. He was conceyued of the holy goost, borne of the virgyn Marye, that Christe beynge pure and cleane frome all synne, mighte redeme synners and satisfye for theim. Now for asmuch as the iustice of God dydde require that Christe should suffer and make satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="cxxvii" facs="tcp:9778:149"/>
for vs, and do all thynges that we were bound to do, it was necessarie that he should be made man. For if he had not bene a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray naturall man, he coulde not haue done for vs, all those thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which we were bound to do.</p>
               <p>And agayne, yf he had not bene veraye God, he coulde not haue bene pure and cleane from al syn, and so haue made a true and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect satisfaction for oure synnes. For no man can perfectly fulfyll the wyl of God, but God himself alone. Wherfore in that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for our synnes, therby he de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clared, that he was a verye pure and natural manne. Agayne he gaue moost certayne and euy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente tokens of hys Godhed, in that he ouercomed and vanquy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the deuell synne and deathe. For yf he hadde not bene veraye
<pb facs="tcp:9778:150"/>
God, he coulde not haue losed the bandes of death, nether haue ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himselfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to lyfe. So you hear good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our lorde Iesus Christ was very God and very man, not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyued in syn (as we be) but conceyued by the holye goost, and borne of the moste pure virgyn Marie. And as man he suffred deathe for vs, and descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into hell. But as naturally God he losed the bandes and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of hell, he destroyed the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of death, he rose from deathe to lyfe, and so payed the rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>some for our synnes, and toke away all the gylthynes of the same. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we beleue in Christ and stedfastly cleuyng to the worde of God, suerly perswade oure selues in oure hartes, that we be thus redemed by Christe, then God is no more angry or displeased with
<pb n="cxxviii" facs="tcp:9778:150"/>
vs for our synnes, but freely and mercyfullye he forgyueth vs all our offences, for the deathe and passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his sonne Iesus Christ, and he gyueth vs also the holye gooste, by whose healpe we maye wythstande synne, and be delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the same. The whiche matiers sayncte Paule doth knyt vp in one bryef sentence, not so shorte as notable and weyghtye, sayinge. Christe was dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to deathe for oure synnes, and dyd ryse agayne for oure iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. In the whiche sentence saynct Paule doeth not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what Christe dyd, but also for what ende, and for whome he suffered death, and rose agayne. For seynge that Christe was that moost innocent lambe, that neuer was blotted with any spot of syn, and yet he suffered for vs as a
<pb facs="tcp:9778:151"/>
synner, it is euident hereby, that he dyed not for himselfe, but toke vpon him oure synnes, and bore for vs the burden which we shuld haue borne. Moreouer seing that Christ was not ouercome by deth but by his myghty power he dyd vanquyshe death, and rose frome deathe to lyfe, and sytteth at the ryght hande of the father, hereby we maye euidently perceyue, that the great wrath and indignation of God to vs, hathe an ende, and that by our liuely faith in hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our synnes be forgyuen vs, and that we be reconsiled into the fauoure of God, made holy and ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For than God doth no more impute vnto vs our former syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but he doth impute and giue vnto vs the iustice and ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of his sonne Iesus Christ whiche suffered for vs. These are
<pb n="cxxix" facs="tcp:9778:151"/>
but fewe wordes, but surely they be of greate importaunce. For in this sentence saynct Paule inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the summe and effecte of the holy ghospell, when he sayeth. Christ was deliuered to death for our synnes, and rose agayne for oure ryghtuousnes. For lykewise as when an other man doeth pay my raunsome and satisfye or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre for me, I my selfe am iudged to paye the same, and no man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can accuse me therof. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other is bounde for me, yf he be by any lawful meanes dischar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged, I my selfe am counted to be dyscharged also, euen so foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as Christe hymselfe, toke vpon him the bande of death for vs, and to satisfye for vs, &amp; so did in deede by hys death, we our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was thus bounde iustely be delyuered and dyschar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb facs="tcp:9778:152"/>
from death and damnation. And so we be counted righteous for asmuche as no man dare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse vs for that syn, for the which satisfaction is made by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ. And when oure sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Iesus Christ had thus sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for our synne, and so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came deathe and hell, than lyke a most valiant conquerer he ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heauen, where God hys father receyued him with a moost gloriouse triumphe, and placed, hym on hys ryghte hande, and made him Lorde ouer all creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and therefore he is called in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crede also our Lorde. For yf he had not raunsomed and redemed vs, we had bene cast downe to hel for euer. But seynge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he redemed and bought vs, therfore bewe his &amp; he is our Lorde and mayster, &amp; hym we must loue, obey and serue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cxxx" facs="tcp:9778:152"/>And this is oure moste hye and euerlastynge comforte, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ is our Lorde and we his seruauntes. For because he is oure Lorde, therefore he wyll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende vs, and delyuer vs from all daungers. And althoughe we be synners, yet he wil forgiue vs our synnes, because he hathe payed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>some and det due for thesame. And althoughe we dye, yet he wil rayse vs vp agayne, because he hathe ouercome and conquered death. And althoughe we be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so muche afrayed of the soro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and paynes of hell, yet they shall not be able to holde vs, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that to theym that be hys seruauntes, he hathe broken hell, and set open the gates thereof. Wherfore seynge that we haue so myghtye a Lorde and maister we be out of all peryll and daunger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9778:153"/>But we agayne aboue all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, we muste studye to obey oure lord &amp; mayster, and do those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges whiche he commaundeth.

               <p>Wherefore good children, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure wyth all diligence and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, that when Christe shall come againe to iudge the world, he may finde you holy and obedient. For then he wyll rewarde you wyth euerlastyng lyfe. After thys ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Christ redemed vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> synne, and from the horryble offence of Adam, by whome we were al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
<pb n="cxxxi" facs="tcp:9778:153"/>
For by Christes passy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; death, &amp; by hys ghospell we haue obteined thus much, that we may beleue and trust in god. And trustyng in God, we haue his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirite, whereby we maye also loue God. And thys holy gooste renueth vs and clemeth vs from all euell lustes and desires, that we beynge thus made holye and rightuouse, maye kepe Goddes commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and serue our Lord Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Wherfore good chyldren be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue ye with al your heart in thys Iesus Christ the onelye sonne of God oure Lord, and doubte not but that he hath suffered for our synnes and contented the iustyce of his father for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, and hath brought vs agayne vnto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, &amp; made vs his wel beloued children and heyres of hys kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

And when you be asked, howe vnderstande you the second parte of the Crede, you shall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. I beleue that Iesus Christ, veray God, begotten of God the father, and verye manne, borne of the virgin Marie, is my Lorde, whiche by hys precyouse bloode and holy passyon, hathe redemed me, a myserable &amp; damned wretch from all my synnes, frome death eternall, and from the tyrannie of the Deuell, that I should be his owne true subiect, and lyue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his kyngdome, and serue hym, in a newe and euerlastynge lyfe and iustice, euen as oure Lorde Christe, after he rose from deathe to lyfe, lyueth and raygneth euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastyngly. Or elles if you wyl an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere more shortely, you may say, thus. I beleue that Christe was deliuered to death for our sinnes,

Wherfore when the holy goost is not in man, then it is not possible that he should be holy, althoughe he dyd all the good workes vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sunne. And for this cause saincte Paule, writing to the Romaines,<note place="margin">Roma. i.</note> doth cal the holy gost, the spirite of sanctification, that is to say, the spirit that maketh holynes.

after that sorte &amp; maner, as it shall please him. And it is our part to gyue place to his workynge &amp; not to w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>stande thesame.

And where they could not be prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selfe, or long abide &amp; continew in their awne persons, thither they sent their disciples &amp; other godly &amp; learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they gaue the holy gost, by layng their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their heades.

For saincte Paule
<pb facs="tcp:9778:158"/>
saieth. How shal men beleue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a preacher? And how shal men preache, excepte they be sente? And here you may learne, that this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gospel whiche we preache, and the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of Christe, taught in the hole churche, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not of the wil of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, &amp; by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> motion of the holy gost which doth sturre vp me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s myndes, to publishe gods most holy worde, and doth worke by his secret inspiration in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and ministers of the same. For they wer not able so muche as to open their moughtes, to teache so highe mysteries and heauenlye wysedome, yf the holy gost did not moue theim therto, and worke in theim. Neyther wolde the hearers so greatlye esteme the preachers worde, and giue so good eare vnto it, excepte the holy goost dyd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade

Now the holy goost wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by this worde on this fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. First he that beleueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel, and receaueth the doctrine of Christ, is made the sonne of God, as sayncte Iohn witnesseth in his gospel,<note place="margin">Iohn. ii</note> sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng. As manye as receiue him, he hath gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them power to be made the children of God. For when we beleue in Christ, and are baptised, then we be borne agayne, and are made the children of God. And when we be his children, then he gyueth the holy gost into our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, as sainct Paule testifieth wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng thus.<note place="margin">Galat. iiii</note> Forasmuche as you be now the children of God, therfore God hath sent the spirite of hys sonne into your hartes, which cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Abba, father. And when we haue receaued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy gost, he doth
<pb facs="tcp:9778:159"/>
kyndle in our hartes true loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde God, as saincte Paull wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the pistle to the Romaynes in the fifthe chapter. The loue of God (saith he) is poured abrode in our hartes, by the holy gost which is gyuen to vs. And where as the true loue of God raygneth, there are gods commaundements kept, and there begynneth a certen obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his wil and pleasure. Forthermore the holy goost dothe staye the fleshe and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lustes of the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same, and helpeth vs to ouercome theim, that we be not caried away by them, but may continew in clen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes and holynes of lyfe. These be the benefites and workes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gost in vs. And to thentent you maye the more easely beare them awaye, I wil (as briefly as I can) repete theym agayne vnto you. First of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy gost prouoketh
<pb n="cxxxvii" facs="tcp:9778:159"/>
&amp; stirreth vp men, to preache gods worde. Than he moueth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to faith, &amp; calleth them to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and than by faith and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme he worketh so, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he maketh vs newe men agayne. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be thus newely borne and made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and be bicome the children of God, then the holy gost doth dwel in vs and make vs holy &amp; godly, that we may be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temples of God, in whome God maye dwell and inhabite. Also thys holy ghoste doeth daylye more and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and establyshe our faythe, that we lyke moste louing childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maie colle and embrace our heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father, and hang fast about his necke. The same holy goost doeth also assure and warrant vs, that our synnes be forgyuen, and that our pardon is signed with Gods seal. He doeth also kyndle in vs a
<pb facs="tcp:9778:160"/>
feruent loue towardes God, and maketh vs wylling to kepe gods law and commaundementes, and helpeth vs also to fyght agaynste synne, and to wythstande oure yll appetites and desyers. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more with the crosse of syckenes &amp; diuerse other kindes of afflictions and aduersities, the holy gooste doth as it were, crucifie and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie vs to the world, that we may lyue to Christ. And this worke he woorketh continually in vs, and cesseth not vntil he hath wrought in oure hartes a perfecte faythe &amp; a perfect charitie, and vntyl synne and all euell desyres be cleane at lengthe purged oute of vs, by the death of our bodies. And then we shalbe perfecte in all holines, and cleane delyuered from all synne &amp; aduersitie, and be heires of oure fathers kyngdome, and hys true
<pb n="cxxxviii" facs="tcp:9778:160"/>
and most derely beloued children,</p>
               <p>Wherefore good chyldren, as heretofore you haue bene taught, that we oughte to beleue in God the father that made vs, and in God the sonne that redemed or boughte vs, so you muste nowe learne to beleue in the holy goste that hathe hallowed vs, and doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually more and more renew and make holy, all those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue the gospell. For he that bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in Iesus Christe, that he is oure Lorde and oure redemer, to him God gyueth the holy gost, to make him holye and ryghtuouse. As sayncte Paule witnesseth, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng. No man can cal Iesus, lord, but by the holy goste. And for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as now it hath ben plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie declared vnto you, after what sorte and manner the holy gooste doth sanctifie vs, it is your part,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:161"/>
not onely to emprynt this lesson diligently in youre myndes, but also to desier God, with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and earnest prayers, that he wyll vouchesafe more and more to sanctifie you.</p>
               <p>And as muche as lyeth in you, ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply your selfes to heare godly ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and gyue youre hartes to God lyke waxe, apte and mete to receyue what thyng so euer it shal please him to prynt in you.</p>
               <p>For he that is wyllynge and glad to lysten to godly sermons, he that is studyous to learne the word of god, wherin christ is prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a stedfast faith cleueth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promise of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de partaker of this Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and holynesse, and of this so great comforte, and euerlastyng salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For God sayeth by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Esaye. My worde shall not
<pb n="cxxxix" facs="tcp:9778:161"/>
returne to me in vayne. And saynct Paule sayeth, that the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is the power of God, where wyth he wourketh the saluation of all them that beleue.</p>
               <p>Nowe the rest that folowethe in the Crede, is a shorte declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these thynges before reher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed. For it foloweth in the Crede.</p>
               <p>I beleue the holy catholycke churche, that is to saye, all godly and Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men must beleue, that the gospel or doctryne of goddes grace thorowe the merites of oure sauiour Iesus Christ, is neuer in vayne published in the worlde, or sowed abrode without fruit, but euer there is founde some compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye of men, or some congregacion of good people whiche beleue the gospel and be saued. And this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of men whiche beleueth the gospell, although here vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth
<pb facs="tcp:9778:162"/>
thei be seuered in so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry places, yet are they called one holy catholike or vniuersal churche of Christe, that is to saie, a multitude co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or companye of Christen people. For this worde, churche, doth not here betoken a temple or churche buylded of tymber and stone, but it signifieth a companye of men lyghtened with the spirite of Christe, whiche do receaue the gospel, and come together to heare gods wourde, and to praye. And this Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> churche is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sainctes, that is to saye, all that be of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, be holy, &amp; be one holy body vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der Christe their heed, they be one holy congregation or assemble. And this congregation receaueth of their hedde and Lorde Iesus Christe, all spirituall riches and gyftes that perteyneth to the sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
<pb n="cxl" facs="tcp:9778:162"/>
and making holy of the same bodye. And these gostly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suers, be commen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole body, and to euery membre of the same. For he that is vnfainedly a fayth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full and Godly man, is made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of these benefites. And these are the sayde gyftes, which be com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole church of Christ and to euery membre of the same.</p>
               <p>The first is that God the father (that euerlasti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and endles maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stye) is our most gentle &amp; mercyful father. That God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne, is our redemer and mediatour betwene the father and vs. And that God the holy gost, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commen sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier or halower, of all theim y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue a true faithe in God. The second, is the preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel, thad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of baptisme, and the sacrament of the bodye and bloude of our Lorde Iesus Christ, by the
<pb facs="tcp:9778:163"/>
whiche we are made partakers of all the inheritaunce of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; of all the benefites of Christe. The third, is prayer. The fourth, is the crosse of affliction and aduersitie, whiche God sendeth to all godly men, to make theim to knowe him, to proue therby &amp; trye their faith, to mortifye their fleshe &amp; to make clene the corruption of the same. And here I speake onely of the crosse, which good men suffre. For thafflictions of the vnfaithful and vngodly, do rather hurt them, then make them holy. For inasmuch as their vnpatientnes, is encreaced by such aduersitie, thei be brought to more disperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nowe it is very good for you to knowe these thinges, that you may also knowe, that there is nothyng in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or erthe better for vs, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the true knowlege of God, and that these excellent gyftes and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites,
<pb n="cxli" facs="tcp:9778:163"/>
cannot be had, but onely in the foresayde churche or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and no where els. But whan the true churche (which is ruled by the holy gost, &amp; the worde of God) dothe promyse vs these so great riches and benefites, we ought not to doute, but that we haue alredye receaued them. And when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che doth happoint and ordeine vs, to be preachers and ministers of these most pretiouse treasures, we must stedfastly beleue, that God effectuously worketh with vs that he is present with vs, and that he at all tymes doth strengthen vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the worlde and the deuyll, and that he doth helpe vs to do all thynges accordyng to our callyng prosperously and with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. Secondly we must beleue the remission of synnes. Therfore next vnto this article, I beleue the
<pb facs="tcp:9778:164"/>
holy catholique churche, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of saintes is added, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenes of synnes. For where so euer the churche of Christ is, there is frely offred that eternall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort aboue all measure, that is to say, the fauore of God, and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of synnes. And without that churche is no remission of synne. Wherefore we must seke remission of synnes in the churche of Christ, and desier absolution. That when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true churche, by their ministers doth promyse vs remissyon of our synnes, and here in erthe dothe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue vs, we may surely trust, that in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also before God we be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued &amp; pardoned. Thirdly, We must beleue the resurrection of the fleshe, wherefore after tharticle of the remission of synne, foloweth next this article. I beleue the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing agayne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleshe, for among
<pb n="cxlii" facs="tcp:9778:164"/>
other ponyshmentes for originall syn, layd vpon Adam, &amp; his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we daily see this horrible paine, that the goodly beawtiful bodye of man, created to immortalitie, must nedes ones be dissolued by deathe, and brought to a filthye and stinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng corse and graue, that the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of synne (whiche so long as we liue rageth in our fleshe) by our deathe may ceasse, &amp; haue an ende, as saint Paule saith vnto the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.<note place="margin">Rom. vi.</note> For by deathe of the body cease all the desires, concupiscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and rages of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mynde whiche be against the wil and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes of God. There ceassith also all synnes against our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as Ire, enuie, lechery, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnes, pride and all ill affecty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and at the last day god shall rayse vs agayne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, so that such infirmities and synnes, shall
<pb facs="tcp:9778:165"/>
no more be founde in vs, but we shal be pure, spiritual, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and lyke to the bright &amp; clere bodye of Christ. And that we may y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more assuredly beleue this, both Christ himself rose from death, and many saintes also w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym. Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely we must beleue euerlastyng lyfe. Wherefore it foloweth in the Crede, I beleue euerlastynge lyfe, that is to saye. I beleue, that wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we shall ryse from death, then we shall lyue euer with Christe in parfite holynes and iustice, and in suche a gloriouse ioy as no toung can tell, nor hart thincke. And this treatise of the Crede, we must end with this wourde. Amen. which is asmuche to saye, as I beleue that al the articles of our beliefe before rehersed, be very true, and thereof I haue a sure faithe trust and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. Therefore good children,
<pb n="cxliii" facs="tcp:9778:165"/>
from the bottome of your hartes, you must beleue in the holy gost, whiche doth promyse vnto vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of our synnes, by al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true preachers &amp; ministers of goddes worde. And he dothe also geue light to our hartes and myndes, and moueth vs to beleue goddes worde, and to put our faith and trust in hym. And the same holy goost dothe dayly purifye &amp; sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifye vs, purge and clense vs from sinne and after this bodily death, shall rayse vs agayne to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life. And take this for a sure conclusion, and doubt nothynge thereof, that the holy goost, as he hath begonne these thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges in vs, so he will fynyshe thesame in vs, yf we obey him, and continue in faith, vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of our liues. For he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende, shal be saued. And this is the summe, and
<pb facs="tcp:9778:166"/>
also the most plaine vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of this thirde parte of the Crede entreatyng of our sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or halowing. Wherefore good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, marke well this lesson, that when ye be demaunded howe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande you the thirde parte of the Crede, yee may answer thus I beleue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s strength power or wysedome, neyther by myne awne endeuour, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe of myn awne reason, I am able to beleue in Iesus Christ, or to come vnto hym. But the holy goost did call me by the worde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospell, and with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> giftes of his grace, he hath hitherto endowed me, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me, and in the true faith, he hathe hitherto preserued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed me, &amp; this he hath not done only to me, but also he calleth and gathereth togyther in the vnitye of one faith and one baptisme, all
<pb n="cxliiii" facs="tcp:9778:166"/>
the vniuersal churche, that is here in earth, and he halloweth, kepeth and preserueth thesame, in the true knowledge of Christ, and faith in his promyses. And in this churche he geueth free and general pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to me and to al that beleue in him, of al our synnes, offences, and tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, and at the last day he shall rayse me, and all other y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be deade, and al that dyed in the true faithe of Iesus Christ, he shall glorifye, in the lyfe euerlastyng. Therefore to the sayde holy gost that sancte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyeth vs, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father that made and created vs, and the sonne that redemed vs, be geuen all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glorye world without ende.

For faith is the gyfte of God, and all good thinges commeth from the father of lightes.<note place="margin">Iacob. i<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> Therefore we must nedes aske and craue these benefites at his hande whiche on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the gyuer of theim. For so Christ saieth, that God the father
<pb n="cxlv" facs="tcp:9778:167"/>
wyll gyue to vs his children all thinges, so that we sue to hym for theim.<note place="margin">Psalm. i.</note> And the prophet Dauyd saieth. Cal vpon me in the daye of thy trouble, and I shal deliuer the, and thou shalt glorifye me. Also our Sauioure Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vs to do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, sayng.<note place="margin">Mat. vii. Iere. xxix. Mar. vii. Luke. xi. Ioh. xvi.</note> Aske and you shal haue, seke and you shall fynde, knocke and the dore shall be opened vnto you. Now therfore, seyng that we haue learned what we shoulde beleue and do, it is most necessary for vs, to cal for gods grace with most ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and ernest prayers, that we may be able to performe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thinge whiche we are bounde to do. For our sauiour Christ hath promised vs, that what soeuer we aske the father in his name, he wyll gyue it vs. Also he saieth,<note place="margin">Ioh. xiii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> that what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we aske, yf we beleue, we shal
<pb facs="tcp:9778:168"/>
receaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. Wher is to be no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted, that yf we wyll obteyne oure requestes, we must aske in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of Christ, and also trust assuredly, that for Christes sake our praiers shal be heard. To aske in Christes name is to aske accordynge to his wil, that is to say, to aske y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he hath commaunded.</p>
               <p>Therefore when we praye we may saye thus. O God our father and the father of our Lorde Iesu Christ, which art in heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I durst not of myne awn head be so bold, to come vnto thy most highe and excellent maiestye to desyer any thyng of the, but thy welbeloued sonne our Lord Iesus Christ hath commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded me so to do, and only in his name and at his commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente am so bolde. Therfore yf thou hear me, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> hearest thy dearly beloued sonne oure Lorde Iesus
<pb n="cxlvi" facs="tcp:9778:168"/>
Christ. And yf thou heare me not, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou hearest not Iesus Christ him selfe, who hath sent me to the, and hath commaunded me to aske in his name. Of this prayer made in fayth, speaketh saincte Iohn in his epistle saying. This trust we haue in God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when we aske any thynge accordinge to his will, he doth heare vs.</p>
               <p>Therefore we shoulde stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleue that God doth heare our prayer. For he that beleueth not, he shall obtayne nothynge. And therefore Christe saith. If you beleue, you shall obtayne. And to thentent,<note place="margin">Mark. xi.</note> that we should beleue &amp; surely thynke, that we be herde, he hath promysed to graunt what soeuer we aske in his name. And agayne to thentent that we shuld knowe and be suer, that we praye accordyng to his wil, he hymselfe
<pb facs="tcp:9778:169"/>
hath taught vs, howe &amp; what we should praye and aske. Therfore it is not in our lybertye, whether we wil praie or not, but by goddes commaundement, we be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to praye, as you haue hearde in the seconde commaundement. Now therefore with all dilygence lerne good children, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy prayer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greate doctour and our Lorde Iesus Christ taught vs hymselfe, saying to his disciples.

               <p>Wherfore good children bothe daily and hourely accustome your selfes, euen from your tender age, to praye to your heauenly father, for all thinges necessarie.

Fyrst he
<pb facs="tcp:9778:173"/>
sendeth vnto vs godly and fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ministers by whom we be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised and before we do anye good woorke, he offereth vnto vs hys grace, he se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vnto vs preachers and messengers of peace, whiche declare vnto vs the glad tidinges of the gospell, and the promises of the fauoure of God, towardes all them that truely repente theym of theyr euyll lyuynge, and do moue theym to put theyr trust in Gods mercye for pardon of the same.

Nowe forasmuche as God hathe thus called vs to the fayth, and by fayth hath gyuen vs lyght in our heartes, that we maye forsake all straunge Gods, and beleue onely
<pb n="cli" facs="tcp:9778:173"/>
in him, now it is our parte, to lead our lyfe in godlynes, to desier god with hertye and feruente prayers, that it maye please hym to make perfecte, that thyng which he hath begonne in vs, to healpe &amp; streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vs, that by his grace we may be able to do those thinges, whiche he hath commaunded vs, and that he wyll augment and increase our fayth in vs. For the prayer of the vnfaythful, is nothinge worth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and without faithe it is vnpossible to please God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God must beginne, and cal vs by his worde, and put faith in our heartes, or elles we shoulde neuer aske nothing of him. And for this cause we be not taught in the lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des prayer to saye to God. Father graunt me to beleue, that thou art my father, but we be taught to say thus. Oure father whiche arte in
<pb facs="tcp:9778:174"/>
heauen, halowed be thy name. That is to saye, o Lorde God our heauenly father, before I beganne to praye, and before I knewe thy name, thou through thin exceding greate mercye didst sende vnto me thi preachers, by whom thou didst declare vnto me, that thou art my father for Iesus Christes sake, and thou didst open my heart that I might beleue that thou arte my father. Therfore graunt I besech the my heauenlye father, that thy name maye be halowed. And he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> taketh not God to be his father, yet he maye lerne that it is so by this prayer. For Christ our Lorde knewe most certenly the wil of his heuenly father, that is to say, that he would be oure moste swete and louynge father (for els he woulde not haue taught vs this title, our father) and therfore must we again

vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our parties haue suche a loue and obedience to hym, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto their father, &amp; conceyue a most assured trust in God (who is all our fathers) that we shall lacke nothyng necessarye for vs, and that nothyng shalbe able to hurt, as long as we haue so mighty and so louyng a father. We see by dayly experience, howe intierlye the fathers loueth their children, what care they take to bryng theim vp in vertue and ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng and to get theim good may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and gouernours, howe they labore to prouide for their liuing, and al thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges necessary for theim.

theim, and wolde rather forgyue theim, yf it wer not for their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and amendment. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the childe falleth on his knees, and asketh forgyuenes, promysynge amendement, we see how redy and willynge the father is to forgiue. Now seyng our earthly fathers, be so louynge to their children, muche more God our heauenlye father wil be our most kynde and louyng father, wil nourysh kepe and defende vs, teache &amp; instructe vs, the way to euerlastyng salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And yf we fall into anye er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore or synne, yet for Christes sake he is wyllynge to forgyue vs, and althoughe he punysheth vs here for a tyme, yet he doethe it of fatherlye loue that he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth towardes vs not to punyshe vs for euer, but to amend vs and to make vs to know our faultes,

and to bryng vs agayne into the right waye. And lyke a most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng father he correcteth vs for a smal tyme in this worlde, lest he shoulde punyshe vs for euer in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde to come. Of this therefore so louyng and so mightie a father we may wel reioyce, and haue an excedynge great comforte, farre passyng any harte to thynke, or tongue to tel. And hym agayn we ought moste entierlye to loue and obey, seyng that he is our father, and hath loden vs with so many gyftes and benefites. With glad hartes therfore you ought to saye this prayer, which wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you say, you speake with God the father in heauen, &amp; he heareth you, and lyke a most kynde father, dothe graunt al that you aske.</p>

be halowed, that is to say, may be honored as holy. This prayer pleaseth God, and he heareth it, &amp; God giueth vs grace &amp; strength, that we maye halowe his name.</p>
               <p>To halowe the name of God, is not to make it holye (whiche in it selfe is euer most holy) but to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe his name is to take it for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; reuerentlye to vse it, as a most holy thing, of great feare and loue to God, to beware that we speake not of his name vaynely, nor with out great reuerence to confesse his name, to laud him, extolle him, &amp; in all necessities to call vpon hym. And on the other syde, we do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the holye name of God, whan we abuse the same to euyll and naughty thinges, whan we speake euyll of God or godlye thynges, whan we teache any false doctrine of God and his religion, or abuse
<pb facs="tcp:9778:179"/>
the name of God to ydoltarie and errours, or whan by the name of God we be forsworne.</p>
               <p>Also whan by the name of God we curse me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or other creatures, or whan we speake of God &amp; godlye thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges &amp; make therof but scoffing &amp; gestyng.

               <p>But nowe it is an horryble hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the churche of Christ and chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten men, we be taughte that God is oure Lorde and father, and yet we be so faynte, so euyll, naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye and vnkynde people, that we do not halow nor reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tli vse his name. Therfore it is more than
<pb n="clvii" facs="tcp:9778:179"/>
nede to praye, and instantlye to pray for Gods helpe, that we mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use not his name vnreuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, but that we maye halowe it, and most hyghly honour it oure selfes, and prouoke other to do the lyke whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che we shall do, yf we preache and teache the worde of God purelye, and agree vnto the same in pure innocent lyuynge, so that no man can reprehende vs, yf we beleue Gods word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and professe thesame, in all necessities call vpon hys name, and gyue hym thankes for all his benefites,</p>
               <p>But whan false doctrine is taughte, than the name of God is defiled, and false doctrine is hono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, and taken for the holy worde of God, which in dede is not holy, but wicked and the false inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the deuyll, the inuentour of all lyes and falsehode. And howe can
<pb facs="tcp:9778:180"/>
the holy name of god be more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly abused? tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whan the deuyls lyes and false inuentions, be sette out and honoured vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and coloure of Gods holye name, that by that meanes the people maye the sonner be decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the name of God is not halowed, but blasphemed and dispised, whan the true woorde of god is cruelly persecuted, as Cain persecuted his brother Abell. For whan the vngodly hypocrites, do call the gospell and true doctrine of Christe, heresy and errore, than is God as it were accused of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, which gaue the sayde doctrine, whiche is an horrible blasphemie of Gods name.</p>
               <p>Also whan we beleue not the worde of God, than we violate and do iniurie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of God,
<pb n="clviii" facs="tcp:9778:180"/>
not takynge hym to be true.</p>
               <p>The name of God is halowed also, but lytle regarded and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, whan the gospel &amp; worde of God, is not boldely professed before the worlde. For he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gospel, and doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vnto it, but for feare of men doth shrynke from it, and reuoketh those thinges, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath truly &amp; godly taught he counteth not Iesus Christ the sonne of the lyuing God, nor hys holy worde and gospell, to be of that value and estimation, that he wil for their sakes, speake bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely, or suffer any thynge, before the kynges and powers of the worlde.</p>
               <p>Also we do not halowe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of God, whan we cal God our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and bost our selfes to be his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and yet that thing whiche
<pb facs="tcp:9778:181"/>
we professe, we do not parforme by holy and godly liuing. For an vnthristy &amp; wicked child, is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to his father. Herof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth God by the Prophet Ezechiel the .xxvi. Chapter, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. By you my name is blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med amonge people &amp; nations.</p>
               <p>And he also regardeth not the holy name of God, that doth not cal vpon God, and gyue than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to god, as though he wer not the very true God, which hath hol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pen hym, and both can and wyll helpe him in all his nedes. For he that knowlegeth himselfe, that he is holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, he of dewty must nedes gyue hym thankes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> trusteth to be holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, must lykewyse cal vpon hym for the same.</p>
               <p>Therefore briefly to conclude, he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> teacheth any other tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb n="clix" facs="tcp:9778:181"/>

Therefore we ought to praye, that God kepe and defende vs from this synne.</p>
               <p>This is the meanynge &amp; plaine vnderstandynge of this petition. The name of God is of it selfe holy, but in this petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we desier, that we may also halow it, which we do, whan the worde of God is purely &amp; si<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerely taught, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we walke and lyue accordynge to the

               <p>Lerne these thinges dilygentlye good children, and whan you be asked, how vnderstande you this first petition? you shall aunswer. The name of God of it selfe is holy, but here we do aske, that it may be halowed of vs. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you be asked, how is it halowed of vs? Answere, whan the worde of God is puerly and syncerelye taught, whan we leade our lyfe in this worlde holyly and godly, as it becommeth the veray true chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. Here in this point succour vs good Lorde, helpe vs O heauenly father. For he that

You knowe that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours &amp; kinges in this worlde, haue their realmes &amp; kyngdomes, and those people that be within their landes and dominions, and dewly obey their lawes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, those be their true and faithfull subiectes of their realmes.

               <p>God causeth his ghospel to be preached vnto vs, howe Christe for our sakes suffered death, was buried and rose againe, as before you herd in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Crede.

               <p>Thys good children is the sayd kyngdome of God, whan by the gospell and the holy ghoste, God raygneth in oure hartes, whan he worketh in vs our Iustification, that we hauynge peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may haue ioye and comforte in the holy gost, of the abundance and plentifulnes of grace and the benefytes of Christe.

Thy kingdome come, he prayeth, nothynge elles, but that God wil gyue vs grace, that we maye rest from our own propre willes, that we do not those thynges that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte the body, and please oure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, but that we maye suffre God, by his holy worde &amp; spirite, to worke in vs holy workes, that so the thirde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement maye be fulfilled.

               <p>Nowe the kyngdome of God commeth vnto vs two maner of wayes, first by his worde &amp; faithe, whan the gospell is preached vnto vs, that our Lorde Iesus Christ, delyuered vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> synne, death and hel, by crosse, death &amp; resurrection. For by the preaching of his word we do lerne to put oure truste in God and to loue God. And this knowlege and faith in Christe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth from tyme to tyme, not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly in theim that haue but newlye begonne to beleue, but they also whiche many yeares haue profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Christe, do profyt in the same
<pb facs="tcp:9778:189"/>
faith more and more. For their faith and loue towardes God, by the dayly preachyng of the gospel is confirmed &amp; made more strong. Secondly, the kyngdome of God shall come to vs at the laste daye whan the euerlastynge glorye and kyngdome of God shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled, whan at the laste daye we shalbe raysed from death to lyfe, and be receyued into the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, where we shalbe made perfytely iuste, holy and safe for euer, whiche thynge so long as we be here in this worlde, is hyde from vs, and appereth not clerlye vnto vs, but at that last daye shal appere to all men, that excedynge ioye, which no tonge is able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse. As saith saint Iohn in hys Canonical epistle.<note place="margin">i. Iohn. iii</note> Yet it appereth not, what we shalbe, but we know that whan it shall appere, we shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be

lyke vnto hym, and we shall see hym, euen as he is.</p>
               <p>All these thynges oure Lorde God causeth to be preached in the hole worlde, of his mere goodnes and most abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mercie, not for our workes or merites, but before we desiered him. But although it be preached through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, yet it should not auayle vs, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued not, that is to say, if he came not into oure hartes, yf the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God wer not within vs. Therefore must we with all dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence praye, that God not onely may make this to be preched, but also y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil gyue faith, not onely to other, but also to our selfes.</p>
               <p>And shortly, this is the summe of this petition, that God by his syncere preachers, wil sende his worde and gospel of Christ, and by his holy spirite brynge vs to

And to the intent, that you maye the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande this petition, you shall knowe, that there be two maner of kingdomes. The first is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God or of heauen, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we spake in the second petition. The other is an earthly or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="clxix" facs="tcp:9778:191"/>
kyngdome, of the whiche you shall nowe heare. Nowe our Lord God, is the chiefe ruler and gouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noure, in bothe these kyngdomes. In the kyngdome of heauen he doth so raygne, that he begynneth in vs here in this world, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of euerlastyng lyfe and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. And the worldlye kinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes he doeth so gouerne, that here he gyueth vs peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes that we may heare and learne the kyngdome of God, and so at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne the kyngdom of heuen. And God hath ordeined in this erthlye kyngdome, commen officers and rulers vnder him, whiche he hath appoynted for thys purpose, that they shoulde in his name gouerne the commen people, and laboure with all dyligence that peace and quietnes maye be maynteyned in the same. And he hath gyuen them
<pb facs="tcp:9778:192"/>
the authoritie of the sworde, that they shoulde not onely therewyth defende the godlye, but also pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe malefactours, and breakers of the commen peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as traytours, rebellions, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quellers, adulterers, theues, and false wytnesse bearers, and all wronge doers to other men, accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dynge to the sayinge of sayncte Paule in the .xiii. chapiter to the Romayns. Let euery soule (saieth he) submit himself vnto the higher powers. For there is no power, but that commeth of God. And the powers that be, are ordeyned of God. Whosoeuer therfore resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth the superiour powers, resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth the ordinaunce of God. And they that resist, do purchase to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues damnation. For the rulers are not fearefull to theym that do good, but to theym that do euell.
<pb n="clxx" facs="tcp:9778:192"/>
wylte thou be withoute feare of the powers? do well then, and so shalte thou be praised of the same. For he is the minister of God for thy wealth. But yf thou do euell, then feare, for he beareth not the sworde in vayne. For he is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of God, to punishe him that doeth euell. Wherefore you muste nedes obey, not onely for feare of punyshement, but also for veraye conscience. By these wordes you may well perceyue good children, that it is Gods will and pleasure, that we shoulde leade here in this worlde an honest and quyet lyfe, and that they whiche be sedyty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and full of trouble and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes in the commen wealthe, shoulde be punyshed. And vpon these considerations he hath gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs these commaundementes. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy father and mother. Thou
<pb facs="tcp:9778:193"/>
shalt not kyll. Thou shalt not commytte adulterye. Thou shalte not steale. Thou shalte beare no false witnesse against thy neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure. Thou shalt not desier anye thynge that is thy neyghbours. And God hath commaunded the gouerners of commen welthes, to punyshe suche as do not obey these commaundementes, and he himselfe wyll punyshe theym also, wherefore lette suche as be disobedient, loke for punyshment, not onely of the gouerners here in the sight of the worlde, but also of God hymselfe. And the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, whiche accordyng to gods commaundement, do correcte and punyshe offenders, they do wour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppe God highly, and do to him a pleasaunt and acceptable sacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And God hathe ordeyned the higher powers, and quietnes to be
<pb n="clxxi" facs="tcp:9778:193"/>
in commen welthes, that thereby we might heare and learne the gos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell more easely and quietly. For where as warre and sedycion is, there is not the place to preach the worde of god with fruyt &amp; profit. For the whiche cause saynt Paul, wrytynge to Tymothye, sayeth on this wyse: I charge you, that pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers and supplications be made for all men, for kinges, and for al that are in authoritie, that we may lyue a quiet and a peaseable lyfe, with all godlynesse and honestye. For this is good and accepted in the syght of God our sauiour, whiche wylleth all men to be saued, and to come to the knowlege of the truth. Nowe therefore forasmuche as we know, by Goddes holy commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, what his wyll is, it is our part to confirme our willes to his wyll, and to desier him, to giue
<pb facs="tcp:9778:194"/>
vs his grace and ayde, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyshe his most holy wyll, saying as Christ hath taught vs. Thy wyll be donne in earthe, as it is in heauen. And because the wyl of God, (wherby he requireth here in earth obedience to lawes and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours) is expressed very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the seuen latter commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes before rehersed, therefore whensoeuer you wyll make thys prayer to God, and saye. Thy wil good Lorde be done in earth, as it is in heauen, you must before, call to your remembraunce, these seuen commaundementes, with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position vnto you hertofore decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For in this shorte request, you comprise asmuche, as yf you shuld praye on this fashion.</p>
               <p>O God oure mooste mercyfull father in heauen, gyue vs thy grace and healpe, that we maye

obey our parentes and commen officers, and honour them with all our hertes, keape vs frome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaughter, from enuye, hatred, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, anger, desyre of reuengynge, and all euell myndes towarde our neyghbours.</p>
               <p>Graunt that we may hartely loue oure neyghbours, and do theim good, both in wordes and deades Graunte vs to lyue purelye and chastely, to auoyde all occations of offence, to prouoke no bodye to vncleane lyuynge, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we maye studye to saue euery mans &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans chastitie and honestye. Graunt, that neyther by thefte, gyle or anye craftye meanes we take brybe or keape awaye anye mans goods from him, but rather that we maye helpe theim to saue and kepe their riches, and yf any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be in pouertie that we maye
<pb facs="tcp:9778:195"/>
be wyllyng to releaue them wyth our almes and charitie. Graunte that we hurte no man wyth false witnes bearing or lying, but that we maye bothe iudge and speake all goodnes of our neyghboure. Kepe vs from all euell lustes and desyres, that we couet not oure neyghbors goodes, nor hauke or hunt after any thinge that is hys. For all these be the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of thy holy &amp; godlye wyll, wherto thou hast commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vs to be obedyente.</p>
               <p>And marke well these wordes I praye you (good children) that we do not onely praye God, that hys wyll maye be donne, but also we desyer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it maye be fulfylled here of men in erth, euen as it is of the angels in heauen. Nowe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heauen fulfyll Gods wyll most perfectlye, bothe with moost
<pb n="clxxiii" facs="tcp:9778:195"/>
feruent loue and moste perfyte o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. And there is not in anye of the heauenly spirites any euell desier, to do any thynge contrarye to gods wyll, but they be whollye inflamed with moste perfecte loue towarde God. Euen so oughte we also to be that dwell here in earth. But the wekenes and euylnes of mans hart is so greate that we be not able to perfourme the same.</p>
               <p>For oftentymes we obey Gods wyll nothyng at all, but gyue our selues wholly to the lustes of our fleshe, oftentimes we do that God requirethe of vs grudgynglye, coldly &amp; as it were halfe agaynste our willes. This is a great feble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or rather an horrible sykenes, lepry, corruption and pestylente contagion of originall synne, by meanes wherof they that be most holy here in earthe, be not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely
<pb facs="tcp:9778:196"/>
iust and rightuous, but euer they want many thinges, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their perfection. We must therefore continually praye God, to gyue vs his grace &amp; helpe, that we may fulfyll his holy wyll, and be made as iust and obediente, as the angels whiche be in heauen. Forthermore (good children) you shall note that when we saye, thy wyll be donne, we do not onelye praye for our selues, but for other also, that bothe we &amp; they maye do the holy wyl of God. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any man goeth about to do anye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly thinge, whiche is agaynste gods wyll, then we praye in this petition that God wyll let his naughty purpose, that gods wyl onely maye be donne. This praier also is against the deuyl and thys most corrupte worlde, that neither the deuels will, neither the wyll of
<pb n="clxxiiii" facs="tcp:9778:196"/>
the wicked worlde maye be done. For when we heare the gospell preached vnto vs, and gyue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyte to it, and frame our lyfes and conuersation after the same, then Satan rageth and is sore greued and vexed, than he calleth all hys wittes vnto him, &amp; setteth all hys studye &amp; craftye, to styrre vp false and braynesyke doctors, to sowe the cockell of heresye and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinions, wher the good sede of gods word was first sowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is busye to rayse vp persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, seditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, insurrections, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyons, warre and blasphemies, whereby ye maye let the worde of God to haue his course, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the kingdome of Christe. And Satan is not alone, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he fygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth against Christ and his kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but he hath on his syde this false and deceyuable worlde, and
<pb facs="tcp:9778:197"/>
also oure owne fleshe, whyche do not cease to intyce and moue vs agaynst gods most holy wil. But when we say in the lordes prayer, thy wyll be donne, then we do not only pray, that both we and other maye kepe gods commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, but we praye also, that the moste naughty wyll of the Deuel and the corrupte worlde maye be broken, and only the wyll of God maye be fulfilled, that in commen welthes maye be peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the gospell frely &amp; fruitefully preached, and that we may lede in this world holy and godly lyues. And forasmuche as Christe oure Lord, hath cammaunded vs thus to praye, and hath promysed, that whatsoeuer we aske the father in his name, he wyl gyue it vnto vs, we ought stedfastly to beleue, and nothyng doubte, but that he wyll
<pb n="clxxv" facs="tcp:9778:197"/>
staye all the craftye imaginations and compassynges, of the worlde and the deuel, and defende vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all persecutions, that we maye kepe and lerne his worde in peace and quietnes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore our dewtie is, sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly to cleue to the gospell, dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to studye and learne the worde of God, and constantly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare to confesse and abyde by the same. For Christ himself saith.<note place="margin">Math. x. Luke. xii.</note> He that confesseth me before men, I wyll also confesse and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege him before my father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. But he that denyeth me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, I wyll denye hym before my father in heauen. Also good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you shal dilygently learne this lesson (whiche I praye you to prynt wel in your memories) that in this peticion we yelde oure sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues wholly to God, to be ordered
<pb facs="tcp:9778:198"/>
after his wyll and pleasure, and willynglye to beare, what soeuer crosse or trouble, he shal lay vpon our sholders. For we praye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hys wil maye be done, than we forsake our awne wyl, and make a whole resignation thereof into Gods ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, that it may not take effecte, whiche of it selfe desier nothynge but helth of body, riches, honors, rest, and quietnes, where as gods wyll is contrarye that oftentymes we shoulde be tryed in oure faithe by aduersyties, and beare oure crosse, as our Lorde and mayster Christ was crowned with thornes and nayled on the crosse for oure sakes.<note place="margin">Rom. viii.</note> This sainct Paule witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, writyng these wordes, whom God hathe chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the worlde, them also hath he ordeyned, to be lyke the image of his sonne. And our sauioure
<pb n="clxxvi" facs="tcp:9778:198"/>
Christe himselfe sayeth. He that taketh not his crosse, &amp; foloweth me is not worthye to be my dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.<note place="margin">Luke. ii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>And this is not a token of gods angre, when he sendeth vs afflye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or aduersitie, but rather a signe of his loue toward vs. For he chasteseth euery childe whome he loueth, as the wyse man Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon witnesseth.<note place="margin">Prou. lii<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

loue towarde you, and that he wil kepe you cleane from synne and corruption of this worlde, and brydle your wyll, that you maye, learne to knowe gods holy wyll, whiche is a wonderful wisdome.</p>
               <p>And therefore sayncte Paule so many tymes repeteth in his epy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, these wordes, that is to say, that you maye knowe the wyll of God. For this knowledge is a most high and heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly wysedome and obedyence, most lyke to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and holines of thangels in heauen. And you be bounde to obey God, in sufferyng his rodde and crosse. For God in our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tysme hath made this couenaunt with vs, that we must dye and be buryed with Christe, &amp; be grafted in his passion and death, if we wil ryse againe and be glorified with him in the kyngdome of heauen,
<pb n="clxxvii" facs="tcp:9778:199"/>
whereunto he is rysen and assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Wherefore good children, marke wel these lessons, that you maye learne pacience in all afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and aduersities, whether you suffre sycknes, pouertie, reproches or persecution for the gospel.

Nowe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the other four peticions, in the whiche we praye God, that he wyll vouche safe to gyue vs all those thinges, whiche be promysed vnto vs in the gospell, and whiche our Crede teacheth vs to loke for. And first in this fourth petition, we sue to God, to graunte vs all
<pb n="clxxix" facs="tcp:9778:201"/>
those thinges, which we be taught to beleue in the first parte of oure Crede concernyng our creation. For when we saye. Gyue vs thys daye oure daylye breade, we praye to God, that as through his great mercye and goodnesse, he dydde create vs, so he wil lykewyse nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryshe and feade vs. Wherefore good children, yf you wyll vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande this peticion, you must call to your remembraunce, those les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which wer taught you in the first article of oure belefe, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng of the creation. For seynge that God hathe made heauen and earth, he is lorde and mayster of al creatures in heauen or erthe, and all be vnder his wil and pleasure. And forasmuche as he made them all for vs he hath appointed them all to serue vs, and to healpe and releue our necessities. Wherefore
<pb facs="tcp:9778:202"/>
let vs not be carefull for meate or drincke or other thinges necessary for oure lyuynge. But lette vs put oure confidence in God oure father, whiche hath made vs, and giuen vs our lifes, and we may be sure, that he wyll also sende vs all thinges necessarie for the preserua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion and maintenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the same. For seyng that he made al creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of nothing, it muste nedes be, that all creatures muste obey hys wil and commaundemente. And in case ther were not in the world, creatures sufficient to nourish vs, yet we shoulde not mistrust hym, for he is able to make newe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to gyue vs all thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie. And to the intent, that no man shoulde truste in hymselfe, thynkynge that by his owne wys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or laboure he is able to get all thynges necessarye to the main<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenaunce
<pb n="clxxx" facs="tcp:9778:202"/>
of his lyfe, Christe hathe taught vs, to aske these thynges of oure heauenlye father, whiche onely is able to preserue and feade vs. Of him therefore oughte we hertely to aske the same, saying. Gyue vs this daye oure daylye breade. For this thinge tendeth to the glorie of god, and syngulerly pleasethe him, whan we aske of hym al thynges necessarie for vs. And for this cause God hath com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded vs to praye contynual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wythout ceasynge.</p>
               <p>And our sauyour Christ hath promysed vs, that he wyl gyue vs all thynges,<note place="margin">Lu. xviii. Iohn. xiii.</note> whiche we shall aske in his name. And it is euident by the wordes of this petition, that we ought oftentymes to praye. For Christ hath not taught vs to aske our sustinaunce for fyfthy or thre score yeare, nor yet for one
<pb facs="tcp:9778:203"/>
yeare, no nor for one moneth or weake, but he hath wylled vs to aske our dayly breade. And he saieth. Be not carefull for to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, for to morow bryngeth care enough of it selfe.</p>
               <p>Now yf we shal not be careful for to morow, but onely require of God sustinance necessarye for the present daye, it is manyfest here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that it is gods wyll, that we shoulde aske agayne of him to morow. For we shal haue asmuch nede of meate and drynke to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, as we haue this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t daye, &amp; yet we praye not for to mrowes fode but for this dayes sustinance onli. Wherefore good children ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome youre selfes frome youre tender age, to pray gladly and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, for that pleaseth God, and he is veray redy, to giue you al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that you nede, so that we giue

him his due honoure, and aske of hym as our dutie is. But specy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they that be godly, muste vse to praye, whan they go to bedde, whan they ryse, whan they go to the churche, or syt doune at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For these times are chiefly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted to prayer, as scripture doth witnesse in many places. And forasmuch as we be not able to get our dayly breade, by oure owne wit, laboure and dylygence, except God giue it vs, let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before all thynges seke his kyngdome and studye to please him, that he may gyue vs al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges necessarye for vs.</p>
               <p>And although many men in this worlde, get their lyuyng and ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by crafte and deceipte, yet let vs absteyne from such vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meanes. For they do rather bryng pouertye to a man, then ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.

And althoughe brybers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torcyoners, vsurers, and craftye deceauers of their neighbours, do prosper for a while in this worlde, yet they seldome establyshe theyr thynges. For it is written, that scasely the thyrde heyre shal enioy goods yll gotten.

And when we desyer God to gyue vs our dayly breade, thynke not (Good children) that our heuenly father wyl gyue vs only a morsell of bread, and nothyng besyde, but vnder the name of breade be all thinges conteyned, whiche be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to the maintenance of our lyfe, as meate, dryncke, apparell, house, landes, cattell, and monye, accordyng to the saying of sainct
<pb n="clxxxii" facs="tcp:9778:204"/>
Paule. God gyueth all thynge to our vse richely and aboundantly. But Christe teacheth vs in this petition, to aske only for our day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breade, for this entent, that we shoulde be content with suche a meane, as oure dayly vse and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie doth require, and that we should not by ouermuche eatyng and drynkynge, wastfully spende those thynges, wher w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple myght be relyued. For sayncte Paul doth commaunde vs to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure and worke, that we maye eate our awne breade, &amp; also gyue to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue nede.

Furthermore in this petition we do not only desier our bodily fode and sustinance, but also all thyng necessarye to the same, wherby we maye vse and inioy suche as God hath sent vs, that is to saye, we praye for seasonable wether and holsomenes of the ayer, for helthe of bodye, for peace and quyetnes

of the commen welthe, for trustye and faithful seruantes, and suche lyke. For except God sende a faire and seasenable wether all the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and corne growyng vpon the earth are lyke to peryshe, and so all our laboure in plowyng, sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng and plantyng shall be besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in vaine.

And yf we haue any thinge lefte vs in the tyme of warre, yet we can not

quyetly haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse of it, for feare, care and trouble of the warres.</p>
               <p>And yf it be a tyme of peace, yet yf thou haue an enemye within the walles of thyne awne house, that is to saye, yf thou haue an vnkynde or vnfaythful wyfe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thryftye children, vntrustye and neglygente seruauntes, then by them, thy lyuynge is wasted and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed. For al these do defraude the of thy dayly breade, and by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occasion of thy greate losse and hynderance. The principal cause of all these aduersities is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. For he is so mortal an enemie to mankynde, that he is desyrous not onli to destroy our souls with false doctrine and erroneous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, but also throughe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestes, infection of the ayer, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse kyndes of sykenesses by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myne, batteyl, by the malyce and

               <p>And this wicked spirite woulde ouerthrowe, in a momente of an houre whole realmes &amp; commen welthes, yf God dyd not let hym. Wherefore we must ernestly pray to God that he wil staye this wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked spirite, and gyue vs our daily bread, that he wil preserue vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all sycknes, that hauynge helthe of our bodyes, we may vse &amp; inioy our substance. And that also he wil sende vs godly and dilygente rulers, to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vs from our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, and to prouide, that nether our goodes be stollen from vs by thefes or robbers, neyther lost or conuayed from vs, thorowe the vntrustynes or falsenes of oure householde seruauntes.

<pb facs="tcp:9778:207"/>
you shall note good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that our Lorde Iesus Christ hath not taught vs to saye, father gyue me my dayly breade, but gyue vs oure dailye breade, and lykewyse in all the petitions that folowe, no man prayeth in the synguler noumber for himselfe alone, but in the plurel noumber aswel for other as for himselfe. By y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whiche lesson we be admonyshed of the brotherly charitie, whiche one of vs shoulde beare towardes an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For we be all offenders, and from our birth the children of yre. Neuertheles God so loued vs, that he gaue his only sonne Iesus Christ to suffer deathe for vs, to obteyne for vs remyssion of oure synnes, to reconcile vs to him, &amp; to make vs his children. Therefore nowe is God our father, &amp; Christe oure brother, and we be goddes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

and heyres, and coinheriters with Christ, and amonge oure sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues we be brethren, and all brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Christ. And therefore we ought to ioyne altogyther in one prayer, and to be glad one to healpe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bothe in worde and dede, to the vttermost of our power. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore this is a great comforte for vs, to know that all the church and congregation of Christ, doeth praye for vs, and that all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surs of Gods riches, that is to say Christ himselfe, the kyngdome of heauen, the holy gospell, the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and the prayers of al god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, be common to vs all. For whan soeuer anye Godly man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth any good thynge of God, he also requireth the same for vs alone, for no man oughte to praye for him selfe. And this is a greate consolation for all Christian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb facs="tcp:9778:208"/>
For the scripture sayeth, that the prayer of one iust man may do muche wyth God. And therfore whan manye iust and godlye men do make their supplications vnto God, with one accorde, we may be sure that their prayers are herde.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:9778:210"/>
whiche we aske in faithe and true belefe. Nowe true faith is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the promyse of god, and it is not buylded, but vpon the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dacion of his word. Wherfore yf we wyll aske any thing in true belefe, we must aske as the worde of God teacheth vs, and we muste take suer holde of Gods promise, declared in the scripture. For it is not faithe, to beleue oure owne phantasies or dreames, of the whiche God hath nothynge spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or taught.

Nowe there is not in the whole scripture anye one promyse, that God wyll helpe me, yf I do any suche acte, but yf we do suche thynges as God hathe commaunded vs, he hathe made vs manye promyses, that he wyll ayde and succour vs, in al our necessities and troubles. By the whiche promyses, he hath declared his fatherly loue towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vs, intendyng therby to stirre and prouoke vs, to runne vnto him in all oure cares and nedes. Wherefore it is our bounden du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, to cal vpon his name in al our necessities, to trust vpon hys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myses, to put him as it were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of them, and ernestly
<pb facs="tcp:9778:211"/>
to desier hym to performe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. But amonge al other promyses, this promyse is speciallye to be remembred where Christ promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth thus. Yf ye will forgyue men their trespaces, my heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also wyll forgyue you, youre trespaces. But yf you wyl not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyue men their trespaces, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyl not my heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father forgiue you.

dyd knyt thys condytion to this promyse, for our great welth and benefyte. For vnder these wour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, ther lyeth hyde great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte, for troubled conscyences, where vnto yf you wil lysten dilygently, ye shal knowe the synguler good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God and his fatherly loue towardes you.

               <p>Wherfore he hath added to his promyse this token, whereby we might be assured that he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyuen vs, that is to saye, when we forgyue our neighbors. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be harde to forgyue our neyghbours, their offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces against vs, yet more harde it is, to beleue that God hath forgyuen vs. Let
<pb facs="tcp:9778:213"/>
vs therfore lay aside al anger and dyspleasure, and accustome our sel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ues gladly to forgyue our neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures, that thereby we maye the soner beleue, that our Lorde God hath forgyuen vs. For God is muche more inclyned and redye to mercye, then we mortal menne be. Moreouer the forgyuyng of oure neyghboure, Christe here in dothe not only stablyshe our faith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our synnes be forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God but also it doth nouryshe peace, concorde &amp; brotherly charitie. For if we shuld not muche forbeare and forgyue one another, but euery man shuld studye howe he mighte be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of his neighboure, for euerye matter, eyther by force or elles by subtiltie, then, we shoulde neuer haue measure nor ende of chiding, scoldynge, layinge in watche one of an other, deceauynge, lawyng,

fightyng and suche lyke. Then fare wel all quietnes, peace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and good ordre.</p>
               <p>And this reuengynge of oure selfes should greatly hurt vs, both in oure bodye, soule, good name, honore and ryches, as experience dayly teacheth vs. For oftentimes we see, that whyle a man goeth to lawe for two or thre crownes, he spendeth twentye or thirthye. And manye men be kylled themselues whyle they go aboute to stryke or wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d other. Wherefore it is much better, one of vs to forgyue an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then to prouoke and increace the anger and malyce one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And although we lose part of our goodes thereby, yet we shall haue this great wynnynge therby, that God wil forgyue vs, euen as we forgyue them that trespasse agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st
<pb facs="tcp:9778:214"/>
vs. And note wel (good children) that Christ doth not teache vs to saye, forgyue vs oure grosse syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but forgyue vs our dettes or trespaces. For it is a greater bene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyte, to haue oure dettes and all offences forgyuen, then to haue oure grosse synnes forgyuen vs.</p>
               <p>For that we proprely cal synne, which we do directly agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st gods commaundement. But that is cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led dette, or offence whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ought to do good &amp; do it not, or do good vnperfitely, although dyrectly we do no hurte to no man. And we Christen men althoughe by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme we be made the chyldren of God, &amp; receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy gost, (which doeth healpe vs to withstande all euil, &amp; to do y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is good) &amp; although we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit no grosse sin, nor breake the law by any outwarde acte, yet we do not perfectely fulfyll gods

commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dementes, nor do al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges whiche we ought to do. And when we do not all thinges which we oughte to do, then euer we be detters &amp; synners in some thyng.</p>
               <p>But God forgyueth vs these dettes for Christes sake, when we praye to him therfore, and forgiue our neighbours for his sake. And this is the cause, why we can not be iustified, or deliuered from syn, death, and hell, by oure own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. For in asmuche as oure good workes be euer vnperfecte, and haue nede of pardon, therefore we must nedes be redemed by the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, death, &amp; resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ, as it hath ben taught you in that part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Crede, which intreateth of our redemption, wherfore in as much as, according to oure Crede, we beleue that God for Christes sake hathe forgyuen vs all oure

Now therfore foloweth the syxt petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the whiche we praye, that God wyll gyue vs all those thinges, whiche we haue learned in the .iii. parte of the Crede, whiche intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of our Sanctification, that is to saye, we desyre, that God will vouchesafe, to sende vs the holye ghost, whiche may assist vs in our continuall batell agaynste synne, the fleshe, the world and the deuel, that in all temptations and skyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes with the same, we may ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And to the intent, that ye maye the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande this petition, ye shall first dilygentlye learne this lesson, that althoughe synne is forgyuen
<pb facs="tcp:9778:217"/>
vs by Christ, yet it is not whollye purged or dryuen oute of vs, but synne yet sticketh fast in our flesh, which doeth tempte and prouoke vs to do against Gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes. For ye haue all redye lerned by the tenne commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, what synne is, and what is very vngodlynes, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent ye may eschew it. Also you haue herd in your Crede, that God doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyue vs our synnes, and doeth no more condempne vs for the same, when we beleue in the son of God our sauiour Iesus Christe. But yet neuertheles, we feale the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of synne, which cleueth to vs lyke glewe. And that this is true euery one of you doth feale in your selues by dayly experience. For when you grudge to do that thing, whiche your parentes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth you to do, then synne
<pb n="cxcv" facs="tcp:9778:217"/>
tempteth you, and prouoketh you to stoubbernes and disobedience towarde your father and mother. But yelde not you to this tempta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cion, but obey your father and mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, as God hathe commaunded you. Lykewise when you see other children haue any gay thing, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che pleaseth you so well, that you woulde fayne haue the same, then synne tempteth and moueth you eyther by force, or by stelthe, or els by some craftie meanes to picke it from them, and so to deceyue your neyghbour. But it is your parte, to withstand this temptation, and to kepe Gods commaundement, whiche sayeth. Thou shalte not steale. And after this sorte we be tempted in the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of God also, and tried whether we wyll be obedyent vnto them or no. But we muste striue agaynste

te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation, &amp; manfully withstande the same, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do nothing against gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. Now when we wyll resyst temptation, and not obey the same, but kepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes of God, then we must haue the help and assistance of the holy Ghost. For without the holy Ghost no man can be rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouse and good. And for this cause also he is called the holy ghost, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he maketh men rightuous, pure and holy. And god doth giue the holy ghoste, to al them, whiche do beleue with all their hearte in Iesus Christ our Lorde. For by this toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sainct Paul teacheth vs to knowe that we haue the holye ghost. No man (saith sainct Paul) can call Iesus Lorde,<note place="margin">i. Cor. xii.</note> but by the holy gost. And saynt Iohn in his epistel canonicall wryteth thus. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we do truely confesse Iesus
<pb n="cxcvi" facs="tcp:9778:218"/>
Christ to be our Lorde than we be borne of God, and haue his holye spirite.</p>
               <p>Wherefore good children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue with all your hartes, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christe the true sonne of God, dyed and rose againe for you, that he hath purchased forgyuenes of synnes and euerlastynge lyfe for you, and that he is so your Lorde, that you shalbe sure to dwel with hym in euerlastyng lyfe. Forther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ye shall beleue, that Christ doth gyue you the holy gost, who doth sanctifye you, helpe &amp; assiste you, that ye be not led into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but that ye may obey God, as you haue heard in the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes. And as longe as we lyue here vpon earthe, we must not loke to be voide of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p>For all our lyfe in this worlde, is
<pb facs="tcp:9778:219"/>
subiecte to dyuerse temptations. Some tyme the fleshe tempteth vs, some tyme the false &amp; deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful worlde, some tyme the deuel tempteth vs, who hath euer had a most feruent desire to do vs hurt. And all the temptations of these oure enemyes, do leuell at this prycke, to bryng vs, to do against gods cammaundementes. But it is oure partes, manfully to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande suche temptations, that we assent not to any euel. And yet we are not able to withstande these our enemyes, onles God helpe vs by the holy gost. Wherfore, when soeuer we be tempted, to do anye thing againste gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, there is no better reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, then to cal for gods helpe, and to say as Christ taught vs. Good Lorde suffer vs not to be leade in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temptation. For when we do

so, God heareth our prayers, he sendeth the holy gost, and helpeth vs, that we be not led into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion.</p>
               <p>And now good children, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you maye the better withstande suche temptations, you shal here learne, that there be thre kyndes of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The first is the temptation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleshe, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are tempted to do any thing, whiche is plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the fleshe, and yet it is synfull. As when the fleshe dothe prouoke vs to lecherye, adulterye, dronke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and suche like. Or when we be tempted to leaue any thinge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, which is painful &amp; greuous to the fleshe, and yet of it selfe it is holy and rightuous, as when we suffer afflictions against our wyl, when we do not gladly fast, when we do not gladly gyue almes, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng lest we shall lacke our awne
<pb facs="tcp:9778:220"/>
selues, and not haue ynoughe to maintayne our pryde and pleasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. The seconde temptation is of the worlde, as when thorowe euel companye, we be corrupted in our awne lyuynge, and prouoked to folow noughty examples. Also when we swarue from that which is right &amp; honest, for feare of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, dyspleasure, indignation or threatnynge of men. Or when men thorowe their falsehede, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or craft do moue vs to anger, enuy or hatred. The thirde temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is of the deuel, as when we feale in our hartes, sodein and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement motions to do euel, &amp; yet neyther the fleshe nor the worlde doth prouoke vs to the same. But euel thoughtes do so sodenly come into our myndes, that we our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues do not wel knowe from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they came. Such euyl thoughtes,
<pb n="cxcviii" facs="tcp:9778:220"/>
no doute of it, come from the de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uel, For the deuel is a spirit, whom we can neither feal nor see, Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he can set our hartes afyer so sodenly, that we shall not knowe from whence suche soden fire and sparkes do come. Also when the fleshe and the world do tempte vs, then Satan also taketh occasion thereby to enter in at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate, which they haue set open for hym, and maketh their temptation so stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, that it is harde for vs to withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and ouercome the same. And all these temptations good children be against gods commundemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Wherefore hereby you shall learne to knowe what is tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For whan any thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in to youre mynde, by the whithe you are prouoked to do against gods commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Wherefore beware you do
<pb facs="tcp:9778:221"/>
not thesame, but desyer of God helpe and assistence against temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For in this sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and holy lyfe, that as oure synnes be forgyuen vs by Christ, so we ought euer to withstande synne, that we suffer it not to enter in to vs, or to raigne ouer vs. For what a monstrous thynge should Christen relygion be? yf we that be Christen menne, (whiche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse synne to be nought &amp; against God, and desier God to forgyue vs our synne) shoulde contynewe still and walke in synne, after that God most mercyefully hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyuen vs the same.</p>
               <p>Also we maye easely withstande temptation and sinne, if we beleue truly, and praye ernestly. For we haue lerned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of faith, that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be rightuous pure and holy of our selues, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy
<pb n="cxcix" facs="tcp:9778:221"/>
gost doth purify clense and halow vs. And yf we beleaue this sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly, then we ought to pray with a feruent spirite, and saye thus. Lorde our heuenly father, we be seche the suffer vs not to be led into temptation. And yf we thus praye, then God wil heare vs, and wil gyue vs strength against him that tempteth vs, and against his temptacion. For a Christen mans life, is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual warre vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, &amp; so long as we liue in this world, we maye not loke to haue peace or quietnes, but as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sea one wawe commeth after an other, so in this worlde one temptation foloweth an other. So that, when we haue ouercome one temptation, by and by, an other is at hande, paradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture greater then the first. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this sixt petition, we do not praye thus. O heauenly father,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:222"/>
graunt that we may haue no te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, but we say thus. O heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father suffer vs not to be led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation. To be led into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is when God suffereth, the greatnes of temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so to grow, that we be not able to ouercome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, but be so deceaued &amp; blyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuel, that synne is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant vnto vs, and we see nothyng in the same but pleasure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and consyder not the anger of God due for synne, nor the poysen that lyeth hyd in the same, nor the payne that shal folow therof, and so we perswade oure selues, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue no more nede to watche or fyght against synne, but do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to temptation, and yelde oure selues into the handes of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

<pb n="cc" facs="tcp:9778:222"/>
leadde me, or this brou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ght me, in to this myschiefe. And that we be not led into temptation, it is oure part, ernestly to praye to God, as Christ hath taught and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs.</p>
               <p>So ye perceaue good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the myserye of this transitorye &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal lyfe, that it is full of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and snares.

But this we be not able to do, excepte y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy gost do sanctifye vs, &amp; make vs pure and holy.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E haue hearde in the syxte petition, howe we sue to God, that he wyll rule, gouerne and strengthen vs, by his holy ghost, that we maye be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to fyght against synne, to w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande al the perellous tentations of the fleshe, the worlde and the deuyll, and to ouercome theim, so that we maye become ryghtuous and holye. Nowe foloweth the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth laste peticion, in the whiche
<pb facs="tcp:9778:224"/>
we desire God, to delyuer vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this perelous &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual battail, &amp; from all other euelles, that thys great dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gier may not continew for euer, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth we mai ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue some ende therof. And for this Christ taught vs to pray, &amp; to say Good Lorde delyuer vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euel.</p>
               <p>And now to the intent, that you may the better vnderstande thys petition, you shall knowe (good children) that this word, euel, doth not sygnifie in thys place, onely synne, against Goddes commaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dementes, and vnbelefe agaynst Goddes promyse, but here it beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth all kinde of aduersitie and affliction, whiche we suffer for our synnes, eyther in oure bodies, sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, honors or riches, as ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, blyndnes of mynd, sadnes, sorow, trouble of conscience, fayntnes of the heart, sickenes of the body, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie,

sclaunders, dispising, repro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches, persecutions, battayle, sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hunger, pestilence, &amp; al plages, with the which Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth afflict and trouble vs, either by hymself, or by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked world, wherof he is prince and gouernoure. The whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che euyls no man can numbre nor reherse, for they be without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre, and encrease daylye more and more. For the deuyll in this lattre tyme doeth dayly more and more rage against the true churche and people of God, forasmuche as he perceyuethe,<note place="margin">Apoca. xii.</note> that hys kyngdome draweth to an ende, and a shorte tyme remayneth vntyll the day of iudgemente come, and his euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stynge damnation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore the worlde wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth dayly worse and worse, and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> waxeth more wylde and vnrulye, synne, wickednes, malice and craf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tines
<pb facs="tcp:9778:225"/>
encrease aboue all measure, so muche that it is not possible to numbre the great floodes of euels whiche haue almoste ouerflowed the worlde. Amonge the whiche e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, there is suche blyndnesse and corruption of iudgement, that few therebe, whiche can rightly deserue what is good and what is euell. As for example. Many men when they be sycke, iudge bodily sicknes to be a great euell, wheras in dede (yf they woulde take it as they ought to do) it is to theim an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of greate goodnes. Who perchaunce (yf they shoulde haue contynuall health) woulde forget God, and runne hedlonge into daungerous perels, both of bodye and soule, from the whiche euyls, their bodyly diseases do staye and let theym. And so their bodyly syc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenes, wourkethe in theym their
<pb n="cciii" facs="tcp:9778:225"/>
soule health and saluation.</p>
               <p>Also many menne sette al their mynde vpon riches, and welth of this worlde, whiche maketh them proude and hyghe mynded, full of reuengynge, idle and slouthful, piteles to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore, and stubburne both toward god and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure, to put their truste in theym selues, and to folowe bodyly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, in ryotyng, surfetynge and bancketynge, whereof ensueth dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse diseases and sicknesses, wher as if they hadde ben poore menne, they woulde haue labored for their lyuynge, and shoulde haue lyued muche more temperatlye, healthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, quietly and Godly.</p>
               <p>And manye there be whiche veraye vnpacyentelye take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie, and murmure againste God, whan their worldly diuises come not to passe after their myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:226"/>
and manye tymes they know not what dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger they shuld haue come vnto, yf God had not letted theyr purpose, so that we knowe full lytle, what is for vs, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste vs, what is good or yll, but as we be taughte by the word of God. And therefore we do not desyre God, to delyuer vs frome thys or that particuler or specyall euell, but we be taughte to praye to God, with these shorte wordes, and syghynges of the spirite, that God wyll vouchesafe to healpe vs, not as we shall thynke good, (whiche do not well knowe, what is good, nor what is yll for vs) but as it shall please him, and as he shall iudge profytable for vs, not prescribyng or appoyntynge vnto hym eyther tyme, place or maner of helpynge or delyueryng of vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="cciiii" facs="tcp:9778:226"/>For as sayncte Paule sayeth,<note place="margin">Rom. viii</note> we knowe not what to praye for as we ought to do, but the spirite himselfe maketh intercession for vs wyth syghynges, whiche can not be declared. Neuertheles let not thys sayinge of saynct Paule dyscorage vs frome prayinge. For God is not so ignoraunt, that he nedeth, that we should expresse oure particuler requestes vnto hym. For he knoweth what we wante, before we open our mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes to praye to hym. Wherefore Christe in the gospel teacheth vs thys lesson, whan ye praye (saieth Christe) bable not muche, as the Heythen do. For they thinke, that they shall be hearde, for their muche bablynge. But be not you lyke vnto them.</p>
               <p>For your heauenly father, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth what you lacke before you
<pb facs="tcp:9778:227"/>
aske of hym. Now forasmuche as the euelles of this myserable lyfe, be so many, that we can neyther noumbre them, knowe theim, nor rightly iudge of them, (as I haue hertofore declared) therfor our ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ster christ (which forbyddeth vs to vse many wordes in our prayers) hath as it were knyt vp together in one ferdel al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plages &amp; aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> happen vnto vs in this worlde, and hath taught vs to say this short prayer. Good Lord delyuer vs from euel. As though he shoulde saye thus. Be not dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coraged from praying, although you perfectely knowe not all the kyndes of euels, from the whiche you desyer to be delyuered, but only saye these fewe wordes, dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs from euel, and by and by your heuenly father knoweth, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what thynge he ought to delyuer
<pb n="ccv" facs="tcp:9778:227"/>
you, and wyl gladly do it.</p>
               <p>Now (good children) you see howe good and merciful is God our heauenly father, who so much loueth vs, and hath so fatherlye a care for vs, that he seeth what we lacke, &amp; what euils he should deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs frome, before we begyn to aske. And he requireth not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we should vse many wordes, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that from the depenes of oure hartes we shoulde cal vpon him, and do to him this honour, that is to say, to aske all thynges of him, to take him for our only God, and to truste assuredly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil heare vs. Therfore good children, lerne perfytely thys lesson, that God wylleth and requireth of vs, that we in all necessities and daunger, that may chaunce vnto vs, should cal of hym for helpe, and to putte our trust and confidence in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:228"/>
and in no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sydes him. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet Hiere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye sayeth. Cursed be he, whiche doth put his trust in man, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And althoughe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do oftentimes helpe &amp; succour vs yet it is not men, that do it, but it is God that worketh these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by men, as by his instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, whom he hath chosen for that purpose. But when God wil not helpe vs, then is ther no man, that is able, to delyuer vs. If we haue any wrong done vnto vs, then yf it please God to succoure vs, he doth it by his iudges and comen officers, whome he hath ordeyned for that purpose. But yf he be not mynded to delyuer vs, then al the men in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world can not helpe vs. Lykewyse when we be sycke yf goddes pleasure be not to make vs hole, what can all phisicians &amp;
<pb n="ccvi" facs="tcp:9778:228"/>
medycynes auayle vs? But yf he be willing to make vs hole again he worketh this thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g by phisitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and medicines, whiche he hath or dened for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same vse. Our deuties is therfore, in all our nedes to call vpon God, to aske helpe of hym, to confesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all goodnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>methe from hym, and to make him onely the authour and chyefe gyuer of al the good thinges that we haue, and to thanke him for the same. Neuertheles we muste also gyue due honour to gods instruments and meanes, by whom he worketh his benefites in vs. Forthermore good children marke dylygentlye thys lesson also, that we be not taught to say in this petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, kepe vs from euel, but deliuer vs from euel. And in desirynge God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer vs from euel, we do confesse (as the truthe is in dede) that as
<pb facs="tcp:9778:229"/>
long as we lyue in this myserable worlde, we be wrapped and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to all kyndes of euels, &amp; that we be not able to delyuer oure sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, there from.</p>
               <p>And the wel and heade, out of the which al these euyll do sprynge is original synne, in the whiche we were conceiued and borne in oure mothers wombes, whereby mans reason is so blynded, that of hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe he can not knowe God, nor his worde. And mans will also by this synne is so poysened, that he doth not obey the wyl of God, nor keape his commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements. Now because mans reason is blynded, it is easy for the deuel, to led ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all errores, as Idolatry, heresies, wytchecraftes, inchauntementes, and to all kynde of superstitious and false doctrine. And these offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces God doth punish with diuerse
<pb n="ccvii" facs="tcp:9778:229"/>
and greuous plages, as w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pryde, enuye, contencyon, detraction, slaunderyng, lying, raylyng, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vnquietnes of conscience, feare and pensiuenes of the minde &amp; suche like, which vices, so torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; gnaw our hartes, that they day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wast &amp; consume vs. And hereof ensue dyuerse dyseases sykenesses and infirmities, and at lengthe death it selfe. Also when mans wil is not ruled by gods lawe, but fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth his awne affections &amp; lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, then he runneth hedlonge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all kynde of grosse and horrible synne, as to treason, sedition, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teryes, theft, extorcion, brybery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gylyng and deceyuyng his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to pryde, enuye, anger, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonye, brawlyng, fyghtynge and manslaughter. And because God of his iustice, can not suffer suche heinous synnes vnpunished, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:9778:230"/>
he suffereth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil, some time to infect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aier, some time to sturre vp greate and daungerous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestes and stormes, some tyme he permytteth hym to destroye oure houses, catel, and riches, wyth fyre or water. Agayne, God suffereth hym some tyme to haue suche po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ouer vs, for our sinnes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> some he maketh to runne madde, some he causeth to drowne theimselfes, some to burne themselfes, some to cut their owne throtes, some hang theymselues. For this is Satans chiefe studye, to dryue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to suche feare, trouble &amp; anguishe of mind, that thorow pensiuenes &amp; heuines of harte, he maye brynge theym to desperation. And this is his onely ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and study, to bring as many as he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to euerlasting damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Nowe you haue heard (good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) into how great and horrible
<pb n="ccviii" facs="tcp:9778:230"/>
euelles, we be brought vnto by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal synne, so that euery mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we be in daunger to be drowned with the ragyous floodes thereof. Wherefore surely we haue moste nede, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually to crie to our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, desyryng him to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs from so great perels and euels. For we can not offer vnto God a more acceptable sacrifyce then by callynge vpon his holye name to acknowlege him for oure God, and to gyue him this praise, that he it is, whiche is bothe able and wyllynge to delyuer vs from all oure myseries. Furthermore (good children) you shall yet lerne here another lesson, worthye to be noted and remembred, whiche is this, that in this request we desier not God vtterly to destroye all those euels, that do vexe &amp; trouble vs, &amp; so to put theim cleare awaye,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:231"/>
(whych for a tyme we muste suffre for our sinnes) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they mai remaine no longer in this worlde, but we desyer God to deliuer vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sayde euel, that is to saye, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we haue suffered euel by some space of time in this life, and haue ben proued and tryed by the fyre of aduersite, that then (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it shal seme good to our moste mercyfull father) he wil delyuer vs from the sayd euyls, that we peryshe not in them. For seing that we haue brought our selues into these my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seryes, we muste patientlye suffer them for a tyme, because they by punyshementes due for our sinne, which we most worthely, haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. And althoughe oure hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, doth most mercye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully forgyue vs our offences, yet he dothe not take synne, cleane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, but durynge thys lyfe, we
<pb n="ccix" facs="tcp:9778:231"/>
fyght agaynst synne, vntyl we die, and so be tryed and proued, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we loue him and his commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dementes, better then oure owne wylles and pleasures. Also oure mercyefull father layeth on oure backes diuerse afflictions and ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersities, to pul downe our proud and hyghe stomakes, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our fleshe, that we may be like oure brother Christe, who by the crosse, ouercame synne, deathe, and the deuyll, and so entred into euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastynge glorye.</p>
               <p>So that in this petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we must lerne both wisedome and pacience, wisdome, to beware of synne, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it prouoketh vs, and in no wise to folow the same. Pacience, to suffer willyngly the crosse and suche af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, as God shall sende vnto vs, &amp; to pray god, with feruent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier, that he suffer vs not, to perishe
<pb facs="tcp:9778:232"/>
in the same, but mercifullye to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende vs, vntyll suche tyme, as it shall please hym clearly to delyuer vs, whiche shalbe, when we shal dye, and by Goddes power be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed agayne from death to lyfe, and be delyuered from all maner of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels. Therefore when we say in the Lordes prayer, delyuer vs from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll, we chiefly desyre God, to send vs a good deathe, that then aboue all other tymes we may be delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from all euels.</p>
               <p>For as muche as at that houre we be in the most daunger of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels and temtations. Wherfore it is moste necessarie for vs, euen from our tender age, to praye to oure Lorde, that at that laste houre chiefly he wyll be good and gracious vnto vs, delyueryng vs from all maner of euell. So that death maye be to vs none euyll,
<pb n="ccx" facs="tcp:9778:232"/>
but a clere acquayntau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce frome al euels. And this the lordes prayer, we must euer ende with this word. Amen. Wiche is asmuche to saye as suerly I trust it shalbe so. And it is not ynough to say Amen with our tongue only, but also Amen muste be in oute harte, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and tary there, that is to saye, we ought to beleue suerly and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stantlye that our prayer is hearde, and that oure heauenly father wil graunt vs oure petitions. For so Christ hath promysed, that what soeuer we aske the father in hys name, it shalbe gyuen to vs. And for that intente Christe confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this his promise w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an othe, saying Amen.</p>
               <p>Nowe you haue hearde good children, the true and playne expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the seuenth and last peti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, whiche I praye you to place

in your memories, that when you be demaunded, howe vnderstande you the seuenth petition? you may redely answere.</p>
               <p>Herein we generally desyre our heauenly father, to delyuer vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all euell and perell, bothe of body, soule, lande, catell and riches. And that when we shall ley on oure death bed, he wyll than graunt vs a good houre, that we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte oute of thys vale of miserie in hys fauoure, and from thys tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitorie lyfe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stynge.

Iesus Christe dyd institute bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, wherby we be borne agayne to the kyngdom of God. And you good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall gyue diligence not onely to reherse these wordes, but also to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, what christe ment by the same. That when you be demaunded any questyon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, you maye bothe make a dyrecte answere, and also in tyme to come be able to teache youre children, as you your selues are nowe instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For what greater shame can ther be, then a man to professe him selfe to be a Christen man, because he is baptised, and yet he knoweth not what baptysme is, nor what strength the same hathe, nor what the dyppyng in the water doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token? wher as all oure lyfe tyme we ought to kepe those promises, which there we solemply made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and man, and all oure
<pb facs="tcp:9778:236"/>
profession and lyfe oughte to agre to our baptisme. Wherefore good children, to thentent you may the better know the strength &amp; power of baptisme, you shall first vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande, that our lorde Iesus Christ hath instituted and annexed to the gospel, thre sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts or holy sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, of his couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and lege made with vs. And by these thre, gods ministers do worke with vs in the name and place of God (yea God him selfe worketh with vs) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vs in our faith, &amp; to asserten vs, that we are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyuely membres of Gods trew churche, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen people of God, to whome the gospell is sent, and that all those thinges belong to vs, wherof the promises of the gospel make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The first of these sacramentes is baptisme, by the whiche we be borne again to a new and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="ccxiiii" facs="tcp:9778:236"/>
lyfe, and be receaued into gods churche and congregation, whiche is the foundation and pyller of the trueth. The seconde is absolution or the authoritie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keyes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we be absolued from suche syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as we be fallen into after oure baptisme. The thirde sacrament is the communion or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, by the whiche we be fedde and nourished, and fortified in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of the ghospell and knowlege of Christ, that by this fode we maye growe more and more in newnes of lyfe, so that we maye be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger children, but maye waxe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte men, and ful growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Christ. For I wolde you should wel know this good children, that a Christen ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s knowlege and lyfe, is a more excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thing, than vnlerned peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can iudge. For a christen man hathe the certen worde of God,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:237"/>
where vpon he maye grounde hys conscience, that he is made a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten man, and is one of Christes me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers which he is assured of by baptisme. For he that is baptysed, maye assuredlye saye thus. I am not now in this wauering opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that I only suppose my selfe to be a christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man, but I am in a sure belefe, that I am made a Christen ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For I know for a suerty that I am baptised, &amp; I am sure also, that baptysme was ordeyned of God, and that he whiche baptysed me, did it by gods commission and commaundemente. And the holy goste doth witnes, that he whiche is baptysed, hathe put vpon hym Christ. Wherfore the holy gost in my baptisme assureth me, that I am a Christen man. And this is a true and syncere fayth, whiche is able to stande agaynste the gates
<pb n="ccxv" facs="tcp:9778:237"/>
of hell, for asmuche as it hath for it the euydence of gods worde, and leaneth not to any mans saying or opinion. Furthermore good chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, you shall dylygentlye learne, the cause, wherefore we are bapty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. You haue alredy herde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by baptisme we be borne agayne. The cause of this our seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d birth, is, the synfulnes and filthynes of our first birth. For by our first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie (whan we were borne of our fathers and mothers) all we were borne in synne, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we yssued out of oure mothers wombe we were laden with synne and Gods angre, as it was at large declared vnto you in the exposition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, and speciallye in the last co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. For as Adam did synne, and by sinne was so corrupted both in his body and soule, that by his awne power or
<pb facs="tcp:9778:238"/>
stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth he was not able to do any good thinge, euen so all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren &amp; ofspring of Adam be borne synners, so that they can not be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by themselues or by their awn strength but are inclined and bent to synne at all tymes. And as saynt Paul saieth,<note place="margin">Ephes. ii.</note> by nature they be the children of Gods wrath. That is to saye, God is angrye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs for those synnes, whiche by nature be, as it wer, a kynne to vs, and we be borne with theim into this world. But when we be borne againe by baptisme, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our sinnes he forgyuen vs, and the holy goste is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, which doth make vs al so holy, &amp; doth moue vs to al good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes. Wherefore good children whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man is baptysed, it is as muche to saye, as he dothe there confesse, that he is a synner, and that he is vnder the rule and gouernau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of
<pb n="ccxvi" facs="tcp:9778:238"/>
sinne, so that of himselfe he can not be good or ryghtuous. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commeth to baptisme, and there seketh for helpe and remedy, and desyreth God, first to forgyue him his synnes, &amp; at length to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him clerely from all synne, and perfectely to heale his soule from the sykenes of synne, as the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian doth perfectely heale his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient from bodely diseases. And for his parte he promyseth to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and solemply voweth, that he wyl fyght againste synne with all his strength and power, &amp; that he wyll gladly beare the crosse, and al suche afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as it shal please God to lay vpon him, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so he wil be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to dye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may be perfectly healed and delyuered from synne. For God doth forgiue vs our synnes by faith, but by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyctions and death, he dothe take
<pb facs="tcp:9778:239"/>
theim cleane away, as saint Peter witnesseth,<note place="margin">i. Pet. iiii.</note> sainge. He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> suffereth or is afflycted in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleshe, doth cesse from synne. And sainct Paule sayeth, he that is deade, is iustified or delyuered from synne. These be the promyses, which we make, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are baptised. And of this mind must all they be, whiche shall haue any fruite by baptisme. Wherfore seyng all you that be here are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy baptysed, continewe I praye you in this good mynde and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, knowlege in your hartes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, that you be synners, be sory for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, and praye to God, to heale and delyuer you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> youre sinne. Beware you fal not to sinne againe, haue no delite in sinne, nor synne not wyllyngly. But be god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and holy, and suffer gladly suche afflictions, as God shall lay vpon your backes. And yf you do thus,
<pb n="ccxvii" facs="tcp:9778:239"/>
then your baptisme shal be auaile able vnto you, &amp; God shall worke in you by his holy spirit, and shall fynyshe in you all those thinges which by baptisme he hath begon. Hitherto you haue herde, what we promyse to God, when we are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised, now learne also I pray you, what God worketh in vs by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, &amp; what benefites he gyueth vs in the same. For baptysme is not water alone, and nothinge els besides, but it is the water of god, and hath his strength by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of God, and is a seale of gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse. Wherefore it doth worke in vs, all those thinges, where vnto God hath ordeyned it. For oure Lord Iesus Christ saieth. Go and teache all nations, and baptyse them, in the name of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, and the sonne, and the holy gost. This god commaunded his disciples to
<pb facs="tcp:9778:240"/>
do. Wherfore by the vertue of this commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, which came from heuen, euen from the bosome of god, baptisme doeth wourke in vs, as the wourke of God. For when we be baptised in the name of God, that is as muche to saye, as God him selfe shoulde baptise vs. Wherfore we oughte not to haue an eye only to the water, but to God rather, whiche did ordeine the baptisme of water, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded it to be done in his name. For he is almyghtye, and able to worke in vs by baptisme, forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our synnes, &amp; al those won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effectes and operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for the whiche he hathe ordeyned the same, althoughe mannes reason, is not able to conceyue the same. Therfore consider good chyldren, the greate treasures and benefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, whereof God maketh vs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers,
<pb n="ccxviii" facs="tcp:9778:240"/>
when we are baptised, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che be these. The firste is, that in baptisme our synnes be forgyuen vs, as sainct Peter witnesseth, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge. Let euerye one of you be baptised for the forgiuenes of his synnes. The seconde is, that the holy gost is gyuen vs, the whiche doth sprede abrod the loue of God in oure harte, whereby we maye kepe Goddes commaundementes accordyng to this saying of saynt Peter. Let euerie one of you he baptised in the name of christ,<note place="margin">Actu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. ii.</note> and then you shall receyue the gyft of the holy ghost.</p>
            <p>The thirde is, that by baptisme the whole rightuousnes of Christ is gyuen vnto vs, that we maye clayme the same as our owne. For so saincte Paule teachethe, saying. As many of ye as are bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tised in Christe, haue putte vpon
<pb facs="tcp:9778:241"/>
you Christ. Fourthly by baptisme we die with Christ, and are buried (as it were) in his bloude &amp; death, that we shoulde suffer afflictions and death, as Christ himself hath suffered. And as that man, whiche is baptised, doth promise to God, that he wyll dye with Christ, that he maye be deade to synne and to the old Adam, so on the other part God doth promise againe to him, that he shalbe partaker of christes death and passion.</p>
            <p>And also God maketh al afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whiche he sufferethe to be good and profitable vnto him, as was the passion of Christ and not damnable, as it was to Iudas, and dyuerse other vngodlye par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>By thys which I haue hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to spoken, I trust you vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de good children, wherfore baptisme
<pb n="ccxix" facs="tcp:9778:241"/>
is called the bath of regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and howe in baptisme we be borne agayne and be made new creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in Christe. The whiche doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne you shall the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande, yf you consider in what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition you were, before you were baptised, and in what state you stande in, after your baptisme.</p>
            <p>Firste before we were baptised it is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that we were synners, and he that is a synner, can haue no peace nor quietnes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science before he come to Christ, so muche he feareth Goddes wroth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastyng damnation. But after that oure synnes, in baptisme be forgyuen vs, and we beleue the promyse of God, and so by oure faith be iustified, than our conscy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences be quieted, and we be glad and mery, trustyng assuredly, that God is no more angrye with vs
<pb facs="tcp:9778:242"/>
for our former offences, and that we shal not be damned for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same And thys is a meruelous altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and renewyng of the inward manne the whyche coulde be wrought by the power of no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by God alone. Also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were baptised, we were slaues and boundemen to synne, so that we neyther coulde do that good, which we would haue done, nor could kepe vs from that euil, whiche we would not haue done, as saint Paule complaynethe of himselfe.<note place="margin">Rom. xvii</note> But whan by baptysme the holy gost was gyuen vs, the whiche did spread abrode the loue of god in our hartes, and did also delyuer vs from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boundage and tyrannye of synne, and gaue vs new strength &amp; power, to wrastle against synne, and manfullye to withstande our gostly enemye the
<pb n="ccxx" facs="tcp:9778:242"/>
deuel, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after a certen maner we were able to fulfyl gods commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dementes. And this is a greate chaunge, and renewyng of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde man. And this I wold you shoulde know for a suertye good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; stedfastly beleue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same that no child of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes or Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, whiche is not baptysed, hathe the holy ghoste, neyther that anye suche can vnderstande the worde of God, neyther that anye suche is holy or righteous before God. Wherefore you shall thanke God with all youre harte, whiche hath brought you to baptysme. And when you beleue in the name of Christ, and loue the ghospell, and are glad &amp; dylige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to hear y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this is a suer toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by the gos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pel you haue receaued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy gost</p>
            <p>Furthermore he that is a synner &amp; not baptised, althoughe he had
<pb facs="tcp:9778:243"/>
the holy ghoste to this effecte, to helpe him to fight againste synne, yet oftentymes he is ouer come, and falleth to synne. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe he doth oftentimes ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come sinne, yet this is a great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectenes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he dothe it not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, but that this fight against sinne is tedious and greuous vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Wherefore he is euer in perrel, lest he be ouercome of syn. And in case he doth manfully w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande synne, yet he seeth, that his iustyce and obedience be to weake and vnperfecte, to stande before the iudgement of God, (as in dede no man, not the holyest, is able to stande before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God by his awne rightuousnes). But when in baptisme the rightuouse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Christ is gyuen and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to hym, then he is delyuered from al those perrels. For he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
<pb n="ccxxi" facs="tcp:9778:243"/>
for a suerty, that he hath put vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him Christ, and that his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenes &amp; imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is couered &amp; hydde, with the perfecte ryghtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes and holynes of Christ. Wherfore after baptisme, he doth not trust in his awne rightuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but in Christ only. And he is no more pensyue or doubteful, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syderynge his awne weaknes, but he is ioyful, because, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidereth, that he is made partaker of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes rightuousnes. And this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne is a great alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newyng, of the inwarde man. These newe affections and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual mocions, are in the soulles of suche as are borne again by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, but they be vnknowne to worldly men, and suche as be not led by the spirite of God. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they that beleue, and be baptysed, do continewe in this their faith to
<pb facs="tcp:9778:244"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he ende of their lyues, then God shall rayse them vp from death to lyfe, that they maye be immortall, and lyue euerlastingly with christ And then, when syn and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of death is vtterli abolished and destroied, we shalbe perfectly holy and rightuous, both in body and soule. And for this cause, our sauioure Christ doth cal in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the rysyng againe from death, a regeneration or a seconde beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng. Al these thynges doth bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme worke in vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we beleue in Christe. And therefore Christe sayeth. He that wyll beleue and be baptysed, shall be saued. But he that wyl not beleue, shalbe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Wherefore good children, learne dylygentlye I praye you, the fruyt &amp; operation of baptisme. For it worketh forgyuenes of sin, it delyuereth from death &amp; power
<pb n="ccxxii" facs="tcp:9778:244"/>
of the deuel, it gyueth saluation &amp; euerlastynge lyfe, to all them that beleue. As the wordes of Christes promyse doth euydently witnesse. But peraduenture some wil saye. Howe can water worke so greate thinges? To whome I answere, that it is not the water that dothe these thinges, but the almyghtye worde of God (whiche is knyt and ioyned to the water) &amp; faith, which receyueth gods worde &amp; promyse. For with out the worde of God, water is water, and not baptisme. But when the worde of the liuing God is added and ioyned to the water, then it is the bathe of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and baptisme water, and the lyuely springe of eternall sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and a bathe that wassheth our soules by the holy ghoste, as saynct Paule calleth it, saying.<note place="margin">Actu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. iii.</note> God hath saued vs thorowe hys
mercy 
<pb facs="tcp:9778:245"/>
and made vs partakers of the rightuosnes of hys welbeloued sonne Iesus Christ. Now consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der depely I praie you, how great benefytes these be, that you maye not be vnkynde to him, that hath done so much for you, but stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye beleue these thinges, mortifye synne, patiently suffre al dyseases &amp; aduersities, whiche it shal please god to send you, and than without dowte you shalbe saued. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, learne these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges dilygentlye, and when you be demaunded, what is baptisme. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you shal answer, baptisme is not water alone, but it is water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed and ioyned to the worde of God, and to the couenaunte of Gods promyse. And these be the wordes, wherby our Lorde Iesus Christ did ordeine baptisme, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch be written in the last chapter of
<pb n="ccxxiiii" facs="tcp:9778:245"/>
sainct Mathew. Go and teache all nations, baptisynge theym in the name of the father, and the sonne, and the holy ghost. And when you shalbe asked what auayleth bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme? you shal answer. Baptisme worketh forgyuenes of synne, it delyuereth from the kyngdome of the deuel and from death, &amp; giueth lyfe and euerlastyng saluation, to all them that beleue these wordes of Christ, &amp; promise of god, which are wrytten in the laste chapter of sainct Marke his gospel. He that wil beleue, and be baptised, shalbe saued. But he that will not beleue shalbe damned.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, yf a man aske you, how can water bryng to passe so greate thynges? ye shall aunswer. Uerely the water worketh not these thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but the worde of God, whych is ioyned to the water, and fayth
<pb facs="tcp:9778:246"/>
whiche dothe beleue the worde of God. For without the worde of God, water is water, and not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, but when the worde of the lyuyng God, is ioyned to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then it is baptisme, and water of wonderful holsomnes, and the bath of regeneration, through the holy gohst, as saincte Paule wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.<note place="margin">Actu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. iii.</note> God saued vs by the bath of regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and renewyng of the holy ghost, whom he powred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs plenteously, by Iesus Christ our sauiour, that we beyng made rightuous by his grace, maye be heyres of euerlastyng lyfe.

euerie manne shoulde styll be in doubt, and thinke after this sort.

For what greater shame can ther be, eyther in the sight of God or of man, then to professe thi selfe to be a Christen ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; yet to be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in what place of scripture and by what wordes, Christ commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded faith, and forgyuenes of synnes, to be preached.

<pb facs="tcp:9778:251"/>
he made his prayer to his heuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father for theim, &amp; for all those that shoulde beleue thorow their preaching. As it is declared in the gospel of sainct Iohn.<note place="margin">Iohn. xvii</note> Now it is not to be doubted, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christes praier was heard, of his heauenly father, wherefore it foloweth, that as mani as beleued the preaching of Christes discyples, were as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely saued, as yf they had heard and beleued Christ hymselfe. And after Christes assention, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stelles gaue authoritie to other godly and holye men, to minyster gods worde, and chiefely in those places, wher ther wer Christen me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alredy, whiche lacked preachers, and the Apostles theim selues could not longer abide with them For the Apostles dyd walke abrod into diuerse partes of the worlde, and did studye to plant the gospel

in many places. Wherefore wher they founde godly men, and mete to preache gods worde, they layed their handes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, and gaue them the holy gost, as they theim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues receaued of Christ the same holy gost, to execute this office. And they that were so ordeyned, were in dede, and also were called, the ministers of God as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles theimselues were, as Paule, sayeth vnto Tymothy. And so the ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gods worde (which our Lorde Iesus Christ hymselfe dyd first institute) was deryued from the Apostles vnto other after theim, by imposition of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, and gyuynge the holy ghost, from the Apostles tyme to our dayes. And this was the consecration, ordres &amp; vnction of the Apostles, wherby they, at the begynnynge, made Byshopes and pryestes, and this

<pb n="ccxxxi" facs="tcp:9778:252"/>
Lorde Iesus Christ. And what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they do to you, as when they baptyse you, when they gyue you absolution, and dystribute to you the bodye and bloude of our Lord Iesus Christe, these you shall so esteme, as yf Christe hymselfe in his awne person, dyd speake, and minister vnto you. For Christe hath commaunded his ministers to do this vnto you, and he hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, (althoughe you see him not with your bodily eyes) is present with his ministers, and worketh by the holy ghost in thadministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his sacramentes. And on the other syde, you shall take good hede, &amp; beware of false and priuye preachers, whiche pryuely crepe into cities, and preache in corners, hauyng none authoritie, nor being called to this office. For Christe is not present with such prechers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:9778:253"/>
and therefore dothe not the holy gost worke by their preching, but their worde is withoute fruite or profyt, and they do great hurte in commen welthes. For suche as be not called of God, they no doubte of it do erre, and sow abrode here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sye and naughty doctrine. And yet you shal not thinke good childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that preachers whiche be lawfully called, haue authoritie to do or teache what soeuer shal please the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But our Lord Iesus Christ, hath gyuen them playne instructions, what they ought to teache and do. And yf thei teache or do any other thynge, then is conteyned in their commission, then it is of no force, nor we ought not to regarde it. And for this cause our sauioure Christ dyd breath into hys discy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and gaue them the holy gost. For where the holy gost is, ther he
<pb n="ccxxxii" facs="tcp:9778:253"/>
so worketh, that he causeth vs to do those thynges whiche Christe hath commaunded. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is not done, than the holy ghost is not there. Wherefore all thynges whiche we shall so speake or do, can take none effecte. Now the summe of the commission whiche Christ gaue to his dysciples, was this, that they shoulde preache re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, and forgyuenes of synne, in his name. And he added therto, bothe a promise &amp; a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, saying. He that wil beleue, and be baptised, shalbe saued. But he that wil not beleue, shall be damned. Wherfore all thinges whiche the ministers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche do saye or do to vs, ought to be directed to this ende, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they maye lowse vs, and declare vnto vs, the forgyuenes of our synnes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we truly repent, and beleue in Christ.
<pb facs="tcp:9778:254"/>
But when we do not repent vs of our synne, and forsake the same, or do not beleue the gospel, then they ought to bind or reserue sinne, and to declare vnto vs, that yf we styl continew in sinne, we shal be damp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned for euer. And when the miny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters do thus execute their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, then they obey God, &amp; whose synnes soeuer they forgyue in earth, their synnes be forgyuen in heauen also. And contrarye wyse, whome soeuer they binde in earth, their sinnes be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de also in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But yf the ministers wolde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise to do contrary to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, that is to say, to forgyue synnes to vnrepentaunte synners and vnbeleuers, or to bynde their synnes and denye theim absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that be repentaunte and truste in the mercye of God, then they shoulde not do wel, nor their acte
<pb n="ccxxiii" facs="tcp:9778:254"/>
shoulde be of any force, but they shoulde deceaue themselues, and other also. And than shoulde that be true, that Christ speaketh in the gospell. When the blynde leadeth the blinde, both fall into the diche. But when the ministers do trulye execute their office, you oughte good children, to take great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte, and to confirme your faithe therby, that you maye stedfastlye beleue, and in all temptations an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere your aduersarye the deuell after this maner. God hathe sente to me one of hys ministers, he in the name and place of God, hathe declared to me the forgyuenes of my synnes, and hath baptised me in the assurance of the same.</p>
            <p>Wherfore I doubte not but that my synnes be forgyuen, and that I am made the sonne &amp; heire of God. Thus good children, you
<pb facs="tcp:9778:255"/>
ought generally in all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to fortifie youre fayth, and to comforte your selfes, with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Goddes word, but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially you shall learne this also, that oure Lorde Iesus Christe, dyd entende, by this authoritie of the Kayes, to comforte the troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led consciences of them, that after their baptisme, do fall in to hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offences.</p>
            <p>For it is not so easye a thyng, to rise agayn from synne, as the mad and blynde worlde doeth thynke, but when the deuel and oure faith shall skyrmishe together, then in those straites, and troubles of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, we haue nede of the helpe of some trewe minister of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, whych (as it were in our swo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge) maye lyft vs vp wyth the wourde of God, comforte and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshe vs. As the wyse kyng Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon

doth declare by thys sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Wo to that man, whyche is alone, for when he falleth, he hath no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to lyft hym vp agayn. And oure Lorde Iesus Christe, doeth speake so often tymes in the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the authoritie of the kayes, and hathe added so great promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to the same, that it may wel ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pere by the earnestnes of Christes wourdes, how careful he was for troubled consciences, and how fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly an effection he had to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte thesame.

Whose synnes ye shall forgyue in earthe, their syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes be forgyuen in heauen also.</p>
            <p>And this also is to be reproued, that some men, whiche continue in manyfest and open synne, and go not about to amende their lyfes, yet they wil be counted christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:258"/>
and interpryse to receaue the same sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, that other do, to come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche, to worship God, and to praye with other. Suche muste be warned of their fautes, and yf they refuse to heare and amende, then they ought to be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and put out of the christen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, vntil they repente and amende their lyfes. Lest by suche manifest sinne and euel examples, other men might be prouoked to do the lyke and so at length many might be infected, and the Christe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religyon dispysed and euel spoken of, as thoughe it wer the worst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygyon, forasmuche as Christian men shoulde tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leade a shameful and vngodly lyfe. And so by this meanes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of God, and God himselfe, might be blasphemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the heathen people. And althoughe those canons, ordynan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="ccxxvii" facs="tcp:9778:258"/>
and rites, whiche be agreable to the gospel, (and were ordeyned in tyme past, to punyshe suche ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sgressors and malefactors) are nowe in oure tyme almost vtterly abolyshed and taken awaye, yet for this cause we ought not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise or cast awaye, the authoritye &amp; vse of the kayes. For they which presumptuously do cast away all pokes of ecclesiasticall discipline or chasticement, &amp; do let, that such kynde of correction, whiche is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the gospel, maye not be restored againe, shall haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubte God for their iudge. But let vs praye our Lord Iesus Christ, that as it hath pleased him to restore vnto vs his moste bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed worde, and the true vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of the same, so also he wyll vouchesaue to rendre and sende a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to vs, these and suche lyke
<pb facs="tcp:9778:259"/>
good and holsome ordinances, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to his worde.</p>
            <p>Now when a man after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme hath greuously synned, and doubteth in his conscience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be in the fauour of God or no (as oftentymes yt happeneth) then it is harde for hym to trust to his awn bare imaginations, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on this fashion. I know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue synned, but yet I am in this opinion, that God is not so cruel a reuenger. But that he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyuen me. For suche an opinion without goddes worde, is not a trew faith, nor is able to stande in the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous skirmyshes of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But trewe faith must euer be stayed vpon the certen worde &amp; wourke of God. Now God dothe not speake to vs, with a voyce soundynge out of heauen. But he hath giuen the kayes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="ccxxviii" facs="tcp:9778:259"/>
of heauen, and the authoritie to forgyue synne, to the ministers of the churche. Wherefore let him that is a sinner, go to one of theim let him knowlege and confesse his synne, and praye him, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to gods commaundemente, he wyll gyue him absolution and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort him with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of grace and forgyuenes of his synnes. And when the minister dothe so, then I ought stedfastly to beleue, that my synnes are truly forgyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me in heauen. And suche a faythe, is able to stande stronge, in all skyrmyshes, and assautes of oure mortal enemy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuel, forasmuche as it is buylded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a sure rocke, that is to say, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the certen word and worke of God. For he that is absolued, knoweth for a suertye, that his synnes be forgyuen him by the minister. And he knoweth
<pb facs="tcp:9778:260"/>
assuredlye also, that the minister hath autoritie from God himselfe so to do. And thirdely he knoweth that God hath made this promise to his ministers, &amp; sayed to them. To whom ye forgyue synnes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, to him also they shall be forgyuen in heauen. Wherefore good children, gyue good eare to this doctrine, &amp; when your synnes do make you afrayed and sadde, then seke and desyer absolution &amp; forgyuenes of your synnes of the ministers, whiche haue receaued a commission and commaundement from Christ hymselfe, to forgyue men their synnes, and then youre conferences shal haue peace, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie &amp; quietnes. But he that dothe not obey this counsell, but beyng ether blynd or proude, doth dispyse the same, he shal not fynde forgyuenes of his synnes, neither
<pb n="ccxix" facs="tcp:9778:260"/>
in hys awne good wourkes, nor yet in paineful chastysementes of his bodye, or any other thynge, whereto God hath not promysed remission of sinnes. Wherfore dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pyse not absolution, for it is the commaundemente and ordinance of God, and the holy spirit of God is present, and causeth these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to take effect in vs, &amp; to worke our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this is the meaning and playne vnderstandynge, of these wordes of Christ, which you hearde heretofore rehersed, whiche are writen to thente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we shoulde beleue, that whatsoeuer goddes ministers do to vs by Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement, are as muche auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as yf God hymselfe shoulde do the same. For whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters do excommunicate ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors and vnrepentant persons or do gyue absolution to those,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:261"/>
which be truly repentant for their synnes, and amende their lyues, these actes of the ministers, haue as great power &amp; authoritie, and be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed and ratified in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as thoughe oure Lorde Iesus Christ himselfe had done the same Wherefore good children, learne these thinges dilygentlye. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you be asked how vndresta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de you the wordes before rehersed? ye shall answer. I do beleue, that what soeuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ministers of Christ do to vs by gods commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, either in excommunicatinge open and vnrepentante synners, or in absoluyng repentant persons, all these their actes, be of as greate authoritie, and as suerly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed in heauen, as yf Christe shoulde speake the wordes out of heauen.</p>
            <p>So ye haue good children, the begynnynge and foundation, of
<pb n="ccxxx" facs="tcp:9778:261"/>
the ministers of gods worde, and of the authoritie of the kayes, as our lord Iesus Christ did first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyne and institute the same. The whiche our sauiour Christ did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute and appointe for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that our consciences myghte thereby be comforted, and assured of the forgyuenes of synnes, and to haue the inestimable thresures of the gospel, as often as we haue nede thereof. That we thereby being made stronge in oure faith, might so continewe to thende of our life. And he that continueth to the ende, shal be saued. The which graunt vs the most merciful God Amen.</p>

            <q>I am the true vyne / and my father is the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande man. Euerye braunche that beareth not fruyte in me / he wyll

me ye can do nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.</q>
            <p>By these wordes our Lord Iesus Christe doeth teache vs veraye plainlye, how we be iustified &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before god. For as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> braunch of a vyne, bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth forth no fruyt, except it abyde in the vyne, so we can not be rightuous, excepte we abyd in Christ. And as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che of a vine, doeth not flouriche, nor kepe lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his sappe, but withereth away, &amp; is cast into the fier, when it is cut from the vyne, euen so be we damned, and can not be saued, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we forsake our master Christ</p>
            <p>Nowe ye haue heard good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, howe by baptisme we are so pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in Christ, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by him we haue forgyuenes of our sinnes, and are grafted in hym, as the braunche is in the vyne. And as the braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haue sappe and lyfe of the vyne, that they maye bryng forth
<pb n="ccxxxii" facs="tcp:9778:263"/>
fruyte, so we also (which beleue in Christe, and are baptised) haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued of hym the holy goste, that we maye be iustified. And yf it chaunce vs to fall from Christe, thorowe synne or vnbelefe, or to be put out of the Christen congre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gation, for our open and manifest synnes, yet ye haue hearde, howe we are receyued agayne, in to the bosome of the churche, and ioyned to Christes bodye, by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Kaies and absolution. But yf we wil be iustified and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it is not ynoughe to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Christ, but we must also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide and continue in hym. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore nowe foloweth that doctrine, which teacheth vs, how we ought to ordre our selues, that we maye styll abyde and growe in Christe, after that we are grafted in hym. And this doctrine is conteyned in
<pb facs="tcp:9778:264"/>
the institution and receauynge of the supper of oure Lorde Iesus Christ. For as by baptisme we are borne agayne, and as by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Kaies and penance, we are lifted vp agayne, when we are fallen in to synne after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, so by the commuinion of the holy supper of the Lorde, we are preserued and strengthened, that we maye be able stedfastly to sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; fyght, against the violent inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of sin &amp; the power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuel. Wherefore good children, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as ye be alredye planted in Christ by baptisme, learne also I praye you, howe ye maye conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually abyde and growe in Christ the whiche thing is taught you, in the vse of the Lordes supper. Ye shall therefore dilygentlye learne the wordes, by the whiche oure Lorde Iesus Christ did institute
<pb n="ccxxxiii" facs="tcp:9778:264"/>
and ordeyne his supper, that ye maye repet them word for worde, and so prynt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in your memory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that you may beare them away with you home to youre fathers houses, and there oftentymes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herse them. And these be the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of oure sauioure Christe.</p>
            <q>Our Lorde Iesus Christ the same nyghte that he was betrayed / <note place="margin">Mat. 26. c Mar. 14. c Luc. xxii. b Iohn. vi. and xiii, i.

            <p>Nowe ye shall dilygentlye laboure, not onely to say without boke these wordes of our sauiour Christe, but also to vnderstande, what oure Lorde Iesus Christe mente by the same, that ye maye make answer, when ye be asked any question herein, and that also in tyme to come, ye may be able to teache your children, as ye youre selfes are now instructed. For
<pb n="ccxxxiiii" facs="tcp:9778:265"/>
what greater dishonestye can ther be, eyther in the sighte of God or man, then to professe youre selues to be Christian people, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes &amp; yet not to know, what Christes sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes be, &amp; wherfore they wer ordeyned? For saint Paul sayth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he whiche eateth and drynketh the supper of the Lorde vnworthely, doth eate and drynke his awne damnation.</p>
            <p>Nowe therfore good children, that ye may truely vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de the wordes of the lordes holy supper, and that ye receyue not this sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mente to youre owne damnation, learne here dylygentlye, that the true vnderstandyng and vse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes supper, standeth in two thynges. The fyrste is, to do that whiche our lord himself hath com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded.</p>
            <p>The seconde is, to beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:9778:266"/>
he hath promysed. Of these two I wil speake in order, wherto I pray you gyue good eare.</p>
            <p>First our sauiour Christ taketh breade in his hand, he giueth tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, he breaketh it and gyueth it to his dysciples, and sayeth. Take, eate. Lykewyse he taketh the cup, and sayeth. Take, drynke. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to obey those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des &amp; to do that, which our Lord commaundeth vs. For although Christ prescribeth no certen tyme, when we ought to come together to his supper, althoughe also he appoynte no certen noumber of dayes, howe often in the yeare we ought to receaue this supper, yet this is his holy &amp; godly wyl, that at some tyme we shoulde receaue this sacrament. And this to do, is for oure great commoditie &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, for elles our Lorde wolde not
<pb n="ccxxxv" facs="tcp:9778:266"/>
haue commaunded vs so to do, who knoweth better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we, what helpe and comforte we haue nede of. Wherfore if we wil be christes trew disciples, then we must do as he himselfe commaundeth his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyples to do. Let vs therefore go to this godly supper, let vs eate &amp; drinke therof, &amp; let vs not absteine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out a great cause. Secondarily Christ saieth of the breade, this is my bodye, and of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cuppe he sayeth, this is my bloud. Wherefore we ought to beleue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the sacrament we receyue trew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the bodye and bloud of Christ. For God is almyghtye (as ye hearde in the Crede). He is able therefore, to do all thynges what he wil. And as saint Paul writeth he calleth those thinges whiche be not, as yf they were. Wherefore when Christe taketh breade, and
<pb facs="tcp:9778:267"/>
saieth. Take, eate, this is my body we ought not to doute but we eat his veray bodye. And when he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the cuppe, and sayeth. Take, drynke, this is my blod, we ought to thynke assuredly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we drynke his veray blode. And this we must beleue, yf we wil be counted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And wher as in this perel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous tyme, certayne deceitful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons be founde in manye places, who of very frowardnes, wil not graunt, that there is the body and bloude of Christe, but denye the same, for none other cause, but that they cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe by mans blynde reason, howe this thinge shoulde be broughte to passe, ye good children, shall with all dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence beware of suche persons, that ye suffer not your selues, to be deceaued by them. For suche men surely are not trew Christy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="ccxxxvi" facs="tcp:9778:267"/>
nether as yet haue thei lerned the first article of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Crede, whych teacheth, that God is almightye, whiche ye good children haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy perfectely lerned. Wherfore eschewe such erroneous opinions, and beleue the wordes of our lord Iesus, that you eate and drynke his veray body &amp; blode although mans reason can not comprehend how and after what maner y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same is ther present. For the wysedome of reason, must be subdued to the obedience of Christ, as the apostle Paule teacheth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly he sayeth, that his body was gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death for vs, &amp; that his blod was shed for vs. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muste beleue and confesse this thing, that all we are concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and borne in syn, as we haue learned in the ten commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and chiefely in the two last.
<pb facs="tcp:9778:268"/>
We are therefore by nature the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of gods wrath, &amp; shoulde be damned for euer yf Christ had not redemed vs by his holy passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> For he was made ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for vs, and dyd all thinges for vs, whiche we were bound to do, and coulde not do, that is to saye, he fulfylled the lawe for vs, and toke vpon hym all that crosse whiche we moste rightuously had deserued, for our iniquities and offenses, and he shed his bloude for vs, that oure synnes might be forgyuen vs. All these thinges we oughte stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beleue. Wherfore they be in a great errore, whiche wyll make satisfaction for their synnes, with fastyng, prayer, almes dedes, and suche lyke good workes. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe we are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to do these good workes, yet they be not a sufficient price, raunsome or satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="ccxxxvii" facs="tcp:9778:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for oure synnes, but onely the death and bloude of our sauy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oure Christ, was a sufficient and worthy sacrifice, to take away our synnes, and to obteyne for vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyuenes of oure offenses, as it is written in the seconde chapter of saincte Iohn his firste epystle. Christ is that sacryfice that pacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth Gods dyspleasure, &amp; obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth pardon for oure synnes, and not for our synnes onely, but also for the synnes of all the worlde.</p>
            <p>Fourthly Christ sayeth, do this in the remembraunce of me. Here also it is oure dutye to obey the worde of Christ, and to do y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thing, which he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vs to do. Wherefore (good children) doubt not, but ther is the bodye &amp; bloud of our Lorde, which we receaue in the lordes supper. For he hath sayed so, and by the power of his
<pb facs="tcp:9778:269"/>
worde hath caused it so to be. Wherefore seyng Christ saieth, do this as often as ye do it, in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of me, it is euident herby, that Christe causeth, euen at thys tyme, his bodye and bloude to be in the sacrament, after that maner and fashion, as it was at that tyme, when he made his maundye with his disciples. For elles we coulde not do that thyng, whiche his disciples dyd. But Christ hath commaunded vs, to do the selfe same thing that his disciples dyd, and to do it in the remembraunce of him, that is to saye, to receaue his bodye and bloude, euen so as he himselfe did gyue it to his dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And let not the foulyshe talke of vnbeleuers moue you, who are wont to aske this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Howe can the pryest or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster make the bodie and bloude of
<pb n="ccxxxviii" facs="tcp:9778:269"/>
Christ? To the whiche I answer, that the minister doth not this of himself. But Christ himselfe doth gyue vnto vs his fleshe &amp; blode, as his wordes dothe euyde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. Nether let their argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes or reasons perswade you, whiche say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ought not to be receaued vnder both kyndes, but vndre one kynde only. For Christ gaue to his disciples both kindes and hath bydde vs, that we also shoulde do the same. And when he gaue the cuppe to his dysciples, he added therto this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in these expresse &amp; plaine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, saying. Drinke ye al of this. Now we ought to obey god, more then men. We ought therefore to receaue the sacrament vnder both kyndes, as Christe commaunded vs. And regarde not the gageling of theim that speake againste the
<pb facs="tcp:9778:270"/>
vse of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes vnder both kyndes, sayinge. It maketh no great matier, whether ye receaue it vndre both kyndes, or one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it perteineth not to salua<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, to receiue it vnder both kin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des. But what shal I dispute long in this matier. Take this for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, that it is only laudable &amp; good, to do that thinge, whiche Christ hathe commaunded, and not to swarue from the same.</p>
            <p>So we ought to receaue this blessed sacrament, in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of Christ, as saint Paule saieth,<note place="margin">i Cor. xi.i.</note> that is to saye, we ought to preache his death, vntil he come a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gaine. For he wil suerely come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and iudge bothe the quicke and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deade, as ye haue lerned in your Crede. In the meane season, we ought to remembre and preach his death, that he hath redemed
<pb n="ccxxxviii" facs="tcp:9778:270"/>
vs, with his death and sheding of his most precious bloude, &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased for vs forgyuenes of oure synnes. And this we ought euer to haue in oure remembraunce, that in no wyse we forget this his exceding great benefyte, and that we seke not for remyssion of syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, by any other wayes or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, then by fayth in Christe.</p>
            <p>Nowe when we preache the death of the Lord, and shewe that he hathe redemed vs thereby, we ought also to call this to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce, that he dyed not for vs onely, but for all men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in him. And forasmuche as Christe loued al men so entierely, that he dyed for theym, we ought for Christes sake to loue our ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghbours, for whom Christe hathe dyed. For Christ sayeth.<note place="margin">Ioh. xiii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and .iii. b</note> if one of you loue another. And this is it, that saincte Paule sayeth. All we that be pertakers of one breade,<note place="margin">i Corin. x.</note> are one bodye and one breade.</p>
            <p>As often therefore good chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as you shal come to the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des table (whiche ye shall vse to do, when ye shall come to further yeares of discretion) you shal seke the comforte of your consciences, and do as sainct Paule saieth in these wordes. Let a man examine himselfe, and so let him eat of the breade and drynke of the cuppe. For he that eateth or drinketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthely, eateth and drinketh his awne damnation, because he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no dyfference of the Lordes bodye. And when ye shal haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined your selues, ye shal fynde that ye are synners, and that ye
<pb n="ccxxxix" facs="tcp:9778:271"/>
haue nede, that Christ should giue his bodye for you, and shede hys bloude for you. And this to do, is truly to examine and trye youre selues. For sainct Paule saieth. Yf we wold iudge our selues, we should not be iudged of the Lord. But when we are iudged of the Lorde, we are chasticed, that we should not be dampned, with the worlde. For him that doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege his faute, God doeth iudge and chastice with dyuerse afflictions, that at the length he maye cause him therby to confesse his fautes, and repent him, that his synnes may be forgyuen him. Ye shal also examine yourselues, whether ye be able to do, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ commaundeth, and to beleue, that Christ saith. Furthermore ye shal make an inquirie in your conscy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, whether you be gladde in
<pb facs="tcp:9778:272"/>
youre harte, to forgyue youre neyghboure his offences against you and to loue him hartely and vnfaynedly for Christes sake. For when ye do thus, then ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely receaue the body and bloud of Christ. And he that so receaueth it, receaueth euerlastyng lyfe. For he doth not only, with his bodyly mouthe receaue the bodye and bloude of Christ, but he doth also beleue the wordes of Christ, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is assured, that Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye was gyuen to death for vs, &amp; that his bloude was shed for vs. And he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this beleueth, eateth and drynketh the bodye and bloude of Christ spiritually. Of this Christ speaketh, when he sayeth. He that eateth my fleshe and drynketh my bloud,<note place="margin">Iohn. vi.</note> abydeth in me and I in him. And when we be planted in Christ, then we maye come to this
<pb n="ccxl" facs="tcp:9778:272"/>
holy supper as often as we wyll, that by this gostlye fode, we may dayly more and more waxe stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in our faith, that Christe was gyuen to be the raunsome for our synnes, and that he dwelleth in vs, and we in him. For seyng that we are planted in Christ by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, and are bound to grow and increase in him, and to be made lyke vnto him, it is not conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that we shoulde onely haue a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueryng opinion, that we dwell in Christe, and growe in faith &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, but we muste haue a sure worde and worke of God, to the whiche we maye leane in all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, &amp; therby be assured, that we do spiritually growe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in Christe. And this worde and worke of God, is set before our eyes in the Lordes supper.</p>
            <p>For seyng oure sauioure Christ
<pb facs="tcp:9778:273"/>
doth gyue vs his bodye to be oure meate, and his bloude, to be our drynke, and thereby doth declare, that he wil effectually dwel in vs, strengthen and preserue vs to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastyng lyfe, we may stedfastly beleue, that Christ doth worke in vs, and that he wil giue vs gostly strength and stedfastnes, that we lyke grene braunches maye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew in the vyne, and so be full of sappe and bryng forth good fruit.</p>
            <p>And this is the meanynge and playne vnderstandynge, of the wordes of the Lordes supper. Wherefore learne them dilygent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I pray you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when ye be asked, what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or the lordes supper? ye maye answer. It is the trew body and true bloude of our Lorde Iesus Christe, whiche was ordeyned by Christ him selfe, to be eaten and dronken of vs Christen
<pb n="ccxli" facs="tcp:9778:273" rendition="simple:additions"/>
people, vnder the forme of breade and wine. Furthermore yf any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil aske ye, wher is this writen? ye shall answer. These be the wordes which the holy Euangelistes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe, Marke, Luke, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle Paule do writ. Our Lorde Iesus Christ the same nyght that he was betrayed, toke breade, and gyuyng thankes brake it, &amp; gaue it to his disciples, and said. Take, eate. This is my bodye, whiche is giuen for you. Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of me. Lykewyse he toke the cup, after he had supped, and giuynge thankes gaue it to them, and sayed. Drynke of this all ye. This is my bloude of the new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, which is shed for you and for manye, for the forgyuenes of synnes. Do this as often as ye drincke, in remembraunce of me. Furthermore yf any man aske ye,
<pb facs="tcp:9778:274"/>
what auayleth it, thus to eate and drynke? ye shall answer. These wordes do declare what profit we receaue thereby, my bodye whych is giuen for you, my bloud which is shed for you, for the forgiuenes of synnes. By the whiche wordes Christe declareth, that by this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramente and wordes of promyse, are gyuen to vs, remission of syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, lyfe and saluation. For where as forgyuenes of synne is ther is also lyfe and saluation. Againe yf a man wyl go further with you, &amp; aske you. How can bodily eatyng and drynkynge haue so greate strength and operation? ye shall answer. To eate and to drynke, doth not worke so great thynges, but this worde &amp; promyse of God, my bodye whiche was gyuen for you, my bloude whiche was shede for you, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remyssion of sinnes.
<pb n="ccxlii" facs="tcp:9778:274"/>
This worde of God is added to the outwarde sygnes, as the chief thing in this sacramente. He that beleueth these wordes, he hathe that thinge, whiche the wordes do promyse, that is to saye, forgyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his synnes.</p>
            <p>Besyde this, yf a man aske of you, who be they, that do worthely receaue this sacrament? ye shal an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swere. That fastyng, abstinence and suche other lyke, do perteyne and are profitable for an outward discypline or chasticement of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But he receaueth the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t worthely, that hath faith to beleue these wordes. My bodye whiche was gyuen for you, my bloude whiche was shed for you, for the remission of synnes. But he that beleueth not these wordes, or doub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he receaueth the lordes supper vnworthely. For this
<pb facs="tcp:9778:275"/>
worde, giuen for you, doth require a faithful and beleuyng harte.</p>
            <p>So good children, ye haue the trew vnderstanding of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of Christe, and the trew vse of the holy supper of the Lorde. Learne al these lessons dilygently (I pray you) that ye also in tyme to come, maye worthely receaue this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and from daye to daye sticke and cleaue more stedfastlye to the wordes of our Lord Iesus Christ, and so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuyng in Christe, maye bryng forthe good fruyt. And yf you do so, then youre heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wil purge and prune you (as the husbande man dothe the brau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his vyne) that ye may dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly floryshe more and more, &amp; bring forth fruit more plenteouslye, that God may be glorified by you, and your fruyt maye abyde contynu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. And so at the length, ye shall
<pb n="ccxliii" facs="tcp:9778:275"/>
receaue lyfe and euerlastynge sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and glorie, with oure saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Iesus Christ, the which God graunt vs all. Amen.</p>
