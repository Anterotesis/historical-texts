            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>HEB. IX. 26.</bibl>
               <q>But now once hath he appeared in the end of the world, to take away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AMong many other great ends and reaſons for which God was pleaſed to ſend his Son into the World to dwell amongſt us, this was one of the chief, that by a long courſe of the greateſt innocency
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151794:3"/>
and the greateſt ſufferings in our Nature he might be capable to make a perfect Expiation of Sin: <hi>But now once in the end of the world,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Ages, that is in the laſt Age of the World, which is the <hi>Goſpel</hi> Age, <hi>hath he appeared to take away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The general deſign of God in ſending his Son into the World was to ſave mankind from eternal death and miſery, and to purchaſe for us eternal life and happineſs. So the <hi>Author</hi> of our Salvation himſelf tells <note place="margin">John 3. 16.</note>us, That <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in order to the procuring of this Salvation for us, the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and hindrances of it were to be removed: theſe were the <hi>guilt,</hi> and the <hi>dominion</hi> of Sin: By the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151794:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>guilt</hi> of Sin we were become obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to the wrath of God and to eternal condemnation, and by the <hi>defilement</hi> and <hi>dominion</hi> of it we were incapable of the happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the reward of eternal Life.</p>
            <p>To remove theſe two great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances two things were neceſſary: the Forgiveneſs of ſins paſt, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our deliverance from the wrath of God and the eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the next Life; and the Reformation of our hearts and lives to make us capable of eternal Life and happineſs in another World. And both theſe, if God had ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, might for any thing we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know to the contrary, have been effected by the abundant mercy and powerful grace of God, without this wonderful method and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of ſending his Son in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>to take away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf:</hi> But it ſeems the wiſdom of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151794:4"/>
God thought fit to pitch upon this way and method of our Salvation, and no doubt for very good <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi> amongſt which theſe <hi>three</hi> ſeem to be very obvious and very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> to vindicate the honour of his Laws, which if Sin had gone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unpuniſh'd would have been in great danger of falling into contempt. For if God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a general Pardon of Sin to all mankind, without any teſtimony of his wrath and diſpleaſure againſt it, who would have had any great veneration for his Laws, or have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in good earneſt that the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of them had been either ſo extremely offenſive to Him, or ſo very dangerous to the Sinner?</p>
            <p>Therefore to maintain the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Laws, rather than Sin ſhould paſs unpuniſh'd God would lay the puniſhment of it upon his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151794:4"/>
only begotten Son, the deareſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to him in the World: Which is a greater teſtimony of his high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt Sin, and of his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der regard and concernment for the honour of his Laws, than if the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had ſuffered the puniſhment due to it in his own perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> another Reaſon of this Diſpenſation, and that likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable, was, that God might forgive Sin in ſuch a way as yet effectually to diſcountenance and diſcourage it, and to create in us the greateſt horror and hatred of it: Which could not have been by an abſolute Pardon, without any puniſhment inflicted, or ſatisfaction made to the honour of his Juſtice. For had Sin been ſo eaſily forgiven, who would have been ſenſible of the great evil of it, or afraid to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend for the future?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:151794:5"/>
But when God makes his own Son a Sacrifice, and lays upon him the puniſhment due for the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of us all, this is a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that God hates Sin as much, if it be poſſible, as he loved his own Son. For this plainly ſhews what Sin deſerves, and what the Sinner may juſtly expect, if after this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of God againſt it he will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to commit it.</p>
            <p>And if this Sacrifice for Sin, and the Pardon purchaſed by it, be not effectual to reclaim us from Sin, and to beget in us an eternal dread and deteſtation of it: If we ſin wilfully after ſo clear a revelation of the <hi>wrath of God from heaven againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men,</hi> there remains <hi>no more ſacrifice for ſin, but a certain fearful looking for of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fiery indignation to conſume the adverſaries.</hi> For what could God do more to teſtify his diſpleaſure
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:151794:5"/>
againſt ſin, and to diſcountenance the practice of it, than to make his only Son an offering for Sin, and to give him up to be wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities? In what clearer Glaſs can we at once behold the great evil and demerit of Sin, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite goodneſs and mercy of God to Sinners, than in the ſorrows and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Son of God for our Sins and for our ſakes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> another Reaſon of this Diſpenſation ſeems to have been a gracious condeſcenſion and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Almighty God with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain apprehenſion and perſuaſion, which had very early and univerſally obtained among Mankind, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the expiation of Sin and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the offended Deity by Sacrifices: by the Sacrifices of living Creatures, of Birds and Beaſts; and afterwards by Human Sacrifices and <hi>the blood of</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:151794:6"/>
               <hi>their ſons and daughters:</hi> by offering to God, as the expreſſion is in the <hi>Prophet, their firſt-born for their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and the fruit of their body for the ſin of their ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Notion of the expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin by Sacrifice, whether it had its firſt Riſe from <hi>Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and was afterwards propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Age to Age by <hi>Tradition:</hi> I ſay, from whence ſoever this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came, it hath of all other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning Religion, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe of the <hi>Being</hi> of God, and his <hi>Providence,</hi> and of the <hi>Recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of <hi>another Life,</hi> found the moſt univerſal reception, and the thing hath been the moſt generally pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in all Ages and Nations, not only in the <hi>old,</hi> but in the <hi>new</hi> diſcovered parts of the World.</p>
            <p>And indeed a very great part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God himſelf, ſeems to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151794:6"/>
have been a plain condeſcenſion to the general Apprehenſion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, concerning this way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing the offended Deity by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: As it was alſo a Figure of that great and efficacious Sacrifice which ſhould in due time be offer'd to God to make atonement once for all for the Sins of all Mankind.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth very particularly inſiſt upon this condeſcenſion of God to them, in the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel: and whereas they apprehended ſo great a neceſſity of an <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> and of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> to make expiation for the ſins of the People, that it was an eſtabliſhed <hi>Principle</hi> among them, that <hi>without ſhedding of blood there was no remiſſion of Sins;</hi> God was pleaſed to comply ſo far with theſe Notions and Apprehenſions of theirs, as to make his own Son both a <hi>Prieſt</hi> and a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> to do that once for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151794:7"/>
all which their own <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do <hi>year by year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from hence the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> takes occaſion to recommend to them the <hi>new Covenant</hi> and <hi>Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as having a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more perfect <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> and a more excellent <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> than were the <hi>High-Prieſts</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Law;</hi> the <hi>Son of God</hi> having <hi>by one Sacrifice of himſelf obtained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Redemption for us, and perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Apprehenſion prevailed no leſs in the <hi>Heathen</hi> World, and proceeded to the Sacrifices of Men, even of their <hi>firſt born.</hi> And with this Apprehenſion, not to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance but to aboliſh it, God was pleaſed to comply ſo far as to make a general Atonement for the Sins of Mankind by the Death of his Son, appearing in our Nature to become a voluntary Sacrifice for us: God
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151794:7"/>
permitting him to be unjuſtly put to death and his blood to be ſhed by the malice of men, in appearance as a Malefactor, but in truth as a Martyr; and accepting of his Death as a meritorious Sacrifice and <hi>propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for the Sins of the whole World:</hi> That by this wiſe counſel and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his Providence he might for ever put an end to that barbarous and inhuman way of ſerving God which had been ſo long in uſe and practice among them: The Son of God by the voluntary Sacrifice of himſelf having effected all that at once, and for ever, which Mankind from the beginning of the World had in vain been endeavouring to accompliſh by innumerable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Sacrifices; namely, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of their Sins, and perfect peace and reconciliation with God.</p>
            <p>For theſe Ends and Reaſons, and perhaps for many more as great and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:151794:8"/>
conſiderable as theſe which our ſhallow underſtandings are not able to fathom, the Wiſdom of God hath pitched upon this way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of delivering Mankind from the guilt and dominion of Sin by the Sacrifice of his Son. And to this end it was requiſite that he ſhould appear in our Nature and dwell amongſt us for ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able time, that by a long courſe of the greateſt Innocency and of the greateſt Sufferings in our Nature he might be capable of making a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect expiation of Sin.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>two</hi> things were requiſite to qualify him for this purpoſe; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Innocency</hi> and Obedience, and great <hi>Sufferings</hi> in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even to the ſuffering of Death. Both theſe the <hi>Scripture</hi> declares to be neceſſary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a Perſon capable to make expiation of Sin; and both theſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151794:8"/>
were found in the Perſon of our <hi>B. Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> unſpotted <hi>Innocency</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Obedience.</hi> This the <hi>Scripture</hi> teſtifies concerning Him, and the whole courſe of his Life and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>He was in all points tempted like</hi>

               <hi>as we are, yet without Sin,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews. He always</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 29.</note>

               <hi>no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth, as</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us of Him. And this was neceſſary to qualify him for the perfect expiation of Sin, whether we conſider Him as a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> or as a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> he could not have been fit to make expiation for the Sins of others, had he not been without ſin himſelf. And this the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us is one great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> under the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151794:9"/>
               <hi>Goſpel,</hi> above the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> who being a Sinner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as well as thoſe for whom he offer'd, had need to offer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before he could make ſo much as a Legal expiation for the Sins of others: But a perfect and effectual expiation of Sin, ſo as to purge the conſcience from the guilt of it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made but by an High Prieſt who is holy and innocent himſelf; <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 26, 27.</note>
               <hi>For ſuch an High-Prieſt,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, became us,</hi> that is, now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Diſpenſation of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> when a perfect expiation of Sins is to be made, <hi>ſuch an High-Prieſt</hi> is neceſſary, <hi>as is holy, harmleſs, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, ſeparate from Sinners, who needs not as thoſe High-Prieſts,</hi> that is as the High-Prieſts under the Law, to <hi>offer up ſacrifice firſt for his own Sins, and then for the People:</hi> The plain force of which Argument is this, that he who will be qualified to make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151794:9"/>
for the Sins of others muſt be without ſin himſelf.</p>
            <p>And then if we conſider <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for Sin; perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is neceſſary to make a Sacrifice acceptable and available for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of Sin. The neceſſity of this was typified by the quality of the <hi>expiatory Sacrifices</hi> under the <hi>Law:</hi> the <hi>Beaſts</hi> that were to be offered were to be <hi>without ſpot and blemiſh:</hi> To which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> alludes, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the quality and efficacy of the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt: How much</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note>
               <hi>more,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſciences from dead works to ſerve the</hi>

               <hi>living God?</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe St. <hi>Peter, For aſmuch as ye know ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot,</hi>  hereby
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151794:10"/>
intimating, that nothing leſs than the perfect innocency and holineſs of him who was to be a Sacrifice for us could have expiated the guilt of our ſins and purchaſed eternal Redemption for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> great <hi>Sufferings</hi> likewiſe in our Nature, even to the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Death, were requiſite to the perfect expiation of Sin: I ſay, even to the ſuffering of Death. For the Sacrifices which were to make expiation were to be ſlain. And it was a conſtant <hi>Maxime</hi> and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> more than once in this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> ſeems to allow and confirm it, that <hi>without ſhedding of blood there was no remiſſion of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that God could not have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned Sin without ſatisfaction made to his Juſtice, either by the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sinner himſelf, or of a Sacrifice in his ſtead: But, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151794:10"/>
to the method and Diſpenſation which the Wiſdom of God had pitched upon, he was reſolved not to diſpenſe Forgiveneſs in any other way. For which reaſon he ſeems either to have poſſeſs'd Mankind with this <hi>Principle,</hi> or to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to be ſo perſwaded, that <hi>Sin was not to be expiated but by Blood,</hi> that is, either by the Death of the Sinner, or of the Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Now the Life of our <hi>B. Saviour,</hi> as well as his Death, was made up of Sufferings of one kind or other: Continual Sufferings from his Cradle to his Croſs, from the time he drew his firſt breath to his giving up of the ghoſt: And not only continual Sufferings, but the greateſt that ever were, conſidering the Dignity of the Perſon that ſuffered, and the nature of the Sufferings: Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe that theſe Sufferings were not only wholly undeſerved
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:151794:11"/>
on his part, but unmerited alſo on ours, for whoſe ſake he ſubmitted himſelf to them: Nay, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he had obliged to the utmoſt thoſe for whom and by whom he ſuffered, and continued ſtill to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them by the greateſt Bleſſings and Benefits purchaſed and procured for them by thoſe very Sufferings which with ſo much Malice and Cruelty they inflicted on him.</p>
            <p>Had our <hi>B. Saviour</hi> been a mere Man, the perfect Innocency and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Purity of his whole Life; his Zeal to do the Will of God, and his delight in doing it; his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite pains and unwearied diligence in <hi>going about doing good:</hi> His conſtant Obedience to God in the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Inſtances, and his perſeverance in well doing, notwithſtanding the ill uſage and hard meaſure, the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reproaches and Perſecutions he met withal for it, from a wicked and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:151794:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ill natured World: His perfect ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Will of God, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Patience under the greateſt and bittereſt Sufferings, and his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Charity to his Enemies and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors: Theſe muſt needs be highly acceptable to God, and if Man could merit of God, likely enough to be available for the Sins of others.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>Saviour</hi> and our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> being the <hi>Son of God</hi> in our Nature; and He voluntarily aſſuming it, and ſubmitting to the condition of Humanity in its loweſt and moſt miſerable ſtate, Sin only excepted; and his being contented to live a Life of doing good and ſuffering evil, and at laſt to be put to Death and ſlain a Sacrifice for us: The Dignity of the Perſon who did and ſuffered all this for us, and his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God, muſt needs add a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty value to ſo perfect an Obedience
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151794:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſuch patient Sufferings; ſo as to render them a full, perfect and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Sacrifice, oblation and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the Sins of the whole World.</p>
            <p>And all this being willingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in our Nature, and accepted by God as done upon our account, may reaſonably be preſumed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to our benefit and advantage, as much as if we our ſelves had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it in our own perſons: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being ſo proper, and ſo avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to make an <hi>honourable amends</hi> and ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God for the Sins of all Mankind, as the voluntary Obedience and Sufferings of Human Nature in a Perſon of ſo great Dignity and dearneſs to God as his eternal and entirely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son.</p>
            <p>Now that Expiation of Sin was made by the Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151794:12"/>
our ſtead, I ſhall endeavour to make good theſe <hi>three</hi> ways.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> from plain Teſtimonies of <hi>H. Scripture,</hi> declaring this matter to us as clearly and fully as it is poſſible for words to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> from the nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of <hi>Expiatory Sacrifices,</hi> both among the <hi>Jews</hi> and Heathen; to which the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſo frequently compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and in point of vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to take away Sin infinitely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by vindicating this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and Diſpenſation of the Divine Wiſdom from the Objections which are brought againſt it; and by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is nothing in it that is unreaſonable, or any wiſe unworthy of God.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall produce ſome plain <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Teſtimonies of <hi>H. Scripture</hi> which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:151794:13"/>
decIare this matter as clearly and fully as it is poſſible for words to do it; namely, that the <hi>Son of God,</hi> in order to the effectual <hi>Expiation</hi> of Sin, ſuffered in our ſtead, and bore the wrath of God for us, and made a perfect Atonement for Sin, and obtained eternal Redemption for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This the</hi> Scripture <hi>declares to us in great variety of expreſſions; as, that</hi> Chriſt dyed for us, <hi>and</hi> for our Sins; <hi>that he was</hi> a Sacrifice for us, <hi>and</hi> a propitiation for the Sins of the whole World, <hi>that is, of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; that</hi> he bare our Sins in his own body on the Tree, <hi>and</hi> appeared to take away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf; <hi>that</hi> we are juſtified in his blood, <hi>and</hi> redeemed by the price of it; <hi>and in very many other expreſſions to the ſame purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is ſo evidently the ſcope and meaning of theſe Expreſſions, that it cannot be denied without
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:151794:13"/>
offering the greateſt violence imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the <hi>H. Scriptures.</hi> For can any man think that God would have uſed ſo many expreſſions in <hi>Scripture,</hi> the plain and moſt obvious ſenſe of all which is that the <hi>Son of God</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our Sins and in our ſtead, if this had not been his deſign and meaning? Would not this be in effect to ſay, that God hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a great Book to puzzle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, but not to inſtruct and teach Mankind?</p>
            <p>I will at preſent ſingle out ſome few of thoſe many <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> which might be produced to this purpoſe: <hi>He hath made him to be ſin</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note>
               <hi>for us, who knew no ſin,</hi> that is, he hath made him who had no ſin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Sacrifice for our ſins. Again; <hi>and walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 10.</note>
               <hi>us and given himſelf for us, an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a ſacrifice to God.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18.</note>to the ſame purpoſe tells us, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151794:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for Sins, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the fleſh:</hi> Here <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>ſuffered for Sin;</hi> and to declare that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> did not only mean that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered upon the occaſion of our Sins, but that he ſuffered in the place and ſtead of the Sinner, he adds, <hi>the juſt for the unjuſt,</hi> that is, the Son of God, who was innocent and had no Sin, ſuffered for us who were Sinners; or as it is elſewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, <hi>he bare our ſins in his own body on the Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true indeed, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our benefit and advantage; which the <hi>Socinians</hi> would have to be all that is meant in the <hi>Texts</hi> which I have cited: But then it ought to be conſidered, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our benefit and advantage does by no means exclude, nor is any wiſe inconſiſtent with his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151794:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in our ſtead. For whoever ſuffers in another man's ſtead, and to ſave him from ſuffering, does un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſuffer for his benefit and advantage, and gives the beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of it that can be: But the manner of the expreſſion, if compared with other parellel <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and eſpecially with what is ſo often ſaid of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s being a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which I ſhall have occaſion further to urge by and by: I ſay the manner of the expreſſion, if well conſidered, will appear to any man that is not contentious to ſignify our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s ſuffering inſtead of the Sinner.</p>
            <p>But not to argue from words and phraſes, I will produce two <hi>Texts</hi> which declare this matter ſo plainly, that the force of them is not to be avoided without the moſt ſhameful wreſting and perverting of them. <hi>This is my Commmandment,</hi> ſays our <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 12.</note>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:151794:15"/>
               <hi>Saviour, that you love one another, as I have loved you.</hi> How is that? he declares in the next words, <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 
               <note place="margin">V. 13.</note>
               <hi>love than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friend,</hi> that is, that he be contented to die in his ſtead. And to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 6, 7, 8.</note>St. <hi>Paul, For when ye were yet Sinners in due time Chriſt died for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly:</hi> Now the queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by this expreſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>dying for the ungodly</hi> be meant only his dying for the benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Sinners, but not his dying in their ſtead? This, let the words which immediately follow deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: <hi>For ſcarcely for a righteous man will one dye, yet peradventure for a good man one would even dare to dye: But God commendeth his love to us, in that whilſt we were yet ſinners Chriſt dyed for us.</hi> And now I appeal to any man of good ſenſe, whether it be not plain that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here ſpeaks of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151794:15"/>
dying for ſinners in the ſame ſenſe as one man is ſaid to dye for another, that is, to ſave another from death; which what is it elſe but to dye in his ſtead? He that can deny this, is perverſe to the higheſt degree, and I fear almoſt beyond the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of being convinced.</p>
            <p>And the Argument from theſe two <hi>Texts</hi> is ſo much the ſtronger, becauſe we do not here reaſon merely from the phraſe and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but from the main Scope of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s diſcourſe in the <hi>one,</hi> and of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s in the other. For the deſign of both is to recommend the Superlative love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to us above the greateſt love that ever any man expreſs'd to another. The higheſt pitch that human affection did ever riſe to, was for a man to lay down his life for his Friend; but the <hi>Son of God</hi> laid down his life for his Enemies. <hi>Scarcely,</hi> ſays St.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151794:16"/>
               <hi>Paul, would one lay down his life for a righteous man,</hi> that is, for one who is but ſtrictly juſt and honeſt, and does no body wrong; but for a <hi>good man,</hi> that is, for one that is kind and beneficial to all, and hath obliged Mankind by great Benefits, ſome one may be found that would lay down his life to ſave the life of ſuch a Perſon: But the love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath gone far beyond this: He <hi>dyed for Sinners,</hi> for thoſe who were neither <hi>good men</hi> nor <hi>righteous: But God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his love to us, in that whilſt we were yet Sinners Chriſt dyed for us.</hi> Now where doth the force of this Argument lye, if not in this? that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done that for us, who were <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>Sinners,</hi> which ſome very few perſons in the World have done for their <hi>Friend,</hi> or for ſome very eminently <hi>good man:</hi> And what is that? Why they have laid down their lives in their ſtead: And
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151794:16"/>
ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done for us. This ſeems to be ſo very plain, that I do not ſee how the force of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is poſſible to be avoided.</p>
            <p>It is evident then from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed not only for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage but in our ſtead; as truly and really as any man ever did or can dye for another who lays down his own life to ſave another from death. For if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not dyed, we had periſhed everlaſtingly; and becauſe he dyed, we are ſaved from eternal Death and miſery.</p>
            <p>And though this be no where in <hi>Scripture</hi> ſpoken of by the name or <hi>term</hi> of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> yet it is ſaid to be the <hi>price</hi> of our <hi>Redemption;</hi> which ſurely is the ſame thing in effect with <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> For as we are Sinners we are liable, and, as I may ſay, indebted to the Juſtice of God: And the Son of God, by his Death and Sufferings in our Nature,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151794:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath diſcharged this obligation and paid this debt for us: Which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge ſince it was obtained for us by the ſhedding of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s blood, and the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us that <hi>without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion of Sins:</hi> And ſince God is graciouſly pleaſed to accept of it for the Debt which we owed to his Juſtice, and to declare himſelf fully pleaſed and contented with it, why it may not properly enough be called <hi>payment</hi> or <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> I confeſs I am not able to underſtand. Men may eternally wrangle about any thing, but what a frivolous contention, what a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling in ſerious matters, what <hi>barre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie</hi> in <hi>Divinity</hi> is this?</p>
            <p>Not that God was <hi>angry</hi> with his <hi>Son,</hi> when he thus <hi>laid on him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of us all:</hi> No he was always well pleaſed with him; and never better, than when he <hi>became obedient to the Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:151794:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <hi>bore our Sins in his own body on the Tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor yet that our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſuffered the very ſame that the Sinner ſhould have ſuffered, namely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the proper Pains and Torment of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: But that his Obedience and Sufferings were of that value and eſteem with God, and his volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrifice of himſelf ſo well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him, that he thereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a Covenant of Grace and Mercy with Mankind, wherein he hath engaged himſelf to forgive the Sins of thoſe who believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and to make them partakers of eternal life. And hence the <hi>Blood of Chriſt</hi> which was ſhed for us upon the <hi>Croſs</hi> is called <hi>the Blood of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> as being the <hi>Sanction</hi> of that <hi>New Covenant,</hi> into which God is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with Mankind: and not only the <hi>Sanction</hi> and confir mation of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> but the very <hi>Foundation</hi> of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:151794:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it: For which reaſon the <hi>Cup</hi> in the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> is called <hi>the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or, as the word ſhould rather be rendred, <hi>the New Covenant in his Blood, which was ſhed for many for the remiſſion of Sins.</hi> I proceed now to the</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> II<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Thing propounded, which was to ſhew that the Expiation of our Sins was made by the Sufferings of Chriſt, from the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Expiatory Sacrifices,</hi> both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathen;</hi> to which the <hi>Death of Chriſt</hi> is in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſo frequently compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and in point of vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to take away Sin infinitely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to it.</p>
            <p>Now the nature and deſign of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifices</hi> was plainly this: To ſubſtitute one <hi>Living Creature</hi> to ſuffer and die inſtead of another; ſo that what the Sinner deſerved to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:151794:18"/>
have ſuffered was ſuppoſed to be done to the Sacrifice, that is, it was ſlain to make an atonement for the Sinner.</p>
            <p>And though there was no reaſon to hope for any ſuch effect from the Blood of <hi>Bulls,</hi> or <hi>Goats,</hi> or of any other <hi>Living Creatures</hi> that were wont to be offered up in Sacrifice; yet that both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> did expect and hope for it, is ſo very evident, that it cannot without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Ignorance or Obſtinacy be deny'd.</p>
            <p>But this expectation, how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoever, plainly ſhews it to have been the common Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Mankind, in all Ages, that God would not be appeaſed, nor ſhould Sin be pardoned without Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering: But yet ſo that men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conceived good hopes that upon the Repentance of Sinners God would accept of a <hi>vicarious</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:151794:19"/>
that is, of the Suffering of ſome other in their ſtead. And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probably, as I ſaid before, in compliance with this Apprehenſion of Mankind, and in condeſcention to it, as well as for other weighty Reaſons beſt known to the Divine Wiſdom, God was pleaſed to find out ſuch a Sacrifice as ſhould really and effectually procure for them that great Bleſſing of the Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sins, which they had ſo long hoped for from the multitude of their own Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth in a large Diſcourſe ſhew the great vertue and efficacy of the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to the purpoſe of Remiſſion of Sins, above that of the Sacrifices under the Law: And that the Death of <hi>Christ</hi> is really and effectually to our advantage all that which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices under the Law were ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be to the Sinner: <hi>But now once,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:151794:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here in the <hi>Text, in the end of the World, hath he appeared to take away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf.</hi> This is the great vertue and efficacy of the Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that what ever was expected from any other Sacrifices, either by <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> was really effected by <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was plainly ſignified by the <hi>Jewiſh Paſſover,</hi> wherein the <hi>Lamb</hi> was ſlain, and the <hi>Sinner</hi> did <hi>eſcape</hi> and was <hi>paſs'd by.</hi> In alluſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes no ſcruple to call <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Paſſover</hi> or <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> who was <hi>ſlain</hi> that we might <hi>eſcape: Chriſt our Paſſover,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is ſlain</hi> or <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 7.</note>
               <hi>offer'd for us;</hi> that is, He by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious appointment of God was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to ſuffer all that in our ſtead which the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſuffer for the <hi>Sinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this was likewiſe ſignified by the Sinners laying his hand upon the Sacrifice that was to be ſlain,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:151794:20"/>
thereby as it were transferring the puniſhment which was due to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Sacrifice that was to be ſlain and offered up. For ſo God tells <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the Sinner, who came to offer an Expiatory Sacrifice, <note place="margin">Lev. 1. 4.</note>ſhould do: <hi>He ſhall put his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering, and it ſhall be accepted for him, to make an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him.</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, that it was an eſtabliſhed Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, that <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhedding of blood there was no Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins:</hi> Which plainly ſhews that they expected this Benefit of the Remiſſion of Sins, from the Blood of their Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>And then he tells us, that we are really made partakers of this Benefit by the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by the <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 28.</note>vertue of his Sacrifice: And again, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was once offered to bear the Sins of many;</hi> plainly alluding to the Sacrifices under the Law, which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:151794:20"/>
did, as it were, bear the faults of the Sinner.</p>
            <p>And that this expreſſion, of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being <hi>offered to bear our Sins,</hi> cannot be meant of his taking away our Sins by his holy Doctrine which was confirmed by his Death, but of his bearing our Sins by way of <hi>imputation,</hi> and by his ſuffering for them in our ſtead, as the Sacrifice was ſuppoſed to do for the Sinner; This, I ſay, is evident beyond all denial from the oppoſition which follows, after the <hi>Text,</hi> between his <hi>firſt</hi> Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and his <hi>ſecond; Chriſt,</hi> ſays our <hi>Apoſtle, was once offered to bear our Sins,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">v. 28.</note>
               <hi>but unto them that look for him he ſhall appear a ſecond time without Sin unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Why? Did he not appear the firſt time without Sin? Yes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, as to any inherent guilt; for the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us <hi>he had no Sin.</hi> What then is the meaning of the oppoſition, That at his <hi>firſt</hi> Coming
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:151794:21"/>
               <hi>he bore our Sins,</hi> but at his <hi>ſecond</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>he ſhall appear without Sin unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Theſe words can have no other imaginable ſenſe but this, that at his <hi>firſt</hi> Coming he ſuſtain'd the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Sinner and ſuffered inſtead of us; but his <hi>ſecond</hi> Coming ſhall be upon another account, and <hi>he ſhall appear without Sin unto Salvation,</hi> that is, not as a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but as a <hi>Judge</hi> to confer the Reward of Eternal Life upon thoſe who are partakers of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which he offered to God for us <hi>in the days of his Fleſh.</hi> I proceed to the</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> III<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Thing I propoſed, and which yet remains to be ſpoken to; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to vindicate this Method and <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> of the <hi>Divine Wiſdom</hi> from the <hi>Objections</hi> which are brought againſt it; and to ſhew that there is nothing in it that is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:151794:21"/>
or any wiſe unworthy of God. I ſhall mention <hi>four Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which are commonly urged in this matter, and I think they are all that are conſiderable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1<hi>ſt. Firſt,</hi> That this Method, of the <hi>Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> of Sin by the Sufferings of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſeems to argue ſome defect and want of Goodneſs in God, as if he needed ſome external Motive and were not of himſelf diſpoſed to forgive Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>To which I think the <hi>Anſwer</hi> is not difficult, namely, that God did not want Goodneſs to have forgiven Sin freely and without any Satisfaction, but his Wiſdom did not think it meet to give encouragement to Sin by too eaſy a forgiveneſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome remarkable teſtimony of his ſevere diſpleaſure againſt it: And therefore his greater Goodneſs and Compaſſion to Mankind deviſed this way to ſave the Sinner, without
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:151794:22"/>
giving the leaſt countenance and encouragement to Sin.</p>
            <p>For God to think of ſaving us any way, was exceſſive Goodneſs and Mercy; but to think of doing it in this way, by ſubſtituting his dearly beloved Son to ſuffer in our ſtead, is a Condeſcention ſo very amazing, that if God had not been pleaſed of his own Goodneſs to ſtoop to it, it had almoſt been Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy in Man to have thought of it, or deſired it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2<hi>d. Secondly,</hi> How can our Sins be ſaid to have been forgiven <hi>freely,</hi> if the Pardon of them was purchaſed at ſo dear a rate and ſo mighty a Price was paid for it?</p>
            <p>In <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this I deſire theſe <hi>two</hi> things may be conſidered. 1<hi>ſt.</hi> That it is a wonderful grace and favour of God to admit of this tranſlation of the Puniſhment which was due to us, and to accept of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:151794:22"/>
Sufferings of another in our ſtead, and for our benefit; when he might juſtly have exacted it of us in our own Perſons: So that, even in this reſpect, we are, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>juſtified freely by his grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And <hi>freely</hi> too in reſpect of any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that lay upon God to forgive us in this or any other way. It was a free act of his Goodneſs to ſave us, even by the Satisfaction and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his own Son. 2<hi>ly.</hi> It was in effect freely too, notwithſtanding the mighty Price which was paid for our Redemption. Becauſe this Price was not of our own procuring, but of God's providing; He <hi>found out this Ranſome for us.</hi> And will any man ſay, that a Prince who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with his Son to intercede for the Pardon of a Rebel, yea and to ſuffer ſome puniſhment or to pay a Fine for the obtaining of it, does
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:151794:23"/>
not in effect and in all equitable and grateful conſtruction forgive him freely?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 3<hi>d. Thirdly,</hi> It is yet further objected, That this ſeems to be more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable than the ſacrificing of <hi>Beaſts</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> nay than the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing of <hi>Men</hi> among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and even of their <hi>own Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> Becauſe this is the offering up of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and the moſt excellent Perſon that ever was.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>manner,</hi> and the <hi>deſign</hi> of it, the thing will appear to be quite otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>manner</hi> of it, God did not command his Son to be ſacrificed, but his Providence permitted the wickedneſs and violence of men to put him to death: And then his Goodneſs and Wiſdom did over-rule this worſt of Actions to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:151794:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the beſt of Ends. And if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matter aright, how is this any more a reflection upon the Holy Providence of God, than any Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Cuelties which by his permiſſion are daily committed in the World?</p>
            <p>And then if we conſider the End and <hi>Deſign</hi> of this permiſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death, and the application of it to the purpoſe of a general Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we cannot but acknowledge, and even adore the gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Deſign of it. For by this means God did at once put an end to that unreaſonable and bloody way of Worſhip, which had been ſo long practiced in the World: And after this one Sacrifice, which was ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely dear to God, the benefit of Expiation was not to be expected in any other way; all other Sacrifices being worthleſs and vain in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of this: And it hath ever ſince
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:151794:24"/>
obtained this effect, of making all other Sacrifices to ceaſe, in all Parts of the World where <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> hath prevailed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 4<hi>th. Fourthly,</hi> The laſt <hi>Objection</hi> is, the Injuſtice and Cruelty of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Perſon's ſuffering inſtead of the Offender.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That they who make ſo great a noiſe with this <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> do ſeem to me to give a full and clear <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it themſelves, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, as they conſtantly and expreſly do, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſuffered all this for our <hi>benefit</hi> and <hi>advantage,</hi> though not in our <hi>place</hi> and <hi>ſtead.</hi> For this, to my apprehenſion, is plainly to give up the Cauſe, unleſs they can ſhew a good reaſon why there is not as much Injuſtice and Cruelty in an innocent Perſon's ſuffering for the benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a Malefactor, as in his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his ſtead: So little do Men,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:151794:24"/>
in the heat of diſpute and oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who are reſolved to hold faſt an Opinion in deſpite of Reaſon and good ſenſe, conſider, that they do many times in effect, and by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence, grant the very thing which in expreſs terms they do ſo ſtifly and pertinaciouſly deny.</p>
            <p>The truth of the matter is this; there is nothing of Injuſtice or Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty in either Caſe; neither in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Perſon's ſuffering for the <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> of an Offender, nor in his <hi>ſtead;</hi> ſuppoſing the Suffering to be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary: But they have equally the ſame appearance of Injuſtice and Cruelty: Nor can I poſſibly diſcern any reaſon why Injuſtice and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be objected in the one Caſe more than in the other, there being every whit as little reaſon why an <hi>Innocent Perſon</hi> ſhould ſuffer for the <hi>benefit</hi> of a <hi>Criminal,</hi> as why he ſhould ſuffer in his <hi>ſtead.</hi> So that I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:151794:25"/>
hope this <hi>Objection,</hi> which above all the reſt hath been ſo loudly and ſo invidiouſly urged, hath received a juſt <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I believe, if the matter were ſearched to the bottom, all this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe contention, about our Saviour's ſuffering for our <hi>benefit</hi> but not in our <hi>ſtead,</hi> will ſignify juſt nothing. For if <hi>Christ</hi> dyed for our <hi>benefit</hi> ſo as ſome way or other, by vertue of his Death and Sufferings, to ſave us from the wrath of God and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our eſcape from eternal Death, this, for ought I know, is all that any body means by his dying in our <hi>ſtead.</hi> For he that dies with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to do that <hi>benefit</hi> to another as to ſave him from Death, doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to all intents and purpoſes dye in his placea nd <hi>ſtead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if they will grant this to be their meaning, the Controverſie is at an end; and both ſides are agreed in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:151794:25"/>
they will give up that which by their own confeſſion is an <hi>undoubted Article</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> and not contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted on either Side; except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who yet are hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Enemies to <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and have expoſed the abſurdity of it with great advantage.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall endeavour to return a more particular <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;</hi> and ſuch a one as I hope will ſatisfy every conſiderate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced mind, that after all this confidence and ſwaggering of theirs there is by no means equal reaſon either for the <hi>receiving</hi> or for the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting</hi> of theſe <hi>two Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is not equal reaſon for the <hi>belief</hi> of theſe <hi>Two Doctrines.</hi> This <hi>Objection,</hi> if it be of any force, muſt ſuppoſe that there is equal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and proof from <hi>Scripture</hi> for theſe <hi>two Doctrines:</hi> But this we ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:151794:26"/>
deny, and with great reaſon; becauſe it is no more evident from the words of <hi>Scripture</hi> that the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Bread</hi> is ſubſtantially changed into <hi>Chriſt's natural Body</hi> by virtue of thoſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> than <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 1.</note>it is that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſubſtantially changed into a <hi>natural Vine</hi> by virtue of thoſe words, <hi>I am the true Vine;</hi> or than that the <hi>Rock</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> drank, was ſubſtantially changed into the <hi>Perſon of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, <hi>That Rock was Chriſt;</hi> or than that the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially changed into the <hi>natural Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it is in expreſs terms ſaid of the <hi>Church,</hi> That <hi>it is his</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 23.</note>
               <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides this, ſeveral of their own moſt learned <hi>Writers</hi> have freely acknowledged, that <hi>Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> can neither be directly proved, nor neceſſarily concluded from <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:151794:26"/>
But this the <hi>Writers</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> did never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerning the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appealed to the clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Teſtimonies of <hi>Scripture</hi> for the Proof of theſe <hi>Doctrines.</hi> And then the whole force of the Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to this, that if I am bound to believe what I am ſure God ſays, tho I cannot comprehend it; then I am bound by the ſame reaſon to believe the greateſt Abſurdity in the World, though I have no manner of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. And if this be their meaning, though we underſtand not <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> yet we very well underſtand what they would have, but cannot grant it; becauſe there is not equal reaſon to believe <hi>two</hi> things, for <hi>one</hi> of which there is good proof, and for the other no proof at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:151794:27"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> neither is there equal reaſon for the <hi>rejecting</hi> of theſe <hi>two Doctrines.</hi> This the Objection ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, which yet cannot be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but upon one or both of theſe two grounds: Either becauſe theſe two <hi>Doctrines</hi> are equally <hi>incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible,</hi> or becauſe they are equally loaded with <hi>Abſurdities</hi> and <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is no good ground of <hi>rejecting</hi> any <hi>Doctrine,</hi> merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>incomprehenſible;</hi> as I have abundantly ſhew'd already. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, there is a wide difference between plain matters of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and <hi>Myſteries</hi> concerning God; and it does by no means follow that, if a man do once admit any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God which he cannot <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,</hi> he hath no reaſon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to believe what he himſelf <hi>ſees.</hi> This is a moſt unreaſonable and deſtructive way of arguing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:151794:27"/>
it ſtrikes at the foundation of all Certainty, and ſets every man at liberty to deny the moſt plain and evident <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> if he may not be humor'd in having the abſurdeſt things in the World ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for true. The next ſtep will be to perſuade us that we may as well deny the Being of <hi>God</hi> becauſe his Nature is <hi>incomprehenſible</hi> by our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as deny <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> becauſe <hi>it evidently contradicts</hi> our <hi>Senſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> Nor are theſe <hi>two Doctrines</hi> loaded with the like <hi>Abſurdities</hi> and <hi>Contradictions:</hi> So far from this, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> as it is delivered in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and hath already been explained, hath no Abſurdity or Contradiction ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther involved in it, or neceſſarily conſequent upon it: But the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is big with all imaginable Abſurdity and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:151794:28"/>
Contradiction. And their own <hi>Schoolmen</hi> have ſufficiently expoſed it; eſpecially <hi>Scotus,</hi> and he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do ſo, as any man that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively reads him may plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: For in his <hi>Diſputation</hi> about it he treats this <hi>Doctrine</hi> with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt contempt, as a new Invention of the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> III. To the <hi>Decree</hi> of which <hi>Council</hi> concerning it he ſeems to pay a formal ſubmiſſion, but really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides it as contrary to the common <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of Mankind, and not at all ſupported by <hi>Scripture;</hi> as any one may eaſily diſcern that will carefully conſider his manner of handling it and the reſult of his whole <hi>Diſputation</hi> about it.</p>
            <p>And now Suppoſe there were ſome appearance of Abſurdity and Contradiction in the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> as it is delivered in <hi>Scripture,</hi> muſt we therefore believe a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:151794:28"/>
which is not at all revealed in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and which hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in it all the <hi>abſurdities</hi> in the World, and all the <hi>Contradictions</hi> to <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and which once admitted, doth at once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all Certainty, Yes, ſay they, why not? ſince we of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are ſatisfied that this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is revealed in <hi>Scripture;</hi> or, if it be not, is defined by the Church, which is every whit as good. But is this equal, to demand of us the belief of a thing which hath always been controverted, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between <hi>us</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> but even among themſelves, at leaſt till the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent?</hi> And this upon ſuch unreaſonable terms, that we muſt either yield this <hi>Point</hi> to them or elſe renounce a <hi>Doctrine</hi> agreed on both Sides to be revealed in <hi>Scripture.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:151794:29"/>
To ſhew the unreaſonableneſs of this proceeding, Let us ſuppoſe a <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Turk</hi> to the belief of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> and becauſe one kindneſs deſerves another, the <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Turk</hi> ſhould demand of him the belief of all the <hi>Fables</hi> in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> or in the <hi>Alchoran;</hi> ſince none of theſe, nor indeed all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are near ſo abſurd as <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation:</hi> Would not this be much more reaſonable and equal than what they demand of us? Since no Abſurdity, how monſtrous and big ſoever, can be thought of, which may not enter into an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in which a Breach hath been already made wide enough to admit <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> The Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> did not half ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be expoſed by the <hi>Prophet</hi> for their Superſtition and folly, as the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do

for this ſenſleſs and ſtupid <hi>Doctrine</hi> of theirs with a <hi>hard Name.</hi> I ſhall only add this one thing more, That if this Doctrine were poſſible to be true, and clearly prov'd to be ſo; yet it would be evidently uſeleſs and to no purpoſe. For it pretends to change the ſubſtance of one thing into the ſubſtance of another thing that is already and before this change is pretended to be made. But to what purpoſe? Not to make the <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt, for that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in Being; and the Subſtance of the <hi>Bread</hi> is loſt, nothing of it remaineth but the <hi>Accidents</hi> which are good for nothing, and indeed are nothing when the Subſtance is deſtroy'd and gone.</p>

               <hi>All that now remains is to make ſome</hi> practical Inferences <hi>from this</hi> Doctrine <hi>of the</hi> Unity <hi>of the</hi> Divine Nature. <hi>And they ſhall be the ſame</hi>

               <hi>which</hi> Text <hi>alſo is cited by our</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, Hear, O Iſrael, the Lord thy God is one Lord; and thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy ſtrength: And thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf. <hi>So that according to our</hi> Saviour <hi>the whole Duty of Man, the</hi> love of God <hi>and</hi> of our neighbour <hi>is founded in the</hi> Unity <hi>of the Divine</hi> Nature.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>love of God; The Lord thy God is One Lord,</hi> therefore <hi>thou ſhalt love Him with all thy heart, &amp;c. this is the firſt and great Commandment:</hi> And it comprehends in it all the <hi>Duties</hi> of the <hi>firſt Table</hi> as naturally flowing from it. As that we ſhould <hi>ſerve him only,</hi> and pay no <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi> to any but to <hi>Him.</hi> For to pay <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip</hi> to any thing is to make it <hi>a God</hi> and to acknowledge it for

ſuch: And therefore <hi>God</hi> being but <hi>One</hi> we can give <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi> to none but to <hi>Him</hi> only. And among all the parts of <hi>Religious Worſhip</hi> none is more peculiarly appropriated to the <hi>Deity</hi> than <hi>ſolemn Invocation</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi> For he to whom men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs their Requeſts, at all times, and in all places, muſt be ſuppoſed to be always every where preſent, to underſtand all our deſires and wants, and to be able to ſupply them; and this God only is, and can do.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe from the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> may be inferr'd, that we ſhould not worſhip God by any <hi>ſenſible Image</hi> or Repreſentation: Becauſe <hi>God</hi> being a <hi>ſingular Being</hi> there is nothing like <hi>Him,</hi> or that can without injuring and debaſing his moſt <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Being</hi> be compared to <hi>Him:</hi> As <hi>He</hi> himſelf ſpeaks in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>

II. The <hi>love</hi> likewiſe of our <hi>Neighbour</hi> is founded in the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd from it: <hi>Hear, O Iſrael, the Lord thy God is One Lord, therefore thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gives this reaſon why <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould be at unity among themſelves; <hi>There is One God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 6.</note>
               <hi>of all,</hi> and therefore we ſhould <hi>keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace,</hi> that is, live in mutual love and peace. The <hi>Prophet</hi> likewiſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns this reaſon why all Mankind ſhould be upon good terms with one another, and not be injurious one to another, <hi>Have we not all One Father?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And therefore when we ſee ſuch hatred and enmity among <hi>Men,</hi> ſuch diviſions and animoſities among <hi>Christians,</hi> we may not only ask
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:151794:32"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s queſtion, <hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi> that we cannot agree about ſerving him; either all to ſerve him in one way, or to bear with one another in our differences: I ſay we may not only ask St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s queſtion, <hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi> but may ask further, <hi>Is God divided?</hi> Is there not <hi>One</hi> God, and are we not all his Offspring? Are we not all the Sons of <hi>Adam, who was the Son of God?</hi> So that if we trace our ſelves to our <hi>Original,</hi> we ſhall find a great nearneſs and equality among men: And this equality that we are all God's <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and <hi>Image,</hi> and that the <hi>One only God</hi> is the <hi>Father of us all,</hi> is a more real ground of mutual <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> in our dealings one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, than any of thoſe petty diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and diſtinctions of <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>weak,</hi> of <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> of <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,</hi> of <hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>honourable,</hi> can be to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men to any thing of <hi>inſolence,</hi>

               <hi>injustice,</hi> and <hi>inequality of dealing</hi> one towards another.

            <p>Thus much may ſuffice to have ſpoken concerning the <hi>first Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the <hi>Text, There is one God:</hi> To <hi>Him, Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>H. Ghost</hi> be all Honour and Glory, Dominion and Power, now and for ever.</p>
