         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He great Enemy of Truth, the Devil, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that in theſe Times of Light and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, he could no longer detain men in the erronious and ſuperſtitious uſe of Ordinances, as heretofore; now labours by all means to perſwade them, either that they have no need of Ordinances at all, or elſe that there is now none to be found who are in a capacity to Adminiſter them. It is true, the Devil for the moſt part deals more ſubtilly then at firſt daſh to perſwade men that they are above, or have no need of Ordinances, but firſt hee labours to ſtumble them about an Adminiſtrator, by which means he prevails with them, firſt to ſuſpend the uſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and ſo gains a great advantage thereby, to perſwade them after a while that there is no need for them now to live any longer under Ordinances. A deviſe by which he hath
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48350:3"/>
brought them into a greater errour, they having recovered themſelves out of that which was leſs: for by perſwading men to caſt off Ordinances, he hath quickly drawn very many to caſt off all Religion; theſe times furniſhing us with too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances, not only of ſuch who having ſuſpended the uſe of Ordinances ſo long upon the ſcruple about an Adminiſtrator as till they are grown from perſons of an excellent ſavour in things of the Goſpel, to be as dry as a chip, but alſo of ſuch who having firſt laid the foundation of their Apoſtacy in their ſcrupeling an Adminiſtrator, have proceeded by degrees ſo far as to loſe all Religion, and to fall into all looſneſs and prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Wherefore to check this growing evill, and out of tender compaſſion to thoſe who I apparently perceive to be in this ſnare of the Devill, I ſhall in the enſuing Diſcourſe offer that which I hope, through the bleſſing of God, may be found ſufficient to role this great ſtumbling block out of the way of as many as ſhall impartialy weigh the ſame.</p>

               <p>And for a Ground-work whereon to proceed, I ſhall lay down that Propheſie of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 18.18. as applyed by <hi>Peter</hi> unto the perſon of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. <hi>Moſes truly ſaid unto the Fathers, a Prophet ſhal the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your brethren, like unto me, him ſhal ye hear in all things whatſoever he ſhal ſay unto you.</hi> Chriſt is ſaid to be a Prophet like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> in that he is the Prophet of the New Teſtament, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Prophet of the Old. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo a Prophet of the Old Teſtament, as that by him the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> received from God, ſuch ſtanding Laws, as by which they were to be ſteered both in matters of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and of converſation otherwiſe, throughout their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, until the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh: Therefore <hi>the Law is ſaid to be a Schoolmaſter untill Christ, Gal.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 16.16. In like manner, Chriſt as the Prophet of the New Teſtament, hath delivered and given forth ſuch Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, Rules, and Precepts, as by which all men, eſpecially thoſe of his houſhold, are to be ordered in point of Faith, Worſhip, Ordinances, and all manner of converſation, from the time of his leaving the world, unto the time of his return

or viſible appearance in the clouds of heaven. In which reſpect Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>be Faithful in his houſe, as Moſes was in his, Heb.</hi> 3.2. And now <hi>all Nations</hi> are to be <hi>taught to obſerve all things whatſoever he hath Commanded, unto the end of the world, Mat.</hi> 28.20.</p>

               <p>If then Chriſt be thus a Prophet like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> then it follows, That as thoſe who lived under the Miniſtration of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were to hear him in all things he delivered to them from God, ſo thoſe that now live under the Miniſtration of Chriſt, are to hear and obey him in all his ſayings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. and 17.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22. <hi>And if they eſcaped not who refuſed Moſes that ſpake on earth, how ſhal they eſcape which ſhall refuſe Chriſt which ſpeaketh from heaven?

               <p>Neither is that like to prove a ſhield and Buckler to defend them here from, which yet ſome take hold on for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That water Baptiſm (to touch that a little) was Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, and continued in force but only under the Miniſtery of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and if uſed afterwards, it was but arbitrarily as circumciſion was.</p>
               <p>For the Miniſtry of <hi>John</hi> and ſo his Baptiſm, was not Legal but Evangelicall, in which reſpect it is called <hi>The begining of the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> Mark 1, 2, 3, 4. And the date of the miniſtration of the law and the Prophets, was until <hi>Iohns</hi> miniſtry began, not ended; for when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>the law and the Prophets were until Iohn, and that ſince that time</hi> (ſpeaking of a time already paſt) <hi>the Kingdom of God is preached, and every man preſſeth into it,</hi> (as they did to the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.16. I ſay when Chriſt ſpake theſe words, referring unto a time paſt, <hi>Iohns</hi> miniſtry was not as yet finiſhed, he being then alive, as you may perceive plainly if you read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. from Verſ. 2. to Verſ. 13. and therefore thoſe words <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTIL Iohn,</hi> cannot refer unto the ending, but unto the beginning of <hi>Iohns</hi> Miniſtry: Which is alſo yet more manifeſt, in that Chriſt ſaid, even while <hi>Iohn</hi> and his Miniſtry were yet in being, Mat. 11.12. <hi>From the days of Iohn the Baptiſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTIL NOW, The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by fore</hi>: which words from the days of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt until now, could not be ſpoken of the ending of <hi>Iohns</hi> Miniſtry, becauſe when this was ſaid his Miniſtry was yet on foot as appears V. 2. So that cleerly, <hi>Iohns</hi> preaching the Baptiſm of repentance for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, was the preaching of the Kingdom of God, to wit, the Goſpel of the Kingdom, as that which is diſtinguiſhed from the Miniſtration of the Law and Prophets, and therefore not legal but Evangelical.</p>
               <p>Beſides, (to ſhew yet further that water Baptiſm was not limited unto <hi>Iohns</hi> Miniſtry) <hi>Iohns</hi> Miniſtry was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within the Territories of <hi>Canaan</hi> (or rather <hi>Judea</hi>) as was alſo that of the Apoſtles, till after the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5. whereas, after the Reſurrection of the Lord, and immediately before his Aſcention, Chriſt gave
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48350:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
commiſſion to his Apoſtles to teach and baptize all Nations, in the doing of which as of other his commands; he promiſeth his preſence with them to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.20. which clearly ſhews that Baptiſm was not confined to <hi>Iohns</hi> Miniſtry.</p>
            </div>

               <p>But if they ſay, thats not water Baptiſm, but the Baptiſm of the ſpirit, of which Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.20. (which yet is too unreaſonable to affirm) yet the practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles acting upon this commiſſion, will evince that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it otherwiſe. For ſurely when <hi>Peter</hi> exhorted the <hi>Iews</hi> to <hi>repent and be baptized, for the remiſſion of ſins, Act.</hi> 2.38. he did not perſwade them to be baptized with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for the remiſſion of ſins, becauſe the Baptiſm of which he there ſpeaks, he perſwades them to uſe in order to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the ſpirit, as it there follows: <hi>Repent and be baptized,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And thoſe that will conſtrue the baptiſm here ſpoken of, of the Baptiſm of the Spirit, take courſe to render the Apoſtle to ſpeak as little ſence, as they do truth, as will appear if you read the words according to their interpretation, thus, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, and ye ſhal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

               <p>And whereas the <hi>Eunuch</hi> deſired <hi>Philip</hi> to baptize him in water, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36. will not every man conclude that <hi>Philip,</hi> in preaching the Goſpel to him, had convinced him of it as a Chriſtian duty? how, or why elſe ſhould he deſire Baptiſm up on <hi>Philips</hi> preaching? Beſides, when <hi>Philips</hi> anſwer to his deſire of being Baptized runs thus; <hi>If thou beleeveſt withall thine heart, thou mayeſt,</hi> does it not cleerly imply, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter baptiſm is a priviledge peculiar to Beleevers? for if it had been then to be uſed only as a thing indifferent, as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe circumciſſion was, it might have been lawful for him to have been baptized, whether he had beleeved or no, unleſs we will ſuppoſe that his not beleeving would have made an indifferent and lawful thing to become unlawful to him.</p>
               <p>Nor can it reaſonably be thought that the men and women of <hi>Samaria,</hi> deluded till then by <hi>Symon</hi> the Sorcerer, would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48350:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have been baptized by <hi>Philip</hi>; but that they were by his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced that it was their duty ſo to be, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.11.12. Nor will any I hope be ſo unreaſonable, as to ſay this was the Baptiſm of the Spirit, ſince in the 15.16. verſe, this Baptiſm is cleerly diſtinguiſhed from that of the Spirit: <hi>For the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was fallen upon none of them, only they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Ieſus.</hi> So that this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm went before their receiving the Spirit, and therefore could not be their being baptized with the Spirit. And when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſaid concerning <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company, <hi>Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Holy Ghoſt as well as we, Acts</hi> 10.47. and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, <hi>commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord Ieſus, Verſe</hi> 48. Will any imagine that <hi>Peters</hi> commanding them to be baptized, was beſide the buſineſs for which he was ſent thither of God, and not in direct purſuance of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion? or that mens having the Spirit, though in an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent degree, as they had, is any excuſe from water Baptiſm? or that it was a thing indifferent to be baptized or not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? eſpecially conſidering that the Angel had told <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould <hi>tell him what he G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHT to do, Act.</hi> 10.6. and <hi>declare to him words, by which he and all his ſhould be ſaved, Acts</hi> 11.14. And <hi>Cornelius</hi> his expectation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, was not to hear from him things which might be done, or let alone; but ſuch things as were commanded him of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.33. And doubtleſs when <hi>Peter</hi> commanded <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> to be baptized in the Name of the Lord, <hi>Cornelius</hi> had reaſon to conclude, that this, as well as any thing elſe, was that which he ought to do, and that thoſe Words as well as others, were Words by which he ſhould be ſaved, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Item before given him by the Angel. Or can it enter into the heart of any Chriſtian to think, that the holy Apoſtle would be ſo prophane as to command and cauſe a thing to be acted and done in the Name of the Lord, which the Lord had not commanded? All which conſidered, what is more plain, then that water Baptiſm was no indifferent thing; but the expreſs Will of God, even after ſuch time as the miniſtry of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt was at an end?</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2.

Whereas when the ſame thing was deſired in the behalf of <hi>Titus,</hi> the Apoſtle would by no means conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, for as much as he was a <hi>Greek</hi>; the Apoſtle aleadging that as a reaſon of his refuſal, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.3. And further, tels the Gentiles, that <hi>if they were circumciſed, Chriſt ſhould profit them nothing, Gal.</hi> 5.2. And the decree of the Apoſtles, was expreſs herein, (when ſome would have had the beleeving <hi>Gentiles</hi> circumciſed) that <hi>thoſe among the Gentiles that were turned to God, ſhould not be troubled</hi> with any the Jewes cuſtomes, but onely that they ſhould abſtain from things ſtrangled and from blood <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 15.19.20 with v. 28.29 But now water baptiſm was uſed among the beleeving Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as well as the beleeving Jews, all along, as well after this decree of the Apoſtles, as before, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.15.33. and 18.8. which clearly evinceth the baptiſm we ſpeak of, to be no Jewiſh rite as is pretended, nor yet to be practiſed upon like terms as circumciſion was in the Apoſtles days.</p>

               <p>To thoſe that lay aſide not onely baptiſm, but other ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances alſo as things fleſhly, I ſhall in ſhort ſay but this to convince them, that thoſe notions which lead them to this,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48350:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
proceed not from the holy ſpirit, but from the foul ſpirit the Devil.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord Jeſus himſelf, whoſe meaſure of the ſpirit was greater then any mans, and the Apoſtles and other Saints in their times, whoſe meaſure of the ſpirit were greater then any in theſe times can reaſonably pretend to, in that they did ſuch works then, as none now can do, yet they were guided by the holy ſpirit to uſe, and to enjoyn others to uſe water baptiſm, the word, breaking of bread and prayer as the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the new Teſtament doth abundantly witneſs. And therefore for thoſe that have not ſo much of the ſpirit, yet to conceit themſelves to be elivated higher in the ſpirit, and to be carryed above thoſe forms which thoſe that had more of the ſpirit were directed to uſe, is ſuch an immagination, as may be ſenſibly felt to be a deluſion of the Devil, and not any inſpiration of the Spirit of God. Thoſe in the Apoſtles days who ſeparated themſelves from the Churches of Chriſt, and communion with them in ordinances of the Goſpel, though probably upon the ſame pretences with m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n of like ſeparation in our times, are charractorized by the Apoſtle, to be <hi>ſenſual, not having the ſpirit, Jud.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Therefore ſecondly, what ever is meant by mens <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt not after the fleſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. or by other Scriptures of like import: moſt certain it is that this is not the meaning of them, that men ſhould not know Chriſt in Ordinances, becauſe the Apoſtles themſelves knew Chriſt in theſe, and had communion with him, and with his Saints in theſe, yea and it was their buſineſs to perſwade others here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: and I hope no man will think that the ſpirit inſpired them to ſpeak contradictions: <hi>For as God is true</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>our word toward you was not yea and nay,</hi> 2. Cor. 1.18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Appoſtle oppoſeth the ſpirit unto the letter, in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. he doth no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48350:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cry down Goſpel Ordinances, as being but the letter, when as indeed the Apoſtle doth oppoſe the whole Goſpel miniſtration (which as to the external part, is made up of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances) as being ſpiritual, unto that of the law which was but litteral. And the reaſon why the Ordinances of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are ſaid to be ſpiritual, and thoſe of the law but litteral, You may underſtand by the ſequel of the Apoſtles diſcourſe, in this Chapter, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the end and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual meaning of the Ordinances of the Law, was little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood or diſcerned; but was vailed and hid under thoſe ſhaddows, ſo that as he ſays, Verſe 13. <hi>The children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael could not ſtedfaſtly look to the end of thoſe things, which now are aboliſhed:</hi> Whereas the end, ſcope, ſpirit, and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Goſpel Ordinances, is plainly revealed, and may cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſcerned; and therefore the Apoſtle by way of magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the miniſtration of the Goſpel above that of the Law, ſaith, Verſe 12.13. <hi>We uſe great plainneſs of ſpeech, and not as Moſes, who put a vail over his face,</hi> &amp;c. and again, verſ. 18. <hi>We all with open face, behold as in a glaſſe, the glory of the Lord.</hi> And therefore it is doubtleſs in reſpect of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that the Goſpel miniſtration (the outward part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of conſiſts in Ordinances) is in other Scriptures, as ſpiritual, oppoſed to the ordinances of the Law as things fleſhly. Gal. 3.3 <hi>Are ye ſo fooliſh, having began in the ſpirit, are ye now made perfect by the fleſh?</hi> Their folly was this, for which he chids them; In that they having firſt embraced the Doctrine and Ordinance of the Goſpel, by which <hi>Chriſt had before their eyes been evidently ſet forth, as crucified among them, Verſe</hi> 1. and by which they had <hi>received the ſpirit, verſ.</hi> 2. yet were ſo weak as to think to better their condition at laſt, by taking up the Ordinance of the Law, which in compariſon of thoſe of the Goſpel which they had already received, were but <hi>weak and beggerly elements, Chap.</hi> 4.9. Moſt evident it is, that thoſe <hi>Galatians</hi> began their Chriſtianity in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving the Goſpel, and putting on Chriſt in baptiſm Chap. 3.26.27. which here in Chap. 3. verſ. 3. the Apoſtle calls their <hi>having began in the ſpirit.</hi> If ſo, then certainly they are not of the Apoſtles mind, who deem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> water Baptiſm to be but fleſhly.</p>
               <p>If then the Ordinances of the Goſpel, as a great part of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48350:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Goſpel Miniſtration, be ſpiritual, and in Scripture oppoſed to carnal ordinances, as we ſee they are, then moſt manifeſt it is, that thoſe poor ſouls, whom the Devil hath ſo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guild, as to conceit themſelves ſo ſpiritual and ſubline, as to be above ordinances, are indeed, and in truth, ſo poor, low, as and carnal, to be groſly ignorant of the mind of God, thus plainly laid down in Scripture.</p>

               <p>That the Prophets themſelves, though men of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſpiration, when they found the <hi>Iews</hi> to have corrupted themſelves and the worſhip of God, did ſtill call upon them to reform, according to the written Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that good men did reform accordingly, will appear by theſe and the like Scriptures, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.13. and 18.6. and 23.25. <hi>Neh.</hi> 10.29.

Therefore, ſuppoſe it were granted, that all right ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Goſpel Ordinances, did totally ceaſe during the time that Papal darkneſſe over ſpread the world; yet this upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, would put men but in like conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the people of God the <hi>Jews,</hi> during the time of their captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> in which the Temple lay waſte, the dayly ſacrifice ceaſed, and all uſe of publike worſhip was cut off, and yet when God gave them the oppertunity by bringing them out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they preſently fell to reſtore the uſe of decayed Ordinances, though Prophets extraordinarily inſpired by God to direct them, were altogether wanting.

that after they had begun, and did again deſiſt from the work the Lord raiſed up two Prophets, <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zachary,</hi> to reprove them, for that they had let their hands ſlick from the work, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.1. to 12. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.1.

A concluſion to which that of the Apoſtle ſeems to add much ſtrength, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.12.13.

and that <hi>he knew but in part,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. and if not he much leſſe the Saints that have lived ſince him in times of degeneration.

               <p>There was a people in the darkeſt times of Popery, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves againſt the corruptions of the times, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſtinguiſhed by the names of <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and <hi>Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and <hi>Lioniſts.</hi> For their qualifications, a certain Frier ſaith thus of them: <hi>That men and woman little and great day and night ceaſe not to learn and to teach, and that divers of them could perfectly deliver all the New Teſtament: a man ſaith he, would not hurt his enemy, if he ſhould meet him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way accompanied with one of theſe Hereticks.</hi> They were ſaid to be <hi>modeſt, ſimple, medling little with bargains, to avoid lying and deceit, living upon their labour, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a little chaſt, ſober, and inviting others by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to every good thing.</hi>

For firſt <hi>Bernard,</hi> who is reported to have lived about the year 1002. which was 250. years before the foreſaid Frier wrote, this <hi>Bernard</hi> in his 65 Sermon on <hi>Cant. pag.</hi> 144. as Mr. <hi>Blackwood</hi> in his ſtorming of Antichriſt <hi>pag.</hi> 31. but as quoted by Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> in his 66 Sermon, hath this complaint againſt this people. <hi>They laugh at us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe we baptize infants, becauſe we pray for the dead, becauſe we require the prayers of Saints, &amp;c.</hi> by which it appears they held the baptizing of infants ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>

               <p>Secondly, It may further appear that this people, or at leaſt many among them, were called <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> becauſe when <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> riſe up in their times, they bitterly inveigh againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> as well as the Papiſts, as their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings do abundantly declare, by which it appears that they in their times found ſuch a people in being as well as Papiſts.

and largely propagated,</hi> pag. 565. And Hiſtory alſo relates, how the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> ſpread themſelves into the Netherlands, and as it ſeems from thence into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> For as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> relates in his Acts and Monuments, <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 95. in King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. time, there were two and twenty Dutchmen Anabaptiſts apprehended, and about ten of them put to death, in the year 1535. Since which time there hath remained in the Low Countries or <hi>England,</hi> or both, of the ſame race unto this every day.</p>
               <p>If then this kind of people by Adverſaries own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, did continue from the Apoſtles days, and that their prints and footſteps are to be diſcerned throughout all Hiſtories till <hi>Luther</hi>'s time, and ſo downwards, why ſhould any man be tender of being confident, (eſpecially having thoſe Scriptures of <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Epk.</hi> 4.12, 13. to back him) that there hath a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive line of true Churches and true Goſpel Adminiſtrators, run along throughout all ages, from the Apoſtles times to this day?</p>

               <p>Thirdly, Though it ſhould be granted (which yet may not) that the line of ſucceſſion both of duly conſtituted Churches, and of all due adminiſtrators of Goſpel Ordinances, had been cut off by the prevailings of Apoſtacy in times of Popery, yet it would not hence follow that there neither is nor can be now, true Churches or right Adminiſtrators of Ordinances, becauſe we have upon the matter, and in ſubſtance and effect, the ſame apoſtolical power now amongſt us, to plant and ſettle churches, &amp; to adminiſter Ordinances, as was injoied in the Apoſtles days.</p>
               <p>The ground upon which I build this aſſertion is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe we have the ſame inſtructions and directions from the Apoſtles in their writings, about things of this nature, as they had who lived in the Apoſtles times.

In this Text there are two things chiefly to be obſerved to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>1. That the Apoſtles inſtructed or taught men about the uſe of Ordinances, as well by their Epiſtles, as by word of mouth. 2. That men were to uſe, practice and keep thoſe Ordinances they had been taught by the Apoſtles writings, as well as when they had been taught the ſame by word of mouth: their writings did as well authoriſe, yea oblige them to hold faſt (to wit in uſe and practiſe) the Ordinances they had been taught there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as any other way of teaching uſed by the Apoſtles.</p>

               <p>Neither did the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles (if any ſhould make a doubt of this. (So appropriately belong to thoſe to whom firſt and immediately they were directed, but that they alſo were intended for the good of all that call on the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for ſo the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1.2. ſhews, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directed as <hi>well to all thoſe which in every place cal on the name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as unto them. For ſo the words run: <hi>Paul called to be an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt through the will of God, and Softhenes our brother, unto the Church of God, which is at</hi> Corinth, <hi>to them that are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be Saints, WITH ALL THAT IN EVERY PLACE call upon the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt both theirs and ours.</hi> So that if we or any others in any place of the world, call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt, this Epiſtle as well belongs to us, as it did unto the Corinthians in like caſes. Beſides many of the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles are called general Epiſtles, as being intended indefinitely to all whom they might concern: ſo the 1 and 2 Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epiſt. <hi>John,</hi> and the Epiſt. of <hi>Jude:</hi> and the 7 Epiſt. to the 7 Churches in <hi>Aſia</hi> though immediately directed to them, yet even every one that hath an ear to hear is to hearken what the ſpirit ſaith unto the Churches, as you have it in the cloſe of every Epiſtle, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.7.11.17.29. &amp; 3.6.13.23.

               <p>And becauſe the knowledge and beleef hereof is of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign uſe to cure that infirmity which troubles many, and keeps them out of the way of Jeſus Chriſt, and to reſolve the main doubt, therefore I ſhall yet make this further manifeſt by what follows.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Then ſince Chriſt Jeſus is the Prophet of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was of the old (as hath been oft-minded) it will not be amiſſe to ſhew, that <hi>Moſes</hi> by his writings was a Miniſter to the Jews, as well when he was dead, as while he was alive, <hi>John</hi> 5.45. <hi>There is one that accuſes you, even</hi> Moſes <hi>in whom ye trust, ſaith Christ to the Jews,</hi> in that the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> which they had in writing did accuſe them, <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf is ſaid to accuſe them. Again <hi>ver.</hi> 46, 47. <hi>For had ye beleeved</hi> Moſes, <hi>ye would have beleeved me, for he wrote of me, but if ye beleeve not his writings, how ſhall ye beleeve my words</hi>? Where we ſee 1. That to beleeve <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to beleeve the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> in his writings is the ſame thing. And 2. That Chriſt held it altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that thoſe that would not beleeve and obey thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Doctrine whilſt commended to them in the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhould ever beleeve and obey Chriſt himſelf teaching the ſame things. And by rule of proportion it holds well, that if thoſe that would not beleeve <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve Chriſts words, he ſpeaking and <hi>Moſes</hi> writing the ſame thing, neither would they beleeve and obey the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or men of like qualifications, if they ſhould come again amongſt us, who now will not obey thoſe Doctrines rules and precepts, which they have left us in writing. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to agrees that alſo <hi>Luke</hi> 16.31. <hi>If they heare not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded though one roſe from the dead.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 21.21. <hi>They are informed of thee, that thou teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all the Jews which are among the Gentiles, to forſake</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>ſaying, that they ought not to circumciſe their children and to walk after the cuſtomes.</hi> Where likewiſe we ſee, that to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is to forſake <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> 16.13. They are ſaid to have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, when yet they had but their writings; ſo that to forſake <hi>Moſes</hi> and to forſake his Doctrine, and to have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and to have their Doctrine in writing, is in Scripture language and account the ſame thing in effect and ſubſtance. And there is altogether the ſame reaſon, why to have the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, and to have their Doctrine in writing, to forſake the one, and to forſake the other, ſhould be ſubſtantially the ſame thing. And let every man be ſure of this,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that if Chriſt Jeſus at his firſt comming did interpret mens neglect of <hi>Moſes</hi> in his writings, to be an neglect of <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Miniſtry, that he likewiſe at his ſecond comming, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count mens neglect to obſerve his Ordinances and wayes deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us in the writings of his Apoſtles, to be an neglect of the Apoſtles miniſtry, yea of Chriſt himſelf, whoſe Embaſſadours they are to the world, and to the Saints, as well by writing as ſpeaking, as I ſhall ſhew further by and by.</p>

Here the Apoſtle makes all mens beleeving the Goſpel to depend upon the Apoſtles preaching of it; I ſay, upon the Apoſtles preaching of it. For when he ſaies, how can they preach except they be ſent, he ſpeaks of thoſe that were firſt ſent to preach the Goſpel, to wit the Apoſtles, who indeed could never have found out nor have preached ſuch a Doctrine to the world, as the Goſpel is, had they not been ſent on this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, had they not been indued with power from on high wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to do it: the Apoſtle denies any ſuch ſufficiency to be of themſelves, and aſcribes it wholly unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p>That the ſending here ſpoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. is Chriſts ſending his Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel, will further appear, if you compare the effects with their cauſes, as here ſet down in order by the Apoſtle. <hi>How can they</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>beleeve in him of whom they have not heard?</hi> That's a principle in reaſon, that a man cannot beleeve that, of which he hath never heard. <hi>And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher</hi>? Here's another thing as manifeſt in reaſon, (for which cauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle makes themſelves Judges in the caſe) a man cannot hear that of which no report hath been given, or of which no Declaration hath been made. <hi>And how ſhall they preach ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be ſent</hi>? that is how ſhould any man at the firſt have divulged the Goſpel and Doctrine of ſalvation; had he not firſt been taught it of God, and impowered with knowledge and utterance from him, wherewith to preach it? which was the Apoſtles caſe. And that the preaching and ſending here ſpoken of, is the preaching and ſending of the Apoſtles, appears yet further by the 18. <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſame <hi>chap.</hi> where having continued his diſcourſe of the hearers and preachers, of which he had ſpoken three verſes before; <hi>ver.</hi> 14.15. he here ſaith of the ſame Preachers, that <hi>their ſound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world</hi>; which all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be ſpoken of the Apoſtles.</p>

               <p>Which thing <hi>viz,</hi> that the Apoſtles Miniſtry extends as far as their Doctrine, may be further illuſtrated and confirmed thus. The Apoſtles Commiſſion was to <hi>preach the Goſpel to every Creature in all the world.</hi> Mark. 16.15. and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> whileſt he was yet living, affirmed that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it had been preached to <hi>every creature under Heaven,</hi> Col. 1.23. But how did twelve Apoſtles think we in their own perſons carry the Goſpel to every man and woman under Heaven? Why ſurely no, that is not lightly imaginable. They indeed firſt ſet it on broach in the Nations, but there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others who were inſtrumental to hand it up and down the world. Many of whom the Apoſtle upon that account calls <hi>Fellow-labourers, Fellow-helpers,</hi> and <hi>Fellow-workers,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them both of men and women, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.3.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Philem.</hi> 1.24. It was indeed the Apoſtles <hi>ſound that went into all the earth,</hi> and they were their words that went to the ends of the world, Rom. 10.18. they made the whole world to ring with their Doctrine, but yet the Beleevers which were alſo made ſuch by their preaching, helped to carry this ſound from one place to another, till it had filled the world. In which work the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers at <hi>Rome</hi> had not the leaſt ſhare, they having a greater advantage and opportunity this way then many others, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the place of their abode was, in the Metropolitan City of the world, where the Emperour thereof had his ſeat and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, whither and from whence upon that account men had recourſe from, and to all parts of the known world, whither the influence of the Imperial Government did extend, and by that means the ſame of the faith of the Goſpel profeſſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> went out into all the world, as the Apoſtle informs us,

               <p>But whoever were the immediate inſtruments, the Apoſtles themſelves were the original miniſters, even to all that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

For when Chriſt ſaith (ſpeaking of his Apoſtles) <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall beleeve on me through their word,</hi> he plainly implies, that all that ever ſhould thereafter beleeve, ſhould beleeve through their word, unleſſe we will ſuppoſe that Chriſt did not pray for all Beleevers. In which reſpect likewiſe I conceive Chriſt promiſeth his Apoſtles to be preſent with them, to wit in their miniſtry, unto the end of the world <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. which alſo ſhews, that their Miniſtry in their Doctrine, ſhould continue even unto the end of the world.</p>
               <p>If then the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles be of the ſame extent with their Doctrine, and that the one is as broad and as long as the other, and that whomſoever the one reaches, the other reaches <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

the Apoſtles Doctrinal inſtructions about matters of ſalvation, worſhip, adminiſtration of Ordinances and the like, did not depend upon the Apoſtles themſelves; as they were ſuch and ſuch men, but upon the will, pleaſure, and Grace of God which was indeed made known by them. For which cauſe the Apoſtles frequently labour to carry mens thoughts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations off from themſelves, as touching the import, energie, operation and vertue of the things miniſtred by them, and to charge the ſame wholly upon God; that is upon his will and appointment, and the influence of his power and grace, as concurrent with his own appointments, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. <hi>So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither is he that water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but God that giveth the increaſe.</hi> Though <hi>Paul</hi> plant and <hi>Apollo</hi> water, yet the effects which the Goſpel doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in men, depend no more upon <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> then the increaſe of the ſeed depends upon the hand of him that plants or waters it, which by the bleſſing of God is wont to grow and increaſe by what hand ſoever planted and watered.</p>

This being ſo, it follows that we having the ſame will of God now made known to us by the writings of the Apoſtles, by which men were directed, authorized and warranted to beleeve be baptized, gather into Churches, and to hold communion in all Ordinances in the Apoſtles days, that therefore we alſo are every whit as well authorized and required to repent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, be baptized, unite in Church bodies, hold communion in all Ordinances of the Goſpel as they were, for the will of God which is the ground and foundation of all, is the ſame, whether it be expreſſed by ſpeaking or writing.

               <p>What hath been ſaid already touching the preſence of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical miniſtry among us, and the validity of their writings as being equivolent with their perſonal ſpeaking, to authoriſe men in the uſe and adminiſtration of Ordinances, may I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe abundantly ſatisfie any that are deſirous of ſatisfaction, touching an Adminiſtrator, and mens power of adminiſtring baptiſm now in theſe daies; yet becauſe men might in this kind have good meaſure, heaped up, preſſed down, and running o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into their boſoms, I ſhall ſpeak yet ſomething further to that particular caſe.</p>
               <p>The queſtion is, what power any man hath in theſe days to adminiſter Baptiſm?</p>
               <p>The anſwer is, even the very ſame that thoſe men had, whom the Apoſtles in their time did put upon this work. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof is becauſe the power of appointing men then to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter baptiſm, was not Arbitrary, or in the liberty of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles own wills, for they were but inſtruments and miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt to declare, who and what manner of perſons he would have imployed therein; but it was the will of God (when known) whoſe work it is, that did impower men to adminiſter Baptiſm. This was proved above in Section 27. not onely in relation to this particular adminiſtration, but all others alſo. And the very truth is, the whole power of adminiſtration of any of the things of the Goſpel, not onely by men of a lower rank and degree, but even by the Apoſtles themſelves, yea which is more, even by Chriſt himſelf is charged upon the will of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Col,</hi> 1.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.1. <hi>John</hi> 6.38. and 12.49. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2.</p>
               <p>Now look then what manner of perſons ſtand declared in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, as allowed by God in the Apoſtles dayes, as meet for this work of baptizing, the

               <p>But now the Scripture is expreſſe, that this work of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, was not reſtrained or tied to the Apoſtles as ſuch, but might be done, as uſually it was by the Diſciples, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. <hi>For Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel.</hi> The meaning is not that Chriſt did not in his Commiſſion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point <hi>Paul</hi> to preach Baptiſm, to preſſe and perſwade men upon their repentance to be baptized (as <hi>Peter</hi> did, whoſe Commiſſion was the ſame, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38.) for this being one of the beginning Doctrines of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. could not be left out of the Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. Nor is this the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as if Chriſt had not impowered him to baptize when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion was, for he confeſſes that he did baptize <hi>Crispus</hi> and <hi>Gaius,</hi> and the <hi>houſhold of Stephanus</hi> among theſe Corinthians, ver 14.16. But his meaning is, when he ſaies Chriſt had not ſent him to baptize, that Chriſt had not impoſed any ſuch thing upon him, as that he ſhould himſelf, and with his own hands baptize all thoſe that he converted to the faith, but this was ſuch a work as in which other common Diſciples might eaſe <hi>Paul.</hi> So that though <hi>Paul</hi> begot them all to the faith by the Goſpel, chap. 4.15. and though they were all of them baptized, as appears chap. 1.13. and 12.13. yet as he declares he baptized but few of them himſel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And it ſhould ſeem by this of <hi>Paul</hi> and that of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10.48. (who is ſaid to have commanded <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his, to be baptized that it was an uſual thing with Apoſtles to leave the adminiſtration of Baptiſm to Diſciples. Chriſt alſo who was never backward in any thing that was neceſſary for him to do, left this work of baptizing to his Diſciples and followers, <hi>John</hi> 4 1, 2. <hi>Jeſus made and baptized more Diſciples then</hi> John, <hi>though Jeſus himſelf baptized not, but his Diſciples,</hi> [what a Diſciple is, ſee <hi>Jon.</hi> 8.31.] By which it appears to be a work rather belonging to followers then to leaders.

And whereas three thouſand were baptized, and added unto the Church in one day, yea in leſſe then a day ſince it was the third hour, when <hi>Peter</hi> began his ſermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.15. its no wiſe likely, but that many of the hundred and twenty Diſciples that till then had kept together, were imployed thereabout, otherwiſe its not like, ſo much work could be done in ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, but by many hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41.</p>
               <p>If then Beleevers or men-Diſciples as ſuch, are ſufficient admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators of water Baptiſm in Scripture account, as by what hath been ſaid may appear, then for as much as that through the Grace of God, there are many ſuch among us now in theſe days, no man need to keep out of this Goſpel way, for want of a fit adminiſtrator.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To this I anſwer, 1. I cannot ſay that the Apoſtles did ſet any to baptize others, who were not firſt baptized themſelves, neither is it likely they did, there being no ſuch need, ſeeing there were other enough in that capacity to do it: yet this I may ſay, though we find Baptiſm preſſed on men as a duty, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>and</hi> 10.48. yet we do not find that they were injoined to be baptized by men ſo and ſo qualified, but onely indefinitely to be baptized, by which, we may gather that the care of being baptized, is a matter of greater conſequence, then what manner of adminiſtrator ſhould do it.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt queſtionleſſe did adminiſter baptiſm, while he himſelf was yet unbaptized, for if he were the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of erecting that Ordinance, then of neceſſity he muſt baptize ſomebody before he himſelf could be baptized, which ſhews, that under ſome circumſtances it is not unlawful for one to be baptized, by one that is himſelf unbaptized, <hi>viz.</hi> where it appears to be the Will of God that Baptiſm ſhould be received, and yet none willing to adminiſter it, but he who is not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48350:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unto its primitive uſe and purity, there would be the ſame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for ſome one to renew this adminiſtration who is not baptized, as was at the firſt to begin it.</p>

with power from on high, as were the Apoſtles, and could ſpeak by immediate revelation of the ſpirit as they did, I ſhall here inſert one word from the Scriptures to prove the contrary. It doth ſufficiently appear, that even in the Apoſtles days, whileſt yet extraordinary gifts were abroad, men might propheſie, who yet could not ſpeak by any ſuch immediate and infallible revelation of the ſpirit as the Apoſtles did.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Apoſtle cautions thoſe that propheſied in the Church at <hi>Rome, to propheſie according to the proportion of faith, Rom.</hi> 12 6. that is, either according to the rule of faith, or according to that meaſure of faith and knowledge, which they had attained in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, which caution were needleſſe, if they had propheſied according to the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate dictates of the ſpirit, as they did who ſpeak as the ſpirit gave them utterance; for then they could not be in danger of erring in their prophecying, becauſe propheſie in this kind, <hi>came not at any time by, or according to the will of man, but holy men of God, ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> hath it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Yea if any had the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of propheſie in this ſence, they could not, though they had a deſire to ſpeak otherwiſe then the ſpirit moved them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the caſe of <hi>Baalam,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>if Balak would give me his houſe full of Silver and Gold, I cannot go beyond the Commandement of the Lord, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the Lord ſaith, that will I speak, Num.</hi> 24 13. And it is not unlike but that the extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſometimes ſpake things by the guidance of the ſpirit, which they themſelves underſtood not; <hi>I heard,</hi> ſaith <hi>Daniel, but I underſtood not, Dan.</hi> 12.8. <hi>See</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.11.12. But theſe who are directed to propheſie according to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith, are to keep within the bounds of their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and not undertake to teach others, what they do not well underſtand themſelves.</p>
               <p>Beſides the Apoſtle deſcribing the ſubject matter of thoſe prophecyings, which were uſed in the Churches ſaith, <hi>He that prophecieth ſpeaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation and comfort,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3. which to do, were things not pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to extraordinary Prophets, but common duties among Chriſtians, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Wherefore comfort your ſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48350:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and edifie one another, even as alſo ye do, and exhort one another daily, Heb.</hi> 3.13. <hi>and</hi> 10.25. <hi>As every man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.10. In which the Apoſtle gives this caution, <hi>verſe</hi> 11, if any man ſpeak let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God, that is, according to, and as becomes the words of God; of which caution there had been no uſe as I ſaid before, if none had ſpoke in a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying, that is, to edification, exhortation and comfort, but onely ſuch as ſpake by immediate revelation. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the gift was which <hi>Timothy</hi> received by the putting on of <hi>Paul</hi>'s hands, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. or which afterward he received by propheſie, and the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, 1 <hi>Tim,</hi> 4.14. I ſay what ever other gift it was, it ſeems it was not a gift of preaching the Goſpel by immediate revelation of the ſpirit, becauſe in order to his teaching he is exhorted, <hi>to give attendance to reading,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. and is admoniſhed alſo, to <hi>take heed unto his Doctrine, verſe</hi> 16. and directed to <hi>hold faſt the form of ſound words, which he had heard of Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. for all which there had been no place, if what he had taught, had been onely by the immediate dictates of the ſpirit: for he that ſpeakes by immediate revelation and infallible gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the ſpirit, needs not give attendanc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to reading, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto, nor is in danger (unleſſe he take heed) of miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in his Doctrine, or of expreſſing himſelf in unſound words. Nor doth the Apoſtle in his directions about the choice of Elders, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 3. where he inſiſts at large on the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons requiſite in ſuch Officers, ſpeak one word of thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts. And as the Apoſtle would not have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying then uſed in the Church to be deſpiſed, ſo he would not have ought delivered therein, to be received without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and tryal, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.20.21. <hi>deſpiſe not prophecying, prove all things, &amp;c.</hi> which ſhews, that thoſe that did then propheſie, might poſſibly deliver errour as well as truth, which thoſe who ſpake onely as the ſpirit gave them utterance could not do; but of this onely by the way. I ſhall now return to add a word more towards their ſatisfaction who lay ſo great a ſtreſs upon a baptized adminiſtrator of Baptiſm, as for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed want whereof they are content, that both Baptiſm, and

               <p n="4">4. That therefore which I ſhall ſay in the laſt place to ſuch, is, that the want of a baptized adminiſtratour, can be no juſt plea for any among us to keep off from obeying Jeſus Chriſt in ſubmitting to the Ordinance of baptiſm, becauſe bleſſed be God, there are many amongſt us meet to adminiſter that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, who have been themſelves baptized by ſuch as were baptized alſo. Neither is it neceſſary, nor indeed reaſonable, for any man to ſuſpend his ſubmitting to Baptiſm, till he be able to make out by clear proof, not onely that he from whom he is about to receive baptiſm was baptized, but alſo that that third perſon, from whom the ſecond received it, and a fourth from whom the third received it, and ſo on to <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt or the Diſciples of Chriſt, who firſt adminiſtred the ſame; for there would have been no end of ſcrupling, nor hardly a poſſibility of ſatisfaction in this caſe, no not in the Apoſtles times, and that ſucceſſive time in which this adminiſtration was not corrupted, if ſuch a thing had been neceſſary. Nor can it eaſily be imagined how the <hi>Eunuch</hi> could have come at ſatisfaction in this point touching <hi>Philips</hi> meetneſſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter baptiſm to him, if ſuch a lineal demonſtration had been requiſite hereunto. Nor can it reaſonably be thought that that mans baptiſm ſhould be the leſſe available to him, who in uprightneſſe of heart, ſubmits himſelf thereto, though he ſhould be miſtaken about the meetneſs of the adminiſtrator; for <hi>Paul</hi> doubtleſſe would never have rejoiced as he did, that Chriſt was preached, though but in pretence by ſome, as in truth by others, but that he knew that a benefit would redound even by their preaching of Chriſt to thoſe that with honeſt hearts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word from them, their unmeetneſſe to miniſter the Goſpel otherwiſe notwithſtanding, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.18.</p>

            <head>A Poſtſcript.</head>
            <p>IN as much as there are too many in theſe times, who to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der waterbaptiſm unneceſſary, do conſtrue moſt of thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as meant of the Baptiſm of the Spirit, which ſpeak of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, after the miniſtry of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ceaſed, and who alſo do interpret thoſe words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>By one spirit we are all baptized into one body,</hi> to be meant of the baptiſm of the ſpirit; and ſo do take themſelves as having the ſpirit, to be duly incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated viſibly into this one body of Chriſt which is his church, by vertue of their being baptized with the ſpirit, whether they have ever received water-baptiſm or no: Therefore having this opportunity, I ſhall here adde a word to convince ſuch from the Scripture, of their deluſion and miſtake herein.</p>
            <p>In order hereunto, let ſuch know, that for men to receive of the ſpirit of God, onely unto their own perſonal regeneration, and ſanctification, is one thing, &amp; to be baptized with the ſpirit, is another. Thoſe whom <hi>John</hi> baptized, at leaſt many of them had received of the ſpirit to their own perſonal regeneration and ſanctification, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.32. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29. and yet they were not then baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, but were directed to expect that from him that was to come after <hi>John,</hi> to wit Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. Thoſe eleven Apoſtles of Chriſt alſo, who being aſſembled together, and Chriſt with them, a little before his aſcenſion, had at that time certainly received, of the ſpirit to their own regeneration and ſanctification, yea and to a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree for the edification of others alſo; and yet at that time they were not baptized with the holy ſpirit, but they then received a promiſe from Chriſt that they <hi>ſhould be baptized with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit not many days thence, Acts</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p>The baptiſm of the ſpirit then, properly, is ſuch a being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the holy ſpirit, as by which men are able to ſpeak with other tongues, and to act and do things of like high and extraordinary import. This is evident, Firſt, from the tenor of that ſaying of the Baptiſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. <hi>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that commeth after me, is mightier then I, whoſe ſhooes I am not worthy to bear, he ſhall
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48350:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire.</hi> Which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly was fulfilled to as many of the Jews as were profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly the Diſciples of Chriſt at the day of Penticoſt following the aſcention of Chriſt. For ſpeaking of the hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Diſciples which were all with one accord in one place, its ſaid that <hi>there appeared unto them eleven tongues, like as of fire, and it ſate upon EACH of them, and they were ALL filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance, Acts</hi> 2.1.3.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſuch a being filled with the holy ſpirit, was meant by the promiſe of being baptized with the ſpirit, appears by the words of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.5. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1.2.3.4, and <hi>Acts</hi> 11.16. Chriſt commanded the Diſciples that they ſhould not depart from <hi>Jeruſalem, but wait for the promiſe of the father, which ſaid he, ye have heard of me: for</hi> John <hi>truly baptized with water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghost, not many daies hence, Acts</hi> 1.4.5. which accordingly they were as we had it before, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1.3.4. which yet is more evident in <hi>Acts</hi> 11.15.16. where <hi>Peter</hi> rehearſing the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his preaching the Goſpel to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his company, ſaith, <hi>And as I began to speak the Holy Ghoſt fell on them, as on us at the beginning, then remembred I the word of the Lord, how that he ſaid,</hi> John <hi>indeed baptized with water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Where note, that the falling of the Holy Ghoſt upon <hi>Cornelius</hi> and thoſe with him, as on the Apoſtles and Diſciples on the day of Pentecoſt, cauſing them to ſpeak with tongues as they did, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.46. this <hi>Peter</hi> deems, to be a like act of grace vouchſaled the Gentiles, as was that which Chriſt promiſed his Diſciples when he told them that they ſhould be baptized with the holy ſpirit not many days after.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why ſuch a rich meaſure of the ſpirit is expreſſed by this metaphor of being baptized with it, is I conceive becauſe of that analogy which is between this metaphorical baptiſm, and that which is literal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: for as no man is litterally and properly baptized with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abundance of water, <hi>John</hi> 3.23. ſo much as in which he is buried, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. ſo no man is metaphorically baptized with the ſpirit, but he that receives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it in great abundance likewiſe. Sufferings alſo which are another metaphorical baptiſm, a man
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48350:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is not ſaid to be baptized herewith whileſt they be but ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and common, but then onely when they are very great and many, ſuch as that he may ſay concerning them, <hi>I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me, Pſal.</hi> 69.2. And therefore Chriſt when he ſpeaks of his being baptized in this kind, doth appropriate it to his ſuffering the ſorrows of death, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.50. and not to thoſe leſſer degrees of ſuffering which befell him in the former part of his life.</p>
            <p>If then to be ſo filled with the ſpirit, as by means thereof to be able to ſpeak with other tongues, and the like, be in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſence to be baptized with the ſpirit, and not otherwiſe; then thoſe that will needs make a being baptized with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the condition of the injoyment of Goſpel priviledges, and the means of mens being made members of that one body of Chriſt which is the Church (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13,) as many now a daies do, on purpoſe to exclude water-baptiſm altogether here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, do not onely thereby exclude themſelves, but alſo all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers now living (ſo far as known to us) from all part and fellowſhip in ſuch Goſpel priviledges, in as much as neither they nor any other viſible to us, are in a Scripture account bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the ſpirit.</p>
