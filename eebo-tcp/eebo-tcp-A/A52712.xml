         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is in my Heart to praiſe thee, O my God! Let me never forget thee, what thou haſt been to me in the Night, by thy Preſence in the Day of Trial; when I was beſet in Darkneſs, when I was caſt out as a wandering Bird, when I was aſſaulted with ſtrong Temptations, then thy Preſence in ſecret did preſerve me, and in a low Eſtate I felt thee near me; when the Floods ſought to ſweep me away, thou didſt ſet a Compaſs for them how far they ſhould paſs over; when my Way was through the Sea, and when I paſſed under the Mountains, there was thou preſent with me; when the Weight of the Hills was upon me, thou upheldeſt me, elſe had I ſunk under the earth; when I was as one altogether helpleſs, when Tribulation and Anguiſh was upon me Day and Night, and the Earth without Foundation; when I went on the Way of Wrath, and paſſed by the Gates of Hell; when all comforts ſtood afar off, and he that is mine Enemy had Dominion; when I was caſt into the Pit, and was as one appointed to Death; when I was between the Millſtones, and as one cruſhed with the Weight of his Adverſary, as a Father thou waſt with me, and the Rock of thy Preſence. When the Mouths of Lions roared againſt me, and Fear took hold on my Soul in the Pit, then I called upon thee in the Night, and my Cries were ſtrong before thee daily, who anſwered me from thy Habitation, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veredſt me from thy Dwelling-Place, ſaying, <q>I will ſet thee above all thy Fears, and lift up thy Feet above the Head of Oppreſſion.</q> I believed and was ſtrengthened, and thy Word was Salvation. Thou didſt fight on my Part, when I wreſtled with Death; and when Darkneſs would have ſhut me up, then thy Light ſhone about me, and thy Banner was over my Head. When my Work was in the Furnace, and as I paſſed through the Fire by thee I was not conſumed, though the Flames aſcended above my Head. When I beheld the dreadful Viſions, and was amongſt the fiery Spirits, thy Faith ſtayed me, elſe through Fear I had fallen. I ſaw thee, and believed, ſo the enemy could not prevail.</p>
            <p>When I look back into thy Works, I am aſtoniſhed, and ſee no End of thy Praiſes! Glory, Glory to thee, faith my Soul! and let my Heart be ever filled with Thanſgiving. Whilſt thy Works remain, they ſhall ſhew forth thy Power. Then didſt thou lay the Foundation of the Earth, and ledſt me under the Waters, and in the Deep didſt thou ſhew me Wonders, and the Forming of the World. By thy Hand thou ledſt me in Safety, till thou ſhewedſt me the Pillars of the Earth: Then did the Heavens ſhower down, they were covered with Darkneſs, and the Powers thereof were ſhaken, and thy Glory deſcended. Thou filledſt the lower Parts of the Earth with Gladneſs, and the Springs of the Vallies were opened, and thy Showers deſcended abundantly, ſo the Earth was filled with Virtue. Thou madeſt thy Plant to ſpring, and the thirſty Soul became as a watered Garden: Then didſt thou lift me out of the Pit, and ſet me forth in the Sight of my Enemies. Thou proclaimedſt Liberty to the Captive, and calledſt mine Acquaintance near me: They to whom I had been a Wonder, looked upon me, and in thy Love I obtained Favour in thoſe who had forſook me. Then did Gladneſs ſwallow up Sorrow, and I forſook all my Troubles; and I ſaid, <q>How good is it that Man be proved in the Night, that he may know his Folly, that every Mouth may become ſilent in thy Hand, until thou makeſt Man known to himſelf, and haſt ſlain the Boaſter, and ſhewed him the Vanity that vexeth thy Spirit!</q>

            <head>About Two Hours before his Death he ſpoke in the Preſence of ſeveral Witneſſes, theſe Words:</head>
            <p>THERE is a Spirit which I feel, that delights to do no Evil, nor to revenge any Wrong; but delights to endure all Things, in Hope to enjoy its own in the End: Its Hope is to out-live all Wrath and Contention, and to weary out all Exaltation and Cruelty, or whatever is of a Nature contrary to itſelf. It ſees to the End of all Temptations: As it bears no Evil in itſelf, ſo it conceives none in Thoughts to any other: If it be betrayed, it bears it; for its Ground and Spring is the Mercies and Forgiveneſs of God. Its Crown is Meekneſs, its Life is everlaſting Love unfeigned, and takes its Kingdom with Entreaty, and not with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and keeps it by Lowlineſs of Mind. In God alone it can rejoice, though none elſe regard it, or can own its Life: Its conceived in Sorrow, and brought forth without any to Pity it; nor doth it murmur at Grief and Oppreſſion: It never rejoiceth but through Sufferings; for with the World's Joy it is murdered. I found it alone, being forſaken; I have Fellowſhip therein with them who have lived in Dens and deſolate Places in the Earth, who through Death obtained this Relation and eternal holy Life.</p>
