         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

APROVED
ANSWER TO THE
PARTIALL AND VNLIKT OF
Lord DIGBIES Speech to the Bill of
Attainder of the Earle of
Strafford.</head>
            <p>THe ſandge, that is the incoherent ſelf-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and ſelf-forſaking ſpeech, that endevor
to ſhew how the ſame man, might both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
and acquit the ſame man (the Earle of
<hi>Strafford</hi>) doth not ſo much call for the ſtroke
of an hammer, to batter it, as a puffe of wind to
blow it away, to encounter it with the Votes of
the two Houſes of Parliament, with the united
opinion of the Iudges, with the learned Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall (before the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees
of both Houſes) were to kill a Fly with an
Axe, and to honour, rather then to overthrow
it. For certainly the ſtrength of it is only great
in the kindneſſe (that I ſay not the weakneſſe) of
the Reader, ſtealing away the affection, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
the Iudgement; if Arguments bee
raiſed from it; they are ſuch as neede an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitall,
being blinde and lame, if Arguments
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96513:3"/>
be raised againſt it the ſpeech falls before them, like graſſe before the Mower.</p>
            <p>Will you ſee an Argument of this paper, and
indeed a paper Argument:</p>
            <p>If it doth not appeare to him by two Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
that the Army of <hi>Ireland</hi> was to bee
brought over to reduce this Kingdome then the
Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> is not guiltie of high treaſon.</p>
            <p>Now doth he beleeve himſelf in this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when he ſeeth divers other charges of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
beſides laid againſt him; if 3. or 4. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
be obiected and proved, is it a ſufficient
cauſe of clearing if 1. be not proved to his mind,
and as he ſaies but by a ſingle teſtimony, though
the other by more; if the Author cannot bee
drawn to a better beliefe by the cords of reaſon.
I thinke he would certainly be drawne to it, by
the cords of a compariſon. If himſelfe were tied
with three or foure cords, and a friend had freed
him from one, would he tell his Friend, let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
for I am free enough, though I am bound
by the reſt; ſurely I think the other cords (after
ſome ſtay at leaſt) wold perſwade him to change
his minde by his inability to change his place.</p>
            <p>But Faults in this paper doe not goe alone;
For is he not wilingly blind when he ſees not the
Iery clauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of reducing this Kingdome by an
Iriſh Army manifeſtly appearing in the former
and as it were looking him in the Face; For a
former teſtimony of 2. witneſſes ſaith, that his
Maieſty is abſolved from all rules of goverment
and may doe what power will admit: certainly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96513:3"/>
moſt beſides himſelfe doe ſee what power will
admit the uſe of an Iriſh Army and any other
that the ſame power can purchaſe, or command.
So that where he quarrels for want of an Iriſh
Army, he hath gotten now about his eares, <hi>Iriſh,
Engliſh, Dutch,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But yet againe he multiplies and is fruitfull
in abſurdities. He ſaies, that he hath no notion
of ſubverting law treaſonable but only by force;
certainly this Argument then will never ſubvert
the Law, for it hath no force in it, it is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
taken onely from his owne ignorance, and
runs, or rather halts thus, he knowes no other,
therefore there is no other; to frame this right
it ſhould run thus.</p>
            <p>There is no way of ſubverting the Law, but
that which I know, but I know no way of ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Law, but by force. Now in the firſt of
theſe is too much knowledge, and in the latter
too much ignorance.</p>
            <p>But who ſaith this, Is it ſome ancient Judge
or Father of the Law, that hath ſwallowed and
digeſted the great volumes of that iudicious and
weightie profeſſion, or is it the Speech of one
that lookes more into the Court then the Innes
of Court, I pray behold an Engine ſtrongly
framed to lift up and overpoiſe the truſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of a whole Kingdome in point of Law, <hi>A
young Gentleman knowes it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if he be not skilfull in Common Law,
he may be ſomewhat skilfull in common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and that may tell him, that if nothing but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96513:4"/>
can ſubvert Law, then Iudges cannot ſubvert
Law upon the ſeates of Juſtice; for though they
wil fully pronounce judgment contrary to law;
ſtop lawfull defences, and rob the ſubject of the
benefit of law; &amp; let looſe the Prerogative upon
the Law to deſtroy it, except they drive the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
away from Courts of iuſtice by Halberds &amp; <hi>Guns;</hi> they may take the Law from them by falſe
iudgments, denying <hi>prohibitions habeas corpus,</hi> and
all legall Remedies and yet not ſubvert the Law.
If this Authors eſtate ſhould be loſt by this way
of iniuſtice, he may comfort himſelfe (and let it
be his comfort alone) that it is not loſt by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
the Law. O unhappy <hi>Treſillian</hi> that thou
didſt not live in the times, when ſuch patronages
might have beene given thee, for then mighteſt
thou have lived out thy time, ſince thou couldſt
not commit Treaſon by ſubverting the Iron
Lawes, but onely by Iron.</p>
            <p>And now I am fallen upon <hi>Treſillian,</hi> I may
not forget this Authors argument, to which this
<hi>Treſillian</hi> will give an unhappy concluſion.</p>
            <p>He argues thus:</p>
            <p>The Earle of Straffords practiſes have bin as
high, as tyrannicall, as ever any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the practiſes
of <hi>Treſilian</hi> and others have bin as high as high
Treaſon. Therefore the Earle of Straffords pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
have been as high <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee how this Author with the helpe
of <hi>Treſilian</hi> hath prononced ſentence againſt the
E. of Strafford, So that if he had no other Judge
this one thus aſſiſted would condemn him, when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96513:4"/>
he goes about to ſave him.</p>
            <p>But that is nothing to the purpoſe, that he is
condemned, for though he be condemned, and
ſo condemned, that he can never be abſolved till
he be diſpatcht into another world, yet this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
will not have a hand in this diſpatch.</p>
            <p>A merciful Inference and moſt unſutable to the
premiſes, eſpecially if it come out of the mouth
of a Judge. Marke how it ſounds in ſuch a
mouth, I being a Iudge condemne you as <hi>guilty</hi>
of murther or of as high a treaſon as any, but I
will haue no hand in your ſentence or diſpatch.
If Judges ſhuld ride their circuits and end their
Aſsies in this Logick, granting the premiſes, and
denying the concluſion, were it not moſt vaine
and a meere mockery of Juſtice? For it were
only to find faults, and not to correct them, and
to turne Juſtice into meere words. It would
ſhortly make a Kingdome a den of Theeues,
murderers and Traytors, and ſafe for none to
dwel in, no not for thoſe that teach this doctrin,
though they may be thought by teaching to
deſerue it. <hi>Nec enim Lex equiar ulla, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, who can beleeue this mans ſuſpitions ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then <hi>Sr. Henry Vanes</hi> oath upon adviſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection?
and oath that gets an addition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
from the ſpeeches going before (iointly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
by the truely Noble Earle of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>)
and backt by a memoriall written the
ſame day when the words were ſpoken: which
words cald venemous by this paper, had their
venome from the ſpeaker, not the hearer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96513:5"/>
recorded the ſame day wherein they were
ſpoken, did ariſe thereby to ſuch a pregnance
of Teſtimony, that it became very great, and
might in a wiſe mans eye (be it <hi>Mr. Pym</hi> or any
other) looke very neere as big, as two.</p>
            <p>But though the Teſtimonies be big or many,
and the charges many alſo; and the Earle of
Strafford as high and tyrannicall in practiſes as
ever any (by the Authors confeſſion) yet hee
muſt at once be both condemned, and ſaved.
Though in his ſaving, the Votes of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
be condemned, and the Kingdome and Law
in danger not to be ſaved.</p>
