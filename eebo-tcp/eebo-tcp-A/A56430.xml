            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

HIS
TESTIMONY
Concerning
James Parnel</head>
            <p>IT was the Care of the Holy Men of
Old, <hi>To keep in Remembrance the Words
&amp; Works which sprang from the blessed Power
of God,</hi> and therefore did record the Words
of many Prophecies, and the Histories of
many Battels and Wars, in which the Arm
of God was manifest; and whenever God
Crown'd any with <hi>Worthiness</hi> and <hi>Honour,
as his Witnesses of his Word and Power,</hi> this
was commonly added unto the Renown
of their Noble Acts and Faithful Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
<hi>That their Name and Manner of Life
was committed unto the Generations that
<pb facs="tcp:101884:3"/>
followed after;</hi> insomuch as one said, <hi>The
Righteous should be had in Everlasting Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;</hi>
and another said, <hi>The Name of the
Righteous was Precious;</hi> and many other

               </gap>h like Sayings are there in the Holy
Scripture: Christ said to her that anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him with the Box of Oyntment, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the Gospel should be preached, this Charity
and Love of hers, bestowed on him, should be
spoaken of.</hi> And if ever any Age had
Cause to prize and keep in Remembrance
the <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Sayings, Great Deliverances</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual Battels,</hi> and <hi>Mighty</hi> and <hi>Noble
Acts of God, wrought by the Finger of his

which our God hath wrought in our Day,
in which he hath brought forth Life, Peace,

               </gap>emnant by a Way
which the Wise and Prudent of this World
were not nor are not yet aware of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
<hi>Babes</hi> have been his <hi>Messengers,</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
have been his <hi>Ministers,</hi> who in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
have received the Revelation of his
<pb facs="tcp:101884:3"/>
holy Spirit, by which the Deep Things
both of his Law and of his Glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
of Life and Salvation were revealed.
And among these <hi>Babes,</hi> who thus came
to receive the Knowledge of the <hi>Mysteries</hi>
of the Kingdom of God, by the Working
of his divine Power, was this Noble Child,
<hi>JAMES PARNEL,</hi> who was a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of Honour indeed, and Mighty in the
Power and Spirit of <hi>Immanuel,</hi> breaking
down and laying desolate many <hi>mighty</hi> and
<hi>strong Holds,</hi> and <hi>Towers of Defence,</hi> in the
which the old Deceiver had fortified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and his Children. Much might
be spoaken of this Man, and a large
Testimony doth live in my Heart to his
blessed Life, and to the Power and Wisdom
that abounded in him, but I do not intend
at this time to write much about him, but
to give the <hi>Reader</hi> a brief Account of my
Certain Knowledge, which I had of <hi>Him,</hi>
and his <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Labours,</hi> and <hi>End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to his Country &amp; Manner of Life,
<pb facs="tcp:101884:4"/>
and how he was about the Age of Fifteen
or Sixteen Years brought to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, and to the Working of his
Power in him, and how he obeyed the
same in many Travails and Tryals, until he
came to be about Eighteen Years of Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
all this, I say, it being spoaken to in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, and before my particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with him, I shall pass over, and
only speak of things within the Compass
of my own Knowledge.</p>
            <p>When he was about Eighteen Years of
Age, the Lord (who had heard the Cry
of his own Seed) put it into the Heart of
this Young Man to come in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o <hi>Essex,</hi> and
to preach the Word of Life, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
the Acceptable Year of the Lord
there, where it might indeed well have
been said, <hi>Behold, the Fields are White unto
Harvest;</hi> For, very many were there in
that County, who were both weary and
heavy laden with their Sins, and were as
weary with running to and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o, to seek a
Way out of them; and having travailed
all Mountains, and all Hills and High
<pb facs="tcp:101884:4"/>
Things, that could be travailed and tryed;
and found no Deliverance; and some sate
down concluding, <hi>If there was a Way, God
would manifest it;</hi> others concluded, <hi>There
was no Way, but we must dye in this Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and never see the Bread of Life;</hi> some
othes set their Wits on work, to find out
and invent New VVayes and Manners of
VVorshipping, but all was in vain; and
great was the <hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> of those
dayes, which some can yet well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and when all Hearts were ready to
faint, and all Hope was almost at an end
with some, &amp; when others had built their
<hi>Tower of Profession</hi> so high, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it did touch the <hi>Heavens</hi> it self; then,
I say, then did the Lord send this his <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Messenger,</hi> endued with Power from on
High, to preach the <hi>Acceptable Year of God,</hi>
and the <hi>Day of Vengeance,</hi> to comfort them
that mourned: His Coming was in the
fore-end of the Year 1655. VVhere He
preached the Gospel in many parts of
that County, as, <hi>Felsted, Stebben, Witham,
Coxal, Halsted,</hi> and many other places,
<pb facs="tcp:101884:5"/>
where many hungry Souls had gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the VVord of God, and it being
mixed with Faith in the Hearts of them
who heard it, it became Effectual to the
saving the Souls of many: And after he
had passed up &amp; down many Parts of that
County, and planted di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers good Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and confirmed them that had belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
he at length, about the middle of
the Summer, the same Year, came to <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi>
upon the seventh day of the week, &amp;
on the day following preached the Gospel
unto many Thousands of people, first in
his <hi>Lodging;</hi> then in a <hi>Steeple-house</hi> there, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Sermon; then in a <hi>Great Meeting,</hi>
appointed on purpose; and after that <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi>
with the <hi>Town-Lecturer</hi> and another
<hi>Priest</hi> in the <hi>French-School,</hi> all in One Day:
in all which the <hi>Wisdom, Power</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi>
of Christ appeared very Gloriously, to the
Convincing of my self and many more,
who were <hi>Witnesses of that day's Work:</hi> So
he spent that week in Preaching, Pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng,
Exhorting and Admonishing, <hi>turning the
Minds of all sorts of Professors to the Light of

and many did Believe, and found it so; and
others were Hardned, and Rebell'd against
the Appearance of Truth, and became <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,</hi>
with whom he Disputed daily in
great Soundness, and in the Evidence and
Demonstration of the Spirit, by which also
many were reached, and convinced of the
Truth, and the <hi>Mouthes of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>insayers</hi> stopt;
which made many gnash their Teeth on
him; and some undertook to club out
the <hi>Priests &amp; Professors Arguments</hi> by beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this dear Lamb with <hi>Fists</hi> and <hi>Staves,</hi>
who took all <hi>patiently;</hi> as particularly, one
who struck him with a great Staff as he
came out of one of the <hi>Steeple-houses,</hi> called
<hi>Nicholas,</hi> and said,
<q>
                  <hi>There, Take that for</hi> Jesus Christ's <hi>sake;</hi>
               </q>To which he returned this Answer,<q>
                  <hi>Friend, I do Receive it for</hi> JESUS
CHRIST'<hi>s sake:</hi>
               </q>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101884:6"/>
And many other intolerable Affronts were
offered him, in all which his Spirit was
not seen to be raised in Heat or Anger; but
was a Pattern of <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Meekness:</hi>
And having laboured in that great Town
about Ten Dayes, it lay upon him to go
back to <hi>Cogshall</hi> (to a Meeting holden as a
<hi>Fast,</hi> of which read more in that part of his
Writings, called, <hi>The Fruits of a Fast</hi>)
from whence he was committed to <hi>Colche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
Castle, and from thence had up to
<hi>Chelsford</hi> Assizes in <hi>Irons,</hi> and again thither
re-committed, where he remained until
he offer'd up his Life for his <hi>Testimony.</hi> He
lived in that Castle about Ten or Eleven
<hi>Moneths,</hi> in great Self-denyal and Careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
being truly watchful over the Flock
of God both in <hi>Essex</hi> and in <hi>Cambridgeshire,
Huntingtonshire</hi> and the <hi>Isle of Ely,</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
where he had travaled, and turned
many to God, and wrote many blessed and
heavenly <hi>Epistles,</hi> both to particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
&amp; to the Churches in general, which
were so many, that we have no certain
<pb facs="tcp:101884:6"/>
Account of them, nor cannot place them
in order as we would, if all could be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
together; but those <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi>
which could be found, are here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for the View of those who desire to
taste the first Fruits of this Tender Plant;
who in the Dayes of his Youth laid down
his Life for his blessed Testimony: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Things he suffered in that Prison, which
is other-where in this Book to be found.
And as he lay in Prison, he laboured for
the building up of them that were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced;
and he saw the Desire of his Soul
concerning many, in whom he saw the
Seed which he had sown Multiply and
Grow, to his Refreshment. And at last,
having passed through many Tryals and
Exercises, both Inward and Outward
and fulfilled his Testimony in Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Courage and Faithfulness, and been
a Comfort to us who had believed, He at
length laid down his Head in Rest and
Peace, stretching forth Himself, saying,
<q>Here I Dye Innocently:</q>
               <pb facs="tcp:101884:7"/>
And after his Departure he was buried in
the Castle Yard, where other Prisoners use
to be buried, because the Cruel Goaler
would not deliver his Body without Fees.
And though he be, as to the Outward, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, his Life doth remain, and his
Testimony doth yet live in the Hearts of
many, and will live through Generations
to come; and happy and blessed are and
shall all they be, who are Partakers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and are Faithful therein, they shall be
also Partakers of that Crown Immortal
with which He is Crowned.</p>
            <p>Thus, honest Reader, have I given thee a brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of this dear Plant of God, and of his blessed Fruit,
some whereof thou may'st find in this following Book;
which, if read in Sincerity and in Uprightness of Heart,
will tend to thy Benefit, and will give thee Cause, with me
and many more, to bless the Lord on his Behalf, who is the
Well-spring of Life, from whom all Good Gifts come, and
to whom all Glory and Honour doth belong, now, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
and forever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

TESTIMONY
Concerning
James Parnel</head>
            <p>COncerning our Dear Friend and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Iames Parnel,</hi> I have this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
to bear for him, in a true Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of him, as being Turned unto the
Truth of God by him; through Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
unto which Heavenly Light &amp; Truth
of God within, which he turned me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
I have found and do enjoy <hi>Peace with
God;</hi> so that although the Dark World
and Envious Priests and Professors Raged
against him, Imprisoned him and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
him unto Death, and made Lyes of
him when he was dead, speaking Evil of
him, accounting of him a Deceiver when
he was alive, I do say, <hi>He was unto Me a
<pb facs="tcp:101884:8"/>
True Minister and Messenger, sent of God, who
brought Tidings of the Way of Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto me, and many more in these Parts of
the Nation,</hi> whom, I know, have the
same Testimony to bear for this <hi>Innocent
Man;</hi> For God hath made us Seals of his

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, through a blessed Experience
of the <hi>Work of Regeneration,</hi> brought to pass
by this <hi>Heavenly Light</hi> &amp; <hi>Everlasting Truth,</hi>
unto the which he turned our Minds. And
this I can say also, <hi>As the Lord was pleased
to call him into his Blessed Work, so he furnisht
him with Virtues suitable for the same, according
to the Work of the Day in which he brought him
forth; and did mightily appear for him and with
him, in giving of him Courage, and Wisdom, and
Power, whereby he was Prepared and Fitted for
every Service &amp; Exercise y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Lord called him
unto;</hi> which Service he faithfully perform'd
of a Ready Mind, &amp; with a Willing Heart,
not neglecting: Nor did he refuse to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in any Service, in which his Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
was concern'd, which God had called
him to bear, although it were to the <hi>Ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy
of his Life,</hi> which many times he did,
both in Going to <hi>Steeple-Houses</hi> &amp; amongst
<pb facs="tcp:101884:8"/>
the Rude <hi>Schollars</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> both in
Disputing with them, and Declaring the
Truth.</p>
            <p>And after he went from Us, he was
moved of the Lord to go into <hi>Essex,</hi>
where he was gladly received by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest-hearted,
which wanted the Knowledge
of the Lord and his Wayes, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
unto them; and many there were
that Received him, and Believed in the
Truth which he declared? But the Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Professors ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e up against him, in <hi>Cain</hi>'s
Murdering Spirit, and cast him into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and there kept him in Hard Bonds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<hi>Death,</hi> at whose Doors, Hearts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
the Guilt of this Innocent Man's
Blood lies, which all their Outward Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shings,
nor Carnal Ordinances, nor Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
Performances, neither could nor can
purge away; but the <hi>Judgments of the Lord</hi>
have been, and yet will be executed upon
all that have had a Hand, or have taken a
Part with them in <hi>shedding of Innocent Blood,</hi>
which the Lord will not acquit.</p>
            <p>And now, as to the <hi>Person, Virtues</hi> and
<hi>Parts</hi> of this our Dear Friend, it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:101884:9"/>
upon me to give some Account of,
as having a Certain Knowledge of him, not
only because I was turned unto Truth by
him, but my Heart loved him, which Love
constrained me, as oft as I could, to be with
him; so that what Service he had in these
Parts, in Meetings of Friends, or amongst
Professors, or with Priests, I was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with him; whereby I was both Eye and
Ear Witness of the Mighty Power and
Wisdom of God, that attended him, by
the which He was prepared for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Work and Service which he was called
unto, and which he performed to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of God and Comfort of his People,
and to the Confounding of those that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the Truth. He was but Young in
Years, and of a Little Stature; for the
which he was by Brutish, Envious, Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
Priests and Professors Mocked, and
by them in a scornful Mind called, <hi>The
QVAKING BOY:</hi> but in him was
seen the Mighty Power of God. VVhen
any of them that were climed up so high
in their Imaginations, and strengthned
themselves in their Self-righteousness, and
<pb facs="tcp:101884:9"/>
came forth in the Strength of the power
of Darkness to Oppose the Truth of God,
which he bore Testimony unto, with him
did then appear the Name and Power of
the Living God, which was with the little
Stripling, <hi>David,</hi> in which Name and
Power he many times stopped the Mouths
of Gain-sayers; and by the Wisdom of
God that was with him, he caught the Wise
and Crafty in their own Snares, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
them in the sight of all that had
an Eye to see, and so brought <hi>shame</hi> upon
them; whereby the Saying is fulfilled,
<hi>That by Weak things the Lord would confound
the Mighty, and things that are Despised hath
God chosen; yea, and things that are not, to
bring to nothing things that are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had also a good Gift to declare the
Truth, and was full of Zeal and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Courage, in the which he performed
the same, for the <hi>informing</hi> of the Minds
of those that wanted the Knowledge of the
Lord; also, to Mark Out and Make Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
the Deceivers, which People were
to turn from. His <hi>Exhortation</hi> was unto
Us, that were turned unto the Truth, <hi>To
<pb facs="tcp:101884:10"/>
Walk in it, and to Watch unto it, and to Keep
Low in God's Holy Fear, &amp; to Deny our selves,
and Take Vp the Daily Cross to our own Wills,
and to be Faithful in that Little Appearance of
Light &amp; Truth which we had already receiv'd;</hi>
alwayes declaring unto us, <hi>That if we were
Faithful in that, the Lord would make known
more unto us;</hi> whose words many of us are
now Living Witnesses of the fulfilling of;
Blessed be the Name of the Lord forever
and for evermore, saith my Soul.</p>
            <p>Also, He was a <hi>Good Example</hi> and a <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi>
in his Life and Conversation unto us,
by the which he preached Truth unto us, as
well as by his VVords; for He himself li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
according to what he taught us; for,
he was adorned with <hi>Gravity,</hi> and walked
before us in <hi>Humility;</hi> yea, he had a <hi>Blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Conversation,</hi> and was <hi>unspotted from the
World;</hi> so that his Presence, as well as his
Words, was a Strengthning and a Comfort
to the Upright and Honest-hearted; but
he was an Awe &amp; a Dread to the Careless
and Disobedient, which made a Profession
of the Truth, but did not walk Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
thereunto, who he alwayes told
<pb facs="tcp:101884:10"/>
               <hi>should be cloathed with Rags, which could not
cover them, and their SHAME should appear,
and they left Naked; for, the Light and Day
of the Lord was come, that would make all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
and strip off all False Coverings, so that
a Profession, although it were of the Truth it
self, would no longer do, nor cover, without
the Life and Power be known and witnessed,
which doth not only Discover Sin and Evil, but
also Overcomes it, Removes it &amp; Takes it away:</hi>
The Truth of this Doctrine, which he
preached unto us, there are many of us, by
the good Hand and Power of the Lord
have &amp; do see the Fulfilling of this Honest-hearted
Young Man's Testimony, both on
them that received the Truth, which he
preached, into an Honest and Good Heart;
and also, upon the Careless and Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
so that I shall and do conclude in this
Testimony concerning Him, That He was
a Faithful Servant and Messenger, sent by
God to Declare the Way of Life unto them
that wanted the Knowledge of it, and to
Reprove Sin, and to Make Manifest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
and to Testifie against them, which
<pb facs="tcp:101884:11"/>
may be seen and felt, to the better Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of them that never saw his Face, in
reading over his own <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Epistles,</hi>
which were written by his Own Hand,
which all that read with an Honest Heart &amp;
in a Serious Mind, I doubt not but will
say with me, <hi>Surely the Mighty Power and
Wisdom of the Lord was with him of a Truth.</hi>

HIS
TESTIMONY
Concerning
James Parnel</head>
            <p>THis Blessed Man, the Writer of
these following Books, was made
a Partaker of that Faith &amp; Patience through
which the Righteous in all Ages obtained
the Crown of Life, and Victory over all
their Enemies; and had a share in his Day
and Time (as alwayes they had in this
World) of the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of Christ in him.</p>
            <p>He was sent into this County with the
Testimony of God in his Heart &amp; Mouth,
and therefore was Bold in the Name of the
Lord to cry <hi>REPENTANCE</hi> in the Ears
of the Sons of Men; and <hi>as He said, so
<pb facs="tcp:101884:12"/>
lived he,</hi> as many in this Town and Place
are living Witnesses of, who have true
Cause to bless and praise the Name of the
Lord, and do, for that He and other of
his Brethren were sent among<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> us.</p>
            <p>He was of a sweet Savour of Christ to the
Almighty God (through his Faithfulness
to him who sent him hither) in them who
receiv'd his Testimony, though many there
were that hardened their Hearts against the
Lord, of which Number were many of
the <hi>Rulers, Priests</hi> and <hi>Professors</hi> of that
Time, who, notwitstanding they cryed,
<hi>Reformation, the Ordinances of Christ Jesus,
Christian-Duties,</hi> and the like, yet manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
themselves of that Stock and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which always <hi>slew</hi> the <hi>Righteous:</hi> and
the Lord God soon stretcht forth his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Hand of Judgment upon some, as
Warnings unto others, whom he spared
from that swift Stroak, that they might
Repent (as some did) and seek his Face,
who is the Light of the World, God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for evermore.</p>
            <p>He was as a <hi>Youth,</hi> and mean in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Presence and Appearance; <hi>but God
hath chosen the Foolish Things of this World to
confound the Wise:</hi> And so high was the
spirit of the <hi>Professors</hi> (and the <hi>Prophane</hi>
encouraged thereby) that with whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
such was his Name used, but in a
way of <hi>Derision</hi> and <hi>Scorn?</hi> terming him,
<hi>The Railing Fellow in the Castle; He owneth
himself to be Christ Jesus; A Wandering Star,
to whom is reserved the Blackness of Darkness
forever.</hi> But since it came to Light, and
the Wandering Stars seen, and their Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Darkness felt, who durst not stand
by their <hi>Ordinances, Duties</hi> nor <hi>Christianity,</hi>
but in <hi>Obscure Holes, Secret Places</hi> &amp; <hi>Vaults;</hi>
which shews them of a low, dark, earthly,
wandering spirit, who know not the Spirit
of Life from God, nor the Stability there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
to set them above the Fear of Man,
where they lie in great Captivity.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath put it into my Heart (in
the blessed Remembrance of his Innocent
Life) to bear my Testimony upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
and thus to appear in the Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of him: And I am assured in my Spirit,
<pb facs="tcp:101884:13"/>
That although the Lord suffer'd him to be
cruelly kept in Bonds until Death, and to
be <hi>hated</hi> &amp; <hi>persecuted</hi> beyond what we had
known before amongst us, yet it was for
his Righteous Life sake (as from his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>)

Sufferings and Death
OF
James Parnel</head>
            <p>I Having a Knowledge of <hi>J. P.</hi> the Author of
these Books, and being an Eye-Witness of
part of his great Sufferings, he under-went
for the Testimony of the Blessed Truth, which he
sealed with his Blood, being persecuted by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
Generation, who, though they made great
Pretence to <hi>Christianity,</hi> yet they were upon Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
found to be such who were born of the Flesh,
who always persecuted them that were born after
the Spirit; and were like the Professing <hi>Jews,</hi>
who reckoned they were of the Stock of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and that he was their Father, when they
were of their Father the Devil, doing his Works,
Persecuting the Innocent. And that the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb facs="tcp:101884:16"/>
of the Great Suffering of this our Dear
Friend and Brother JAMES PARNEL
may not be extinguished, I shall insert a full
Relation of his <hi>Imprisonment</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>The said <hi>JAMES PARNEL</hi> being moved
of the Lord to go to a Steeple-House at <hi>Cogg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall,</hi>
the Priests and the People having appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Fast (as they said) against Error, the 12th
Day of the 5th Month, in the Year One Thousand
Six Hundred and Fifty Five; after the Priest
had Ended, <hi>James</hi> spake a few Words to them;
so passing forth of the Steeple-House, one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Justice <hi>WAKERING</hi> followed him, and
clapt him on the back, and said, <hi>He Arrested
Him,</hi> although he shewed no Writ; and by
the means of divers Priests he was (by <hi>Dionysius
Wakering, Herbert Pelham, Thomas Cook</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Harlakenden</hi>) committed to <hi>Colchester-Castle,</hi>
and there kept close up, and none of his Friends
suffered to come near him; and from thence, at
the Assizes, was carried to <hi>Chelmsford, where they
kept him on the Chain Day and Night;</hi> but when he
appeared at the Bar, the <hi>Chain</hi> was taken off, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had <hi>Irons</hi> on his Hands, where Judge <hi>Hill</hi> urged
the Jury to find him guilty, declaring what he
could against the Prisoner to them, and would not
suffer him to speak to the Jury to clear himself;
so the Judge fined him Forty Pounds, and to be
<pb facs="tcp:101884:16"/>
committed Close Prisoner till Payment; and
gave Charge to the Goaler, <hi>Not to let any Giddy-Headed
People</hi> (as he called them) <hi>come at him;</hi> so
the Goaler denyed his Friends to come to him, to
Relieve him, and would not let them in; but such
as came to Abuse, Scorn and Beat him, they let
in to him; and the Goaler's Wife did set her
Man to Beat him, who threatned to Knock him
down, and make him <hi>shake his Heels;</hi> and she her
self did Beat him several times, and swore, <hi>She
would have his Blood:</hi> And sometimes they would
not let him have any Victuals brought to him;
other times, they would set Prisoners to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
such Victuals as was brought to him; and
would not let him have a <hi>Trundle-Bed,</hi> which his
Friends would have brought him to lie on; but
forced him to lie on the Stones, which in a wet
season would run down with Water; and when
he was in a (Room for which he paid Four Pence a
Night) he was threatned if he did but walk to and
fro in it: Then they put him in the <hi>Hole in the
Wall,</hi> which is very high from the Ground, and
where the Ladder was too short by Six Foot; and
when his Friends would have given him a Cord
and a Basket, to have taken up his Victuals in,
they would not let them (though they much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
it) but he must either come up and down by
a Rope (or else Famish in the Hole) which he
did a long time: But after a long Suffering in
this Hole, where there was nought but Misery,
as to the Outward Man, it being no Place either
<pb facs="tcp:101884:17"/>
for Air or Smoak (and <hi>James</hi> being much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbed
in his Naturals) as he was climbing up
the Ladder, with his Victuals in one Hand, and
coming to the top of the Ladder, catching at the
Rope with his other Hand, missed the Rope,
and fell from a very great Height down upon
Stones, by which Fall he was exceedingly
Wounded in the Head and Arms, and his Body
much Bruised, and taken up for Dead: Then
they put him in a little low Hole, call'd the <hi>Oven</hi>
(which place was so Little, that some Bakers
Ovens have been seen Bigger then it, though
not so high) without the least Air, Hole or
Window for Smoak; neither would they suffer
him to have a little Charcole brought in to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Smoak: And after he was a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
they would not suffer him to take a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Air, which was but once desired by him,
feeling himself spent much for want of Breath:
And although some did offer their Bond of Forty
Pounds, to a Justice (so called) and another to
lie Body for Body, that <hi>James</hi> might have but
Liberty to come to their House while he was well,
and to be returned again when he should be Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and that if he Dyed, they should have
his Body; but they would not, their Wills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unalterably set in Cruelty against him: And
it was desired, That he might but walk in the
Yard? but it was said, <hi>He should not have so much
Liberty as to walk to the Castle Door;</hi> which was
strictly executed; for, the Door being open, he
<pb facs="tcp:101884:17"/>
did but walk forth into a Close Stinking Yard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Door, and the Goaler came in great Rage,
and lock't up the Hole where he lay, and shut him
out in the Yard all Night, being in the Coldest
Time of all Winter. And seeing that their Rage
did more and more encrease, and there was an
Addition to his Sufferings daily, and seeing there
was no way to satisfie their Malice, but his <hi>Blood,</hi>
and seeing his Life could not in all likelihood be
continu'd long in that Place and Condition he was
in, there was no little Labour and Means used to
lay it before the Highest in Authority, yea, more
concerning that Man (that his Life might
have been saved, and they kept from Innocent
Blood) then ever was concerning any (if not all)
that ever were Imprisoned of our Friends for some
Years before; but no Mercy could be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them; and though they were told of his
<hi>Wounds, Weakness</hi> and <hi>Ill Usage,</hi> yet would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it, till he was Dead; and then some, who
were his Persecutors, used their Wits to cover his
Sufferings from being known, and would cast it
upon himself.</p>
            <p>At his Departure there were present with him,
<hi>Ann Langley</hi> and <hi>Thomas Shortland,</hi> who related his
last words as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> HERE I DYE
INNOCENTLY; and further said, NOW I
MUST GO; and turned his Head to <hi>Thomas,</hi>
and said, THIS DEATH I MUST DYE;
and further said, <hi>THOMAS,</hi> I HAVE SEEN
GREAT THINGS; and bad him, <hi>That he should
<pb facs="tcp:101884:18"/>
not hold him, but let him go;</hi> and said it over again,
WILL YOU HOLD ME? then said <hi>Ann,
Dear Heart, we will not hold thee;</hi> and then he said,
NOW I GO; and stretched out himself, and
fell into a sweet Sleep, and slept about an Hour
(as he often had said, that <hi>ONE HOUR's SLEEP
WOULD CURE HIM OF ALL)</hi> and so drew
Breath no more.</p>
            <p>This is the Substance of a Relation given (of
his <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> heretofore printed) in a
Book entituled, <hi>The Lamb's Defence against Lyes,</hi>
published soon after <hi>James Parnel</hi> departed.</p>
            <p>Thus did this Valiant Souldier in the Lamb's
War Conquer through Sufferings, and hath laid
down his Head in Peace forever.</p>

God cannot commit sin; and no Unholy nor Unclean
thing must enter.</hi> So now, What Assurance
have you of your Salvation, or what is your
Faith built upon, when both Christ and the
Scriptures witness against you? And Faith,
which is not built on the Rock, Christ Jesus,
is vain, and perisheth. <hi>And he that hath this Hope
in him, purifieth himself, even as he is Pure:</hi> Here
all your Faith is searched, tryed and proved,
and is found all vain and perishing; and so
is not built upon the Rock which Perisheth
not.</p>
            <p>Therefore come down all you High-minded
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> and lay away all your Profession,
and throw down all your old Building, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
and lay a new Foundation; for, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the <hi>Pharisee</hi> climbs, the greater will be his
Fall; and he that will be Wise let him first
become a Fool: <hi>For, man by his Wisdom knows
not God:</hi> Here the <hi>Pharisee</hi> is shut out from the
Knowldge of God, who stands in his own wisdom.</p>
            <p>And all you Wilful Blind, Carnal, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
Creatures, whom my Soul pittieth to see
how ignorantly you are led, who pin your
Faith upon the Sleeves of your Fore-Fathers,
and live in Lightness and Wantonness, spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
your Youth in Vanity, in Gaming, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and Sporting, in Drunkenness, in
Swearing, and Lying, in Vain Talk and Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Jestings, in Pride, and Lust and Filthiness;
and say, <hi>You follow your Fore-Fathers;</hi> and say,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101884:24"/>
               <hi>What is become of them?</hi> and say, <hi>Your Pleasures is
Pastime, and Recreation; and your Vain Talk and
Foolish Jesting is Pastime and Merriness;</hi> and so you
pass the Time away, and say, <hi>Your Drinking,
and Rioting, and Feasting, is Good-Fellowship and
Neighbourhood;</hi> and so you cover over your Sins and
Iniquities: but Wo unto him that hides his Sin,
and covers his Iniquity; and all this will not
profit you any thing; neither can your Fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
excuse you before the Lord: for in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
it was so, that <hi>Eve</hi> could not Justifie
<hi>Adam,</hi> neither could be any Excuse, but rather
Condemned him, because he hearkened to the
to the Voice of the Woman, and Disobeyed
the Lord; so <hi>Adam</hi> suffered for his own Sin, and
so did <hi>Eve</hi> for her's. And so this will be no
Excuse for you in the Day of Account, to say,
<hi>You followed your Fore-Fathers, and did as they did
before you:</hi> But then will the Lord say, <hi>Because
you followed the Traditions and Fashions, and Customs
and Inventions of Man, and have hearkened to the
Voice of the Serpent, and have Disobeyed my Voice,
and my Command, and Sleighted my Counsel, and
would none of my Reproof; but cast my Law behind
your Backs, and trampled my Mercy under Foot, and
have turned my Grace into Wantonness, and have
nourished your Hearts as in a Day of Slaughter, and
have spent my Creatures upon your Lusts, and Stoned,
Stocked, Buffeted, and Imprisoned and Shamefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
my Messengers, which I sent unto you to Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn
you of your Iniquity, and have killed my Son;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101884:24"/>
therefore depart, ye Workers of Iniquity, I know ye
not; into Everlasting Torment, prepared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and his Angels.</hi> To see now how vain your
Hope is, and how unstedfast your Faith is, when
you have more Assurance of your Damnation,
than your Salvation: for the Lord saith, <hi>No Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
Person must enter into his Kingdom; nor no
Unholy, nor Unclean thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore all you, who desire Salvation to
your Souls, Try and Prove your Faith and Hope,
which you do trust to; and take heed of trusting
to a broken Reed, lest it deceive you: Experience
hath taught you, That if a Foundation of a
Building be decayed, and wasted, and naught, the
Building will Fall when a Storm cometh: so let
him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he
falleth. So every one, whose desire is after
Righteousness, hearken to that in your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
which raiseth up Desires after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and which sheweth you the Vainness
of your Lives, and checks you when you do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss,
and troubles you and torments you in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
when you have been Drunk, or have
done some Evil Act; be willing to be guided by
that, and that will lead you to Repentance, and
Newness of Life, to forsake those things which
it discovers to be contrary to the will of God:
and if you be willing to follow this, and be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by it, you shall find a Teacher continually
present, checking in the Conscience for vain
Thoughts, and for Vain, and Idle, and Needless
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101884:25"/>
Words and Actions, and so will Crucifie the
Lust, which is the Ground of those things, and
which will lead you out of the Pathes of Death,
into the Way of Life; out of the Traditions, and
Customs, and Fashions &amp; Opinions of the World,
into the Assurance of the Eternal Truth: And
thou that art willing to follow this, and be
guided by this, shalt need no man to teach
thee; but it will be a Teacher unto thee,
Teaching and Directing in Righteousness, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Holiness; and if thou art Dilligent,
keeping thy Mind within, with an Ear open to
the pure Voice, thou shalt find it present with
thee wheresoever thou art, in the Fields, in
thy Bed, in Markets, in Company, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
thou art, when thy Outward Priest or
Teacher is absent, it may be in the <hi>Ale-House,</hi>
or at his <hi>Pleasures</hi> and <hi>Delights,</hi> or far off, it will
be present with thee, and will Check thee and
Condemn thee for that which no Outward Eye
can See, and will cleanse thy Heart from Lust,
and Deceit, and Uncleanness; and will purifie
thy Heart, and will make it a fit Temple for
Purity to dwell in; and then thy Sacrifices will
be Pure, which come from a Pure Heart, the
Lord will accept them; for, <hi>Abel</hi>'s Sacrifices he
receiveth, but <hi>Cain</hi>'s he denies: but if thou
wouldest attain to this, thou must be willing to
deny thy Lusts, thy Vanity, thy Delights, or
whatsoever hath been thy Life; For, <hi>He that
will save his Life, shall lose it; and he that will lose his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101884:25"/>
Life for my sake, the same shall save it.</hi> So there
is no obtaining of Life, but through Death;
nor no obtaining the Crown, but through the
Cross: So thou must deny thy self, and take
up thy daily Cross, and follow Christ, if thou
wouldest be his <hi>Disciple,</hi> and give up thy Self
wholly to be guided by the Will of God,
that all which is contrary to the Will of God
may be Crucified (though it be never so near
and dear to thee) and be forsaken; Lands or
Living, Wife or Children, Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
or all the World, and all Delights
in the World: <hi>For he that loveth any thing
better then Me, is not worthy of Me:</hi> And <hi>all
things below the Lord Vanisheth; but He Endureth
forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Lord God Almighty prosper all the
Tender Desires which are raised up towards
him, and feed the Hungry and Thirsty Souls,
as he hath promised, and raise up his own in
all his, that he alone may be Glorified, Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and Honoured, who is Worthy, and to
whom all belongeth.</p>
            <p>And this is the Desire of his Soul, who is
a Servant of the Lord; who is Hated, Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and Derided of the World, because he
hath no Fellowship with the World, nor the
Vanities of the World; but testifieth against
their Wayes, Fashions, Traditions, Customs,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101884:26"/>
Fellowship, Words and Worship; and seeth
them all to be Formal Imitation, and the
Invention of Man, out of the Covenant of
God, so cannot but deny them; and for this
Cause he is Hated of all, both Priest and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:

            <p>THis then is the Message that we have
received of the Father, <hi>That God is Light,
and in him is no Darkness at all: if we walk
in Darkness, and say, we have fellowship with him,
we lye, and do not the Truth; but if we walk in the
Light, as he is in the Light, then have we fellowship
one with another, and the Blood of Jesus Christ his Son
clenseth us from all sin,</hi> 1 John 1. 5, 6, 7. And
this is the Word which was in the beginning,
by which all things were made; <hi>and in him was
Life, and his Life was the Light of men,</hi> John 1. 1,
2, 3, 4. By which Light all the holy Men of
God, in the dayes of old, were inspired: By
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101884:27"/>
which Light <hi>Moses</hi> saw the things that were
done in the beginning, and wrote of them:
Which Word was a Lamp unto <hi>David</hi>'s Feet,
and a Light unto his Pathes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 105.
Which Light dwelt in the Prophets and holy
Men, by which they saw the Day of Christ,
and wrote of him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 6. &amp; 60. 19, and spoke
as they were moved by it; and by it saw the
Deceit, Iniquities and Transgressions of <hi>Israel;</hi>
and declared against it, both in Priest, People,
and Rulers; speaking the Word of the Lord
faithfully, whether they would hear, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
<hi>Ezek. 2. Mic. 3. Isa.</hi> 56. And this Word
came unto the Prophets, which was as a Fire
and a Hammer in their Bones, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 9. &amp; 23. 29.
Which Word in due time became Flesh, and
dwelt among the Apostles, and they saw the
Glory thereof as of the Only Begotten Son of
the Father, full of Grace and Truth, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14.
whom <hi>John</hi> bears witness of, to be the Light of
the World, who doth enlighten every one that
comes into the World, <hi>John</hi> 1. To which
<hi>Light Paul</hi> was sent to turn the minds of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
Acts</hi> 26. 17, 18. Which <hi>Light</hi> is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the World, who love Darkness
rather then Light, because their deeds are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
and he that hates it, hath it, though he
will not bring his deeds to it, by it to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
therefore his Condemnation it is, <hi>John</hi> 3.
19, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>And there is a time, <hi>Light</hi> shines in <hi>Darkness,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:101884:27"/>
and Darkness comprehends it not, <hi>John</hi> 1. 5. and
this is the Cause why many stumble at it, and are
offended in it.</p>
            <p>And there is a time Light shines out of darknes,
and darkness flees away, and then is witnessed the
perfect Day, where the Children of the Day do
walk, <hi>Isa. 42. 16. Mat. 4. 16. Eph.</hi> 5. 8. Which <hi>Light</hi>
is the true Tryer of spirits, &amp; gives the discerning
of spirits, and discovers the works of darkness, and
manifests the deeds of darkness; and by it the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of the heart are seen, and hidden things
searched out; and by it all things are manifest;
and whatsoever makes manifest is Light, <hi>Heb.</hi>
4. 12. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 13. all which the natural man
knows not, and therefore cannot receive the
things of God, but by this Light is seen and
judged; for by this Light the Spiritual Man is
able to discern and judge the natural man, <hi>but
he himself is judged of no man,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14, 15. For
this is the Judge of the World, and by this the
Prince of the Air is judged, wheresoever he ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,
<hi>John</hi> 16. 11. and therefore at it rageth,
and stirreth up his Servants to persecute it,
where it is manifest: and so it is a Stumbling
Stone and a Rock of Offence to the Children of
the World, in whom the Prince of this World
lodgeth, <hi>Rom</hi> 9. 33.</p>
            <p>And of this Word the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> beareth
witness, <hi>to be quick and powerful, and sharpe- then a
two-edged Sword, to the dividing assunder betwixt the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101884:28"/>
Marrow and the Bones,</hi> Heb. 4. 12. to which Word
the Apostle directed the minds of people within
them, from looking without for to find it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
<hi>Rom,</hi> 10. And from this same Word the
Apostles spoke forth the Scripture; which Word
was their Guide, and Rule, and Teacher all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
from the beginning; by which both the
Apostles, and Prophets, and the holy Men were
acted, moved, and carry'd forth in the Power
of it, to declare that which by it they were
taught, 1 <hi>John. 1. 2. Pet.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
            <p>And this is the free Grace of God, which
bringeth Salvation, and hath appear'd to all
men, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. which is their Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
who do despite unto it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. but
this was the Saints Teacher, by which they
were taught to deny all Ungodliness and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Lusts, and to live Godlily, Righteously and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
in this present evil World.</p>
            <p>And this is the Anointing, which teacheth all
things freely, which is Truth, and no Lye,
and leads into all Truth: and he that knows
this, needs no man to teach him; but is come
to the end of mans teaching, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. unto
which the Prophet was come, and therefore called
freely, <hi>Come, buy Wine &amp; Milk without Money or Price;
Why spend ye your Money for that which is not Bread, or
your Labour for that which profitteth not?</hi> Isa. 55. 1,
2, 3. And from this the Apostle spoke freely,
nor coveting any man's Silver or Gold; but as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101884:28"/>
they freely had received, freely they gave, <hi>Acts</hi>
20. 33. And whosoever speaks from this, speaks
freely, and its Ministry leads to the end of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and here let all flesh keep silence before the
Lord, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
            <p>And let all Hirelings, and greedy Shepherds,
stop their mouthes, who cry Peace Peace to them
that put into their mouthes, but if not, they
even prepare War against them, and such like
the Prophet in the Light saw, and by it testified
against them, <hi>Mich.</hi> 3. 5. And all this the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
bears testimony of, which was spoken from
the Light, but is not the Light, nor the Word,
nor the Life, nor the Judge, nor the Rule, nor
the Guide, nor the Tryer of spirits; for all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to Christ, <hi>who is the Discerner of the Thoughts
and Intents of the heart,</hi> Heb. 4. 1, 2. who is <hi>the
Light,</hi> John 8. 12. who is <hi>the Word,</hi> John 1. 14.
who is <hi>the Life,</hi> John 14. 6. who blamed the
<hi>Pharisees</hi> that thought <hi>in the Scriptures to find eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life, but would not come unto him that they might
have Life,</hi> John 5. 39, 40. who is the <hi>Anointing,</hi>
who is the <hi>Guide</hi> and <hi>Teacher,</hi> and the <hi>Rule,</hi>
1. <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. who when we are going to the right
hand or to the left, cryes, <hi>This is the Way walk in
it, Isa.</hi> 30. 21. Of which the Scripture is a true
Declaration spoken from this Word of Truth,
of which Light every one hath a measure, which
unto them is the free Gift of God to profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
which Light in the Conscience reproves
for sin and iniquity, and manifests the deceit of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101884:29"/>
the heart, and checks the Creature when it
swears, or lyes, or doth amiss, telling it, <hi>that it
should not do so;</hi> and calls for Repentance and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of Life, and leads unto the same as it
is owned and followed; <hi>and as many as receive it,
receive power to become the Sons of God,</hi> Joh. 8. 12. <hi>and</hi>
1. 12. Rom. 2. 4. <hi>But he that doth evil hates the
Light, and will not bring his deeds to it, by it to be
proved, and to him it is condemnation; but he that
loves the Light brings his deeds to the Light, that it
may manifest them whether they be wrought in God,</hi>
John 3. 20, 21. But of this Light you People
and Teachers of the World are ignorant, and so
are doting upon the Scripture without, with your
dark minds there, with the blind Pharisees, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
for Life where it is not to be found, but will
not come to Christ the Light, that you might
have Life; but would cast him out of his
Throne, and exalt Scriptures above him, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them the Judge, and the Light, and the
Word, and the Life, and the Rule, and the
Guide; and thus with your dark minds you would
take the Authority from Christ and would give it
unto the dead Letter, which is but a Declaration
of these things; And thus your Leaders cause
you to err, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 12. for their own ends, and
of the Scripture they make an Idol, to get mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
by adding their own Meanings, Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Constructions upon them, which are
all the Conceivings and Imaginations of their
own hearts, by which they lead you in Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101884:29"/>
ever learning, and never able to come to
the knowledge of the Truth in your hearts; but
are looking without, doting without in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
acting and imitating out of the Light for
Life, and so in darkness, doing your own works,
which are not required at your hands, but are for
Condemnation by the Light; And so in vain
are you worshipping a God, whom ye know not,
crying up his Ordinances, and crying up his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and crying up the Scripture, exalting it
in the Place of Christ, and thus coming neer him
with your lips, and your hearts far from him;
still living in the corrupt sinful nature, ignorant
of the free Grace of God, which should lead you
to repentance and amendment of life, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.
5. 8. And because we do witness this Mystery,
which hath been hid from Ages and Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
now made manifest in us, which is, <hi>Christ
within the Hope of Glory, Col.</hi> 1. 26, 27. who is
the Light of the World, who doth enlighten eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that cometh into the World, who is the
true Shepherd, <hi>John</hi> 10. and the true Teacher,
no more to be removed into a Corner, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 20.
who is the Anointing, who teacheth all things,
and is the End of mans teaching: therefore your
Ministry of the Letter, who make a Trade and
a Gaine of the Letter, by idolizing it, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it up in the room of Christ, by taking the
Authority from Christ, and applying it to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that your minds, who are taught by them,
may the more be drawn without, to look at it,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101884:30"/>
and Idolize it, expecting Life and Salvation by it,
and no hope without it, that they may the longer
make Merchandize of you, and still uphold
their Trade, and Gain by it, do now see that this
our doctrine of Christ to be all in all, and that
without him we can do nothing, <hi>John</hi> 15. 5.
but that by him we can do all things without the
help of Scripture, or any thing else without, <hi>Phil.</hi>
4. 13. and that there is no other name under
Heaven by which we can be saved, but that he
is able to save to the utmost all that shall come
unto God by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. and that he is the
Word, and the Scripture is not; and that he is
the Light, and the Scripture is not; and that he
is the Rule and Guide, and Teache<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and Judge,
and the Scripture is not; but a Declaration of him
to be so: and that the Scripture all along witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
with our Doctrine to be one with it, and theirs
to be another Doctrine, which the Scripture will
not maintain, but the Scripture is against, and is
onely brought in for Lucres sake to satisfie their
own carnal ends, that they may bear rule by their
Means, as the false Prophets did before them,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 30, 31.</p>
            <p>And this Light all along makes them manifort
in all their Colours and false Covers, so that they
cannot hide themselves from being Deceivers,
and also this they do know, that if every one
come to know and find a Teacher within them,
which doth teach them the will of God, and
doth enable them for to obey it, so that they need
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101884:30"/>
no man to teach them; then indeed they will
no longer spend their Money upon them for that
which is not Bread, nor their Labour for that
which profitteth not, and will be a Prey unto
them no longer: So not only their Craft, and
Trade, and Idol will fail them; but also, their
great Gain and Riches will be taken from them,
and all their Honour, and Fame and Dignity
will come to nought: Therefore they in their
hot Rage, and Fierceness, and Enmity of their
Spirits, do set themselves to oppose this <hi>Light,</hi>
wheresoever it is made manifest; and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Publishers of this Doctrine, railing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them as Deceivers, &amp; Seducers &amp; Bringers
in of false Lights, and such as deny the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and would rob it of its Authority, and give
it to a Light within them (which the Priests call,
<hi>natural Light</hi>) and insufficient to lead to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
without the help of Scripture, and other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Helps; and so would set the Scripture
above the Light of Christ; saying among
themselves, <hi>If we let go the Authority of Scripture,
then all is gone;</hi> (that is to say) <hi>Take away our
Idol, then take away our Maintenance, then down
with our Ministry.</hi> So here is clear the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they stand upon, and this is the cause why
they call the Scripture their Foundation; and so
all this Authority, which they put upon the
Scripture, they take from Christ, who alone is
the Foundation of the Faithful, of whom the
Scripture is a Declaration: and so we do own it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101884:31"/>
by the same which gave it forth, which unto
us doth open it and reveal it, and manifesteth
them to be out of the Life of it, and so by the
Life thereof are judged and condemned, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is proved. And though they call it the
Word, yet in the same it doth witness against
them, and witness Christ to be the Word before
the Scripture was written, <hi>John</hi> 1. And though
they call the Scripture the Light, yet in the same
it doth witness against them, and witness Christ to
be the Light before the Scripture was written, and
is able to save to the utmost all that shall come
unto God by him; and they that climb up any
other Way, the same are Thieves and Robbers,
<hi>John</hi> 10. 1. And therefore is not a Natural Insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Light, as they that know not him
do report of him, and therefore shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be as ignorant as the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
supposed him to the Son of <hi>Joseph,</hi> yet won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at his Power, and the Works that were
done by him; as these do now wonder at the
Prosperity of this Ministration of Light, and
to see how it prevails upon the Hearts of the
people, so that they know not what to think
of it; they are not able to encounter with it,
but that they see it strikes so much at their <hi>Diana,</hi>
and lies so hard at their Foundation, so that it
makes their Building Totter, therefore the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
Priests aud Pharisees take Counsel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
saying one to another, <hi>If we let this People
alone, all men will go after them, and they will draw
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101884:31"/>
away whole Nations;</hi> therefore they take the same
course, as ever the <hi>false Prophets</hi> did, joyning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Earthly Powers to make War
with the <hi>Lamb, Persecuting, Stocking, Whipping,
Imprisoning</hi> and <hi>shamefully intreating his Messengers,</hi>
whom the Lamb sent forth to bear Testimony of
this Light in peoples Consciences (where we
have a Witness both in them that believe, and
in them that perish) and also, striving all the
wayes they can, by their Evil Incensing, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Railings, and false Accusings and Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to defame this <hi>Light,</hi> and leaven your minds
against it (that if it were possible) to put it out,
that still they might uphold their Father's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of darknes, and bear rule by their Means over
the Blind, carrying captive the minds of people:
<hi>But who is able to make War with the Lamb, or who shall
withstand the Day of his Coming?</hi> Saul, Saul, <hi>it
is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks:</hi> And though
they call the Scripture their Rule and Guide,
yet in this it witnesseth against them, to be in
<hi>Cain</hi>'s way, and <hi>Balaam</hi>'s way, and in the Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Saying
of <hi>Core,</hi> and so have not God, <hi>Jude</hi> 11.
2 <hi>John</hi> 9. but are found to be the Generation
who are born after the Flesh persecuting them that
are born after the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29. And though
they call the Scripture their Rule and Guide, yet
they receive not Power from it to enable them
to walk according to it; but are altogether er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from it, in any thing that crosseth Self: but
as many as receive the Light, receive Power to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101884:32"/>
follow it, <hi>and come out of the corrupt sinful nature,
which they live in who know not the Light,</hi> John 1. 12.
and here the Light is above the Scripture. And
though they say, <hi>the Scripture is the Judge and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Spirits,</hi> yet in the same it witnesseth against
them, to be Lyars, and bears witness of Christ
to be the Judge, and Tryer, and Searcher of
the Heart, and Discerner of the Thoughts, <hi>Heb.</hi>
4. 12. <hi>Rom. 1. 16. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 5. and <hi>that whatsoever
makes manifest is Light,</hi> Eph. 5. 13. therefore that
which makes manifest <hi>false spirits</hi> is the Light,
and not the Letter, which Light manifested and
discovered <hi>false spirits</hi> before the Scripture was
written: And also, though they say, <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the Judge and Tryer of Spirits,</hi> yet by the
Scripture they cannot discern or judge of Spirits,
else, what makes all this difference in Judgment
amongst them who profess to try Spirits by the
Scripture, and profess it to be their Rule, and
ground their Judgments upon it, yet are so
confus'd in the same, and never a one knows
which is the Truth, when as the Way is but
One? So that it follows, that they have nothing
but the Scripture without, and are still without, in
<hi>Darkness</hi> and <hi>Confusion,</hi> as all those appear to be
who call the Scripture their Rule, and Guide, and
Judge, and Tryer of Spirits, aud yet know not
the Truth; but are jangling, and rangling, and
arguing, and disputing, and contending about
the Scripture, every one with a several Judgment
upon it: surely this Distraction is not in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101884:32"/>
for it was spoken from One, and all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in one; therefore you that so profess the
Scripture, see if you can find it out by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and see where you are; <hi>but they that are
in the Light have fellowship one with another, 1 John 1.
7. and are of one heart, and one Soul,</hi> Acts 4. 32. <hi>and all
agree in one, and are Epistles wrote in one anothers heart,</hi>
2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2. and by the Light they try and discern
false spirits, and in it are able to judge them, and
open the Scriptures without wresting adding or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing,
and by it do know, <hi>they are of God, because
they love one another with the same love with which
Christ loved them, 1 John</hi> 4. it is not such love
which is to day, and to morrow cross the will, and
it is turned into wrath and anger; nay that love
stands in the corrupt will, but this love stands in
the bond of peace which doth indure; and here
again the light is above the Scripture; and though
they say the light must be received from the
Scripture, yet in this the Scripture doth witness
against them, and bears witness of Christ to be the
light of the World, <hi>and doth enlighten every one that
cometh into the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they that could never read letter of the book
have this light, which is sufficient to teach them
and lead them into all Truth, after they come to
the knowledge of it, &amp; from this light the Scripture
was spoken, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. and without this light
none can read the Scripture with understanding;
and here the light is before the Scripture, and
out of it all the Children of Darkness are shut
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101884:33"/>
with their busie minds and vain contending spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
and though they say, they must receive life
and salvation from the Scripture, yet in this the
Scripture witnesseth against them, and testifies
of Christ to be the alone Fountain of Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<hi>and that there is no other name under Heaven
by which we can be saved, Psal.</hi> 30. 9. and 144. 10.
And that the Pharisees had the Scripture, yet had
not the Light, neither could see that he was the
Christ, though the Scripture bare testimony of
him, or either would come unto him for Life and
Salvation, but trusted in the Scripture, thinking
there to find eternal Life, and therein found it not,
<hi>John</hi> 5. 39, 40. As all you are now who are seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the living among the dead, and here again
the light is above the Scripture, which light is
within us the hope of glory. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 26, 27. and
those that cannot witness this are in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
though they have the Scripture with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. and from it we receive life
and salvation, and from no other, and this alone
is our Guide, Teacher, Judge, and Law-giver,
if we never see letter, <hi>Luke 1. 79. John 6. 45. Isa.</hi>
33. and this alone is the Ground and Foundation
of our Faith and Hope, by which we are made
able to cry Abba Father, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 11. Rom.</hi> 8.
15. And here it is not self that judgeth or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns,
but Christ that liveth in us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20.
and it is not self that justifies us, but Christ that
liveth in us; and here Christ is exalted into his
Throne, and the Scripture owned in its place,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101884:33"/>
without contempt or undervaluting. And they
are found the Ministers of Antichrist, who would
cast Christ out of his Throne, and take the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
out of its place to exalt above him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
to it that Authority which alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
unto him, for their own by secret self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends;
so that in that they apply such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the Scripture, they in the same Rob
Christ of it, and undervalue him, as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
did, who thought in the Scriptures to find
Eternal Life, but would not come to Christ
that they might have Life; in whose steps ye
and your Teachers are now found, professing
Christ in words, but in Life denying him, and
therefore must be judged and condemned by him,
as they were. And if you Priests do alledge,
there is a false Light, as well as a True Light;
I Answer, That is it in you, which blinds
your Minds so that you cannot receive this
Gospel, but from you it is hid, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3,
4. And therefore you bring another Gospel,
calling the four Books <hi>Mattew, Mark, Luke,</hi>
and <hi>John,</hi> the Gospel; in which, these four
Books will Witness against you, and bear
Witness of Christ to be the Gospel, which is
the Power of God unto Salvation; who is the
Lamb of God, slain from the Foundation of
the World, who came to take away the Sins
of the World; and blessed are they that are
not offended in him; <hi>John 1. 26. and vers.</hi> 13.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101884:34"/>
               <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 23. And also, that is a false Light
in you, which leads you into the Form or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance,
or outward Shew of Holiness, but
denies the Life and Power, 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3. 5. and
to profess the Scripture to be your Rule, but
in Life and Practice deny it; and to be short,
leads into a Profession without Possession; but
that which leads into the Life and Power is
no false Light; for it leads into the Possession,
before the Profession, and so the Profession is
from the Possession; but your Profession is
from anothers Possession, and so Boast in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others
line, by which you beguile both your
selves, and others; and therefore in that
you go about to Arm your selves with the
Scripture, to oppose the Light, by exalting
it above the Light, thinking thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base
the Light, and so to keep Peoples Minds
from the Light, that they may still remain in
Darkness and Blindness under you; You do
but in the same bring a Weapon to cut off
your own heads, and raise a War to destroy
your selves, and increase more light to the
people, and manifest your selves odious, and
to be the Blind Guides of the Nation; who are
to be denyed and turned away from by us,<note place="margin">2 John <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10.</note> as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
and to be held as accursed, who bring an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Doctrine in oposition to the True Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which is held forth in the Scripture; for
the Scripture and the Light agree in one,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101884:34"/>
from both which you are shut, with jangling
contentious spirits, by which you would wrest
the Scripture out of its place, to clash against
its Original, thereby to uphold your Father
Antichrist's Kingdom, and therein do the more
Manifest your selves to be the Ministers of
Antichrist, who under Profession of the True
Christ do oppose him, and make War with him,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13, 14, 15. but your Weapons are weak,
as is daily made manifest.</p>

opposeth God in his Kingdom, daubing the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

who doth not dare to call God a Hard

which it is not able to perform; and thus
he deceives the Creature, and draws out of the
Commands of God, and out of the Fear of God,
which preserves from Evil; and so he draws into
Carelesness and Slothfulness, and begets a liberty
therein; and because of those things cometh the
Wrath of God upon the Children of Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 5, 6.</note>

surely dye; for God doth know, that in the day you eat
thereof, you shall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil.</hi>
And thus he deceived them, and drew them out
of the Commands of God, and out of the Fear
of God, into the Disobedience, and so came the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101884:44"/>
Curse of God upon them, by hearkening to him,

Wives and Children, decking and adorning
themselves according to their Proud minds, to
make the Creature seem something in its own
eyes,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 3.</note> and in the eyes of others; and those are

ability of the Creature; but it shewes it selfe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101884:51"/>
the most in Apparel; but the Light of God
makes manifest the Heart, where lies the Root.</p>
               <p>Covetousness is a Fruit of the corrupt Tree;
see whether your Teachers be covetous, yea or

and Hundred or two Hundred Pounds in the Year,
more or less, as they can get it; and some have
Money for Smoak passing up the Chimnies,

told us we were Christians, when we were Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
and knew not God;<note place="margin">Mich. 3. 5.</note> so sewed Pillows
under our Arm-holes; and appeared to us in
Sheeps Cloathing; but now we that are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
into the Flock of Christ, by Christ our eyes
are opened, and now we see that we profited
nothing by them, but were deceived by them,
so we cannot put into their Mouthes, nor
Maintain them any longer in their Deceipts,<note place="margin">Ezek. 13. 18, 19.</note>
but testifie against them; and so they Sue
us at the Law, and hale us before Magistrates,
and take Tribble Damage, and appear Rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Wolves, and would destroy us and our
Families, and would live upon our Estates by
Compulsion, and an outward Law; and some
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101884:52"/>
of us they cause to be put in Prison, and call
us Hereticks, Deluders, and Deceivers, false
Prophets, and yet could live on our Estates, and
covet our Silver and Gold, and Estates, and
by your Law and Justices Warrants straine upon
them, and so seek ours, and would destroy us;
like the false Prophets which <hi>Hosea</hi> declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,<note place="margin">Hos. 6. 9</note>
who as a company of Robbers wait for a
man,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 3</note> so the company of Priests murder in the way
by consent; and also the false Teachers, which <hi>Peter</hi>
foretold of, who through covetousness, with feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
words make merchandize of the People, or we,
who are made merchandize of, though we take
none of their stoln Wares, and make merchandize
of none, God is our Witness. And see if these be
not the false Teachers which <hi>Paul</hi> fore-told of to
come in the last times, <hi>Covetous, Proud, Boasters,
Blasphemers, Disobedient, Unthankful, Unholy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Naturall Affection, Truce-breakers, False-accusers,
Incontinent, Fierce, Despisers of those that are good,
Traytors, Heady, High-minded, Lovers of Pleasures
more then Lovers of God, having a Form of Godliness,
but denying the power thereof, from such turn away. For
of this sort are they that creep into Houses, who lead
silly women captive, full of sin and corruption, and
divers lusts ever learning, and never coming to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Truth:</hi> Now as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi>
withstood <hi>Moses,</hi> so do they withstand the Truth:
<hi>Men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the Faith,</hi>
2 Tim. 1. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Now see if your Teachers be not Lovers of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101884:52"/>
their own selves, who seek for the Fleece, and
regard not the Flock; but feed with the
Fat, aud clothe with the Wool, and live by
the Sweat of others Brows, living at Ease, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
the Creation, and spending it upon their
Lusts, they,<note place="margin">Ezek. 34.</note> and their Wives and Children,
nourishing their Hearts as in a day of Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and of changable Minds, according to the
Government of Man,<note place="margin">James 5.</note> that they may save and
shelter themselves under the Power and Will
of Man, as the false Prophets did, by which
they stood, and were upheld; and the same
that Prayed for the <hi>King and Realm,</hi> the same
Pray now for the <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> and the <hi>State of
England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now see whether these be false Prophets, or
we, who have forsaken our outward Livings,
and Estates, and Countries, and Acquaintance,
and come into Strange Countries, and lite
among Dogs, and Wolves, and Heathens, as
Christ saith,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 16, 17.</note> he sends us forth as Sheep among
Wolves, which are of the Priests Flock; and
suffers our Bodies to be Stock'd, Ston'd, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd,
Revil'd, Imprison'd and shamefully In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
and love not our Lives unto Death for
Christ's sake; he is our Witness and only Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,
in whose Power we stand and are upheld,
contrary to the Will of Man.</p>
               <p>And see whether we or your Teachers are
Covetous, as it is before proved; and Proud,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101884:53"/>
as it is before proved: And see if they be not
Boasters, who boast that they are the Ministers
of Christ, and sent of God, when as they are
come but from <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Will of Man: And boast of Gifts,
and sell them for Money; when the Scripture
saith,<note place="margin">Acts 8. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>The Gift of God is not to be bought with Money:</hi>
And they boast, they are the mediate Means
ordain'd by God; when as they are ordain'd by
their Parents, or some other; and their Means
are Mediate,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 16.</note> and the Apostles Immediate;<note place="margin">John 15 6,</note> and
<hi>the Way is but One,</hi> saith Christ; he that hath
an Ear to hear, let him hear. And see if
they be not Blasphemers, who say, They are
the Ministers of Christ, and some of them Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards,
some Proud, some Covetous, and are
Evil Examples to all that follow them, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, or his Apostles, who said, <hi>Walk as you
have us for Examples;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 3.</note> and here they abide not
in the Doctrine of Christ,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 3.</note> and so have not God,
as in 2 <hi>John</hi> 9. And this is Blasphemy, to say,
They are the Mouth of the Lord; and are the
Mouth of the Devil, teaching Lyes and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies;
telling the People that are of their
Flock, <hi>They are Christians, and of the Flock of Christ;</hi>
when as they are all manuer of unrighteous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
who live without God in the World: and
tell them, <hi>Their Children are the Flock of Christ,
when they are sprinkled on the Face with a little Water;</hi>
when as they grow up in all manner of Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:101884:53"/>
without the Fear of God, or the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God; and they are <hi>Heathen,</hi> that know
not God; and this is Blasphemy, to say, <hi>Christ is
the Head of</hi> Heathens, for he is the Head of his
Flock: And they tell People, <hi>that a House of Lime
and Stone is the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 10. 15.</note> whenas the Church is the
Body of Christ,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 11.</note> and this is Blasphemy:<note place="margin">Vers. 24.</note> Now
see whether we or your Teachers, be more like
Deceivers, Lyars and Blasphemers, and let every
one's Life preach him forth, and judge him: and
see if they be not Lovers of Pleasures more then
Lovers of God, who delight in Musick, in Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
in Carding, and Dicing, and Hawking, and
Hunting, and all manner of Pleasures &amp; Delights.
Now see whether they or we be like the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
who never used any such thing, but all their
Delight was in the Work of Christ; but <hi>They that
are of the Flesh, mind the things of the Flesh;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>and they
that are of the Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>the things of the Spirit.</hi> Now see
if they have not a Form of Godliness, but deny
the Power and Life which the Apostles lived in;
therefore <hi>from such turn away;</hi> And if you find that
our Lives be contrary to what we profess, from us
turn away also. <hi>But of this sort are they who creep into
Houses, and lead silly People captive:</hi> Now see if they
do not creep into Steeple-houses, and say, <hi>that's
the Place, and no where else,</hi> and lead silly People
captive, <hi>laden with Sins and divers lusts, ever lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and never coming to the Knowledge of the Truth:</hi>
Some learn thirty, some fifty, some sixty years,
and above, and still full Sin, and as dark and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101884:54"/>
blind and ignorant of the Things of God as ever:
And they will teach, <hi>You shall never be made free
from Sin, so long as you are upon the Earth;</hi> and
hereby they set up their Rest in the Devil's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>And if you do alledge, <hi>We creep into Houses;</hi>
I answer, The Apostle witnessed the same where
he said,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>I have taught you publickly from House to House;</hi>
And our Meetings are publick to any who will
come amongst us, sometimes in no House, but in
the Fields or Commons, as the Apostles witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 20.</note> and we find the Lord amongst us,<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 20.</note> being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in his Name, according to his Promise:
Now see by their Fruits, if your Teachers be not
the Deceivers, which are foretold of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
who as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withstood <hi>Moses,</hi>
so do they withstand the Truth by all the Wayes
they can, as it is before proved; for <hi>Jannes</hi> and
<hi>Jambres</hi> were the Magicians of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 7. 11, 12.</note> that imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Moses;</hi> so those University Men by their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
Arts, Inventions and Imaginations, and
studying old Authors, have gotten the Form of the
Prophets, Christ and his Apostles Words, to trade
with, but deny the Life and Power, and so are
Traytors to Christ, who are Men of corrupt Minds,
and Reprobates concerning the Faith; but they
shall proceed no further; for their Folly shall be
made manifest to all Men: Now he that desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s
to see, may see, and let all who are wise hearted
judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if you do alledge,</hi> They have been long, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101884:54"/>
have reigned long, and we are new come up, and
it is a New Way; and we come to breed Divisions and
Dissention.</p>
               <p>I answer, The more is their Shame; and by
that the more they are seen to be those <hi>that run
and the Lord never sent them, therefore they profit not
the People at all,</hi> who have reigned so long, and
wrought no better Reformation in the Land,<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 31.</note> but it
flows as much in Iniquity and all manner of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness
as ever, and the People that are taught
by them, as ignorant and as dark to the Things of
God as ever; and here they would keep them by
an outward Power, but the Day hath made them
manifest, and the Scripture fulfilled, which the
Apostle spoak of, who said,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>It was the last Times
then;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 20.</note> and since they have continued, you may
know them by their Fruits; they profess Christ
in Words, but in Life deny him; and the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Iniquity hath reigned a long time,<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 16.</note> and
there hath been a time of cruel Darkness,<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 3, 4.</note> and all
the World hath wondered after,<note place="margin">Vers. 12.</note> and worshipped
the Beast and his Image, and he hath reigned, and
by him the false Prophet hath reigned, which
hath deceived the Nations; but now Light is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
out of Darkness,<note place="margin">Rev. 16. 20.</note> and shines forth now in these<note place="margin">Joel 2. 28, 29.</note>
latter Dayes in the Sons and Daughters of Men,
according to the Promise of God, whereby the
Wiles of Satan are made manifest to the Glory of
God.</p>
               <p>And now is the Separation, the Sheep from the
Goats, the Wheat from the Tares, and Christ is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:101884:55"/>
come to set at Variance, Father against Son, and
Son against Father, and Wife against the Man,
and the Man against the Wife,<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 3.</note> and to turn the
World upside down; and this is the Cause why
the World rages, <hi>And this is the Condemnation of
the World,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 17. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Light is come into the World,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 3. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>and they
love Darkness rather then Light, because their Deeds
are Evil:</hi> and so to those, who are in Darkness,
it is new; but we witness it is no new Way, but
the same which was, is, and is to be forever; and the
same Signs follow, but the adulterous Generation
cannot see it, but they that believe shall see and
be healed: And though the Beast and false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and those that bear the Mark of the Beast,
do now make War with the Lamb &amp; the Saints, for
to uphold their Kingdom; yet the Lamb, the
King of the Saints shall overcome,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 10.</note> and to him the
Nations shall bow;<note place="margin">Rev. 19. 20.</note> and the Beast and false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,<note place="margin">Isa. 30. 33.</note>
and all that bear the Mark of the Beast, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lake for them prepared of old, shall go;
and for this End we are come out of our Countries,
and outward Habitations &amp; Possessions, to preach
to every Conscience the Eternal Truth as it is in
Jesus, the Everlasting Gospel; as we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it freely, freely we give, and as we preach
the Gospel, we live of the Gospel; and this
is our End and no other End, God is our Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>We are accused <hi>to deny the Scripture,</hi> which is
false; for we witness the Life thereof, and by the
same do we witness the Scriptures to be Truth,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101884:55"/>
and serviceable in its Place, &amp; was written for our
Admonition, upon whom the Ends of the World
is come; and to us it is given to know, but to the
World in Parables; and he that would go about
to unfold the Parables to the dark Minds, by the
Serpentine Wit and Imagination,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 11</note> he must be kept
out of the Scripture;<note place="margin">Luke 8. 10.</note> and he who takes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and makes a Trade of them, professing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
them, and so gets a Living by them, which
was spoaken forth freely, he is a Deceiver, and
must be shut out of the Scripture: and who reads or
takes the Scripture to talk or discourse of, and is
ignorant of the Life, must be kept out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for all those run in with their Serpentine
Wit &amp; Imaginations, wresting them for their own
Ends, adding and diminishing, to their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
and so he must be shut out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for hence arise all these Sects and Opinions
in the World, running into the Scripture with
their Wit, Imaginations and dark Minds, one
imagining one Way, and another another Way,
and one of this Opinion, and another of that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion;
but Opinion is no Assurance, but is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
and every one out of the Way, because they
want the Life, which is the Mystery; and this is
the Difference between all Sects and Opinions and
the Infallible Truth; and so they come not in
by the Door, but are climbing up another Way,
and so are shut out of the Kingdom; but the same
which gave them forth, the same can open them,
and to it they are no Mystery nor Parable, nor
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101884:56"/>
need any Meaning; <hi>For they are of no private Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
nor came not in the old Time by the Will of
Man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>but Holy Men of God spake as they were mov'd by the
Holy Ghost;</hi> neither can the Will of Men open them,
but the same which spake them forth, the same
can open them,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 20, 21.</note> and spake them forth freely: <hi>So
let him that hath a Dream; tell a Dream, and he that hath
my Word, let him speak my Word faithfully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the Chaff to the Wheat,</hi> saith the Lord?
So he that hath the Letter, let him speak the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and he that hath the Life, let him speak the
Life: What is the Husk to the Kernel? And
what should Swine do with Pearls,<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 28.</note> whose Life is
Husks,<note place="margin">John 1. 1.</note> and there they feed? He that can receive,
let him; the same which gave it forth, the same
can open it: And he who saith, <hi>The Letter is the
Word,</hi> is a Deceiver, and errs, not knowing the
Scripture; for the Scripture saith, that <hi>In the
beginning was the Word, and the Word was God;</hi> and
the Word of the Lord came to the Prophets,<note place="margin">Jer. 1. 1.</note> and
they spake from the Word of the Lord;<note place="margin">Jer. 2. 1.</note> and the
<hi>Word became Flesh, and dwelt among</hi> the Apostles,

this the Apostles, in whom the Word dwelt,<note place="margin">John 1. 14.</note> bare
witness of, and have left it upon record;<note place="margin">Rev. 19. 13.</note> and we
witness the same, the Word is the same,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12, 13.</note> which
was, is, and is to be forever: and who putteth
the Letter for the Word is blind, and putteth the

Shadow for the Substance, and must be shut out
of the Scripture; and he who saith, <hi>The Letter is the
Light,</hi> is in Darkness, and errs, not knowing the
Scripture, which declareth of the Light, which
<hi>John</hi> came to bear Witness of, who was not the
Light, but testified of the Light, <hi>which was the

and his own received him not; but as many as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him, to them he gives Power to become the Sons
of God;</hi> and this we witness, and by the same
Light do we discern and testifie against him to be
in Darkness and Blindness, and is a Deceiver,
who puts the Letter for the Light, and so draws
Peoples Minds off from the Light within them,
to the Letter without them, seeking the Living
among the Dead, thinking to find Life in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
without them, as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did, and will not
come unto Christ,<note place="margin">John 5. 39, 40.</note> that they might have Life; and
also they must be shut out of the Scripture, as the
<hi>Pharisees</hi> were: And he also that saith, <hi>The Letter is
the Rule and Guide of the People of God,</hi> is without,
feeding upon the Husk, and is ignorant of the true
Light,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 73. &amp; 19. 15.</note> which was before the Letter was,<note place="margin">John 16. 13.</note> which
all the Children of God were and are guided by,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 14.</note>
and spoak and speaks the Letter from which was
before the Letter was; and with this the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
witnesseth: and who is guided by this cannot
walk contrary to the Letter, nor deny it; but they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101884:57"/>
know how to use it in its Place, and see in what
Condition it was spoaken, and it witnesseth with
them both in Words and Actions;<note place="margin">John 7. 15.</note> and they that
have this, have and need the Mystery within,
though they cannot read the Letter without, nor
ever learned, as it was with Christ, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 15.</note> and they who
are never so learned without,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 11.</note> and can read and
understand all Tongues and Languages without,
and do not read the Scripture within, only feed
upon the Husks, &amp; are ignorant of the Life, which
is the Mystery which is hid from the Wise and
Prudent, and revealed unto the Ignorant, as it was
from the <hi>Scribes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 7. 48, 49.</note> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and <hi>High Priests,</hi> and
was revealed to those whom they counted Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and Cursed, and knew not the Law.</p>
               <p>And they who take the Letter to be their Rule
can't walk according to it, because they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Light, which opens and leads into the
Life, which they who spake them forth lived in;
but Drunkards, &amp; Swearers, and Proud, and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
and Covetous Lustful, Envious Ones, and all
Manner of Unrighteous Persons will take the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to talk of, and say, <hi>it is their Rule and Guide,</hi>
but are out of the Life thereof, and so by it are
condemned;<note place="margin">Luke 15. 15, 16.</note> and those are the Swine that are
feeding upon the Husk without, and have gotten
the Form, but are out of the Life and Power, and
put the Shadow for the Substance, and so live in
Darkness, and knows not whether he goeth: but
they that read with the single Eymay understand;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101884:57"/>
for the Scripture is within, and was read within,
before it was read without. Now Silence all the
Study and Wisdom of Man.</p>
               <p>We are accused to <hi>Deny the Baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Baptism we own, which is the Baptism of
Christ with the Holy Ghost and with Fire; but we
deny all other; for there is but one Lord, one Faith,
one Baptism,<note place="margin">Mat. 3. 11.</note> one God and Father of all; and they
who would have one Baptism outward,<note place="margin">Eph. 4, 5, 6.</note> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inward, would have two Baptisms, when
the Scripture saith, the Baptism is but One; and
whosoever have the Baptism Outward, are the
same they were before; but the Baptism of Christ
makes a New Creature, and this I witness; for
I received Water upon my Face,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 3.</note> as my Parents
told me, which they called Baptism: but I grew
up a <hi>Heathen,</hi> as all other Children do, and no New
Creature, though my Parents were counted Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
among the World and their Priests;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> but
now I witness the Baptism of Christ,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> by One Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
into One Body; and now I witness a New
Creature; old things are past away, and all things
become New: And now I see the other to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal

so a meer Delusion; and all are <hi>Heathens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 4.</note> and no
<hi>Christians,</hi> who cannot witness this Baptism, who

or no Water availeth nothing, but a New
Creature; for all by Nature are the Children of
Wrath, and except they be born again, they
cannot enter; and as for the Baptism of Water,
which the Apostles used, it being a Figure for its
Time, the Power went along with it, and the
Disciples received the Holy Ghost when they
were Baptized; but none can witness this, who
set themselves of acting or imitating the Apostles,
and so take it up by Imitation, and their Ground
is the Letter, and are not guided to it by the same
Spirit which guided the Apostles; and so they
are the same after Water, as before; and so now
Water (or no Water) availeth any Thing, but a
New Creature; for Water was but for its time,
though many in Darkness have now got the Form
and are groping in it for Life, but want the Life
and Power, and so <hi>from such turn away.</hi>

               <p>We are accused <hi>to deny the Supper of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Supper of the Lord we own,<note place="margin">John 6. 54, 55, 56, 57.</note> which is the

here they all feed upon one, and are of one Heart

for Saints are Spiritual, and their Communion is
Spiritual and Eternal; and this we witness, who are
of one Heart and one Mind, who are in the New

and here all <hi>Drunkards</hi> are shut out, and all <hi>Lyars,

Adulterers, Proud, Covetous, Lustful and Envious

of the New Covenant,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9, 10.</note> and are without, feeding

for the Bread which the World breaks is Carnal

Body, and goeth into the Belly, and so passeth
out into the Dangil; and so likewise the Cup
which they drink, and so the Communion and
Fellowship of the World passeth away; but this
is no Nourishment to the Soul, but still the Soul
lyes in Death; and here is no Communion, but
Natural, Outward and Carnal, of several Minds
and Hearts, full of Filthiness and Uncleanness,
which is the Table of Devils, eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own Damnation, not discerning the
Lord's Body,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 21.</note> which is Spiritual, which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

God,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 12.</note> who was the first Birth, he offered up a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the Earth,<note place="margin">Jam. 5. 5. 16.</note> but God had no Respect to it;

his Sacrifice God had Respect to; so the
Prayers of the Faithful and Righteous God doth
accept, and they avail, and what comes from his
own,<note place="margin">Exo. 40. 12, 13.</note> which is the second Birth: his own is pure, &amp;
what comes from it is pure;<note place="margin">Luke 1. 3.</note> and God who is pure,

                  <note place="margin">Job 14. 4.</note> for his Sacrifice
must be without Spot or Blemish:<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> and that which
comes from an unclean Heart is spotted,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 2. 22</note> and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and unclean; for nothing that is pure can come
forth of an unclean Vessel: But who can witness
the second Birth, and that the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
hath bruised the Serpents Head, which is the
first Promise, and Faith which purifieth the Heart,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101884:59"/>
then that which comes out is pure, proceeding
from a pure single Heart; and this Prayer God
receives, and he hath Respect to it, and this we
own and witness, and this comes from the second
Birth, which is pure; for the first Birth is unclean,
and out of the Command of God, in the Fall, in
the Wrath, in the Peevishness, and Perversness,
and Frowardness, <hi>Cain</hi>-like, and the Seed of the
Serpent is first in every one, and rules the Head;
but the Promise is, <hi>The Seed of the Woman shall bruise
the Serpents Head:</hi> So you who are not come to
this, are still in the Fall, and are not come to the
first Promise, so all your self-acting and imitating,
thinking to merit with your Prayers and Praises,
Singings, and Duties, and Worships, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
which are all in vain; and you are sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
to an unknown God,<note place="margin">John 4. 22.</note> a Sacrifice of the
Earth from the first Nature, which God hath no
Respect to; and the flaming Sword is set against
that,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 5. 22.</note> to keep from the Tree of Life; for both
Drunkards,<note place="margin">Isa. 1. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</note> and Swearers, Lyars, Proud, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
and all Manner of Unrighteous Persons are
offering up Sacrifices, and are in their Formal
Worships and Duties, thinking that is sufficient
to pacifie for their Sins, and yet do not repent:
But saith the Lord,<note place="margin">Prov. 23. 16.</note>

                  <hi>When you spread

cease to do Evil, learn to do well.</hi> So it is the Heart
that the Lord requireth, and where your Treasure

               <p>The true Ministry of Christ we own and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

the Letter and Form to trade with, which was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
forth freely, and deny the Life and Power,
those we deny &amp; their Ministry; And all those who
go to get human Learning, and are certain Years,
as it were serving Apprentiship, pretending to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Divinity, and when their time is expired, they
go amongst ignorant, blind People, and get a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Place, and a certain Wage, and so sell that
which they studyed and got into the Brain, and
those which receive it,<note place="margin">Mich. 3. 10.</note> get it into the Brain;
and so they live upon Dust, which is the Serpents
Meat, feeding upon the Tree of Knowledge, both
Priest and People, death feeding death, and with
the Notion begets into the Notion, and feeding
the Carnal Mind with the Carnal Letter; and
this is the Cause why <hi>Drunkards, Swearers, Lyars,
Proud, Covetous, Envious, Wrathful</hi> and <hi>Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Ones,</hi> and all <hi>Unrighteous Persons,</hi> have gotten the

Letter to talk of, or discourse of, though in the Ale-house
or Tipling-house; but this Ministry works
no Reformation, only hath the Form, and leads
into the Form, and denyes the Life and Power,
which is neither to be bought nor sold for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
so from such we turn away, who come by
the Will of Man, and approved by the Will of
Man, and are upheld by the Will of Man, and
not by the Will of God; and their Call and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
we deny, which is mediate, and formal I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
and the Invention of Man, and so a meer
Delusion. And this is the Cause why the Land so

&amp; no better Reformation wrought amongst
them; their Ministry is so dark, and dead and cold,
and yet the Land full of Teachers, and yet the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

which we own is no new Call, nor no new Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
but the same which was with the Prophets

and here is the Difference of the Ministers of the

World, and the Ministers of Christ; the one comes
by the Will of Man, the other by the Will of God;
&amp; the one is upheld by the Will of man, the other

the Life &amp; Substance; and the Effects and Fruits of
their Ministry make them manifest;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 5</note> but <hi>from such
turn away,</hi> who have the Form, but not the Life and
Power; for they are meer Deceivers and Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
bewitch People from the Truth, holding forth
the Shadow instead of the Substance; and what
is the Shadow to the Substance? Or, what is the

               </p>
               <p>We are accused <hi>to deny all Magistracy and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, This is false; for we own it in its
Place;<note place="margin">1 John 3. 4.</note> for whilst there is Transgression, there
must be a Law; and while the Devil hath Power
over Man, there will be Transgression: so the
Law was added because of Transgression,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 29.</note> and the
Devil was the Cause of it; so there must be a
Law without, to keep those who are without the
Fear of God in Subjection, else they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
one another, and <hi>Cain</hi> would destroy <hi>Abel;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 14.</note>
for this is the Devil's Work; and so for this End
was the Law given forth, to curb Evil-Doers,
and to preserve and encourage them that do well:
And it was according to that in the Conscience,
Just, Holy, and Good, according to the Will of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101884:62"/>
God, and serviceable in its Place. And true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
according to the Law of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 12.</note> is ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
in its Place:<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 15.</note> And all Magistrates who
fear God, and hate Covetousness,<note place="margin">Rom 8. 1.</note> and are guided
by the Light of God in the Conscience,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 23.</note> and ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ecute
the Law in its Place,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 8.</note> without Partiality and
Respect of Persons,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23. 3.</note> and such are serviceable in
their Place;<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 15, 16.</note> and this we own, and honour, and
are subject to for Conscience sake:<note place="margin">Prov. 2. 28.</note> but the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
are from under the outward Law;<note place="margin">Prov. 29. 10.</note> for they
are a Law unto themselves;<note place="margin">Isa. 14. 15.</note> neither is there
need of any Law amongst them,<note place="margin">James 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Who walk not after
the Flesh, but after the Spirit; for against such there is
no Law: But they that walk after the Flesh, cannot please
God;</hi> neither know, how to rule or govern, who
cannot witness their own Wills subjected by the
Law of God in the Heart, but are guided by their
own Wills, and stand in their own Wills; and
such wink at Deceit, and rule with Partiality and
Respect of Persons, and so transgress the Law of
God, which respects no man's Person; and also
give forth Laws in their own Wills, which take
hold of the Righteous,<note place="margin">Hos. 14. 8.</note> persecute the Righteous, &amp;
countenance &amp; encourage the <hi>Heathen,</hi> who know
not God; so <hi>Cain</hi> slayes <hi>Abel</hi> within them, and they
suffer <hi>Cain</hi> to slay <hi>Abel</hi> without them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Ungodly have more Liberty in the Nation
then the Righteous; and so the Land abounds with
Iniquity, Oppression and Treachery, because such
corrupt Magistrates wink at Deceits for Carnal
Ends, and uphold Iniquity and Oppression, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101884:62"/>
tread Truth under foot; and this is the Cause why
the Land so abounds with all Manner of Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and Deceit, Falshood, Tyranny, Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and Persecution, and yet full of Magistrates
and Officers: And corrupt Magistrates put corrupt
Magistrates in Office; and so they bear with, and
wink at one another, and feed and nourish up De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
amongst them, unless they cross one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Will, and then they are as much in Deceit
on the other side, seeking and perverting the
Law for Revenge; and such as these uphold these
corrupt Ministers and false Prophets, which the
Nation swarms of;<note place="margin">Hest. 3.</note> and they can have a Law to
maintain their Deceit,<note place="margin">Dan. 1. 3.</note> and uphold them in Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;<note place="margin">Isa. 23.</note>
and so the Beast upholds the false Prophet,<note place="margin">Isa. 5. 27. 29.</note>
and they combine together against the simple,<note place="margin">Psal. 82. 1, 3.</note> and
so the Law is made a stalking-horse to deceive the
simple; and they will pervert and wrest the Law
out of its Place, and act contrary to their own
Law against the Righteous: And such Magistrates
and such Government we honour not, but deny
and testifie against it, as the Prophets of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
did; for by such Magistrates and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
did the Righteous ever suffer; and for the
same Testimony of a pure Conscience, I have,
and do suffer by such corrupt Magistrates, and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
more in the Nation, who are redeemed out
of Transgression, <hi>who walk not after the Flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>but
after the Spirit:</hi> And <hi>Haman,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hos. 4. 18.</note> who stood in the
corrupt Will, would have destroyed <hi>Mordecai,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he crossed his Will, and could not bow to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101884:63"/>
him; and also <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Nebuchadonozer,</hi> and
<hi>Herod,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 6. 17, &amp;c.</note> who beheaded <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hest. 3. 8.</note> who stood in their
own Wills; but the Hands of the Lord they did
not escape. And so corrupt Magistrates say, <hi>We
deny all Magistracy and Government,</hi> as <hi>Haman</hi> did;
but Christ comes to fulfil and end all outward
Laws and Government of Man, and he himself
will reign; for as Truth and Righteousness grows,
the Law is fulfilled; and passeth away, and the
Lyon and the Lamb lye down together; and this
is the Cause why corrupt Magistrates beat down
the Truth as much as they can, and so to uphold
themselves; but God will deliver his own, and
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> will he plague and confound: But such
Magistrates as are guided by the Light of God in
the Conscience, and rule and govern by it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Partiality or Respect of Persons,</hi> in <hi>Singleness of
Heart, discharging their Consciences before the Lord,</hi>
and <hi>executing the Law in its Place,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 3, 4.</note> such Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
and such Government we own &amp; honour
in our Hearts; for <hi>such are a Terror to Evil-Doers,
and for the Praise &amp; Encouragement of those that do well;</hi>
and such <hi>bear not the Sword in vain, but stand in the
Will of God, which is a Cross to their own Wills, and
rule for God, and not for themselves;</hi> and this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is of God, and not of Man, nor after the
Will of Man; neither takes hold of any tender
Conscience, nor oppresses it, but stands in the
Place where it is set; and some such Magistrates
there have been in the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who witness the Law of God set up in their
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:101884:63"/>
Hearts, and feared God, and hated Covetousness
and testified against those who did not; and so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Magistrates sought to put them out: So let
all who are single-hearted judge, who are destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
to true Magistracy and Government.</p>
               <p>We are accused <hi>to be destructive to all Superiority &amp;
Honour, Breeding and Manners,</hi> because we cannot
<hi>put off our Hats,</hi> not follow the <hi>Fashions of the World,</hi>

observe it not so much as the other; but their
Minds are more set upon the Earth and Earthly

Preferment in the World, and would be exalted

whom there is no Partiality, nor Respect

Thousand; and here God alone is King,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12, 13. Acts 4. 32. Rom. 6. 4, 5.</note> and he
alone is honoured, exalted and worshipped, no
more after the Flesh, but after the Spirit; for
we have no other God in whom our Hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light:
And here proud <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his Image is

Worships, which are after the Flesh, and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

knows where Christ comes,<note place="margin">Rev. 19.</note> he comes to take his
Kingdom from him, and cast him down into the

               </p>

Noble, wheresoever it is born up, and who can
witness to the Head of the Serpent bruised,
and the Seed of God born up to reign and rule;
there is true Nobility; there is true Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
no more after the Flesh, hut after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101884:66"/>
and this is to be honoured; for Honour is

or Ploughman,<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 7.</note> Herdsman or Shepherd,
wheresoever it rules without Respect of Persons;
and here, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom
Honour; and this is no more after the Flesh, but
after the Spirit: And here all the true Prophets
of God were Noblemen and Gentlemen, sprung
of the Noble Seed,<note place="margin">1 King. 19. 19.</note> though of the Nobles and
great Ones of the Earth they were disdain'd,<note place="margin">Amos 7. 14, 15.</note> &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
because according to the World they
were of low Degree, some of them Ploughmen,
some Herdsmen,<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 3. Deut. 37. 5.</note> some Shepherds; and therefore
they persecuted them and destroyed them, yet
they were Gentile and bore all. Christ was No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
sprang of the Noble Seed, though of the
great Ones and Nobles of the Earth he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
reproached and scorned to be the King of
the Jews, because according to the World he was
of low Degree, and supposed to be a Carpenter's
Son; so they spit upon him, and disdained him,
and crucified him, yet he was gentile and bore all.
The Apostles were Noble,<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 55, 56, 57.</note> sprung of the Noble
Seed, though of the Nobles and great Ones of the
Earth they were despised and disdained, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
because according to the World they
were of Low Degree, some of them Fishermen,
and the like, and came to turn the World upside
down; so they were despised, persecuted and
killed, yet they were gentile, and bore all: But
those were all Noble, sprung of the Noble Seed, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101884:66"/>
so are all now who are of the same Seed; and those
were all gentile, sprung of the gentile Seed, &amp; those
have the Nature, but not the Name; and to those
belongs the true Honour, not after the Flesh, but
after the Spirit; for they denyed the Honour of the
World; and therefore Christ said, <hi>I receive not
Honour from Men;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> and said to his Apostles, <hi>Be ye

                  <note place="margin">John 5. 44.</note> And here the
true Honour is no more after the Flesh, but after
the Spirit: And here you who are giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
out-side earthly Honour, you are in the
Unbelief, out of the Doctrine of Christ, cringing

these Manners and this Breeding;<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 37.</note> but the Nobles

the Ground of all true Nobility, Gentility, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
Honour, Breeding, Manners, Courtesie
and Civility, no more after the Flesh, but after
the Spirit; for the Natural Man minds Natural
Things, and the Spiritual Man Spiritual Things;
but the Natural Man receives not the Things of
God; and this we own and witness: And the

every Knee shall bow, and every Tongue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
and the Kings and Nobles of the Earth
shall be bound in Chains and Fetters of Iron:<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 5.</note>
And here is also the Ground of the Nobility,
Gentility,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 9, 10, 11.</note> Superiority, Honour, Breeding and
Manners of the World,<note place="margin">Psal. 148. 9.</note> which is after the Flesh,

the Lust that reigns in man, and is not <hi>Yea</hi> and
<hi>Nay,</hi> but calls it <hi>Manners</hi> to say <hi>Nay,</hi> and take it,
or do it; and so they have the Name, but not the
Nature; and so are Bastards, and no Sons, who are
not sprung from the Noble Gentile Seed; and to
those Honour is not due, neither can we bow unto
them; for if we should, we should set the Devil in
the room of God, &amp; give unto him that which is due
to God, which when we were in Blindness through
Ignorance we did,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.</note> and so worshipped the Beast
and his Image,<note place="margin">Rev. 14. 5.</note> which all the World worships and

but testifie against it wheresoever we come, both
in Words and Actions; and so we are destructive
to the World's Superiority, Nobility, Gentility,

               <p>And now something concerning the <hi>Partiality</hi>
that is among the Children of this World in their
<hi>Breeding</hi> and <hi>Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Concerning the Word <hi>Thou</hi> or <hi>Thee,</hi>
which all those which are their Priests and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
know, that <hi>Thou</hi> is the proper Word to one
particular Person, and is so all along the Scriptures
throughout to any one, without Respect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
yea, to God himself: And the Word <hi>You</hi>
is the proper Word to more then one, but not to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101884:68"/>
one; and so it is all along the Scriptures through
out. As for Example; at all Times when the
Apostles spake to Christ, they used the Word
<hi>Thou</hi> or <hi>Thee,</hi> unto him, and when he spoak to
more then one of them, he used the Word <hi>You</hi> or
<hi>Ye;</hi> but if he spoak but to one, he used the Word
<hi>Thou</hi> or <hi>Thee,</hi> as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 14, 15, 16, 17. verses:
And also <hi>Paul Thou'd</hi> King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and King <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa
Thou'd</hi> him, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 26. ver. 27, 28. and so
all along the Scripture: And so it is plain, that
now it is an invention of Proud <hi>Lucifer</hi> in man to
exalt himself, as it will plainly appear; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Great and Rich Ones of the Earth,
they will either <hi>Thou</hi> or <hi>You</hi> one another, if they
be equal in Degree, as they call it; but if a man
of low Degree in the Earth come to speak to any
of them, then he must <hi>You</hi> the Rich Man, but the
Rich Man will <hi>Thou</hi> him; nay, you shall find it
so betwixt Priest and People; If a poor labouring
Man come before one that you call a Minister,
though he be one of his Hearers, &amp; one who helps
to maintain him,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 25. Prov. 22. 7. 1 Cor. 9. 19.</note> according to his Ability, yet he
must <hi>You</hi> the Priest, and the Priest <hi>Thou</hi> him:
And here the <hi>Heathen</hi> Lord over one another by
their corrupt Wills; but this is contrary to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
and Ministers of Christ, who made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Servants to all; and yet those will call
themselves the <hi>Ministers of Christ:</hi> And the Word
<hi>Minister</hi> signifies a Servant, and they are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
and so they have gotten the Name, but not
the Nature, and so are Bastards, and no Heirs,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101884:68"/>
who are not sprung from the Gentile Seed,
and yet they are hired as Servants of Men, and
yet bear Rule by their Means,<note place="margin">Je. 5. 30, 31.</note> as Masters
over those that maintain them: so that he that
hath an Eye to see, let him see the Deceits of the
professed Ministers of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, as concerning the <hi>Putting off of the
Hat,</hi> which is another Invention of proud <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
whereby he is honoured and worshipped, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
in man: but the Scripture doth not speak
of any such Fashion used in any Age; but <hi>man hath
found out many Inventions,</hi> since the Scripture was
recorded: and now it is so, that it is a Fashion
throughout the Land, whereby one man is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above another; for if a poor man come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Rich Man, it may be the Rich Man will
move his Hat, that is called <hi>Courtesie</hi> and <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
but the Poor Man must stand with his Hat
off before him,<note place="margin">Prov. 1. 23. Prov. 16. 4.</note> and that is called <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
and due <hi>Respect</hi> unto him; but if the Rich
man do bid him put it on, it is counted a great
<hi>Courtesie,</hi> and he gets Honour to himself there, to
be counted a <hi>Courteous man.</hi> But this Difference
or <hi>Respect of Persons,</hi> was never ordained by God,
but by the Devil, whereby he exalts himself in
Man; but <hi>James</hi> the Apostle of Jesus Christ,
witnessed against it, as in <hi>James</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
and so on,<note place="margin">Acts 10. 3, 3.</note> and said, <hi>He that respects Persons commits
Sin, for there is no Respect of Persons with God:</hi> and
therefore saith <hi>James, Houle ye Rich men:</hi> and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101884:69"/>
here your professed Ministers abide not in the

               <p>

<hi>Neighbour-hood</hi> and <hi>civil Respect</hi> one to another: and
so the Devil hath covers for all his Deceit;<note place="margin">Isa. 30. 1.</note> and
so he is honoured and exalted both in Court and
Country, but the highest in the Court, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have the highest Title: <hi>But We unto them

Honour; and therefore do Rich men and great
ones of the Earth, and Rulers, and Priests, and
Pharisees, persecute and oppress us, and draw us
before Judgment-Seats,<note place="margin">James 2. 6. Esth. 3.</note> and would root us out of
the Nation, as <hi>Haman</hi> would have done by <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi>

they cannot bear those Straws: but I say, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it is that comes to be forbidden in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
it becomes a Weight and a Burden,
though it be never so small a thing in the eye of

               <p>VVe are accused that we say, <hi>We are perfect

               </p>
               <p>I answer; Man was perfect without Sin before
the Fall, or else he could not have been the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God; for <hi>God is pure and perfect,</hi> and he
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101884:70"/>
made Man after his own Image,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 27.</note> pure and perfect,
without Sin;<note place="margin">Gen. 5. 24.</note> but when he sinned, he defaced
his Image, and lost his pure Estate, and was drove
out of Paradise, and became the Image of the
Devil, for <hi>Sin is the Image of the Devil;</hi> and here
all Sin is in the Fall, and who are in the Fall are
in the Devil's Kingdom, which is impure, and
imperfect, and unclean; but God promised, the
Seed of the VVoman shall bruise the Serpent's
Head;<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> and Christ the Seed, said, <hi>he was come to preach
Deliverance to the Captive,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 4. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>and to heal the broken-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and to seek that which was lost,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
that which was driven away;</hi> and this was his
VVork to redeem to Man that which Man had
lost. Now consider <hi>what</hi> Man hath <hi>lost;</hi> and I
shall leave this as Querie with all both Priests
and People, who deny <hi>Perfection</hi> from Sin here,
<hi>Whether Christ is but a part of Redeemer, or a perfect
and full Redeemer; and which is the Place betwixt
Heaven and Earth, where man shall be made free or
cleansed from Sin, if not upon the Earth? Seeing that
no unholy, nor unclean thing can enter the Kingdom
of God?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 27.</note> But who can witness this, have passed
through;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 5.</note> Death, and that have none who plead
for Sin, neither can they witness Christ come:
But for some Simple ones sake I shall speak more
clearly of this; for it is a great Delusion of the
Devil, to keep People in Sin, to tell them, <hi>they
shall never be made free from Sin so long as they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Earth,</hi> and bring this Scripture to maintain
it, <hi>He that saith, he hath no Sin, deceiveth himself, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101884:70"/>
is a Lyar;</hi> but he tells them, <hi>Christ dyed for all, and
if they can but lay hold on him by Faith, he will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
their Sins unto them, though they sin daily; for
the Righteous man sins seven times a Day, and all the
Holy men of God sinned;</hi> and so he takes Scripture
to maintain his Kingdom, and this he delivers by
the Mouth of his Ministers, which he sends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to deceive the Nations, leading People in
Blindness, full of Sin and Corruption, <hi>ever learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and never come to the Knowledge of the Truth,</hi>
nor never shall do for them; and here he carries
them on an easie delightsom way to the Flesh;
but the End is Death; and so heals them up in
their Sins with a feigned formed Faith which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth;<note place="margin">John 8. 13.</note>
and here they settle upon the Lees, and
set up a Rest in the Devil's Kingdom, which is
Sin; and here many are meerly blinded and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and all Tenderness of Conscience is done
away: But you shall find that he that sooths
you up in this Faith, is the gratest Enemy of your
Souls; and whosoever witnesseth Christ their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
shall witness that he is come <hi>to destroy the
works of the Devil,</hi> which is Sin, and to redeem out
of the Fall, out of Sin, and out of the Devil's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which is Sin, and all Sin in the Devil's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
which is in the Fall; but <hi>for this End Christ is
manifest to destroy the Works of the Devil</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
out of the Fall; out of the Devil's Kingdom
into his own Kingdom,<note place="margin">Rev. 21. 27.</note> and <hi>no unclean thing can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
therein,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 6.</note> but none can witness this Redemption
but through the Death, and through the Cross
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:101884:71"/>
which <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced in, by which <hi>he was crucified to
the World, and the World to him,</hi> and <hi>had put off the
Body of Sin,</hi> and <hi>was made free from the Law of Sin,
which once warred against his Mind,</hi> which once he
complained of, Which Scripture <hi>the Unlearned,</hi>
which are Strangers from his Conditions, who
read them with the carnal Eye, now pervert, and
<hi>Wrest to their own Destruction;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 15.</note> and this we witness
who through the Lamb, our Saviour, do reign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the World, Death, Hell, and the Devil;
but none can witness this, whose Eye is outward,
looking at a Redeemer afar off, and still live in Sin;
but who cannot witness this Redemption here,
must never witness it; for, <hi>as the Tree falls, so it
lyes:</hi> and Sin is the Mark of the Beast; and who
lives in Sin, hath the Mark of the Beast, and bears
his Image; and it is written, that <hi>the Beast and
false Prophets and all that have his Mark and Image,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 1. 8.</note>

               </p>
               <p>But as for that Scripture that saith, <hi>If we say we
have no Sin, we deceive our selves, and the Truth is
not in us: All have sinned and fallen from the Lord; and
he that hath Sin, and saith, he hath no Sin, deceiveth
himself, and is a Lyar; but if he confess and forsake
his Sin, God is faithful and just to forgive him his sin,
and to cleanse him from all Unrighteousness:</hi> and this
<hi>John</hi> witnessed;<note place="margin">1 John 1. 5.</note> and he that can witness this, is
no Lyar if he say, he is cleansed from all Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
but witnesseth forth the Truth &amp; a perfect
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101884:71"/>
Redemption; and the same <hi>John</hi> said,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>He that is
born of God, sins not neither can he sin; because his Seed
remaineth in him; and he that sins is of the Devil, and
never knew God:</hi> By this are the Children of God,
and the Children of the Devil made manifest;
This <hi>John</hi> witnessed; he was no Lyar, neither did
deceive himself, but spoak the Truth. And the
same <hi>John</hi> said,<note place="margin">1 John 5. 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>God is Light, and in him is no
Darkness, at all: If we say, we have Fellowship with
God, and walk in Darkness, we Lye, and do not the
Truth; but if we walk in the Light, we have Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
one with another, and the Blood of Christ cleanseth us
from all Sin:</hi> This <hi>John</hi> witnessed; he was no Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar,
neither did deceive himself.<note place="margin">1 John 3. 3.</note> And this <hi>John</hi>
said,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>He that hath Hope in him, purifieth himself even
as he is pure; and Faith in God purifieth the Heart:</hi>
Now try your Faith and Hope, who plead for
Sin; for Sin lodgeth in the Heart, and while there
is Sin the Heart is unclean; now here you may
see, all your Faith is vain, and your Hope, which
doth not purifie the Heart; and so it is feigned
<hi>Hypocrites</hi> Faith, and not Faith in God, and so
perisheth. And who can witness Christ dyed for
them, have passed through Death: for none
can live with him, but those that dye with him:
and this is the <hi>true Baptism,</hi> to be baptized <hi>into his
Death by one Spirit into one Body?</hi> and <hi>how can they
that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein?</hi> and
who can witness this, hath Faith in him, which
purifieth the Heart, and removes Mountains;
and <hi>the pure in Heart sees God:</hi> And this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101884:72"/>
witnessed, and that he was made free from
Sin, and more then Conqueror, through Faith
in Christ Jesus; he was no Lyar, and said, that
<hi>Christ was come to redeem unto himself a pure Church,
not having Spot or Wrinkle:</hi> and though <hi>once</hi> they
<hi>were Sinners,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 11.</note> like the World; <hi>but they were washed
and cleansed by the Blood of the Lord Jesus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ethes. 4. 22, 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>and the

                  <note place="margin">Col. 3. 9, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and had put off the Old man, and put
on the New, which after God is created in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and true Holiness;</hi> but this you are Strangers
from who plead for Sin, and are such as call your
selves a Church and are not, but the Synagogue of
Sathan,<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 9.</note> in whom the Prince of Darkness reigns,
which ruleth in the Children of Disobedience.<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 2.</note>
And as for that, which blind People call <hi>Scripture,</hi>
who sayes, <hi>The Righteous Man that is, sins seven
times a Day:</hi> There is no such Scripture; for it is
false: But though the Righteous fall, he riseth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
by Repentance; and this the holy men of
God wituessed: and though <hi>David</hi> through Lust
disobeyed the Lord, and forgot his God; yet he
rose again by Repentance,<note place="margin">Psal. 101.</note> and after witnessed
that he walked in the midst of his House in the
Pureness of his Spirit: and though <hi>Peter</hi> sinned
through Weakness; yet he rose again by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and afterward exhorted the Church, <hi>to be
holy as God is holy;</hi> but this you cannot witness,
who plead for Sin, and are not yet come to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
but deny Christ daily,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 15, 16.</note> and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
but do not repent: but they who dwell
in the Righteousness of Christ, sin not; for <hi>they,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101884:72"/>
that are alive in Righteousness,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 18, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>are dead to Sin; and
they that live in Sin, are dead to Righteousness; but
how can they that are dead to Sin, live any longer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?</hi>
And this is the Devil which pleads for Sin,
the Enemy of the Soul; for by Sin did he obtain
his Kingdom, and so his Kingdom stands in Sin;
and your Teachers, which tell you, <hi>you can never
get out of Sin, nor be cleansed from Sin here, ERR,
not knowing the Scripture,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>nor the Power of God;</hi> but
deny the End of Christ's coming, and bring ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Doctrine, which they have from their Father
the Devil; and so are the Deceivers, which <hi>Paul</hi>
speaks of, who <hi>creep into Steeple-Houses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 6, 7.</note>

and so are not to be received,<note place="margin">Jer. 14. 13, 14.</note> but held as accursed;

seeing Vanity, and divining Lyes, who say, <hi>the

have healed the Hurt of the People slightly, and
have sewed Pillows under their Armeholes, crying
Peace, when there is no Peace, because they
put into their Mouths, and they are not ashamed,
neither do they blush; therefore they shall fall
amongst them that fall, in the Day that I visit
them, saith the Lord: And these are your Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

their Works, by him who sits upon the white

               <p>We are accused to deny <hi>Christ come in the Flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We witness the same <hi>Christ</hi> which ever was,

And <hi>none can call Jesus Lord, but by the holy Ghost:</hi> so

yet they will say, <hi>Christ is meek, Love, and lowly:</hi>
It is so, but not to Ungodliness: but he is <hi>meek</hi> to

whose Bodies are the Temples of the Holy

               <p>We are accused <hi>to deny the Sabbath.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the Saints we own, which is not

as the Scribes, and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and High

               <p>We are accused that <hi>we justifie our selves, and

               </p>
               <p>I answer; When we were our selves without
the Spirit of God, and had a Form and Profession
of the Saints Condition, which we did not possess,
we sought to justifie our selves in our Profession,
and earthly Wisdom, and to exalt our selves,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101884:76"/>
and be something in the Eyes of others; and
here we were <hi>Pharisee,</hi> and yet feigned <hi>Publicans,</hi>
saying, we were sinfull, but thought higher of our

Nature; and here our Justification was of our

upon the Letter: but as the <hi>Light of Christ</hi> arose
in us, all our earthly Wisdom wherein we were
exalted, became Foolishness, and Self was judged
and denyed, and all that which was of Self, both
Wisdom and Righteousness, wherewith we cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
over our filthy, lustful, unclean Hearts, and
so were as painted Sepulchres; and here are all

Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and though we glory, we glory in the Lord;
for we have nothing in our selves to glory of;
and the Saints thought it no <hi>Presumption</hi> to call
themselves <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> and said, <hi>they were of God,
and all the whole World lie in Wickedness;</hi> and here the

though of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> he was judged a <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi>
and <hi>as he is, so are we,</hi> say the Saints; yet they

neither those who are <hi>made free from Sin,</hi> to wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ness

them that have gotten the Form, Notion, or

the Truth is but one; and they who dwell in the

of God owns its own, wheresoever it is; for God
cannot deny himself: but <hi>they that are not with us,

               <p>We are accused <hi>to be one with the</hi> Ranters.</p>
               <p>I answer, it is false; for we abhor their <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>

the true Light of the Lord Jesus,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 4.</note> which is not of the

the many Wayes of the World, and the Snares, Baits,

rules in all the Children of Disobedience; now whatsoever
makes manifest,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 2.</note> is Light, the which Light will discover
unto them whose Minds are turned to it, the Wiles and

Wisdom, and thereby be preserved from the subtile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring

WATCHER,
Striking at the
Feet of the IMAGE, &amp;c.</head>
               <p>IN the Dayes of old, the Holy Men of God
(who were indued with the Spirit of God)
did as they were acted and guided, moved
and commanded by the Power and Spirit of God,
which dwelt in them; and here was their RULE:
And also the Serpent, as an Angel of Light, he
acted and worked in his Instruments by the Power
of Darkness, in Opposition to the Spirit of God,
the Enmity being placed betwixt the two <hi>Seeds;</hi>
and the more gloriously the true <hi>Light</hi> appear'd in
any Age, <hi>Satan</hi> also reform'd himself, and appear'd
accordingly in the Shape, and Form, and Likeness
thereof, as it is now to this Day, but his was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
but the <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Likeness</hi> of the thing, but
not the <hi>Thing it self:</hi> His is the <hi>false Light,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the <hi>true Light;</hi> and so the true Light all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
discover'd him, and made him manifest to
those in whom it ruled: But thus by his Subtilty
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101884:84"/>
and Deceit, he hath ever deceived the World,
and blinded the World, so that he might keep his
Kingdom, who is the God of the World: as for
Example; <hi>Moses,</hi> a Servant and Messenger of the
most high God, to whom God had revealed and
made known himself, when he and <hi>Aaron</hi> were
sent unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to require him to let <hi>Israel</hi> ge
free, for a Sign unto him, they cast down their
Rod, and it became a Serpent; and the <hi>Magicians</hi>
of <hi>Egypt</hi> they were brought,<note place="margin">Exo. 10. 11, 12.</note> and by their Sorceries
and Inchantments they cast down their Rods, and
they became Serpents, and thereby <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Heart
was hardned, and they would not obey, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
And thus the Devil imitated and opposed
the Truth, but <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rods swallowed up their
Rods; so that it was manifest, <hi>that He that was with
them, was Greater then he that was in the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And also, when <hi>Israel</hi> had sin'd against God, and
done that which is Evil in the Sight of God, the
Lord God sent forth his Prophets and Messengers
to declare the <hi>Word of the Lord</hi> amongst them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Sin and Evil,<note place="margin">Jer. 20. 9.</note> Pride, Deceit and Oppression,
and all Ungodliness, Iniquities, Disobedience
and Rebellion; and they had Visions and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
and the <hi>Word of God</hi> dwelt in them, by
which they were led,<note place="margin">Jer. 23.</note> guided and acted: And <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
he also wrought in his Instruments with a
<hi>Spirit of Delusion;</hi> and he sent forth his Prophets
with their Visions &amp; lying Divinations, and false
Dream; and they cried <hi>Peace,</hi> where the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
cried <hi>Wo;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 5. 30, 31.</note> and the People hearkned unto
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101884:84"/>
them, and set them up; and the Prophets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
falsly, and the Priests bore Rule by their
meanes, and the People loved to have it so: But
<hi>What will you do in the End thereof?</hi> saith the Lord,
by the mouth of his Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
against it freely, and said, <hi>It was an horrible
filthy Thing;</hi> and he was persecuted: And the true
Prophets, who dwelt in the <hi>Light</hi> and in the <hi>Power
of God,</hi> they saw them to be such <hi>as run,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 21, 22, 32. ver. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Lord
never sent them, and therefore they profited not the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at all; and they stole the Word from their Neighbour,
and they spoak a Divination of their own Brain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 14. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>and not
from the Mouth of the Lord,</hi> and say, <hi>the Lord said,
when he never spoak to them; and they were light and
vain, and daub'd the People up with untempered Morter,
and sewed Pillows under their Arm-holes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 22. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>and healed the

no <hi>Peace;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 13. 18.</note> but they turnd them not from their Evil
Wayes, nor from their Evil-doings, and the Lord
was against them:<note place="margin">Jer. 20. 9. Jer. 23.</note> And the true Prophets of God
(who dwelt in the Light) they saw them, and
plainly &amp; freely declar'd against them then, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they would hear or forbear; and told them,

                  <hi>and the Priests
preach'd for Hire, and the Prophets divined for Money,
and yet,</hi> said the Prophet, <hi>will they lean upon the Lord,
and say, Is not the Lord amongst us, as that none Evil
can come upon us?</hi> And they saw them to be such <hi>as

blinded their Eyes (in that Age) with a strickt

so that they could not see the Light and the

the chief Persecutors of Christ, the Substance of
those things which they upheld in the Law and
the Prophets; therefore they were Witnesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

denyed Christ, whom <hi>Abraham</hi> foretold of; but
Christ told them, <hi>they were of their Father the Devil,
and his Works they did and</hi> would do; and thus he
judged them for all their Zeal and Profession, and
said, <hi>how could they escape the Damnation of Hell?</hi>
Then after he was sacrificed up, he appeared unto
his Apostles, and sent them to preach the Gospel
to every Creature; and here they did not run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Prophets run, nor take up a Command
without them in the Prophets Writings to do a

which Christ before he was offered up, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,

and then after they had received the Holy

Christ; and this they declared in their Temples
and in their Synagogues, and they haled them out

brought them before Governors, Rulers, and
Magistrates, and the chief Priests, and their Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;
and the chiefest Professors (which were the

never the less they went on boldly, being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the Power of the Holy Ghost, without
the Fear of Man, obeying God rather then Man:
so they were not subject to the Authority of Man
in that respect; but they were subject unto the
Law of Man so far as it was subject to the Law of
God: and so they went on preaching <hi>Christ; and
many believed and were baptized, and received the

<hi>the multitude that believed was of one Heart and of one
Mind;</hi> and they were so far of one being exalted

any of them said, that ought of the things which

he judged them and said, <hi>Ye Stiff-necked and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised

gnashed upon him with their Teeth, and fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

them go about to plant a better Vineyard, or else
to cast off their long Gowns, and fall to dig with
a Spade; for some of them have sometimes brought
that Place of Scripture to uphold their forty, or
fifty, or an hundred or two hundred by the Year,
where the Apostle saith, <hi>Who planteth a Vineyard,

they cry Peace, Peace,</hi> and speak you fair, and call

have Law for you to take <hi>treble Dammage</hi> from

<hi>Heathenish</hi> Traditions: and thus the blind have led
the blind along, &amp; many of them into the Ditch;
but yet I say not but the Lord hath had his People
in all Ages, those who were zealous, and faithful,
and true-in what they knew; but I know the Priests
have been long utter Enemies to God and his
Truth, and the Tares have long covered the

Wheat, and in the time of Ignorance God wink'd,
but now the Light shines out of Darkness, and
now is the Separation and gathering the Sheep
from the Goats, the Wheat from the Tares, and
to convince the World of Sin, and of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and of Judgment, because the Prince of the
Air is judged; and now the Lord doth require all
every where to repent; and they that love the
Light, will bring their Deeds to the Light, that
the Light may prove them, whether they be
wrought in God; and it is not to say, <hi>You will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

are they that hate the Light, and despise it, and
love Darkness rather then Light, because their
Deeds are Evil, and so having drunk old Wine
do not straightway desire new;<note place="margin">Jeh. 3. 19, 20.</note> for they say, <hi>the old

And this is the Condemnation of the World, Light is
come into the World, and Men love Darkness rather then
Light, because their Deeds are Evil:</hi> Light is new
to them who have alwayes been in Darkness, and
Truth is new to them who have alwayes lived in
Deceit; but the Light is the same as ever it was,
for it is unchangeable, and the Truth is the same,</p>
               <p>So People take heed of Obstinacy and wilful
Blindness, and love not to be deceived; for now
the Light plainly and clearly shines; and here
your old Way is plainly laid open, what it is, and
from whence it is, and also your Priests; and
though they be more refined within these late
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101884:98"/>
Years then they were before, it is, because the
Light is more broaken forth within these late
Years, so that many are come to see their Deceit,
and declare against them, and now they are but
the more subtiler and closer Deceivers, Satan
transformed into another Shape more like the
Light; but still they have not parted with their
great Benefices, and Augmentations, or Tythes,
nor the chiefest Place of the Assembly, nor their
long Gowns, though they are almost ashamed of
their Colour, nor to be called of Men Master, nor
from seeking their Gain from their Quarter, nor
from making a Trade of other Mens Words, nor
from their lying Divinations, and saying, <hi>The
Lord saith,</hi> when he never spoak to them, nor
from stealing the Word into their Mouth, and
saying, <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord,</hi> when they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

from their Pride, nor the Ungodly from their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness,
nor the Prophane from their Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but are still prophane themselves, and still
proud and covetous, and still shelter themselves
under the Powers of the Earth, as their fore-fathers
the false Prophets alwayes did, and still run when
the Lord never sends them, but ordained and set
up, and upheld by the Will of Man, therefore
they profit not the People at all; but only have
gotten a higher Notion to feed the Notionists
withal, and so make more <hi>Pharisees, Hypocrites</hi>
and <hi>Whited Walls;</hi> and they are more whited over
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:101884:98"/>
themselves to deceive the World, but the pure
Light is so broaken forth, that they cannot hide
themselves, and many see the Deceit of the Priests,
and their Folly is a manifesting even to all, so that
none need to be deceived by them, but the wilful,
obstinate and blind, who love to have it so, who
<hi>love Darkness rather then Light,</hi> which is their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
the Light which reproves them for
their Evil Deeds, and therefore they hate it; for
<hi>every one that doth Evil hates the Light,</hi> and this is
his Condemnation; and no Ignorance here is to
be pleaded; and these are they that uphold the

though the Powers of the Earth have long upheld
them, more then any other Sect; so that they
have continued so long, as they do not a little boast
of, and thereby say, <hi>They are of God;</hi> but let the
Magistrate look to his Office, and let the Minister
alone with his Office, and then you shall see the
professed Ministers of <hi>England,</hi> to be the weakest
of all Sects and Forms; but Anti christ hath had

               <p>Therefore now all People who are captivated
under the Priests, turn your Minds within to the
Light of the Lord Jesus, which reproves you in
secret, when you tell a Lye, or use any Deceit,
which shews you your Evil Deeds, and that your
Hearts are not right towards God for all your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

by this you will come to profit;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 6. Isa. 59. 1, 32.</note> for it teacheth
Godliness, and Godliness is great Gain, so that
you will not need to spend your <hi>Money for that which

               <p>Now within these late Years the <hi>Light of Christ</hi>
beginning to stir in Peoples Hearts, so that many
come to see themselves in much Darkness and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of these things which they read of in the
Scripture, and also the Corruption of the Priests
and Teachers, and what Reprobates they were
concerning the Faith, and that they profited not
the People at all; but they had heard them so
long, and still blind and ignorant, so that many
come to see their Folly, yet their Minds not being
directed to the Light, which shewed them this,
and should have led them out of this Condition,
upon which they should have waited for Direction
to have found the Way of Truth, but they run
without to the Letter in their own Wills and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and so would find out a Way by their own
Wisdom &amp; Imagination, and so went out to search
the Scripture, but with a wrong Eye, giving their
own Meanings and Interpretations upon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and one cries, <hi>This is my opinion,</hi> and another
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101884:100"/>
cryes, <hi>This is my Opinion,</hi> and another cryes, <hi>This
is my Judgment;</hi> and thus they are confounded and
divided into their several Judgments and Opinions
yet all still in one Life and one Nature, but only
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ounded and divided in their Judgments of
what the Prophets meant, and Christ meant, and
what the Apostles meant; but it is as a Book seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
both to the learned and unlearned, and none
is found worthy but the Lamb to open the Seals,<note place="margin">Isa. 29. 11.</note>
who is the Light, wherein lyes the Ministry; so
this is the Cause why they whose Minds are from
the Light, are so divided and scattered in their
Judgments and Opinions, and one sets up a Form
in his Imagination, and another sets up a Form
in his Imagination; and one runs abroad into the
World with his Wisdom, and he will go preach
up his Form and Judgment to be the Truth; and
another he will cry down that Form for Delusion,
and preach up his Form for a Truth; and so many
Deceivers and false Spirits are entered into the
World, and one cries, <hi>Lo here is Christ, if you can
believe and be baptized, you shall be saved;</hi> So they
that can say that is the Way, and that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Christ dyed for them, then they must be
dipped in the Water, and that they call <hi>baptizing
of them,</hi> and then they are of their Church, and
then they call themselves Saints, though they are
still in the old Nature, and so in the Fall, and in
their Sins and Corruptions; and it is not the
washing away the Filth of the Flesh that doth
change them, but because they are come out from
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101884:100"/>
the Priests, and turned into another Judgment and
Profession, they think themselves Saints; and
they read the Scripture of laying on the Apostles
Hands,<note place="margin">Acts 19. 6</note> and then the Disciples received the Holy
Ghost; and so those Formalists and self-Actors
lay on their Hands; but there wants the Holy
Ghost; and thus they act, and form, and imitate
and make the Form or Likeness of a Church; and
they read of washing the Feet in the Figure, and
so they dote upon the Letter, and wash one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Feet; and they read of delivering up to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
one for Fornication,<note place="margin">John. 13. 5. 1 Cor. 5. 1, 2 3, 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Destruction of the

for in the Spirit <hi>Paul</hi> discerned it, for saith he,
<hi>Though absent in Body, yet present in Spirit, I have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
already, as though I were present, concerning him that
hath done this Deed;</hi> and so those Formalists and
Imitators, if any differ from them in Judgment,
they will also deliver him up to Satan, as they
imagine, taking the Apostles Words, though they
cannot tax him for any Thing, but his Judgment
differing from them; but they want the Power;
and here they are the Magicians, like <hi>Jannes</hi> and
<hi>Jambres,</hi> opposing the Truth, and those are they
that are called <hi>Baptists;</hi> and another Form, they
are more spiritual in their Judgment, and they hold
a spiritual Baptism, and not a Water-Baptism,
and as many as hold with them, are of their Church
and Faith; and thus they are divided into several
Forms and Churches, and so have several Names,
and there are several Judgments of one Thing,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101884:101"/>
under one Name; and here is the Confusion of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> with their several Sects, Judgments and
Opinions, and every one are professing the Name
of the Lord, and stealing the Words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Christ and his Apostles, and saying, <hi>The
Lord saith,</hi> when he never spoak to them; and here
is the Difference from another, only in Profession,
Judgment or Opinion; but still in <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon's</hi>
Fashions, Customs, and Traditions and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
Manners and Breeding, which is all <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish</hi>
and at Enmity with God, being in the Fall,
and thus they stand in the first Nature, in Pride, in
Covetousness, Anger, Wrath, Malice, Fleshliness
and Lustfulness, and Idle Words, Vain Talking,
Foolish Jesting and Evil Communication, and to be
short, still alive in the World's Nature, Strangers

and here I comprehend all Forms, Sects, Judgments

one clashing against another with their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Opinions, and here are the Disputes of

a Blasphemer, a Seducer, a Deceiver, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
and now the rude Multitude they stand up

imprison them, as their Fore-fathers ever did;
and the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and ancient hypocritical rotten
Professors, they side with the Priests, and go
about railing and evil speaking of the Truth,
learning and incensing Peoples Minds against it,
with their Lyes, and Slanders, and Reproaches,
to present it odious to all People; and also
fawning, and crouching, and seeking to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
to act in their Wills, and persecute, as
their Fore-Fathers alwayes did against the same
Seed, and likewise, the Formalists and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
do the same; and thus they that were
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101884:104"/>
after the Flesh alwayes persecuted them that
were after the Spirit; and yet these are ready to

Christ, and persecuted his Apostles; and if they
had been in those dayes, they would not have been Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
with them in the Blood of Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles:</hi>
Whenas they are now found the same
Generation of Persecutors, persecuting the
Righteous Seed, and so they fill up the Measure
of their Fathers Wrath, that upon them might
come all the Righteous Blood-shed from Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Abel</hi> until now.</p>
               <p>And now the <hi>Priests</hi> and the <hi>Baptists</hi> can agree,

and the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> they joyn together;
all against the Life and Power, which the Lord
hath now manifested in his Sons and Daughters,
and hath sent them to declare and lay open their
Hypocrisie and Deceit, which they have long
covered with a Gospel-like Profession; but now
all their Coverings are found too Narrow before
the Light, which is come now into the World,
to convince and reprove them of their Sin, of
their Righteousness and of their Judgment; and
therefore, now they have enough to do to joyn
together with all their Strength and Wisdom, to
put out this Light, and so they endeavour to
sow their Tares in Peoples Hearts, and all the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:101884:104"/>
Wayes they can invent to destroy the Work
which now is begun; and as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi>
withstood <hi>Moses,</hi> so do they withstand the Truth,
according to the Prophesie of the Apostle, <hi>Being
men of Corrupt Minds, and Reprobates concerning the
Faith;</hi> which I have much experienced in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Meetings, which I have had with the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Baptized People, which shall follow
in order afterward.</p>
               <p>But the more they strive in their Wills and
Wisdoms, the more doth the Work of the Lord
Prosper, and go on, and flourish by his Mighty
Power and Out-stretched Arm; and their Shame,
and Folly, and Down-fal the more appears; and
when they have done all they can, they shall be
glad to lay down their Cronws; and bow unto
this Truth, which they now so oppose; and
every Tongue shall confess it, though to their
Condemnation, who do now oppose and gain-say
it: Wo unto such; they shall perish in the Gain-saying
of <hi>Core. And the Time shall come, that when
the Master of the House shall have shut the Door,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 13. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>they

all who now oppose and reject the Counsel of the

               <p>And thus the LORD will exalt his SON in
his Saints, when his ENEMIES shall be his
Foot-stool, and be made to bow before him.</p>
               <p>And thus do all Sects, Judgments and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101884:105"/>
joyn in one against the Life and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
they being all sprung from one Root, so
make up all one Image, whose Head is Gold,
Breast of Silver, whose Thighs are Brass, and
Legs of Iron, and Feet Part of Iron and Part of
Clay; and the Stone cut out of the Mountain
without Hands, which strikes at the Feet of the
Image.</p>
               <p>Now, the Head of the Image, which is of
Gold, and those that have had a Light shining
into them, and have had a Sight of many things,
and have seen the Emptiness of many Forms, and
have gotten the Thing in their Comprehension,
and have a Notion above others of much of that
which is now witnessed and possest in Life by
the Faithful, and there have been exalted, and
gotten up a Life therein, and a False Rest, but
have lost the Light which once shined into them,
by catching the Thing in their Comprehension,
and so got it in the Notion, but did not obey nor
suffer the Death of the Cross. And the Breast
of the Image, which is of Silver, and the Thighs
of Brass, are the rest of the Sects, and Opinions,
and Forms, and Likenesses, which are more
Glorious one then another; for, as I said before,
<hi>Satan can imitate every Appearance of the true Light,
in his Forms, Shapes and Likenesses; and the more
Glorious the Light appears in any Creature, so doth he
refine himself, and appear more Glorious to deceive the
Simple:</hi> so that many (by the Light of God st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in them) have come to see the Deceit and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:101884:105"/>
Emptiness in one Form, and how they have been
deceived therein, then presently the Deceit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in another more Glorious Shape or Form,
and calls that the Truth; and the Creature still
looking without, from the Light within, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared
there again, still painted with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-words,
and then the Creature thinks its a
Saint in that Form, whenas its but a Painted
Sepulchre, still in the Old Nature, and under
the Power of the same Deceit; but the Cross
tryes all; for, there all Forms and Professions
miss and come short; so that many a Creature
hath passed through many Forms, &amp; hath thought
it self a Saint in every Form; but coming, yea,
but to see the Cross, which they are to take up
before they can be the Disciples of Christ, and
there have stumbled, and cryed out, <hi>It is Hard
and Straight,</hi> and go away sorrowful, I know
this is witnessed and answered in many Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
for, here every Man's Faith and Works
come to the Tryal; and so <hi>to some the Preaching of
the</hi> Cross <hi>is Foolishness, and to some a Stumbling-block,
but unto them that believe and take it up, it is witnessed
the Power of God unto Salvation;</hi> and such rejoyce
in it with <hi>Paul, who are crucified to the World, and
the World to them, upon whom the Ends of World are
come:</hi> But it would be an easie thing to the Flesh,
if that was all, to turn out of one Profession into
another, and out of one Form and Judgment into
another;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 11.</note> but <hi>the Way to Life is through Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Legs of the Image, which are of Iron,

is the Beast, or the Power of the Beast, upon which
these stand, where lies their Strength. And the
Feet of the Image, which is part of Iron and
part of Clay, are the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> joyn'd
to the Powers of the Earth, which upholds them;
for, but for that, as I said before, they are the
weakest of all Forms, and so they are the Part of
Clay, and the Power that upholds them, is that
part of Iron, which is the strongest of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals:
And the <hi>Watcher,</hi> or the Stone cut out

whom be all Praise, Honour, Power, Dominion

shall this Great Image be broaken to pieces by
the Stone cut out of the Mountain without Hands,
which will become a heavy Mountain, even a
burden some Stone to all Nations; but upon this
Mountain shall the True Church stand,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 14.</note> as a City
set on a Hill, that cannot be hid. And thus I
have laid down the Ground and End of all Sects,
Forms and Professions, with a Blow to this Great
Image, with a Weapon, which is not Carnal, but
Spiritual; he that can receive it, let him.</p>
               <p>And now concerning the CHURCH, which is
now gathering and redeeming, not by the Will of
man, nor by the Wisdom of many, but by the Will
and Power, and Spirit of God, which according
unto his Promise he hath <hi>poured down upon his Sons
and Daughters now in these latter dayes,</hi> by which we
are carried abroad in the Power of the Almighty,
now to declare abroad his Powerful Truth, which
the Lord has decreed shall prevail upon the hearts
of the People, which is Glad-tidings of great Joy
unto them that receive it; but unto the Stubborn,
and Stiff-necked, and Rebellious, Tidings of Wo

used, slandered</hi> and <hi>abused;</hi> yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
blessed be the Name of the Lord, there are

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:101884:107"/>
the Messengers of the Gospel;<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 15.</note> so that they know
how Beautiful are the Feet of those that bring
Glad-tidings, to the reviving the just Witness
for God, and raising up to Life the Dead, and so
the Living comes to Know and Praise the Lord;
and so the Just comes to reign, and the Wicked
comes to be judged, and the Mind comes to be
turned from the Darkness to the Light, to which
we do preach in every Creature, and to the same
are made manifest, and known to them who do
like to retain it in their Minds, and from whence
we come, and the Testimony which we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare;
but they that do not receive it, to them
we are not known, and therefore are by them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
as Deceivers and Deluders, Vagabonds
and Wanderers, and the like: yet at all this we
do not Wonder; for we read, <hi>The Servant is not
greater then his Lord;</hi> for, <hi>if they have called the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the House</hi> Beelzebub, <hi>how much more those
of his Houshold? and if they had known him, they
would not have crucified the Lord of Glory:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 24, 25.</note> Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
we have a Witness in every Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

that perish, unto which we do clear our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and leave all without Excuse by the same,
which will answer for us in the Mighty Day,
though to the Condemnation of those that hate it,
wherein we have our great Joy above all our Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings;
<hi>but as many as receive this, to them he gives
Power to become the Sons of God;</hi> and those are they,
who are led and guided by the One Spirit of

which the World cannot receive, even the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,
of whom you have heard should come,</hi> by which

out of the Rudiments and Pollutions thereof,
their Fashions, their Customs, their Words, their
Wayes, their Manners, their Breeding, their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
Love and Friendship, their Honour and
Glory, and their Worship, and so are become
Strangers to the World, and so are hated of the
World, because they are not of the World; and
the Enmity stands betwixt the two Seeds: but
while they were of the World, the World loved
them; but now they are gathered out of the
World, and separated from the World, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
against the World both in Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
therefore the Enmity is raised in the World,
against the Righteous Seed; and those are they
upon whom the Ends of the World are come,
to <hi>whom it is given to know the Mysteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
though to the World in Parables; and those
are they that are come with a Mighty Arm and

the Lord hath gathered, and is a gathering out of
the World by his own Spirit of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> to

                  <hi>where the Ransomed of the Lord do walk, and serve and

seeking to worship him,</hi> in whom he is, in doing his

<hi>create New Heavens and New Earth, wherein dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
Righteousness;</hi> and those are they that are

the New Creatures, in whom this New Work
is witnessed, in whom the Father hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
his Son, that in the Likeness of sinful Flesh
he might condemn Sin in the Flesh, and to bind
the Strong Man, and cast him out of his House, and
spoil his Goods, and so to destroy the Works of
the Devil, and to cut down the Man of Sin, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that Son of Perdition, who is exalted above
all that is called GOD, sitting in the Temple of
God as God, and saith, <hi>He is God;</hi> this is he by
whom the World is deceived, who is the God of
the World, even the Prince of Darkness, who
rules in all the Children of Disobedience; and
so saith <hi>John</hi> in the Light, <hi>The whole World lies in
Wickedness;</hi> and unto this doth Christ come with
a Sword, for to make War with him, and to take
and bind him, and cast him into utter Darkness,
and so to take his Kingdom from him, and to rule
himself in Righteousness.</p>
               <p>And this is the King of the SAINTS, who is
now come to redeem unto himself a Pure People,
and to wash them &amp; cleanse them from their Sias
by his BLOOD, and so to wash away all Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
both of Flesh and Spirit; and this is the
Baptism by which they are received into his
Church and Faith; and here is the Effect of his
BLOOD wrought in MAN; and thus he doth
and will manifest his Mighty Power, to purifie,
and cleanse, and make Man a fit Temple for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

made the TEMPLES of the HOLY GHOST;
and thus is the Word of Life and Reconciliation

reconciling the Soul to GOD; and those are
they that are begotten and born again of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Word, which dwelleth and abideth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
and here is the Houshold of God, the
Houshold of Faith, and the Houshold of Love,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 1.</note> who
speak the things which they have heard, and seen,
and tasted of the good Word of Life, which was in

to walk in the Light of Life,</hi> wherein they are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

into the Love and Union which springs from the
Life of God; and here is the Vine and the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
and here is the <hi>Communion of the Church,</hi> all
feeding upon One Bread, all drinking upon One
Cup; this is Christ, the Life of the Saints:
and as many as are baptized into this Church,
partake of this Communion; and those are they
which have denyed themselves, and have born
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101884:109"/>
the Cross of Christ, by which they are crucified
to the World, and the World to them, who are
gathered into one Covenant of Life, where all
are Fellow-Servants under one MASTER; who
serve one another in Love and Meekness: And
here is the true Humility in the <hi>Heart</hi> wrought;
and here is the true Washing of Feet without Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
which some are imitating without for
LIFE, but fall short; for, the Heart the Lord
requires.</p>
               <p>And thus is the Church of Christ gathered by
one Spirit, and by the same circumcised and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized

the Blessed Union and Communion in One; and
here God is worshipped in Spirit and in Truth;

out of the New Covenant of Life in the Dark
World, under Death's Dominion, of what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession

in the Light of Life:</hi> But you must all suffer the

live in,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 30.</note> before you can witness this Redemption;
for those that live with <hi>Christ,</hi> are crucified with

Death:</hi> Therefore you must be stripped of all your
Old Covers, naked and bare, that your Deceit
and Shame may appear, which you have so long

in his Presence; but I say unto all you Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
Formalists, Notionists and Disputers, and
Wise Ones of this World, <hi>If you will not take up
and imbrace this Cross, Publicans and Harlots shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Kingdom before you; Therefore, not many

those that are Mighty, that no FLESH should

things which I have seen, and heard, and felt,
and tasted of the good Word of Life, which was
in the Beginning, the same do I declare, and am
known and read by the Children of Light.</p>
               <p>And now I shall proceed to several Passages

                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:101884:111"/>
Upon the Thirtieth of the First Moneth, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>March,</hi> in the Year 1655. I was at one <hi>Ashen</hi>'s
House in <hi>Fenstanton,</hi> in <hi>Huntingtonshire,</hi> where I
was freely declaring the Truth of God to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that came there together that Day, as I was
taught &amp; moved by the Spirit of Truth, by which
the Holy Men of God spoak forth the Scripture, as
they were moved; and there came several of the
People, called <hi>Baptists,</hi> into the Room amongst
us, amongst whom was one of their Teachers,
called, <hi>Richard Elligood,</hi> who after a while stood
up in his Will and Wisdom to accuse me, and
said, <hi>That I had said, That God did not respect any
Forms, and yet</hi> (saith he) <hi>you use the Form, and so
use that which God hath no Respect to;</hi> But his first
words were, <hi>Sir, (if you please) I will speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to what you have said:</hi> To which I made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>Here needs no Complements:</hi> And then he runs
on, as afore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> said; to which Accusation I reply'd,
<hi>was False;</hi> and bad him <hi>prove what Form I used:</hi>
And he said, <hi>The Letter:</hi> And I replyed, <hi>He that
takes the Letter to talk of without the Life and Power,
such sets up a Form, and makes a Form:</hi> But this
would not satisfie his filthy Wisdom, which dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
his Understanding; but because I spoak
words which are mentioned in the Scripture, by
the same Spirit that spoak forth the Scripture, by
which I challenge the Scripture, from him and all
such who have gotten it to talk of, but denies the
Life, and are Strangers to the Life and Power;
therefore with his contrary Spirit tasked me with a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101884:111"/>
Form, which by his <hi>Logick</hi> and deceitful Art
would have proved, but could not, but his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
was laid open to the People, and many decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
against him; for a Form is this, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Likeness of a Thing, but not the Thing
it self, as they have the Likeness of a <hi>Church,</hi> which
they have imagined from the Letter, with their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Pastors and Teachers, but not the <hi>Church</hi> it
self; and so they imitate the Scriptures, but live
not in the Life of them that spoak forth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
neither are acted and guided by the same
Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures, and so want
the Life and Power, and those are the Formalists
that make Forms and Likenesses, to deceive the
simple, as the Devil hath the Form of an Angel
of Light, but not the Life and Power, who appears
to rule in those Formalists and Self-Actors, but
the Day doth make him manifest, and therefore
he rages; and then this <hi>Elligood</hi> denyed that I had
the same Spirit that gave forth the Scripture, and
he said, <hi>The Spirit might be tryed by the Letter;</hi> for
he said, <hi>Many false Spirits are entered into the World;</hi>
and I asked him, <hi>By what did the Apostle know that
false Spirits were gone out into the World?</hi> and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
and said, <hi>By the Spirit of God;</hi> then I replyed
and said, <hi>If by the Spirit of God the Apostle knew that
there were many false Spirits gone out into the World,
then by the Spirit of God be tryed FALSE SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITS,
and knew False Spirits from the TRUE;</hi> and
here his Deceit was laid open to the People, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101884:112"/>
he judged out of his own Mouth to be a Lyar, and
to be guided by a false Spirit, who would try the
Living by the Dead; and again he said, that one
<hi>Spirit could not try another; for by that Judgment the
Evil Spirit might try the Good Spirits;</hi> to which I
replyed, <hi>By the Spirit of God all other Spirits are tryed,
and also, that by the Light Darkness is discovered, but
Darkness cannot comprehend the Light, neither disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Light;</hi> and here again his Blindness, and
Ignorance, and Deceit was much discovered to
the People, although he fed himself, and would
have shuffled it off by his Consequences and filthy
Logick, but it the more laid open his Deceit; and
presently the said <hi>Elligood</hi> was found with another
Lye in his Mouth; for he said, <hi>that I said the Thing
should be proved by every Man's Spirit,</hi> which was a
very Lye; for I said, <hi>that the Baptism of the Spirit
was the Substance of the outward Baptism,</hi> the which
he denyed, and bid me prove it, and I said, <hi>I spoak
to the Witness in every Man's Conscience,</hi> which his dark
Mind could not comprehend, but with his dark
Mind wrested my Words, and therefore said, that
I said, <hi>it was witnessed by every Man's Spirit,</hi> but his
Spirit was a lying Spirit, there tryed and made
manifest to the People, and his Blasphemy against
the Spirit of God, in calling Truth Error, and
Error Truth, and putting Darkness for Light, and
Light for Darkness,<note place="margin">Isa. 5. 20.</note> because the God of the World
hath blinded his Eye; and many witnessed against
him, for his filthy Spirit was odious to many of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101884:112"/>
Hearers; then afterward he again said, <hi>that I was
a Deceiver,</hi> and his Proof was, <hi>that I was not obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the Command of Christ, to be baptized;</hi> and I
told him, <hi>I was baptized;</hi> but he said, <hi>with Water?</hi>
and he said, <hi>that was a Command of Christ to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with Water,</hi> and <hi>I bid him shew me that Scripture,</hi>
but he could not, but brought a Scripture in the
<hi>Acts,</hi> where the Apostle commanded some to be
baptized;<note place="margin">Acts 10. 47, 48.</note> and this by his filthy <hi>Logick</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
he would have made a Command of
Christ, but he could not deceive the Light which
did him try, and make him manifest to the Shame
of his Prosession, but he could not bring one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to prove it to be a Command of Christ, to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
with Water; and then he shuffled to that
Scripture where the Apostle said, <hi>Be ye Followers
of us, even as we are Followers of Christ;</hi> and then
he said, <hi>Christ was baptized,</hi> but he confessed, it
was to fulfil all Righteousness; and I said, <hi>he was
also circumcised;</hi> and he said, <hi>that was not for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
then not the Baptism; for both were to fulfil
all Righteousness, to which End, he, the Substance
came; but Christ himself baptized not with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
neither do they read that the Apostles were
baptized with Water; then who is their Example?
and how do they follow the Apostles in that, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are baptized, and the Apostles were not?
then he fled from that being there routed, and
said, <hi>They might be Disciples before they could take
up the</hi> CROSS <hi>of Christ,</hi> and I replyed with
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101884:113"/>
Christ's Words, <hi>That they might take up his Cross be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could be his Disciples,</hi> which he denyed, and
said, <hi>That Wicked Men upon that Account might take
up the Cross of Christ, and that Christ required Wicked
Men to take up his Cross;</hi> and I said, <hi>it was so, he did
require them so to do; for by taking up his Cross, they
come to deny their Wickedness; for they that bear his
CROSS, live not in Wickedness;</hi> but this <hi>Elligood</hi>
said, <hi>That Wicked Men could not take up his CROSS;</hi>
for he said, <hi>Reproaches and outward Sufferings were the
CROSS of Christ</hi> (for his Name's sake) but this
was not the Cross by which <hi>Paul</hi> was crucified to
the World, and the World to him; and saith
<hi>Paul</hi> (where he was speaking concerning Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Unrighteous Ones, to the <hi>Corinthians)
Such were some of you, but you are now cleansed, &amp;c.</hi>
And here Wicked Ones and Unrighteous Ones
took up his CROSS, which to them was the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of GOD unto Salvation, though to the GREEKS
Foolishness,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11.</note> and to the JEWS a stumbling<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

amongst whom this ELLIGOOD is found, who
is a Stranger to the CROSS OF CHRIST,
who saith, <hi>REPROACHES and Outward SUF<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FERINGS

whenas the CROSS OF CHRIST makes

or <hi>PERSECUTION</hi> for the NAME

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:101884:113"/>
before they be a Prey to the World for
CHRIST's sake; for the VVorld loves its
own, and they that take up the CROSS, do
depart from Iniquity, which is before Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
or Persecution is suffered for the Name of
CHRIST: And here <hi>ELLIGOOD</hi> is found
the Lyar, who said, <hi>Wicked Men were not called to

is found to be no Disciple of Christ, who
is such a <hi>Stranger</hi> to the Cross of Christ, who is a

               </p>
               <p>Then I knowing him to be one of the <hi>Baptists</hi>
Teachers, I took out some Queries, which not
long before I had sent them, but no Answer to
them had I received, and I would have read them
openly that the People might have heard, and also
he that was one of their Teachers; but as I was
reading, he not having Power over his own VVill
could not bridle his Tongue, but disorderly run
into many VVords, so that the People could not
understand; and I spoak to him for it, and he said,
<hi>He had not Time to stay,</hi> and further said, <hi>That he
was not of the Society of these</hi> Baptists <hi>at</hi> Fnestanton,
and yet he came with them and from them; and
then I replyed, <hi>That be owned them to be the Church
of God,</hi> and this he did, and then if he was not of
their Society, he was shut out of the Church; and
then he would have shuffled off with his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
and said, <hi>he dwelt for off,</hi> and then I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101884:114"/>
with the Apostles Words, <hi>Though absent in
Body, yet present in Spirit;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 4. 32.</note> and the Multitude that
believed were of one Heart and Mind, and here
was the Society of the Saints, and he being out
of this Society, is shut out of the Church; and
then he would have made it stood by his <hi>Logick,</hi>
which only is to make a false Thing seem true;
but it the more laid open his deceitful Heart and
Shame to the Hearers, who severally witnessed
against him, to speak nothing but Deceit; and
then saith he, you <hi>call the Apostles Words Deceit,</hi>
because he had often stoln the Apostles Words,
to make his DECEIT seem TRUTH, by
covering it with the APOSTLES Words,
and this is a more subtil Deceit; and then in his
Will he called me Deceiver, the which he was to
prove, and all the People was silent, and there he
uttered several Lyes, and laid open himself to be
the Deceiver, as I had told him in going about to
prove me a Deceiver, he would the more lay open
his own Deceit, and prove himself to be the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver;
and the People did plainly see it so, and
witnessed with me against him; for he did so utter
forth his Folly and Deceit, that he made himself
odious to many that were there; and at last he
shuffled away, under Pretence he had far to go;
but the Judgments of God he cannot escape; for his
Damnation slumbreth not, who is an Opposer of
the Truth of God.</p>
               <p>Then there was one <hi>Philips,</hi> an Old Man of the
Baptized Party in another Room, who in Scorn
and Wrath stood up and said, <hi>They knew the first
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101884:114"/>
Principle of Religion before I was born,</hi> because one
of my Queries to them was, <hi>What is the first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Religion?</hi> So I replyed to the Old Man, if
they knew it, they should have answer'd; and then
presently, as he was running on in many Words,
he swore, <hi>as he lived and breathed,</hi> and Christ saith,
<hi>Swear not at all;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 34.</note> and here he was found not come
to the first Principle of Religion, but out of the
Doctrine of Christ, and so hath not God; so I told
him of his Swearing, and he would have shuffled it
off, but he could not; and I told him, <hi>He that seems
to be Religious,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 John 9.</note> 
                  <hi>and bridleth not his Tongue, his Religion
is vain,</hi> and therfore he might own his Religion to
be vain, who could not bridle his Tongue; and then
in his Will he shuffled off, and said, <hi>He would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
his Sin to me, for I could not forgive Sin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 26.</note> in Scorn
he spoak; then I said, Wo unto him that hides his
Sin, and covers his Iniquity, but he shuffled away
in much Confusion of Face, as they will all appear
as by the Light they come to be searched and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
their Coverings will be found too narrow, and
their Nakedness will appear to their great Shame
and Confusion of Face, and they will be made to
bow to the Truth, and lay down their Crowns at

do oppose him; but here now by the single Eye

               <p>These Things I donot ask because I know them

bow unto the Truth, and be silent, and
let your Mouthes be stopped, and thereby confess

               <p>A Copy of most of these <hi>Queries</hi> was sent to the

               <p>Then after I had received this Libel, I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them this Answer at the Bottom of their own

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> THis is plain Scripture, <hi>Though as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
yet true;</hi> and if my Life and
Conversation doth not prove the same, and make
good my Affirmation, then in your Answer to my
Queries you might have taxed me, and proved
to the contrary: But this of you is but a plain
Shuffle to blind the World, and shun the Shame,
and still to blind the People, who are enslaved
under your Deceit; but this will the more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
your Ignorance.</p>
               <p>Then not long after they return'd me this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,

               <p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:101884:118"/>
IT is not plain Scripture, <hi>Though as a Deceiver, yet
True; As Deceivers, yet True,</hi> is plain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
the greatest Deceiver in the World might as
well have brought it to prove himself no Deceiver, but
true as well as you. For your Conversation, we know
it not; we have nought to say to that: but this we
know, that Wolves may come in Sheep's Cloathing; and
this doth appear in you, in drawing People from the
Truth, as namely, from <hi>Water-Baptism,</hi> which is
a Command of the Lord unto Believers. As for your
saying, We <hi>might have taxed you in our Answer
to your Queries:</hi> We think you might plainly see
your Folly in this: You affirmed nothing in them as
your Judgment; how should we then tax you, and
prove the contrary? And again, We made no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to Answer, and therefore you might have spared
your Daring and False Words, to say, <hi>The People are
Enslaved under our Deceit:</hi> And therefore, until
you have made good what you have taken in hand by
plain Scripture, by the Fruit of your Lips, by bringing
the Doctrine of Christ, and owning his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we say, until then, we are exhorted, To let
you alone: <hi>Let them alone; they be blind Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Blind:</hi> you having been so plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
unto us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> Here all People, who with a single Eye
read, may see the Deceit of this People; for I
spoak but of one, and therefore in that Respect
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101884:118"/>
it is plain Scripture, <hi>though as a Deceiver, yet True:</hi>
But these are they, who, if they could, <hi>would
make a Man an Offender for a Word.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 29. 21.</note> My Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
they cannot touch, and yet are not ashamed
to say, <hi>The greatest Deceiver might as well have brought
this Scripture, as I;</hi> &amp; this is the Blindness of their
Minds: And also say (because I deny <hi>Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi>
to be an Ordinance, or a Command of Christ)
that <hi>I am a Wolf in Sheep's Cloathing,</hi> which they
do affirm to be a Command, but cannot prove it;
and so are such as use their Tongues, and say, <hi>The
Lord saith,</hi> when he never spoak to them: But
surely, a Wolf in Sheep's Cloathing is to be known
by the Life and Practice, but in this they
are blind, and cannot discern, and so themselves
are the Blind Leaders of the Blind; but I shall
not let you alone, but make you manifest unto the
World; neither did Christ let them alone, but
pronounced Woes, and declared against them:
And here I am sure you might see your Folly, who
say <hi>I have been so manifest unto you;</hi> and said, <hi>You
know not my Conversation,</hi> What a Confusion is
this? But it is your Mother's Language. And
also in expecting me to affirm my Judgment upon
my own Queries; then what need I send them
to you to Answer, if I Answer them my self?
And here I am sure you might see your own Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
for it is here plainly laid open; so that all
who are led by you, are plainly seen to be ensla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
under your Deceit: And these words shall
stand for Truth against you, which you call false,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:101884:119"/>
who are the Blind, and so put Evil for Good, and
Good for Evil: And the Doctrine of Christ I
have brought, and his Commandments I do own
from and against you, who are the Busie Bodies
and Self-Actors, who have nought to do with him,
nor his Commands. Therefore, Silence Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
for here I have made good what I have
taken in hand, which witnessed, shall be in your
Condemnation.</p>

and here is Time and Place from me declared.
But to the End of all Disputes and Arguments I

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:101884:122"/>
cease your Boasting and Daring behind the Back

                  <p>So, it seems this pleased them; and so it was
concluded to be of the Twentieth Day, called
<hi>Fryday,</hi> of the Second Moneth, called <hi>April:</hi> So
when the Hour came which was appointed, we
were disappointed of the Meeting-Place which
the <hi>Baptists</hi> had provided; for, they sent me word,
they had provided a Place, but when we came to
meet, it could not be had, and so we were disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed:
Then we were in this <hi>Hind</hi>'s House, and
the Woman of the House much Fumed and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
at us all the while we were in the House,
which manifested what Spirit she was of, and that
<hi>Water</hi> had availed her nothing; for she was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
departed from the Old Nature: So then
they would have had us to have met in the Yard,
but there could be no Order for Multitude of Rude
People and Brutish Schollars, which were as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed
brute Beasts, like the Beasts of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
which <hi>Paul</hi> fought with after the manner of Men;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 32.</note>
so I passed to a Friend's House hard by, and there
continued declaring the Truth, as I was moved,
to the People, and there the idle Drones follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
even <hi>Babylon</hi>'s <hi>Children,</hi> with their Turbulent,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:101884:122"/>
Vain, Contending Spirits, Opposing and Gain-saying
the Truth, like <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> their
Fore-Fathers, who must perish in the Gain-say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Core.</hi> So then word came, <hi>That the</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists
<hi>were in the Shire-House, in the Castle-Yard, and
had sent for me:</hi> and so I went up thither; and when
I came there, the Goaler discharged me for staying
there, and said, <hi>I caused Tumults,</hi> though I had not
spoaken any thing to the People whereby to cause
a Tumult; but the Generation of this World was
alwayes Tumultuous, both about Christ and his
Apostles, though they were known to be innocent
and harmless, offering Violence to none; yet it
was so with them then, and it is so now with the
same Seed, where it is born up to Rule, because it is
not of the World, but hated of the World; for the
Enmity lodges in the World: The World is the
Sea, with its tumultuous gathering together of the
Raging Roaring Waves, casting up Mire and Dirt,
foaming out its own Shame; and though an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Person travail here, he must such Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
expect, and tumults of Raging Waves about
him, casting up such as they have; but he that
made the Bounds of the Sea, can and doth deliver
his out of the Compass of its Bounds, and then
it cannot pass its Bounds; for, its Bounds it keeps:
here is a Parable hid from the Wisdom of the
World; but the same which gave it forth, the same
will open it to the Unlearned.</p>
                  <p>Then after the Goaler had spoak to me, they

made some way for me to come up to the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
who were there sitting upon the Bench like
Judges; this <hi>Doughty</hi> and one <hi>Rix</hi> a Brewer, an
old <hi>Pharisee</hi> in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> the one, a <hi>Baptist;</hi> and
the other of the <hi>Independent</hi> Sect, so called; but
two great Enemies one against another, in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
against each Sect, yet these two were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together as Friends against me; and thus sate
<hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> together, like Judges, against the
Innocent: So when I was gotten amongst the
People, I would not meddle until the Goaler had
given Freedom for me to stay there, as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
discharged me; so, after a while, he gave
leave, so that we would be short: Then this
<hi>Doughty,</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> so called, stood up, and put
off his Hat to the People, after the Manner of
the <hi>Heathen,</hi> with a Complement, pleading of
the Shortness of the Time, and so begun with a
Question; so I said, His Question might stand,
and as he had Liberty to speak to the People, so
would I; and then he would have hindred me,
contrary to what was before agreed upon betwixt
us by the Passages afore-said; so I got Liberty
to speak something to the People, and declared
what I was made a Minister of, according to the
Will of God; and then I took out a Paper, and
read unto the People the Occasion of my coming
thither to meet the <hi>Baptists</hi> that day, and by the
Conclusions therein I was to have Liberty to
speak my Mind as well as he, and he was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:101884:123"/>
me before the People, or the Truth which I
bore Testimony unto; but he broak his first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
and flew to Question; so then, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the Simple-Hearted, I gave this Answer to
the Un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erstanding of the Simple.</p>
                  <p>First, the Baptist's Question:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> The Writings of the Prophets and Apostles,
which are called Scripture, whether are they the Words
and Sayings of the Most High God? yea or nay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Word of God, which is God, which
dwelt in the Prophets and Apostles, from it they
spoak forth the things which are recorded in
Scripture. But this would not satisfie the <hi>Baptists,</hi>
but cryed out, <hi>No Answer;</hi> and <hi>Doughty</hi> stood up,
and put off his Hat, and beckened to the Young
Priests and Schollars, and said, <hi>Judge, ye Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of Divinity:</hi> And there was one <hi>Anger,</hi> a
Drunken Priest, sided with the <hi>Baptists.</hi> Now,
let all see, how contrary to their own Principles
they acted; but some of the Schollars had so
much Understanding, as to receive it for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
but the Drunkards sided with the <hi>Baptists,</hi>
and the Ruder Sort, who could not understand,
though there were many simple Hearts, that
with this Answer were satisfied; but the Wise
must be catched in their own Craftiness: And
several times I repeated this Answer over to the
People, but the <hi>Baptist</hi> and his Party could not
receive it, because it was in the Cross to their
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:101884:124"/>
Wisdom; But there was that which I spoak to
which could and did receive it: Then <hi>Jos. Doughty</hi>
the <hi>Baptist,</hi> and <hi>Henry Rix,</hi> the old <hi>Pharisee,</hi> joyned
together, and with one Consent said, <hi>I durst not
Answer it;</hi> and thus the Unclean Spirits joyned
together, and made Lyes their Refuge: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that I was repeating my Answer over to the
People, <hi>Doughty</hi> stood up, and said, <hi>I spoak I knew not
what;</hi> and then I taxed him with a Lye; and then
he said, <hi>It was not to his Question:</hi> but I bad him
prove that I spoak I knew not what; but he
could not, but shuffled off, and said, <hi>I would flee
from his Question,</hi> and there he stood: Then the
Goaler called to depart; and <hi>Doughty</hi> stood up,
and spoak to the Goaler, <hi>Not to suffer Me to stay
after Him, lest I should seduce the People;</hi> there I
stood up, and challenged him to prove me a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer</hi>
to the People; but he had nothing to say
for that, but manifested himself to be a Seducer,
and a Slanderer, and a Reproacher of the Truth
of God, and so must take part with his Forefathers
of the Wrath of God: Then I openly spoak to
the People, <hi>That if any there could tax me, or lay
any thing to my Charge, I was there to Answer;</hi> but
none did or could there accuse me: So then I
passed into the Castle-yard, then the wild brutish
Schollars, who had plotted together (as I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
informed) to abuse me, and they flocked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
about me like the Wild Beasts of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and there I was tossed as amongst the Raging
Waves of the Sea, to &amp; fro, and at last was hurried
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:101884:124"/>
into a House, where I got shut of those Caterpillars,
which the Nation swarms with: But the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
Party passed away without Disturbance; so
it appears, <hi>The World loves its own.</hi>

and then thou wentst on dreaming and flattering
and <hi>daubing up the People with untempered Morter,
saying, The Lord saith, when he never spoake to

Back of People that was not there, as thou

thou utteredst forth thy Folly, and it is like thou
mightst belie those whom thou spoakest of; for I
heard thee utter forth many open Lyes; and then
thou runnedst on to thy <hi>Water-Baptism,</hi> to maintain
it an Ordinance of Christ, and thou broughtst this

spoak to the Church, <hi>Know you not that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

are baptized into Christ; but as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
It is not the washing away of the Filth of the
Flesh; and here is thy Folly and Ignorance laid
open, who art so blind as to bring this Scripture to
prove <hi>Water-Baptism</hi> to be an Ordinance of Christ;
and again it saith, <hi>They were baptized into his Death;</hi>
and in the same Chapter it saith, <hi>They that are dead
are freed from Sin,</hi> and this thou denyedst, that any
could be set free from Sin so long as they are upon
the Earth; and thus thou deniest Jesus Christ and
his Ordinances, who came to take away Sin, and
to cleanse his People from their Sin; but praised
be the Lord, we do witness a Freedom from Sin by
Jesus Christ, who is the Lamb of God, who came
to take away the Sin of the World, and to redeem
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:101884:127"/>
his People from their Sins, and to redeem unto
himself a pure Church, not having Spot or Wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle,

                  <hi>If the Son
hath set you free, then are you free indeed;</hi> and here
is the Liberty of the Sons of God, and now are
we the Sons of God; and now they that witness
this, and confess it, such blind Hypocrites as thou
call them Blasphemers, and so <hi>deny Christ come in
the Flesh,</hi> and so are of Anti-christ: And one
while thou affirmedst in thy Pulpet, that they that
pressed &amp; led People into Holiness, were no Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
but they that led them into Sin and Evil were
Deceivers, and then afterwards toldst the People,
they never could be free from Sin, so long as they
are upon the Earth; and thus thou wouldst settle
them upon the Lees, and deny Jesus Christ come
in the Flesh, who comes to cleanse from all Sin;
and thus art thou judged out of thy own Mouth for
a Deceiver.</p>
               <p>And thou also broughtst this Scripture to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Water-Baptism,</hi> where the Apostle said,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>For

are enlightned by the Light of Christ, read this

and if any by <hi>Water-Baptism</hi> do now put on Christ,
and by the Light judge thee to be a Lyar, and a
Deceiver, and a Perverter of the Scripture to thy
own Destruction, and all who believe thee, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:101884:128"/>
those that say that God is the Word, and
that there is no written Word, when the Letter
saith it self, that the Word is God; and then thou
broughtst this Scripture to prove the Letter to be
the Word, in 1 Pet. 1. 23. <hi>Being born again, not
of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word
of God, which liveth and abideth forever; for all Flesh
is Grass, and the Glory of Man as the Flower of Grass,
the Grass withereth, and the flower fadeth away, but the
Word of the Lord endureth forever:</hi> And this is the
Word which by the Gospel is preached unto you;
here thou dark Sot, thy Blindness and Ignorance
is more laid open; is the Letter immortal, or any
written Word immortal, or liveth or abideth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever?
or are any born again, but of God? and
is not he that same immortal Word which the
Scripture often bears Testimony unto,<note place="margin">John 15. 3.</note> and also in
this Place; and Christ, the Lamb of God is the
Everlasting Gospel, who preached the Word, and
his Apostles were made clean through the VVord
which he preached unto them; but this was not
the dead Letter, in the which thou wouldst find
Life,<note place="margin">John 5. 39.</note> and so art seeking the living amongst the
dead, like the blind <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who thought in the
Scripture to find Eternal Life, but would not come
unto Christ that they might have Life; and here
thou art in their Steps, though thou madest light
of this Scripture, and saidst, <hi>That some added Ye to
it,</hi> and said, <hi>Ye search the Scripture, for in them ye
think to have Eternal Life, they are they that testifie of
me but ye will not come unto me, that ye might have
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:101884:128"/>
Life;</hi> this was spoaken by Christ unto the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi>
who could not believe that he was the Christ,
but thought in the Scriptures to find Eternal Life,
but would not come unto Christ that they might
have Life, and therefore he bid them search the
Scripture, for there the Prophets had prophesied
of him, and thereby they might know that he was
the Christ, if they had searched with the single
Eye; therefore without <hi>Ye,</hi> I say unto thee, search
the Scriptures, for they are they that bear Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Christ to be the Word, and all that do
search the Scripture with a single Eye, will find
Christ to be the Word, and will believe it,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 24.</note> and
not be so blind as to put the Letter for the Word,
as thou dost, who broughtst another Scripture with
thy dark Mind, where the Apostle saith, <hi>Ye have
a more sure Word of Prophecy, the which ye do well to take
heed unto, as to a Light shining in a dark Place, until
the Day dawn, and the Day-Star arise in your Hearts,</hi>
2. Pet. 1. 19.</p>
               <p>Here thou still the more manifests thy Blindness,

so art a blind Guide and a Deceiver, who cryes,
Lo, here without in the Letter, when the Apostle
saith, <hi>Go not forth, the Word is nigh in the Heart:</hi>
And thus thou opposest the Apostle, and drawest
from his Doctrine, and bringest another Doctrine,
and so art not to be received, but held as Accursed,

thou calledst the Letter the Word, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Story; and here was thy Confusion: And
then thou runndst on with thy fauning dissembling
Speeches, making a Shew oftentimes to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of speaking more of a Matter, but for wearying
their Patience: Oh, blush and be ashamed of thy
Doctrine! now thou makest it appear what filthy
Stuff it is, that art afraid it should weary Peoples
Patience to hear it; if it was of God, it would not be
wearisom to any Thing of God to hear it; but it was
not of God, therefore I am sure it was wearysom
and burdensom to the Spirit of God; and here
thou art shut out with thy frothy Stuff and vain
Complements, to be a Deceiver: And then thou
saidst, <hi>If you please I will speak more,</hi> and thus thou

of the Lord, they spoak, whether they would hear

the Spirit of God, and the Word of God, which
is one, who art a Man Pleaser; and if not a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of Christ, then a Servant of the Devil; and
so I mark thee out, that all may know thee, and
no longer be deceived by thee with the Shadow
instead of the Substance, with thy inticing Words
of Men's Wisdom: And thou told'st the People,
<hi>Thou spoakest to the Reason of Man;</hi> whenas all Men
in the Fall, their Reason is corrupted, and the
Natural Man receives not the Things of God;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 14. Jer. 10. 14.</note>
for, Man by Nature is worse then a Beast; and
there art thou, who art preaching to the Corrupt
Reason of Man in the Fall, to judge of thy Corrupt
stuff; for, I know there were none there that owned
thee, but such like: But the Message of <hi>Paul</hi>
was,<note place="margin">Acts 26. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>To Turn Peoples Minds from Darkness to Light;</hi>
but thou strivest to draw People's Minds from the
Light Within, to the Dead Letter without them,
telling them, that was the <hi>Light,</hi> and that was
the <hi>Word;</hi> and so thou bewitchest them with thy
Lying Divinations, and bad them <hi>search</hi> that, and
<hi>read often</hi> that, and <hi>cleave unto</hi> that: But I say,
they that read that, and not by the Light within
them, read a Parable; and it is unto them as a
sealed Book, though they may, by their Carnal
Wisdom, add their own Meanings; but that
must be shut out of the Scripture; for,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note> such are
unlearned, and unfruitful in the Word, and so
wrest the Scripture to their own Destruction:
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:101884:130"/>
But by this know, That I go not about to draw
men from reading the Scripture, so that they read
with this Single Eye, the Light, which gave
it forth, so shall they that read understand; but
to thee, this is a Mystery, and therefore thou
went'st about to deny <hi>Christ in Man</hi> and <hi>God in Man,</hi>
by way of Derision to those that witnessed forth
Christ Within, God Within: And thou saidst,
<hi>That he meant, he was in them, by his words;</hi> and
thou brought'st this Scripture, <hi>If you abide in me,
and my Words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will,
and it shall be done unto you:</hi> In this Place (thou
Serpent) he meant as he spoak; but <hi>Paul</hi> witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Christ Within, and said, <hi>They that could not
witness Christ Within, were Reprobates;</hi> and so art
thou, who denyest <hi>Christ come In the Flesh:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5. Gal. 2. 20. Col. 1. 26, 27.</note> And
<hi>Paul</hi> preached <hi>Christ Within, the Hope of Glory, the
Mystery which had been hid,</hi> and so it seems is still
from thee; therefore to thee this preaching is
Foolishness, and as Fancies and Whimsies; but
unto us that are saved, <hi>Christ, the Power of God, and
the Wisdom of God;</hi> by which thy Folly and thy
Ignorance of Christ is here made manifest, and
that thou never escaped'st the Pollutions of the
World by the Knowledge of Christ, who denyes
him as he is known to all who have escaped the
Pollutions of the World by the Knowledg of him;
&amp; they that thus know him not,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5.</note> are in the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation:
And here art thou a Minister of Antichrist,
who <hi>denyest Christ come in the Flesh.</hi> And then thou
went'st on with thy Deluding Spirit, pressing the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:101884:130"/>
Wicked to pray; yea, there were many there
present of the People of the World, besides thy
own Company, whom both thou and thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
count as <hi>Heathen,</hi> yet thou didst press them
much to pray, and to take unto them Words and
pray; whenas the Scripture saith,<note place="margin">Prov. 15. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The Prayers of
the Wicked are abominable;</hi> and thus thou didst that
which was abominable in the Sight of God, in
praying thy self, and teaching the Wicked to pray,
and to steal other Men's Words, and pray; for,
neither you nor they have any Words, but what
you steal out of the Scripture: for, thou hast
shut thy self from that by which the Apostles
preached, therefore thou thus runnest into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
               <p>And thou toldst the People of <hi>Deceivers,</hi> and
nominated them to be such as denyed <hi>Baptism,</hi> and
<hi>Ordinances of Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the Dead,</hi> and <hi>Eternal Judgment:</hi> So
when thou hadst done thy Divination and thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Prayer, I stood up, and claimed the Order of
the True Church,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 30, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>That all might speak one by
one, and if any thing was revealed to him that stands
by, let the first hold his Peace:</hi> And then, like <hi>Cain,</hi>
thy Countenance fell, thou being struck with
Guilt in thy Conscience, and fear surprised the
Heart of the Hypocrite: and thou wast shuffling
away, but I bad thee stand; for, said I, thou art
a Deceiver, as I shall prove thee one before all
the People; therefore stand to maintain what
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:101884:131"/>
thou hast said: But said I unto the People, The
Prophets and Apostles, and the Holy Men of
God, who spoak forth the Scriptures, they spoak
from the Infallible Spirit of God, as they were
acted, guided and moved thereby; but all who
come with their Words, and pretending to preach,
and not from the same Infallible Spirit, such are
Deceivers, of which this man is one, who stands
here in the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>at of the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> &amp; he being smitten
with Guilt, fetled to be gone, and several would
have stopped him; but he said, <hi>He would be gone,
unless they kept him in by Violence:</hi> And I said unto
the People, Know this, that these things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he marks out Deceivers, I own, so that I
am none of those; for, the Scripture I own, and
the True Baptism of Christ I own, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
from the Dead I own, and Eternal
Judgment upon the Wicked I own, so that I am
none of those which he marked out; but this
Man is a Deceiver, and so I shall prove him, if
he will stay: But thou, <hi>Ray,</hi> wast ashamed of
thy Ministry, and durst not stand to what thou
hadst said, but plainly, like a Hireling, fled from
thy Stage, and left thy Flock, like a Cowardly
Serpent; I never knew <hi>Baptist</hi> so routed out of a
Pulpit: But the <hi>Independents</hi> joyn'd with him,
and the Priests rude Multitude stood up for him,
and several would have been persecuting of me,
but by the Power of God I was preserved and
kept from the Hands of such Unreasonable Men,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:101884:131"/>
But thus did all Sects ever joyn against the One
Single Truth; but it is but that the Scripture
should be fulfilled, <hi>That</hi> Gog <hi>and</hi> Magog <hi>should
joyn in Battel against the Lamb; but the Lamb shall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome;
and they shall lay down their Crowns before
him; and his Enemies shall become his Foot stol; and
he will tread them in the Wine-Press alone; without the
City.</hi> Therefore Tremble all you Formalists, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitators
and Self Actors, who have gotten a
Form, but deny the Life and Power, even Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, whom you have crucified, which you
shall be made to confess with Weeping Tears,
where your Eyes behold him whom you have
pierced.</p>
               <p>So after I had dassed out of the <hi>Steeple-House,</hi>
when the <hi>Baptist</hi> was put to the rout, I stood upon
a <hi>Grave</hi> in the <hi>Grave-yard,</hi> and there I called to
the People, <hi>If any of them had any thing to Object
against me, I was there to maintain and stand up for the
Truth, to the which I had openly born Testimony in their
Town;</hi> but none would come to my Face. And
there was one Captain <hi>Cole</hi> there present, who
had been counted an <hi>Independent Teacher,</hi> until his
Flock forsook him, and owned the Truth; and
he had railed against the Truth behind my Back,
but he would not come then, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>peak to my
Face; and since he hath imprisoned one of his
<hi>Neighbour's Sons,</hi> for obeying the Command of
God, and coming to his House for a Sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. So I
spoak the Truth unto the People, and proved this
<hi>Ray</hi> openly to be a Deceiver among them; and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:101884:132"/>
judged him out of his own Mouth; and so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my Conscience, to the People, and so I came
away with my Friends in Peace, having cleared
and discharged my Conscience unto them, by
which they are eternally left without Excuse, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they would hear or forbear, their Blood will
be upon their own Heads; and so I leave them.</p>
               <p>Now, upon the Day following, it happened,
that a Friend of mine did speak with this <hi>Ray,</hi> who
unto him did falsly affirm, that I said, <hi>I was the
Head of the True Church,</hi> whenas I never spoak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such a thing; therefore I hearing of a Meeting
of the <hi>Baptists</hi> that day, and that this <hi>Ray</hi> was
there, I and several of my Friends went unto this
Meeting; and when I came at the House, the
Door was open, and I went in amongst them,
and this <hi>Ray</hi> was speaking unto the People;
and when he saw me, he stopt his speaking, and
shut his Book, before I open'd my Mouth to speak,
and bad me <hi>Be gone out of the House:</hi> And I said,
Is thy Spirit limited? Is thy Spirit bound? And
he bad me <hi>Be gone;</hi> and said, <hi>Why did I Disturb
them?</hi> And I asked him, How did I disturb you?
Was not I silent until thou spoak'st to me? But
Guilt tormenting him within, he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
me, but called for the Man of the House to
command me out several times; but he was not
amongst them, as they said, so this <hi>Ray</hi> was much
vexed, and in much Wrath; and one of their
Elders, named, <hi>John Tabram</hi> of <hi>Wickin,</hi> stood up,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:101884:132"/>
and pushed me with his Hand upon my Breast se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times in much Wrath, to have me out of the
House, and I did not resist him; and he said, <hi>If
I would not go out, they would send for the Officers.</hi>
Now, let all People see what Weapons they make
use of, when one comes soberly and civily without
any Violence amongst them, and presently to be
in such Disorder, and Confusion, and Rage, as
they were, and threatning to send for the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
whenas there was no Violence offered by us:
But here you might see what these People would
do, if they had a Law to guard them, as the
Priests have: Then there was one Man, that had
been hearing of them, and he spoak, and said
to this <hi>Ray, You say, They are Deceivers; and they
say, You are Deceivers; now I would have you dispute
it, that those that are ignorant might know which are
the Deceivers:</hi> But <hi>Ray</hi> sleighted him, and said,
<hi>Who art you? I know you not;</hi> and would by no
Means have his Deeds brought to the Light to be
tryed, but gets amongst the Blind, where he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be seen. So then they brought the Woman
of the House to me, and she ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>e <hi>Go out of her
House,</hi> which I did not resist; and so I called to <hi>Ray,</hi>
and told him, He was ashamed of his Doctrine,
and so I shook off the Dust of my Feet for a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against them, and so left them; and then
they shut their Door.</p>
               <p>But, Poor People! I do pitty you, to see how
ignorantly and blindly you are led by the Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:101884:133"/>
of Satan, to think that you are the Church
of Christ and none else; whenas your Teachers
dare not stand to maintain their Doctrine, but
flee away when they should come to the Proof, and
call for Officers when one comes in amongst you
without any Carnal Weapon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is this the Doctrine
of Christ, which you talk so much of, or of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist?
Surely if I had been a Deceiver, and
he a Minister of Christ, then I could not have
stopped his Mouth, but he would have stopped
mine; for, the Ministers of Christ are able to stop
the Mouthes of Gain-sayers; but his Mouth was
stopped, yea, when he was busie at that he calls
preaching too; but my Mouth he could not
stop: And he was found the Deceiver, whom
Truth put to Silence, who was ashamed of his
Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Oh People! take heed how you reject so Great
Salvation; for, this is the Day of your Visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Now you are warned by one, who amongst
you is counted a <hi>Deceiver,</hi> yet <hi>True,</hi> witnessed in
all your Consciences, by that which will either
Accuse you or Excuse you before the Throne of
God, who am known to all the Children of

Is not the first Man yet standing, and the first

you are Strangers to the Light and your Minds
are from the Light, you are wandred and strayed
in the Pathes of Darkness, and so are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

shall bruise the Serpent's Head:</hi> But you are acting
in your own Wills and Wisdom; the Serpent is
your Head; and you are not yet come to witness
the first Promise fulfilled, but are still in the Fall,
under the Power of Darkness, in the Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and Strangers unto the Cross, and so have
no Part in Christ in that Nature: For, none come
to have a Right in Christ, but through the Cross,
for, <hi>As many as are baptized into Christ, are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
into his Death; and they that are Dead with him,
do Live with him; and they that are Dead, are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Creatures, old things are passed away, and all things
become new:</hi> But they that are not in Christ,
are still in old <hi>Adam,</hi> and so in the Fall, under

               <p>Therefore, now read your selves by the Light

your Minds, for the turning of your Minds from
the Darkness to the Light, all you that have a
Desire to find the Way of Truth, in what Form
soever, that thereby you may come to see how
you have been wandred and scattered in the many
ways of Darkness, in the Land of Darkness, in this

for it is to be found within, if ever you find

for the Way is but one, and he that saith, <hi>I am

and stumble at the Light, you stumble at all, and
so fall; but if you love the Light, and be willing

               <p>FIrst, I shall give unto the Reader a <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Work of God in my Soul, and the
Conversion of my Heart from Darkness unto
his marvellous Light, and from the Power of Satan
unto God, and out of the Path of Death into the Path
of Life,</hi> where I now walk in the Light of my
God, with the Ransomed of the Lord, who are
availing towards the Holy City; and also, the
Cause of my coming forth into the World to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the Truth, for which I now suffer Bonds by
the Persecuting Generation, wherein I once lived
a Child of Wrath (as all are by Nature) and
then I was loved of the World, while I followed
the Vain Courses and Wayes of the World, where
by Nature I was led in Imitation of others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that Nature which is prone unto the same,
the time I was sent unto the Schools of Humane
Learning, for to learn the Humane Wisdom, for
which End the Schools are profitable; but for
the attaining of Heavenly Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
they are as far unprofitable; and many
Books that are there read, are much for the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:101884:141"/>
of Youth, and nourishing of the Wild
Prophane Nature, which then ruled in me; and
I was as Wild as others, during the time I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the School; and after I was taken from
the School, I still continued in the same Nature,
growing and encreasing in Sin and Iniquity, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the vain Courses of the Wicked World,
and also was trained up in the Customary Way
of the Worship of the World, which is held in
the Idols Temple, every First Day of the Week,
but no Conversion there was wrought, but all still
continued in the old Nature, both Priest and
People, Young and Old; and as was the People,
so was the Priest, all walking in Darkness and
Blindness, by Form, Custom and Tradition, but
ignorant of the pure Light, which is the Guide
and Teacher of the Faithful, which oftentimes
did reprove in Secret, when I was alone; but
then I knew not what it was; but oftentimes
it did strike me into a Consideration of my Ways
and Doings, and set Life and Death before me,
so that I have sometimes promised within my
self, <hi>never to do the like again;</hi> but the Promise
being in the Will made, it did not stand; but
when the Temptations came, the Careless Mind
got out again, and led me still to delight my Heart
in the Vanity which my Eye did see, and my Ear
did hear, which all passed away with the using
thereof, and left me to the Judgment which was
due unto me for my Iniquity, which did follow
me time after time, calling me to Repentance;
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:101884:141"/>
and the more I did incline my Mind, and draw
nigh to it, it also did draw nigh to me; and so
the Goodness of God led me to Repentance, and
the Grace of God wrought in my Heart a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and so I was found of him when I sought
not; and thus he both wrought the Will and the
Deed of his own good Pleasure, and plucked me
as a Brand out of the Fire, to make me a Vessel
of Honour to his Name: all Living Eternal
Praises be to his Name forever; my Soul shall
Praise and Magnifie his Name forever. For I may
well say with <hi>Paul, of Sinners I was chief;</hi> for
according to my Years, <hi>I was as perfect in Sin and
Iniquity as any in the Town where I lived,</hi> yea, and
exceeded many in the same; so that there was as
little Hopes of my Conversion, as any in the
Town; and yet, though it is a Place of many
People, I was the first in all that Town which the
Lord was pleased to make known his Power in,
and turn my Heart towards him, and truly to
seek him; so that I became a Wonder to the
World, and an Astonishment to the <hi>Heathen</hi> round
about: but they were such Enemies to Goodness,
and so given up to Idolatry, that as much as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they had loved me in my Vain Conversation,
so much the more they hated me in my Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

when they could not prevail, they stood afar off
me, and Reproached me with Lyes, and proved
my Greatest Enemies; yea, and my Relations
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:101884:142"/>
became my Adversaries, and laboured to destroy
what God had begun in me, because that thereby
I came under the Reproach and Shame of the
World, because I could not conform to the World
in their invented Fashions, Customs and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and their Words, Wayes, Fellowship
and Worship; but was made subject to the Law
of God; and could not Respect Persons, neither
in Word nor Deed, then the Beast, which rules in
Proud Flesh, was disturbed, who before ruled in
Peace,<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 38.</note> while he was worshipped; but when I
came to see proud <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the Lust in Man, to
be the Beast, which all the World worships and
wonders after, but those whose Names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Book of Life; therefore I could
no longer follow the World in Blindness; for by
the Power of God my<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eye was opened, so that
I did behold their Idolatry, and therefore I could
no longer be conformable to them, so that their
Rage and Persecution arose against me, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came

Cross, and despise the Shame; so that neither
Foul Words nor Fair Words could cause me to
Deny what God by his Grace had wrought in my
Heart; but by his Power he carried me above
the Raging Waves of the tempestuous Sea; so
that I knew, that he that was in me, was greater
then he that is in the World; yea, and out of
my Kindred and Acquaintance I came, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Stranger to them that lov'd not the Truth:
Yea, and presently I came to see the Priests of
the World by their Fruits, and the Fruits of their
Ministry, which was cursed from God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
profited not the People at all. But when the
Lord by his Power had changed and converted
my Heart unto himself, the Priests became mine
Enemies, and said, <hi>I was deluded;</hi> whenas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when I lived in the vain Conversation of
the World, they took no Notice of me, either to
Reprove me or Instruct me, but as they went on in
a customary way, for Gain and Lucre, speaking
against Sin in the general, but not reproving it in
particular, but were as deep in it in their Lives as
others: and so what they preacht down with their
Tongues, they upheld in their Lives, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
in their Conversations; and so from them I
turned, whom I saw had gotten a Form, but deny'd
the Life and Power: and I sought for a People, with
whom I might have Union; and there was a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with whom I found Union, a few Miles from
the Town where I lived, whom the Lord was a
gathering out of the dark VVorld, to sit down
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:101884:143"/>
together, &amp; wait upon his Name; but we were the
Objects and Reproach of the Country, and were
accounted as the Off-scourings of the VVorld:
but in all this we saw the Scriptures fulfilled,
and that we might thus suffer if we would live
Godly in Christ Jesus:<note place="margin">

                     </gap>
                  </note> and here was our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
and Strength, which carryed us above our
Sufferings, as knowing it was for the Name of
Jesus. And thus I continued a certain time,
counting it greater Riches to suffer Affliction with
the People of God, then to enjoy the Pleasures of
Sin for a Season: and about this time I was about
Fifteen Years of Age. And afterwards I was
called forth to visit some Friends in the North
Part of <hi>England,</hi> with whom I had Union in
Spirit before I saw their Faces: And afterwards
I returned back to my outward Dwelling-Place,
and remained in my outward Calling: And the
Lord all this time still more &amp; more perfecting &amp;
encreasing his Work in my Heart, which by his
Power he had begun in me, and by his pure Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
bringing forth his Truth in me, and making
known his Will unto me, until by his Power He
opened my Mouth to declare his Truth in the
VVorld; and still I continued in my outward
Calling, and also in the VVork of the Lord, as
not being called far from my Dwelling-Place.
And when I was betwixt Seventeen and Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Years of Age, I was moved in my Spirit to
go to a Place about Fifteen Miles from my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Dwelling-Place (southward) amongst a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:101884:143"/>
to whom the Lord was making known his
Truth, not knowing when I went out of going
farther then that Place; but when I was there,
I was moved of the Lord to come on the <hi>Cambridge;</hi>
and in Obedience unto the Lord I came to see
what he had to do for me, not knowing one Foot
of the Way, but as I was directed, neither
knowing when I came there where to be receiv'd;
but had heard before of Two of my Friends, that
were there Whipped, caused by the Mayor that
then was, only for declaring the Truth as they
past through the Town, against the Deceit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
neither did I know but it might be my Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
also when I came there; but without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
with Flesh and Blood, I passed on my
Journey; and he that called me forth, went along
with me, and did direct me: And when I came
there, I found those that were worthy, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
me; and also, I found a Friend, whom the
Corrupt Rulers had put in Prison for the same Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
which I also was sent to declare: &amp; before
I had continu'd there the space of Fourteen Nights
<hi>William Pickering,</hi> the Mayor of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me to Prison for publishing two Papers, the one
<hi>against the Corruption of the Magistrates,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>against the Corruption of the Priests,</hi> at the time
of their Commencement, as they call it; and
there they kept me in Prison the space of two
Sessions, and tossed me from <hi>Prison</hi> to <hi>Dungeon,</hi>
and had nothing to lay against me, whereby to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:101884:144"/>
prove the Breach of any Law; but when I came
to the last Sessions, they called a Jury to prove
the Papers to be Scandalous and Seditious Papers;
and they were nigh Two Hours about them, but
could not prove it, but came and said, <hi>That they
found nothing, but that the Papers were mine;</hi> which I
had before own'd in the open Court, and there was
my Name to them to testifie the same: And so they
were crossed in their Intentions, and their Plots
came to nought. Then they committed me back
to Prison again, and after the space of Three Days
they sent me away with a <hi>Pass,</hi> under the Name
of a <hi>Rogue,</hi> yet durst not give me the Law which
belongs to <hi>Rogues;</hi> but had me away with Clubs
and Staves; and I could not see the <hi>Pass</hi> until I
was Three Miles out of the Town, where I lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Night; and the next day there came a
<hi>Justice of Peace</hi> from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who knowing me
to be Innocent of what was laid to my Charge,
so he witnessed the <hi>Pass</hi> to be false, and took it
back to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and so I was set free.</p>
               <p>And not long after I went of <hi>Cambridge</hi> again,
and went abroad, preaching and declaring the

found that received the Truth gladly, but more
Enemies; yet nevertheless, <hi>Truth spread &amp; conquer'd
over its Enemies;</hi> and there I continued labouring in

the Lord; and when I came there, I found those
that were worthy, who received the Truth glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and there I continued, freely declaring and
preaching the Truth from Place to Place, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the Synagogues, and was haled out by the
Priests Party, that the Scripture might be fulfilled
upon that Generation; yet nevertheless, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in constant Preaching of the Word to the
Consciences of the People, freely and publickly
in several Plains of the Country, notwithstanding
much Opposition both of Priests, People and
Professors, and much did the Truth prevail in the
Hearts of the People, to the Glory of God the
Father of Truth, which did make glad the Hearts
of many, who have long expected this Day to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
but the false Prophet began to utter forth his
Lyes &amp; Blasphemies against the Truth; &amp; the Beast
(by whose Power the false Prophet stands), began
to rage and persecute; and the Ministers of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-christ
stood up for their Kingdom, crying against
Truth, striving to present it odiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the People; but when I came to their Faces,
they fled like Hirelings, and left their Flock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
so that the Truth much prevailed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
their railing and raging, so that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to appoint Meetings, purposely to set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against the Truth, to presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as Error and Heresie; so that if by any Means
they could by their evil incensing and leavening
of the Minds of the People, turn away their Minds
from hearkning to the Truth; and on the other
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:101884:145"/>
Side, they had the Earthly Powers to uphold them
and strengthen them against whomsoever should
come to gainsay them, and to lay their Law upon
them; so I hearing of a publick Meeting that
was appointed by the Priests and Professors of
these Times, to be at a Town, call'd <hi>Great Coggashall,</hi>
upon the 12th Day of the 5th Moneth, called <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
as was declared in publick by the Priest of the
said Town, to Fast and Pray against the Errors
(as they said) of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and
also their Intent was to ensuare me, and to bring
my Body into Bonds, if that I came amongst them
for to defend the Truth, which afterwards appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and although I did see their Intent towards
me, I was made willing not only to be bound, but
also to suffer for the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re Eternal Truth, which I
am made a Witness of; so I being pressed in my
Spirit for to go amongst them and in Obedience to
the same I went, and there was one Priest <hi>Willis,</hi>
an <hi>Independent</hi> Teacher, who was set up in the Seat
of the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> the chiefest Place of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
there speaking <hi>a Divination of his own Brain,
and not from the Mouth of the Lord;</hi> and therefore
knew not how to divide the Word aright, but
cryed against false Prophets and Deceivers, and
he himself one of them; and when the Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st had
done, I spoak unto the People in Vindication of
the Truth of God, which the Priest had before
reproached, reviled and blasphemed; but the
<hi>Priests</hi> and the <hi>Rulers</hi> interrupted me, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
many Words, which bred much Disorder and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:101884:145"/>
Confusion; and then another of the <hi>Priests</hi> got up
into the Pulpit, and they bid me <hi>put of my Hat, and
stand with my Hat off the Time the Priest was praying,</hi>
which Worship I denyed, and therefore could not
be conformable to it, and so I said, <hi>Before I should
be subject to their Wills, I would pass out of the Meeting
Place,</hi> and so I did, and many People came out
after me; for I intended to declare the Truth in
the Town, being I could not have Liberty in the
publick Place: And as I was passing on the Way
quietly towards my Friends House, he that is
called Justice <hi>Wakering</hi> came rushing behind me
amongst the People, and suddenly smote me with
his Hand upon my Back, and said, <hi>He arested me
in the Name of the Lord Protector,</hi> and so I turned
me about, and looked upon him (but knew not
that he was a Magistrate) so I asked him, <hi>Where
was his Writ?</hi> and he said, <hi>He had one,</hi> but none
he shewed me; then they hurried me into
an House, and there some Friends engaged that
I should be forth-coming when their Worship was
done; and so I went unto my Friends House, and
there spoak the Word of the Lord unto the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that there came together, and was also ready
when their Worship was done, according to my
Friends Engagement: And when I came before
them, there were four Men called Justices, and
six or seven <hi>Priests;</hi> yea, there were nigh nine or
ten <hi>Priests</hi> that Day, that were gathered together
against the Truth; and when I was come before
them, he that is called Justice <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="242" facs="tcp:101884:146"/>
and plucked my Hat off my Head, and threw it
away; then they fell to question me of many
Things, to which I made answer, and many fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
Questions they asked me, whereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snare
me, which was neither just nor honest for
Men of their Profession to do; so when they
had satisfied their Wills in examining of me, they
caused a <hi>Mittimus</hi> to be made, and committed me
to the Common Goal at <hi>Colchester:</hi> And there
were several of the chief <hi>Priests</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> that were
Actors in this Persecution; <hi>Priest Willis,</hi> who is a

Church, and those were the Head-Actors in this
Persecution; yea, and <hi>Priest Stellum</hi> speak to the
Rulers in the publick Place, thereby to stir up their
Spirits to persecute; and this was plotted amongst
the <hi>Priests</hi> and their gathered Churches,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 15, 16.</note> to appoint
Meetings, thereby to ensnare the Innocent, and
raise Persecution against the Truth; yea, and
two of the Men called Justices, who were my chief
Persecutors, are Members of the <hi>Independent</hi>
Church; and thus the Churches gather them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
against Christ and his Kingdom; and now
the Ravening Wolves in Sheeps Cloathing do
appear, yea, their Fruits make them manifest,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:101884:146"/>
and those are they who call themselves <hi>Jews, and
are not, but the Synagogue of Satan;</hi> and those are the
Builders, who have &amp; do reject the Corner Stone,
which is now become the Head of the Corner,
and over their Heads is set, and Wo unto them
on whom it lights. And after I was sent to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
there I was kept close, and could not have
my Friends and Acquaintance to come to see me
with Peace and Freedom; and so when I was
there, I wrote an Answer to the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> whereby
I was falsly accused and imprisoned, and sent to
the Men that committed me, for to clear my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
unto them, and lay the Injustice and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
before them, and leave them without Excuse
in the Presence of the Almighty: And so when
the Time came that I was to go to the Assize,
they put me on a Chain amongst Felons and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
and joyned me to one suspected for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and thus I was numbred amongst Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
that the Scripture might be fulfilled; and
thus six of us were hooked together upon a Chain,
so that we could not go into a Bed; for four of
us remained upon the Chain Day and Night; and
thus I was led 18 Miles through the Country for
a gazing-Stock unto the World; but Truth was
preached in all this, and prevailed on the Hearts
of the People, so that I could rejoyce in all, and
triumph over mine Enemies: So when we were
at the Assize-Town, which is called <hi>Chansford,</hi>
the Judge came in upon the seventh Day of the
Week; and upon the second Day of the next
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:101884:147"/>
Week I was brought into the Court before Judge
<hi>Hills,</hi> who sate upon Life and Death, and there
I stood for a gazing-Stock while, and then the
Judge comma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ded them to take me away, and
did not say any thing to me; for then I was singled
from the rest, only had Irons upon one of my
Hands; then upon the next Day Morning the
Goaler sent his Man to take off my other Irons,
and so in the afternoon I was had before the Judge
without any Irons, and the Goaler took off my
Hat, and cast it upon the Floor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then the
Clerk read a long <hi>Indictment</hi> full of Falshoods, and
asked me <hi>if I was guilty,</hi> and I told him, <hi>I denyed
all Guilt,</hi> and called for my Accusers, and the
Judge said, <hi>I might see my Accusers,</hi> and told me,
<hi>I might say Guilty or not Guilty,</hi> and I told him, <hi>I
was not Guilty,</hi> so called twelve Men to try
me, and the Fore-man was a Drunkard; and they
bid me <hi>object against any of them,</hi> and I told them,
<hi>I owned none out of the Doctrine of Christ, and all that
swore were out of the Doctrine of Christ, and they had
all sworn before my Face, and therefore I openly denyed
by them to be tryed;</hi> yet nevertheless they went
on with their Work; and <hi>Priest Willis</hi> was called,
and he swore against me, and swore falsly too;
and the two Men called Justices swore against me,
and swore falsly too; and one of the Justices Men
(so called) and another Man swore against me,
and swore falsly too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet all these false Witnesses
were heard to the full what they would say aginst
me, and thus <hi>the Leader of the People caused them to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:101884:147"/>
err;</hi> for if the Teacher be a Swearer and a false
Swearer, what may the People be? for Christ
saith,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 35, 36, 37. Jam. 5. 1. 2 John 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Swear not at all, but let your Yea be Yea, and your
Nay be Nay, for whatsoever is more is Evil;</hi> and the
Apostle saith, <hi>In all Things my Brethren swear not at
all, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>he that abides, not in the Doctrine of
Christ, hath not God;</hi> and thus, like People, like
Priest, all live without God in the World. And
when their false Witnesses had spoaken what
they could against me, they brought in the Letter
which I had sent to the Men called Justices, in
Reply to their <hi>Mittimus,</hi> and it was openly read
in the COURT, and I owned, it; for my
Name was to it, and the reading of it was much
Satisfaction to many that understood it, and they
also brought another Paper that I writ against the
<hi>Idol's Temple and the Deceiver therein,</hi> both which
shall follow in Order afterwards; and then when
they were both read, <hi>Judge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ills</hi> took them
both, and repeated over unto the Jury all that he
could gather by wrong Interpretation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
against me, whereby to incense the Jury
against me, and told them, <hi>If they did not find me
Guilty, the Sin would lye upon their Heads,</hi> and he as
it were passed the Sentence upon me before the
Jury went forth, yea, and told them what they
should do, whenas they had sworn before to speak
the Truth, and nothing but the Truth; and I had
charged them to take heed what they did, for I
told them, None could judge betwixt Truth and
Heresie, but by the Spirit of the Lord; but
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:101884:148"/>
when I would have spoken something to the Jury
before they went forth, the Judge interrupted me,
and would not suffer me (though one of the Jury
desired it) neither would he suffer that the Jury
should have the Papers that were brought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, though I required it; but sought all
that he could against me, true or false, although
I had sent him a true Declaration of the Grounds
of my Imprisonment, with Hands of four
Witnesses to it, neither would he suffer that to be
read: And that which I would have spoaken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Jury was, to clear it unto them, that it
was no scandalous nor reproachful Words, to call
a corrupt Magistrate, a corrupt Magistrate; and
to call an Unjust Judge and Lawyer, an Unjust
Judge and Lawyer; or a Persecutor, a Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
or a Deceiver, a Deceiver; all which was
brought against me, and call'd <hi>Railing and Scandalous;</hi>
for by that Account they might have taxed all
the Prophets for Railing and Scandaling; for they
open and often declared against the Corruption of
the Priests and Rulers,<note place="margin">Isa 56. 11. Ezek. 34. John 10. Luk. 13. 14, 15. Luk. 13. 31, 32. Joh. 3. 14.</note> as you may read in many
Places in the Prophets Records; <hi>Isa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ah</hi> called the
Priests <hi>Greedy Dumb Dogs;</hi> and the Prophets cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them <hi>Idol-Shepherds,</hi> and the like; and Christ
call'd them <hi>Hirelings</hi> and the Rulers <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and
<hi>Herod</hi> a <hi>Fox;</hi> read <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thew</hi> 23. and see if you may
not as well call that Railing; and yet in all this
they did not rail nor scandalize any, but gave to
every Nature its Name and due Reproof, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they would hear or forbear; <hi>But this is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:101884:148"/>
of the World, Light is come into the World,
and Men love Darkness rather then Light, because their
Deeds are Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So, when the Jury came in, to bring in their
Evidence, they could charge me with nothing;
but the Paper I had writ in Reply to my <hi>Mittimus,</hi>
after I was imprisoned; which Paper I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
owned in the open Court, with my Name
to it: But the Indictment they could not charge
me with; for it tended to a Riot, which I was
far from, or any that owned me: But the Judge
and the Clark both dishonestly strove to draw
Words out of the Fore man of the Jury, which
the rest did not consent to, neither could he speak
their Minds; but others of the Jury were fain to
speak themselves, but nothing was cleared against
me: Then the <hi>Goaler</hi> was commanded to take me
away; and when I was gone forth of the Court,
they sent for me again; and the Judge imposed
two Fines upon me, to the Value of about <hi>Forty
Pounds;</hi> the one he said, <hi>was for the Contempt of
the Magistracy;</hi> the other, <hi>for the Contempt of the
Ministry;</hi> for he said, <hi>The</hi> Lord PROTECTOR
<hi>had charged him, to see to punish such Persons as should
Contemn either Magistracy or Ministry.</hi> But what a
Ministry is this, that stands in need of an outward
Magistracy, to uphold it against a People that
come with nothing but Spiritual. Weapons, to
defend themselves against Spiritual Wickedness,
which now sits in high Places: But this Ministry
is contrary to the Ministry of Christ, <hi>whose Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:101884:149"/>
are not Carnal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>but Spiritual.</hi> And also, several
of mine Accusers stood upon the Bench, hard by the
Judge, several time Whispering him in the Ear,
and leavening and incensing his Mind against me;
and I reproved one of them in the open Court for
so doing, and yet these things were suffered. And
also the Judge gave Charge unto the Goaler, <hi>To
let no Giddy-headed People come to me</hi> (as he called
them) which I never desired that any such should
come; but thereby they take Occasion to keep
my Friends from me, accounting them Giddy-headed
People: But they are not Giddy-headed
People, that own sound Doctrine; but they are
Giddy-headed People, that cannot endure sound
Doctrine, but have itching Ears, carried about
with Reports and Hear-says, to speak Evil of the
things they know not. But thus, without all
Honesty they acted in the Enmity of their Minds
against me; yet in all I was made to rejoyce;
for, I see their Deceit was manifest to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the Truth owned in many Hearts, so
that my Sufferings were not grievous unto me, but
joyous. But as the Judge's Dealings were Rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and Unjust towards me, it was so much the
more on the contrary to <hi>Barrabas;</hi> for there were
three or four arraigned for Suspicion of <hi>Murder,</hi>
and others for <hi>Fellony,</hi> yet he did deliver them, and
there was not one that Dyed or was Branded, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which I did desire; but only this I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
to shew <hi>how the World loves its own,</hi> and how
the same Spirit now rules in both Priest, People
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:101884:149"/>
and Rulers, that ruled amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> who
esteemed <hi>Barrabas</hi> above <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>numbred him
amongst Transgressors:</hi> And so, in all this the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is fulfilled, and the Day further appears to
the <hi>Glory of God, the Father of Truth,</hi> who will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
his <hi>Truth by his own Power over the Heads of all its
Enemies.</hi> So then they brought me back to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
again, where I still remain in the <hi>Peace and
Freedom of my Spirit,</hi> which none can take away,
though in the Hands of mine Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know,</hi> That the Invisible God in working

with very many other Persons, of my gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, did this day in a Riotous Manner, enter
the Parish Church of <hi>Great Coggashall,</hi> aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> Are you not ashamed, who profess
your selves Ministers of <hi>Law, Justice</hi> and
<hi>Peace,</hi> to begin with Lyes, and make them your
Refuge against the Innocent, tending to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
of the Peace of the Faithful, whom
you both ought and would Encourage and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
if you were faithful Ministers of <hi>Peace</hi>
and <hi>Justice,</hi> standing in the pure Counsel of God,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:101884:152"/>
Ruling for God, and not for your selves, in all
things discharging your Consciences unto God,
without Partiality or Respect of Persons, as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Ministers of Law and Justice: But contrary
unto this you have acted in your corrupt Wills,
turning your Swords against the Messengers of
the Most High, and wilfully resisting the Truth
of God, making Lyes your Refuge, as here doth
plainly appear. For, upon the day aforesaid, I
was at a Friend's House in <hi>Great Coggashall,</hi> where
several Friends and Neighbours were come to see
me, and there sate peaceably together, waiting
upon the Lord, and I having heard of a publick
Meeting at the Steeple-House in the said Town,
of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Professors</hi> of these Times, as it
was openly published by Priest <hi>Sammes,</hi> and the
Priest of the said Town, in the said Steeple-house,
upon the First Day last past, to that End, as I
heard, and since did understand, <hi>for to Fast and
Pray against, and lay open the Errors</hi> (as they said)
<hi>of the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>for the Returning of
them who owned them, and the Establishing and Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening
those against them that did not own them</hi> (to
wit) <hi>the People called</hi> Quakers; so I being pressed
in my Spirit for to go amongst them, in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
and Defence of the Truth of God, brought
forth in these People, whom the World scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
calls <hi>Quakers,</hi> I also being made a Minister
of the same Eternal Truth, through the Power
of God, by which I am made able, and carryed
on to declare it openly and publickly, to the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:101884:152"/>
Confounding of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and the reviving
of the Witness for God in the Conscience, and
also to suffer for the same, which I did believe
the Priests did much Blaspheme and Reproach,
striving to present it Odious to the People; so,
in Obedience to the Lord I went out from amongst
my Friends, not telling one of them whither I
was a going (as many can witness) and one
Friend followed me to the Door, and perceiving
something of my Going, he asked me, <hi>If he
might go with me?</hi> and I bad him, <hi>Use his Freedom
to come after, but I desired to go alone;</hi> and so I went
on the Way single: And when I came at the
Steeple-house Door, which you Persecutors call a
<hi>Church,</hi> &amp; also account your selves another <hi>Church;</hi>
and thus you set up Churches in your Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet are Strangers to the True Church, which
are no Persecutors; but when I came there,
there were several Boys and Children that would
have flocked in after me, and I bad them go in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, rather then to go in Disorderly, whereby
to occasion <hi>any Disturbance;</hi> and so I went in very
Orderly, and stood very Orderly, not speaking
one Word until their Priest had done, and was
coming out of his Seat, as many can witness,
though the Priest had been openly Reviling and
Reproaching the People of God in particular,
whom he scornfully called <hi>Quakers.</hi> Therefore,
let all People, whose Understandings are enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened,
judge in what Riotous Manner I entred
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:101884:153"/>
the place which you call a <hi>Church,</hi> and bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against you, who are not ashamed to make
Lyes your Refuge against the Innocent: and also,
what are the Weapons which you make use of,
who call your selves <hi>Christians,</hi> but make Lyes
your Refuge; and cover your Actions with Deceit?
But was this the Practice and Nature of Christ?
For, a <hi>Christian</hi> is Christ-like; and let all that
profess Christ walk as he walked. But these are
the Fruits of your publick Humiliation, who go
about to mock God; but your End shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your Works.</p>

out of his Seat, I did not speak one Word unto
him, as Hundreds can witness; and the first
words that I spoak, were not as you accuse me, but
this I said, <hi>This is the Order of the True Church, that
all may speak one by one;</hi>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:101884:153"/>
I spoak on in the Behalf of those People called
<hi>Quakers,</hi> whom the Priest had before often and
openly reviled; but so soon as I had spoak a few
words, the Priest and several others disorderly ran
into many words, &amp; so interrupted me in speaking,
that it bred much Confusion: Then the Priest
asked me, <hi>What I would Object against him?</hi> I told
him, <hi>In that he Reviled the People called</hi> Quakers;
<hi>and said, they were built upon a Sandy Foundation, and
so called them</hi> Shakers, <hi>and the like:</hi> But I told him,
<hi>I would prove their Foundation not to be Sandy, and
him to be the False Prophet:</hi> And so I declared of
the <hi>Stone cut out of the Mountain without Hands,</hi> which
strikes at the Feet of the Image, whose Head is
Gold, and Breast of Silver, and Thighs of Brass,
and Legs of Iron, and Feet part Iron &amp; part Clay;
and this Stone is become a great Mountain, upon
which the Church is built, as a City set on a Hill
cannot be hid; And this is the Foundation of the
People that are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> not all that are
called <hi>Quakers,</hi> but the Real People, whom the
World scornfully calls <hi>Quakers:</hi> And this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Stumbling-Stone, and a Rock of Offence
to the Nations; and so it seems it is unto you,
because you are the Worshippers of the great I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
which you call the Divine Worship of
your God: but God Almighty you know not;
for he abhors all the Sacrifices of <hi>Cain,</hi> and his
Generation, which was ever the Persecuting Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
upon which must come all the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Blood-shed from Righteous <hi>Abel</hi> until now.

                        <hi>Wo unto you, ye Serpents, ye Generation

                     </p>
                     <p>So when I had cleared the Foundation of the
People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as aforesaid, some of you
accused me, <hi>That I owned no Church:</hi> And I said,
<hi>It was False:</hi> Then some of you asked me, <hi>What
Church I owned?</hi> And I answered, <hi>The Church in
God;</hi> and more words I spoak about the Church:
Then <hi>Willis,</hi> the <hi>Diviner,</hi> stood up in his Will,
and said, <hi>I spoak nothing but Nonsense:</hi> And I bad
him, <hi>Name one Word that was Nonsense, that I had
spoaken:</hi> And he said, <hi>To say, the Church in God:</hi>
Then I took out my <hi>Bible,</hi> and read unto him the
first Chapter of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and the first
Verse, where the Apostle writeth to the Church
of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> which is IN God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:101884:154"/>
Then Paleness struck the Face of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner,
neither would any of his Fellows stand up
to justifie what he had taken in hand; and this
was it wherein I said he Blasphemed, to say <hi>the
Church in God was Nonsense,</hi> Then there was one
Priest <hi>Stellum,</hi> a Magician of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who stood up
in the Enmity of his Spirit, and accused me with
several Lyes and Slanders, which hardened <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi>'s
Heart, so that you Corrupt Rulers would
not suffer me to clear my self from what he had
accused me withal: But the Magician got up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Seat of Divination, and was going to his
Abomination, and then the Rulers called to me,
<hi>to put off my Hat;</hi> then I bad you call to the Priest,
<hi>to put off his Cap,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus may all see the Blindness and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Priests and People, who are offended at
a <hi>Hat,</hi> and not at a <hi>Cap:</hi> And this is as the Vain
Traditions of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who observed the
Washing of Pots and Cups, and such like things,
making clean the Outside; which Scripture
Priest <hi>Willis</hi> (who said, <hi>the Church in God was Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense</hi>)
brought in reference to the People called
<hi>Quakers,</hi> because they do not put off their Hats,
in Respect [or Worshipping] of Mens Persons:
But let any, who hath Understanding, consider
which is more Traditional, for a man to keep his
Hat on his Head, for which End it is made, as
also his Shoe for his Foot, his Glove for his Hand,
or the putting off these things in <hi>observation</hi> or <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,</hi>
                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:101884:155"/>
and <hi>Reverencing mens Persons,</hi> for all which
there is No Scripture, therefore a Vain Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Man; and thus they teach for Doctrine
the Traditions of Man: Therefore, <hi>in vain do
you worship God,</hi>

and observing Vain Traditions and Customs, as
did your Fore-fathers, whom Christ pronounced
Wo against, who were his Persecutors, and in
whose Steps ye are found; and therefore read
your Portion. And thus, while you are crying
against the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> for observing vain
Traditions and Customs, and their Strictness in
their Observations, and yet Persecutors of the
Just, you also are found the same, who are set up
in the Chiefest Place of the Assembly, as they

<hi>stand praying in the Synagogues,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> as they did; <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and <hi>in your set Times of Worship, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Fasts, and Dayes of Humiliation,</hi> and yet are
Persecutors of the Just, as they were; yea, in
the very Height of your Worship the Bitterness of
your Spirits appeared: But is this such a Fast as
God hath chosen? Nay; It is Abomination;
his Soul loaths it: And he will judge the Cause
of the Innocent upon you Hypocrites, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
of you his Adversaries, and give you your
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:101884:155"/>
Portion with Unbelievers in the Lake that burns,
prepared of old for <hi>Cain</hi>'s Generation, in which
you are found, by the Eternal Light of God,
which cannot Lye, which will rise up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against you at the Last Day, though now you
stumble at it, and are offended at it; yet then
<hi>shall you behold him whom you have pierced,</hi> though
with Lamentation and Sorrow of Mind, when
there is none to deliver you from the Wrath of the
Almighty; and this is answered and witnessed in
your Consciences.</p>
                     <p>Then the Occasion of my passing out of the
Steeple-house, was this; When I could not have
Liberty to speak in the Vindication of the Truth
against Gain-sayers, ye would have had me to have
stood with my Hat off the Time the Priest was
Praying, which Worship I denyed, and therefore
could not be Conformable to it; and so I said,
<hi>Before I would stay to fulfil your Wills, I would pass out
of the Steeple-House:</hi> And many came out after
me, but not of my calling, and many that I knew
not, and yet you are not ashamed to say <hi>My Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And again, <hi>That I went into the Common high Way,
and there kept with the People unlawfully together,</hi> as
you affirm, is a very abominable Lye, especially
for Men of your Profession to tell, which many
can witness against; for I was passing on the Way
quietly without Disturbance towards my Friends
House from whence I came, not purposing to stop
until I came there; but that he that writes himself
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:101884:156"/>
                        <hi>Dyonisius Wakering</hi> came hurrying in amongst the
People, and clapped me on the Back, and said,
<hi>He rested me in the Name of the Protector,</hi> and there
stopped me; and the first Words that I spoak,
were, <hi>Where is thy Writ?</hi> And so the People ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
about, and thronged much; but that any
gave out menacing and threatning Speeches, I
cannot say, neither whom they were spoaken
against; but any that own me, it is well known,
they are not Men of such boistrous Spirits, but
rather are made willing to be rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as Hundreds will acknowledge: But <hi>Wakering,</hi>
if he was true to that of God in his Conscience,
he would confess how I laboured in his Presence
to still the People, when he had violently laid
Hands on me, and given the Occasion; and so
let all take Notice, that there was no Disorder
nor Disturbance until the Magistrate came and
laid violent Hands on me, tending to the Breach

no Propriety in the Earth, because my Kingdom

I appear unto you to be an idle disorderly Person,

changeable Minds; but I am a Labourer in the
Gospel of God, in which Work none can tax me
with Idleness, since I came into these Parts, but
if I had been more idle in the same, ye would
have been more pleased; for it is my great Labour
and Diligence in this Work of the free Gospel, and
the Prosperity thereof, in the overturning and
laying open the Deceits of deceiving and deceived
Men, that torments you, who are the Shelterers
of the false Prophet, whom you carry in your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
because he cryes Peace unto you, when the
Lord cryes Wo; yet nevertheless, it is but for a
Time; for the Hand of the Almighty is against
you, and who shall deliver you?</p>
                     <p>And when you have laid all these Lyes, Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and false Accusations upon my Back, you
commit me to the Common Goal for this County,
as you say, <hi>in the Name of his Highness, the Lord

he took not upon him that Place and Title

it doth so appear, or else the Messengers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

such Unjust Lawyers and Judges as you are? For
you that cast me in contrary and without Law; it's

against you to your Shame and Confusion of Face,

you for Enemies and Persecutors of the Just, who bind
heavy Burthens, and lay them upon the Oppressed, but
will not touch them with one of you Fingers, but the
greater will be your Condemnation, when there is none to
deliver you from the Hand of the Almighty, neither
Rocks nor Mountains to shelter you, but the Refuge of
Lyes shall be done away; therefore while you have Time
prize it, and bring your Deeds to the Light, and own
your Condemnation by the Light, that your Souls may
be saved; now you are warned, and the Messenger of
the Lord discharged, by whom you are warned, and the
Truth cleared from your Lyes and false Accusations, which

               <p>
                  <hi>Several Queries to all you Magistrates and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
and Proud and Lofty Ones, who Rage,
Persecute and Despise Men because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
put off their Hats to you; and call it,
A Contemning of Authority, and Mis-behaviour,
and yet say, you are Christian-Magistrates,
and profess the Scriptures to
be your Rule: Now, try your selves, and
prove your Practice by the Scripture, and by
it Answer these Queries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 1. WHat Rule have you in the Scripture
for the putting off the <hi>Hat?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. What is that in Man, that would be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the putting off the Hat, or bowing the
Knee?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:101884:158"/>
3. Why is it called Courtesie to put off the Hat
to the Poor; and Honour, and Manners, and Due
Respect to put off the Hat to the Rich?</p>
               <p>4. Whether is this Respect of Persons, because
of Advantage? yea or nay: or what makes
this Difference?</p>
               <p>5. Where is your Example for this amongst all
the <hi>Christians</hi> under the Gospel, as you profess?</p>
               <p>6. And what is that in Man that so swells, and
causeth such Wrath and Rage to appear against
another, for not putting off the <hi>Hat,</hi> if the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off the Hat or bowing the Knee be such a
small Matter, as some acconnt it?</p>
               <p>7. Whether is that right Authority or Justice
in man, that commands his Fellow-Creature to
put off the <hi>Hat</hi> before him, and so to stand until
he suffer him to put it on; and if he doth not so
stand, then to fall into Wrath and Rage, and say,
<hi>He Contemns Authority?</hi> yea or nay.</p>
               <p>8. Where is there any Law that commands a
man to put off his <hi>Hat</hi> to one man more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>9. And if there was a Law that did so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
whether he that obeyes the Law of God,<note place="margin">James 2. 9.</note>
that commands No Respect of Persons, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeys
the other Law, do Contemn Authority?
yea or nay.</p>
               <p>10.<note place="margin">Esther 3.</note> Whether was that Authority in <hi>Haman</hi> to
be obeyed (who was a Chief Ruler) and would
have had <hi>Mordecai</hi> to have bowed unto him?</p>
               <p>11. And what was that in <hi>Haman</hi> that made
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:101884:159"/>
him full of Wrath, so that he would have destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Mordecai,</hi> and all the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Nation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Mordecai</hi> could not bow unto him; and what
Difference is there betwixt <hi>Haman</hi> and you in this
Matter, who now are full of Wrath and Rage,
and imprison those that cannot put off their <hi>Hats</hi>
to you?</p>
               <p>12. And whether was that Mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Kings Command to bow unto <hi>Haman,</hi>

to you now; and wherein do you see any Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt these men now, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> in
that Matter, seeing they suffer Imprisonment
before they can do it?</p>
               <p>13. And what Lordship and Authority was
that,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 25.</note> which they that were accounted to rule over
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> did exercise upon them, which Christ
declared against to his Disciples, and wherein do
you differ from them in that Matter?</p>
               <p>14. And what Honour was that which the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi>
received one of another,<note place="margin">John<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 54. 4.</note> for which Cause
Christ judged them to be in the Unbelief, and
whether you be not guilty of the same? yea or
nay.</p>
               <p>15. And what is the Honour which comes from
God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which Christ there spoak of; and whether
it stands in the putting off a <hi>Hat?</hi> yea or nay.</p>
               <p>16. What is the Beast,<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 3, 8.</note> which all the World
worships and wonders after? and what is the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of that Beast, and his Image? and whether the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:101884:159"/>
Power and Authority of that Beast is to be obey'd?
yea or nay.</p>
               <p>17. How is Justice to be honoured?</p>
               <p>18. And whether a Man may not put off his
<hi>Hat</hi> to a Magistrate, and yet envy him, and hate
him in his heart? And whether many in these
dayes do not so? And whether this be the <hi>Honour</hi>
that a Magistrate ought to seek for? yea or nay.</p>
               <p>19. And whether a Man may not honour Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Equity in is heart without putting off
a <hi>Hat</hi> to a Magistrate? and he that so doth, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is he fit to be called a Magistrate, that calleth
such a one <hi>A Contemner of Authority,</hi> and commits
him to Prison for Mis-behaviour? And whether
this be Justice or Equity? yea or nay.</p>
               <p>20. And you that plead this Scripture, <hi>Be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's sake;</hi>
Whether is it for the Lord's sake, that a Man
would have his Fellow-Creature to stand with
his <hi>Hat off before him,</hi> or for his Selfs sake; and
whether then it is to be obeyed? yea or nay.</p>
               <p>21. And he that for the Lord's sake, aud for
Conscience sake, cannot so rob God of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Honour, as to bow to or worship any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but God alone, who is the Creator; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought he to be imprisoned for Mis-behaviour,
or a Contemner of Authority? yea or nay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of Equity: And whether
this is to be called <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> according
to the Law of <hi>England?</hi> yea or nay.</p>

Now, all you that profess your selves <hi>Christians,</hi>
and the Scripture to be your Rule; take the Scripture,
and prove your Practice by the Scripture amongst all the
<hi>Christians;</hi> or else, let the Life and Practice of
the True <hi>Christians</hi> judge you and condemn you;
and own your selves to be in Proud <hi>Haman</hi>'s
Nature, and so liable to <hi>Haman</hi>'s Judgment: And
hence forward look to your Office, to Rule for God, and
not for your selves, and then you will not stand upon
such frivolous things; for, it is a frivolous thing to
look for the putting off the Hat, and is no Part of True

               <p>
                  <hi>THis is the Idols-Temple, where the Worship of
the Beast is upheld, down with it, down with
it, 1 Cor. 8. 10. Rev. 13. 7, 8. Deut.</hi> 12.
God that made the World and all Things therein,
dwells not in Temples made with Hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.
47, 48, 49. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. Neither is he worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in Idols Temples made with Mens Hands,
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 24. God is a Spirit, and they that worship
him must worship him in Spirit and in Truth; for
the Father is seeking such to worship him, <hi>John</hi>
23. 24. All the World wonders after and worships
the Beast, but those who have their Names writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Book of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 3, 4, 8. And
they that worship the Beast, receive his Mark in
their Foreheads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 16. As sprinkling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
and worshipping the Works of their own
Hands, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 8. And following the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their own Hearts; such must drink of the

Place for Night-Birds and Scrich-Owls to meet

To the Dishonour of the only true God, that
dwelleth in Temples made without Hands, at

and</hi> speaketh a Divination of his own Brain,
but not from the Mouth of the Lord, and so makes
the People light and vain, <hi>Jer. 14. 14. But the
Lord is against him, hold him not up;</hi> for he ran and
the Lord never sent him, therefore he profits not
the People at all, <hi>Jer. 3. 1, 2, 3. But hath stollen
the Letter, which is Carnal, with it to feed the Carnal,
for Carnal Ends and Lucre, and so</hi> hath a Form, but
denyes the Life and Power, and therefore from
him turn away, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. Therefore spend

Justice in thy Hand, and hast turned the Edge of

and thy fair VVords will not shelter nor
cover thy deceitful Actions, but thy deceitful
Heart is made manifest, and thy Hypocrisie doth
there appear;<note place="margin">Sa. 5. 10.</note> for thou hast hearkned unto the
false Prophet, and by his enticing VVords thou
art deceived, and so puttest Darkness for Light,
and Light for Darkness, Evil for Good, and Good
for Evil, and so art lyable to the VVo from the
Lord, and hast persecuted Christ, and set at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<hi>Barrabas;</hi> yea, <hi>and I was numbred amongst
Transgressors,</hi> yet could not have the Liberty of
Transgressors, as in many Things might be nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated;
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:101884:166"/>
but in short I shall declare it; <hi>First,</hi> That
mine Accusers should stand in the Place as Judges
over me, and their Accusations and false
Witnesses to be heard to the full, and also to
whisper and buz in thy Ears in secret, what they
would against me, and also that thou that satest in
the Seat as a Judge, to repeat over unto the Jury
all that thou couldst gather by wrong Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Construction against me, but nothing
of my Defence against my Accusations,
but rather to drive out of their Minds, by thy
evil incensing, what I had before declared in my
own Defence; but thou, as it were, passedst the
Sentence upon me before the Jury went forth;
but thou thoughtst thou hadst pannelled a Jury,
wherewith thou wast pleased to try me, according
to thine own Mind and Will; for the Fore-man
was a Drunkard, and the rest Swearers, out of
the Doctrine of Christ; against all which I did
object, and denyed by them to be tryed; but it
was thy Will and Pleasure so to do; and when
they come to bring in their Evidence, they had
so much Understanding, that they charg'd me with
nothing but the Papers which I had before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to be mine, and owned them, but the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment</hi>
they would not own to be Truth against
me, though dishonestly both thou and the Clerk
did draw Words out of the Fore-man of the Jury,
which the rest did not consent to; and then in thy
Will, with thy fair and deceitful Speeches, thou
imposedst a Fine upon me, contrary to all Law
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:101884:167"/>
and Equity; but where Equity is not, it cannot
be expected; for Oppression within, Oppression
without; and he that cannot Witness the Sword
of Justice set up in his Heart, knows not how to
handle it without; for he that rules not by the
Law of God in his Heart, rules in his own VVill,
and is partial, and understands not the Things of
God; but what pleaseth his VVill, that he che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth;
and what crosseth his VVill, that he would
curb: and the VVill of Man is opposite to the
VVill of God; therefore the Cross of Christ is
of Use to them that know it, but a stumbling
Block to the VVorld; but he that rules in his
own VVill is no Minister of God; he that respects
Persons is not fit to bear Rule for God; he that seeks
himself is not fit to bear Rule for God; all which
appeared, and was openly manifest in thee in the
open Court, as in those Things before mentioned,
and many other which are now out of Mind; but
for the clearing of my Conscience unto thee, I
was moved to write, that thou mightst see what
thou hast done, and be left without Excuse of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance

same with Patient Suffering in the Bonds of the
Gospel, that you may see, <hi>That it is no other but
what we are made able and willing to seal with patient
Suffering, yea, with our Blood, if we be called to it,</hi>
as many of us have done in this Nation, though
it be called <hi>A Land of Liberty,</hi> but it is for <hi>Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
but Truth and Equity are Strangers in it,
and therefore are persecuted: But you that are
found worthy to receive these Strangers, happy
are you: And though the Raging <hi>Sodomites</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
you about, for to cause you to cast out these
Strangers, that they may work their Wills upon
them, yet be Faithful, and fear them not; but
cast out your Darlings before them, and stand in
the Faith of the God of Truth and Equity, and
you shall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> see the <hi>Sodomites</hi> struck with Blindness,
that they shall not be able to prevail against you;
but when they are weary with striving, they shall
be made to sit down in Sorrow; and so shall it
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:101884:171"/>
be fulfilled which of old was prophesied, that
<hi>No Weapon formed against the Faithful shall prosper;</hi>
but, <hi>Wo unto them that lift up their Heel against them.</hi>
Therefore I charge you all in the Name of
the God of Truth, <hi>Be Faithful, Valliant and
Bold for the Truth received: and as you have received
it, so walk in it; that you may profess no more in Word,
but what in Life you seal; that the Light may be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
forth in your Lives, and shine forth in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations,
to the Glory of the Father of Lights, and
the Confounding of the</hi> Heathen, who profess God
in VVords, but in Life deny him: <hi>And be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that Self shall suffer for the Truth, and not the
Truth for Self</hi> (for the Truth was ever sealed with
Persecution since <hi>Gain</hi>'s Generation had a Being
upon the Earth) <hi>and so own the Cross, and despise
the Shame; and give up your selves to suffer for the
Truth received, all you that would follow the Lamb to
the Land of Rest, and through many Tryals you will
wax strong and bold, and confident in your God;</hi> for,
God is not known what a God he is, until the
Time of Tryal. <hi>And all keep your Meetings in the
Name and Fear of the Lord God, waiting for his Power,
in the Obedience to his Light, which in your Consciences
doth reprove you when you do amiss, that in it you
may wait, and watch over the Foes that are of your own
House, that you may know the Warfare begun in your
Hearts against your Spiritual Enemies; and so the God
of Power manifest himself amongst you by his Mighty
Power, bringing down all that in you which opposes him,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:101884:172"/>
and would not that he should reign over it, and exalt
his own Seed in your Hearts, and establish you in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
that his Image you may bear; and</hi> He shall
be your God, and Ye shall be his People.</p>
               <p>And so, in the Unchangeable Truth, I rest,
in Unity with all the Faithful, in the Glorious
Liberty of the Sons of God, though in Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Bonds for your sakes.</p>

                  <hi>Reply,</hi> HEre thou mayst be ashamed to stile
thy self an ancient Minister,
who manifests such an <hi>Ishmael</hi>'s

of God in all Ages witnessed,<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 9.</note> which made

owned the Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> owned and witnessed quaking
and trembling which Truth thou manifests thy
self but a Professor of, and a Stranger to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and a Despiser thereof; and therefore, out
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:101884:174"/>
from among the Ministers of Christ thou art rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
and thy Answer is not according to Truth,
but a Lye, as shall further be made to appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
by him whom thou callest the Young <hi>Quack;</hi>
and it seems, Fear surpriseth the Heart of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
so that thou art ashamed to own thy Work
with thy Name.</p>
               <p>Priest, <hi>And whereas thou saist,</hi> Courteous Reader,
we are forced, notwithstanding so many Pamphlets ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
against the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> to give Answer
to thirty six Queries of <hi>James Parnel</hi>'s, the Young
<hi>Quaker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> Although thou hast boasted thy self an
ancient Minister, and contemnest me as a young
Boy, yet here it appears, that thou art glad of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to help thee to answer my Queries, as these
Words before mentioned do testifie; and yet it
is but a Pamphlet, as thou and thy Helpers do
confess, that those many are that are extant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the People called <hi>Quakers:</hi> And then thou
runst on in Way of Reproach and Scorn against
me, because of my Youth; but the Wisdom of
<hi>Solomon</hi> answereth you, That <hi>a poor and wise Child
is better then an old foolish King, who will no more be
admonished;</hi> and therefore, when you think of
your Age, consider also your Folly, and let that
stop your Mouthes from professing your selves
Ancients, who manifest such a light scornful Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and hate to be reformed.</p>
               <p>Priest, <hi>And whereas thou saist,</hi> Thou doubtest not
but his Queries are the Dictates of others, deceiving
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:101884:174"/>
and being deceived, which yet they put under the Boy's
Name, for the Credit of their Cause.</p>
               <p>Here also, without Doubt, thy unbelieving
Heart is manifested, who without Ground measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
others according to thine own Heart, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou makest Use of the Dictates of others,
as here doth plainly appear, therefore censurest
others, which doth not add Credit to thy Cause,
because thou boasts of thy Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priest,</hi> But according as thou believest, so be it to
thee, yet nevertheless, thou shalt find, that the Truth
I shall maintain against thee, who with thy Unbelieving
Heart art deceiving and being deceived; <hi>and then
thou runnest on in the Pride of thy Spirit, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of me to be</hi> Ignorant of the Truth of God, because
(<hi>as thou sayst</hi>) of the false wording of my Queries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply,</hi> But with Shame mightst thou speak it;
for openly hast thou manifested to the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reader thy self to be a meer Stranger, both
to God and his Truth also, who wouldst limit the
Truth of God to an human Art, which many of
the Children of God had not, and therefore the
Power of God was the more manifested: And
when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were brought before the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men, to wit (the chief Priests and the Rulers)
and they wondred at them, because they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
they were unlearned Men; and thus with thy
Wisdom, and thy great Learning, thou art shut
out of the Truth in the natural; but by this I do
not own thy Accusation to be Truth against me;
for I have a Copy of the Queries of my own Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:101884:175"/>
which was the Original of those that
were sent to thee, which will bear Testimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thee, to be a false Accuser, and how thou
thy self hast wronged them and misworded them,
because they were in the Cross unto thy Wisdom;
and to maintain this, thou bringest a Story in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasmus;</hi>
nevertheless, the Story which thou
bringest doth not at all touch me, but may fitly
be returned into thy own Bosom, where it shall

to read without Partiality, which if he do, he
will judge no otherwise of you, then as I have
declared, but will see how you have uttered forth
your Folly, and foamed out your Shame, in going
about to contradict the truth: And at the End
of this your <hi>Epistle</hi> to the Reader, I find <hi>W. P.</hi>
which I judge to be one of thy Agents to this your
shameful Work, to which thou darest not own

               <div type="section">
                  <head>My first Query.</head>
                  <p>Where, and how, and by what wast thou called to the
Ministry which thou professest?</p>
                  <p>Pr. Answ. <hi>And in thy Auswer thou goest about
to plead many Excuses, whereby to flee the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
of my Queries; saying,</hi> It is easier for
him that is yet in Darkness to propound Doubts and
Queries, then for some of the Children of Light to
auswer them on a suddain. <hi>Which to prove, thou
quotest</hi> Daniel; and that our Saviour (<hi>thou say'st</hi>)
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:101884:175"/>
himself refused to answer the <hi>Pharisees</hi> Interogatories,
till they had first answered his, <hi>Mat. 21. 23, 24. And
albeit thou say'st,</hi> Thou might'st put me off with <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s
Words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 4. Answer not a Fool accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Folly, lest thou also be like unto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> I did not propound the Queries unto
thee, as any Doubts of mine; but that thou in
thy Answer thereunto, mightst either prove thy
Practice by the Scriptures unto them that are in
Doubt thereof, or unto them manifest thy self
to be a Deceiver; which last thou hast plainly
done to the least Child of Light: and therefore
it doth not follow, that I am in Darkness, or
that thou art a Child of Light. Neither didst
thou suddainly answer the Queries, though they
concerned thy own Condition, and therefore
this Place in <hi>Daniel</hi> doth not at all stand for thee;
for, it was for <hi>Daniel</hi> to tell and interpret <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzer</hi>'s
Dream; which was a hard thing for
any to tell, unless it was immediately revealed
to them by God's Spirit, as it was to <hi>Daniel;</hi> but
all the Magicians and Learned Men could not
find it out by their Arts: But most of these
Queries unto thee were concerning thy present
Condition and Practice; and herein thou mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festest
thy self to be in Darkness, who thus wrests
the Scripture out of its Place, for thy own Ends.
And also, <hi>Daniel was a Man that Feared the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 10.</note>
                     <hi>and Trembled at his Power;</hi> which now thou deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and scoffest at; and yet art not ashamed to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:101884:176"/>
take <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Words for a Refuge against the
Light.</p>
                  <p>And as for that Scripture in <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 23, 24.
it shall be returned into thine own Bosom; for, it is
thee, and such as thee, who are set up by the
Will of Man, and Authorized by the Authority
of Man, who joyn with the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi>
of these Times, and combine together with the
Earthly Powers to call us to question, <hi>By what
Authority we go abroad, preaching the Truth from
Place to Place, and Crying against Deceivers, and
where we had our Commission,</hi> because we receive it
not from Man, as you do; but do witness the same
Power and Authority as the Ministers of God did
in all Ages, and the same Commission; for, they
received not their Commission from Man, but
were <hi>immediately called,</hi> and <hi>immediately fitted,</hi> and
sent forth into the Work of the Ministry, <hi>freely to
give, as freely they had received;</hi> and were persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by them that were set up by the Will of
Man, which also we do witness; and therefore
the Scripture afore-mentioned belongeth unto
thy Generation, who were ever Persecutors.
And if by propounding Queries thou judgest me
to be in Darkness, then much more thou judgest
and condemnest thy self; for, for my Thirty Six
Queries, thou hast propounded me an Hundred:
And here also thou accountest me a Fool, as by
the Scripture thou quotest in <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 4. and
therein manifests thy self so much the greater
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:101884:176"/>
Fool, in propounding so many Queries to me,
whom thou account'st a Fool: And thus the Pride
of thy Heart hath deceived thee.</p>
                  <p>Pr. Answ. <hi>And whereas thou sayest,</hi> Thou wast
Inwardly called to the Ministry, by the Motion and Gifts
of God's Spirit, long before I was born, which (<hi>thou
sayest</hi>) hath been God's Ordinary Way; <hi>which to
prove, thou quotest</hi> Job 32. 8. 2 Chron. 20. 14.
Amos 5. 7. 15. Mich. 3. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Though it hath been and is God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Way, by his own Power and Spirit, to call
and fit his own Ministers for his own Work, as
those Scriptures afore-mentioned do prove; which
we also do witness, and do come no other Way;
yet these Scriptures do not at all prove where, and
how, and by what thou wast called: and <hi>Jaha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziel,</hi>
and <hi>Amos,</hi> and <hi>Micha,</hi> which those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
aforesaid bear Testimony of, to be thus
called, were men that spoak the Word of the
Lord freely, against Sin and Transgression, and
False Prophets and Hirelings; and their Lives
sealed their Testimony: And these Scriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
bear Testimony, how, and where they were
called, from their Outward Callings, to speak
the Word of the Lord; and so, from those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
thou art shut, and hast nought to do to take
them into thy Mouth; for, they do not prove
that thou wast thus called from thy Labour; for,
thou wast brought up all thy Dayes in Idleness,
and at a <hi>University</hi> (as you call it) to learn Arts
and Sciences, without which Those were Called
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:101884:177"/>
and Fitted. And for any other Call, then as the
Common National Ministers are called (who
deny both Immediate Revelation and Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
thou hast brought no Proof that will stand
for thee, but only thy own bare Words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thy Life and Practice will condemn thee; for,
it is one with the National Priests, and thou art
maintained and upheld by the same Power as the
National Teachers are, neither dost go from
Place to Place, reproving Sin in the Gate, as
<hi>Amos</hi> and <hi>Micha</hi> did, who were thus called; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dost speak freely as they did, &amp; therefore are
a False Prophet, who sayst, <hi>The Lord saith,</hi> when
he never spoak to thee; but runnest, and the
Lord never sent thee; and therefore thou
profittest not the People at all, as is manifest by
the Fruits of thy Ministry, and thus thou wast a
Deceiver before I was born, and the Lord hath
Raised me up to Tell thee of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. Whether is thy Call and Means, which thou
professest, Mediate or Immediate?</p>
                  <p>Pr. Answ. <hi>And in thy Answer thou say'st,</hi> It
was both: For, (<hi>say'st thou</hi>) Besides the Immediate
aforesaid, thou wast ordained a Minister by the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
and Governours of the Church, as the Elders and
Pastors of the Churches were formerly by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas,
Acts 14. 23. But thou say'st,</hi> Thou doubtest
whether <hi>James Parnel</hi> well was called either way to be
Teacher; if so, let him prove it by an Infallible Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:101884:177"/>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Those that have an Inward Call to the
Ministry do not stay for an Outward Call by Man,
but go forth in Obedience to the Word of the
Lord: Whosoever was called to the Ministry of
the Gospel, it was Immediately, and not Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately;
but thine Mediately, by the Will of Man,
and not Immediately, as before is proved; and
also out of thy own Mouth art made manifest:
For thou say'st, <hi>Thou doubtest whether I was called
either way;</hi> But if thou wast Called and Guided
by the Spirit of the Lord, thou wouldst know,
without Doubts, whether I was so called, yea or
nay; for, the True Ministers were Epistles writ
in one anothers Hearts: And they also know the
False Prophets, and the False Apostles, and the
False Ministers, and declared against them, as I
do against thee; and without doubt I do know
thee to be a Deceiver by an Infallible Testimony;
and those that thou speakest of in <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 2.</note>
whom <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ordained Elders,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 13, 14, 15.</note> they did
not ordain them Ministers of the Gospel, neither
sent them abroad to preach the Gospel, neither
allowed them an Hundred or Two Hundred
Pounds by the Year, as thou hast; but they
chose out those that were strong in the Faith, and
set them to watch over the Weak: But those
Churches were gathered by the Power and Spirit
of God, and were turned from Darkness to Light,
and were washed, clensed and sanctified in the
Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our
God. But out of your Church cast Drunkards,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:101884:178"/>
and Swearers, and Lyars, and Proud, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Ones, and Adulterous, and Idolaters, and
Quarrellers,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 11.</note> and Fighters, and Scoffers, and
Scorners, and Backbiters, and Envious Ones,
and Prophane and Wanton Ones, and the like,
who are neither Washed nor Sanctified; and then
see where will be the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and the
<hi>Pastors, Teachers</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> and all: Then you
that profess your selves to be the Church of Christ
will be found the Synagogue of Statan, whose Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
thou art. And also, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who
ordained them Elders, were Men endued with the
holy Spirit of the Lord, and were immediately
called and chosen to the Ministry, and had a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Discerning to know who were fitted for the
Eldership, and all this was done without an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
or serving Seven years to learn Arts and
Sciences, or taking Degrees, without which you
can do nothing: And also, those Superiours and
Governours, have nothing but what they have
gotten by Art and Study, and reading of others
Experiences; but are ignorant of the Power of
God, neither know whether there be any Holy
Ghost, yea or nay, but by the hearing of the Ear;
but scoff<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and scorn, and persecute those that
now do witness these things; and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were also first ordain'd by the Will of Man.
And thus thou hast but so much the more manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
thy self of the World, in going about to prove
thy self a called Minister by the Scripture, which
doth altogether witness against thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:101884:178"/>
And whereas thou wouldst have me to prove
my Call by an <hi>Infallible Testimony:</hi> I tell thee,
Without an <hi>Infallable Testimony</hi> I do not go, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without an <hi>Infallible Testimony</hi> do I desire to
be received or owned; and to this the Infallible
Spirit of Truth bears Testimony in all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Truth: And thou that hast not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Testimony, either with me or against
me, are still in Darkness, and knowest not the
Truth, then far unfit to be a Teacher to others.</p>

                     <hi>Qu. 3.</hi> Whether thou art guided by the Same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Spirit that gave forth the Scripture?</p>
                  <p>Pr. Answ. <hi>And in thy Answer thou say'st,</hi> That
we our selves teach, That all Men are taught and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by that Spirit at times: <hi>And secondly, thou
say'st,</hi> Thou praisest God for it, thou art guided and
assisted by that Spirit which is alwayes Infallible: <hi>And
thirdly, thou say'st,</hi> Thou doubtest whether any of

of Truth to say, <hi>Thou art guided by it,</hi> and yet

                  <p>Pr. Ans. <hi>And in thy Answer thou sayst, Timothy</hi>
had that Spirit in a greater Measure then <hi>James Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel;</hi>
yet <hi>Paul</hi> saith thus unto him, as in <hi>1 Tim. 4.
13, 14, 15, 16. And thou saist,</hi> If the Apostles
had been put to preach upon a short Text or Theam, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically,
as by long Practice in the Church is expected
from you, they must oft times have studyed for it, <hi>as
thou conceivest;</hi> though if you were left at large, to
speak as the Spirit of God moves you, and gives Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in, <hi>thou hopest,</hi> some of you by God's Assistance
should speak as to good or better Purpose, then any who
now pretend to the Spirit's Actings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Here thou hast sufficiently manifested thy
Spirit, and thy Ignorance of the Spirit of God, to
any who understand the Things of the Spirit of
God; and all these Scriptures which thou hast
brought concerning <hi>Timothy,</hi> doth not at all prove
that he that is guided by the Spirit of God, need
study how or what to preach: But <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted
<hi>Timothy</hi> to the Gift that was in him, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:101884:179"/>
him by, or for Prophesie; for in so doing,
he should save himself, and those that heard him,
which you never do by the Fruit of your Study,
but rather destroy them, witness the Fruits of
your Ministry these many Years in this Nation,
who have wrought no better Reformation among
your Hearers; and also this Scripture doth not at
all prove that <hi>Paul</hi> bad <hi>Timothy</hi> study old Authors,

to <hi>Study Arts and Sciences, as you do,</hi> who with

for thou hast manifested thy self to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
ignorant of the Spirit of God, who by
thy own Conceivings judgest the Spirit of God to
be insufficient to instruct and teach the Apostles
what to speak at all Times, without Study, when
as Christ himself exhorteth them, to take no
Thought what to speak, for it should be given
them in the very same Hour; for saith he, <hi>It is
not you that speak,</hi>

Method, which Spirit you Teachers of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> are great Strangers to, who think that
the Spirit of God can be limited to a Text or a

where is now thy infallible Spirit, who thus
speakest thy own Conceivings? And therefore be
ashamed hence-forward to pretend to an Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Ignorance of it and its Movings, so that if thou
wast left at large to speak from that Spirit in thee,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:101884:180"/>
and wast shut out of thy Library, and from any
Text or Writing, thou wouldst plainly manifest
thy self to be one of the dumb Dogs that could
not bark,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> which <hi>Isaiah,</hi> from the Spirit of the
Lord, declared against, without Study: For I do
believe, that if thou and the rest of the National
Teachers, whom thou confessest, are tyed to a
Text or Theam, could tell how to please the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and get Gain without studying or speaking
from a Text, you would for the Credit of your
Cause (as thou saist) for I know nothing that
tyes you to it, but your own Covetous Ends, to
make a Gain of these Scriptures, and to deceive
the Ignorant with feigned Words,<note place="margin">Isa. 5. 6.</note> whom <hi>Peter</hi>
without Study foretold of; and therefore, thou Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
pretend no more to an infallible Spirit,
but with the rest of thy Brethren, confess thou
art void of it, as many of them have done; for in
such Pretences thou art but the greater Deceiver,
and thy Folly doth the more appear.</p>

                     <hi>Qu. 5.</hi> Whether is it as lawful now for Tradesmen,
Shepherds or Plowmen to preach, if they be led by the
Spirit of God, as those that spake forth the Scripture?</p>
                  <p>Pr. Ans. <hi>And in thy Answer thou saist,</hi> If this
was wholly granted, <hi>James Parnel</hi> cannot claim any
Interest therein, as thou conceivest (for thou saist)
he is neither Tradesman, Plowman, nor Shepherd, nor
will take any Course to maintain himself by this Labour;
for he hath been tryed.</p>
                  <p>But herein <hi>James Parnel</hi> can plainly tell thee,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:101884:180"/>
thou art a Lyer; for he followed a Trade with his
Father, until the Lord by his Spirit called him from
it, into his own Word; and so I obeyed the
Word of the Lord, and left my Father with his
Trade, as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> did their Father in the
Ship; <hi>For he that will not forsake Father and Mother,
Lands and Livings: Wife and Children, and all for
Christ's sake, is not worthy of him;</hi> in which Work
neither thou nor any other can tax me for Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but I believe my Labour and Diligence in
the same is more offensive to you Deceivers, then
if I had been Idle: But he that would call me from
this Work that I am set about, into the Work of
Man, I should answer him, God must be served
before Man; for if it had not been the Will of
God to call me forth into his Work, I should still
have served my Earthly Father, sooner then any
other Man, notwithstanding the Evil Thoughts
and Conceivings of such like as thee, who art gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up to believe Lyes, and tell Lyes; but where
is now thy infallible Spirit, who speakest by thy
own Conceivings, and thus the Thoughts of thy
Heart deceive thee: And as for my Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
I need not a Law, to compel it as thou dost;
neither am chargeable to the World, as thou art,
who by a Law of Man takest nigh three hundred
Pound by the Year of them; therefore in this
thou mightst have laid thy Hand upon the Mouth;
for thou and hundreds more of thy Brethren ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
followed any honest Calling, whereby to get
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:101884:181"/>
an honest Livelyhood, without being chargeable
to the World, but were from your Youths brought
up at <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Schools, learning her Witchcraft
and Sorcery, thereby to deceive the Nations, and
through Covetousness with feigned Words make
Merchandize of them, which you now spare not.</p>
                  <p>Pr. Ans. <hi>And</hi> secondly, <hi>thou grantst,</hi> That if Men
be made of God spiritual, whether Shepherds or Plowmen
first, they may teach: <hi>But</hi> thirdly, <hi>thou sayst,</hi> every
Man that hath the Spirit in some Measure, doth not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to that Height, Growth and Degree that they did, who
gave forth the Scriptures, and therefore may not as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuly
nor as infallibly teach as they did; <hi>and thou
sayst,</hi> Nor canst thou discern clearly, that the best amongst
them called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have yet reached that Degree
or Dispensation of the Spirit: <hi>And after much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
Speeches, thou manifests thy light and
frothy Spirit, still despising me because of my
Youth, but thy Words are not worth mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus when thou openest thy Mouth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Spirit, thou manifests thy Folly and
Ignorance of the Spirit, so <hi>that a Babe may compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
thee,</hi> and tell thee of thy Folly: And when
<hi>thou thinkst of thy Beard or Age</hi> (as thou sayst) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of Face may cover thee; <hi>For though every

to that Height, Growth and Degree that they did, who
gave forth the Scripture,</hi> yet it doth not follow that
none do attain to that Height Growth &amp; Degree;
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:101884:181"/>
and they that have attained to the same Spirit in
a Measure, and by the same Spirit are moved
and called forth, may as lawfully and as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
teach as they did (in their Measures) for the

its call is lawful; and thus thou shewest, thou

of it; and as here also doth further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
in that thou confessest, <hi>Thou discernest
not the People called</hi> Quakers; and therefore are
blind, and from thee the Secrets of God are hid;
and it doth not follow, that they are ever the less
spiritual, but rather more (because thou canst
not discern them) who pretend'st thy self a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Man: And thus they are attained to that
Degree, they can discern thee to be a Blind
Guide, and Deceiver of the World; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is thy spirit the more against them, for all thy
Flattering and Dissembling Speeches from thy
hypocritical Heart, who bendest thy Tongue like
a Bow against them, uttering forth Lyes in
Hypocrisie, and with thy scornful spirit Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest
me with Lyes: but it was thy Generation
that Quaked for Fear of the Downfal of their
Kingdom, and therefore persecuted me, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned

for, I was made as willing to Suffer, as they were
to Afflict, as knowing it was for his Cause,
who will make you all to Quake and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
who lift up your Heels against him. And as

thou comparest <hi>Cambridge</hi> to <hi>Jericho,</hi> so the Curse
of <hi>Jericho</hi> shall come upon it, for its Whoredom,
and Sorceries, and Stiff-neckedness against the

Scornest me and Despisest me, because of my

thou grantest,</hi> That none are the True Ministers and

have that Spirit, and yet be led by the Lying Spirit, as

who art not guided by his Spirit, and therefore
abidest not in his Doctrine, as is before proved
by thy Ignorance of the True Spirit: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou, and such False Prophets as thou,
thus smite at and persecute us, that are called
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:101884:182"/>
                     <hi>Quakers,</hi> because the Lord is pleased to bestow
his Spirit upon us, whereby we are able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
your Deceit, and manifest your Lying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
who have professed your selves the Ministers
of Christ, yet Strangers to his Spirit, and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers

<hi>thou say'st,</hi> That the Wiud blows where it listeth, if it be

likewise from a Deceitful Spirit; <hi>which to prove,

                     <hi>Rep.</hi> This I do mind, and still see how thou
markest out thy self with thy Deceitful Spirit;
for, if the Wind doth blow where it listeth, which
thou acknowledgest; then what is that in you
professed Ministers, which goes about to stop
it with Gain-saying and Persecution, and would
limit the Spirit of God unto a Text or Theam,
from which you with your deceitful spirits do raise
Uses, Points, Tryals and Motives, &amp;c. whereby

of? and whether thy Gospel be free, and without Charge?</p>
                  <p>Pr. Answ. <hi>And in thy Answer thou sayest to
the first Part,</hi> That the Gospel which thou preachest,
is the same which Christ and his Apostles taught, which
(<hi>thou sayest</hi>) is summarily contained in these four Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13, 14. wherein the Apostle
speaks of the Grace of God to be their Teacher, to deny
all Ungodliness and Worldly Lusts, and to live Soberly,
Justly and Godly in this present World, &amp;c. <hi>And to
the second Part, thou sayest,</hi> The Apostles Gospel
was not every way without Charge; <hi>which to prove,
thou quotest</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 8. <hi>And again, thou say'st,</hi>
Nor hath Christ, or any of his Apostles, imposed it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, that the Gospel should be altogether without
Charge unto them which have it taught; <hi>which to
prove, thou quotest</hi> Rom. 15. 27. <hi>And again,
thou sayest,</hi> Nor is <hi>James Parnel</hi>'s Gospel, be it
Right or Wrong, without Charge: If he doth not take
more then it is worth, if duly examined, it is well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Thy Spirit is much against <hi>James Parnel,</hi> as
<hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s was against <hi>Michaiah;</hi> yet here he can
prove thee to be a Lyar, and not only against
him,<note place="margin">John 1. 29.</note> but of his Lord also; and therefore, if thou
belyest the Lord, how much more the Servant?
For, Christ Jesus, the Lamb of God, was the
Gospel which the Apostles preached, which was
free, and not chargeable to any, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ugh he was
and is a Burdensom Stone to them that believe not
in him; yet not Chargeable. And therefore,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:101884:184"/>
thou Blasphemer, how darest thou to open thy
Mouth thus against the Lord and his Anointed,
who are still in thy <hi>Ungodliness</hi> and <hi>Worldly Lusts,</hi>
who art pleading for the Earth, and art a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the Free Grace of God; and therefore,
these Verses, which thou hast set down, shall
stand to witness against thee, which thou sayest
<hi>containeth the Gospel which thou preachest:</hi> But the
<hi>Apostles Gospel</hi> could not be contained in Paper and
Ink; for the Heavens could not contain him;
for, <hi>He ascended far above all Heavens, that he might
fill all things.</hi> And also, of thy Gospel thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
a Trade and a Gain, being many Years at an
<hi>University,</hi> as thou callest it, to learn to preach it;
all which the Apostles did not: and so thou brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
another Gospel, and so art not to be Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
but held as Accursed, as thou art, who art
not ashamed to presume to say, <hi>Thy Gospel is the
same with the Apostles;</hi> and thou dost here yield thy
Gospel to be chargeable; but this Scripture in
2 <hi>Cor</hi> 11. 8. doth not at all prove the Apostles to
be chargeable, who saith, <hi>He took Wages of other
Churches to do them Service;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</note> for it was but for his
Necessities; and it was freely communicated to
him, and therefore no Charge: But now, you
professed Ministers, instead of robbing <hi>other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
you rob and oppress the <hi>World,</hi> Ruling over
them by a Law, with Force and Cruelty; for the
which you have no Scripture-Rule, but amongst
the False Shepherds. But whom do you spare,
whether you do them Service or nay, if you can
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:101884:185"/>
but get it either by Fair Means or Foul? And
therefore in this thou, before many others, mightst
well have laid thy Hand upon thy Mouth. For,
whereas the Apostle there took some Necessaries,
which were freely communicated to him by the
Churches, thou takest nigh <hi>Three Hundred Pounds</hi>
by the Year of the World, by a Law of Man,
and none wilt spare who come within thy Bounds,
whether thou dost them Service or nay. And
<hi>that Christ, or any of his Apostles, have not imposed it
upon you, that the Gospel should be altogether without
Charge,</hi> it is true; for they never intrusted you
with it, though <hi>for Lucre sake you have run, though
he never sent you, and speak a Divination of your
Brain, but not from the Mouth of the Lord, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
not the People at all; but like Ravening Wolves,
make a Prey upon them; but your End shall be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

with the Ministry of the Gospel, have this Charge
imposed upon them, <hi>As they have received Freely,
Freely to give:</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> also sheweth
the same Example, whose Care was, <hi>to make the
Gospel Free, and without Charge;</hi> and said, <hi>Wo unto
him, if he preached not the Gospel;</hi> and therefore,
because he would not make the Gospel Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
he took Necessaries of some, and spared
others; and this was Wisdom (which you Earth-Worms
are void of) and thus, he that is taught
in the Word, may communicate to him that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

                     <hi>Qu.</hi> 9. Whether thou dost hold up the First Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
that took Tythes; or the second Priesthood, that
took No Tythes; and which thou dost deny, seeing thou
takest Tythes?</p>
                  <p>Pr. Answ. <hi>And in thy Answer, thou sayest,
Melchizedeck,</hi> whose Priesthood was the First Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
took Tythes; and the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood, which
was the second, and not the first, took Tythes also: so that
(<hi>thou sayest</hi>) there is no Priesthood, mentioned in the
Scripture, that took no Tythes. <hi>Then thou queriest,</hi>
How thou or any dost deny either of those Priesthoods by
taking Tythes? <hi>which to prove, thou quotest</hi> Gen.
14. 20. Hebr. 7. 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Hear, thou Serpent! Although thou thus
twinest about to cover and shelter thy Deceit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
other Wings, it will not at all serve to prove,
that thereby thou dost not deny Jesus Christ come
in the Flesh, who is the Everlasting High Priest
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:101884:186"/>
forever, after the Order of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> which
is the Unchangeable Priesthood, the End of the
Changeable, which took Tythes, and so the End
of Tythes, as is proved by that Scripture which
thou hast quoted, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. and chap. 8. 1. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Apostle speaks how <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tythes
to <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> of the Spoils which he got in
the War, which was a Free Gift, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Law or Compulsion: neither did stand for a
Law or Rule to the Generations following, until
the Law was given to <hi>Israel</hi> after the Flesh, and
the Changeable Priesthood established; which,
I say, was the First <hi>Priesthood,</hi> to which Tythes
were due; for it was so the Command of God,
<hi>that the Tythes should be paid unto the Changeable Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;</hi>
and they were to have a <hi>Store-house,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Tythes were to be put; <hi>and the Widdows,
and the Fatherless, and the Strangers were to come, and
be filled within their Gates, that there should not be a
Beggar in</hi> Israel: Which Statute is now rejected
by you, who now so gape for <hi>Tythes;</hi> for ye, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of doing this, <hi>do Grind the Faces of the Poor,
and Oppress the Widdows, the Fatherless and the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
if they do come within your Bounds, and so make
Beggars rather then otherwise:</hi> So that if you profess
<hi>Tythes</hi> by this Law, it will witness against you;
and also, in so doing you deny Christ Jesus come
in the Flesh, who, when he was offered up, was
the Everlasting Offering, and the Everlasting
High Priest over the Houshold of God; and so
the Fulfilling and the End of the Changeable,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:101884:186"/>
who took <hi>Tythes</hi> by a Command: <hi>And so,</hi> saith
the Apostle, <hi>the Priesthood being Changed, there must
of Necessity be a Change of the Law;</hi> and so the
Command was disannulled, and Tythes ended;
for, saith the Apostle, <hi>Hebr. 8. 1. Now, of the
things that we have been speaking, this is the sum, We
have such an High Priest, that is set on the Right Hand
of the Throne, &amp;c.</hi> Now, <hi>Tythes</hi> were one thing,<note place="margin">Here thy 6th <hi>Query</hi> is answer'd.</note>
and the <hi>Priesthood</hi> was another thing, and the <hi>Law</hi>
(by which they both were upheld) was another
thing, of which the Apostle had been speaking,
of which he saith, <hi>This is the Sum, Christ Jesus, the
High Priest, that is set on the Right Hand of the
Throne;</hi> and so the Fulfilling and the End of
these things before-mentioned, of which Tythes
is one: so, by this New Covenant he hath made
the First Old; now, that which decayeth or wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
old, is ready to vanish away: Now, mark
then, which <hi>Priesthood</hi> the Apostle here accounts
<hi>first,</hi> because thou accusest me, that <hi>I know not
which was the first, and which was the last:</hi> But by
this it is proved, that you that now so gape for
<hi>Tythes</hi> under the <hi>Profession of the Gospel,</hi> are razed
out from <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> who <hi>once took Tythes,</hi> only of
the Spoil which was taken in the War, which
was a Free Gift unto him (which now you have
not) and also are raized from the <hi>Changeable Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
which was the first to which <hi>Tythes</hi> were
due, by a Command for its time; and also, do
deny Christ come in the Flesh, who is the End
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:101884:187"/>
and Fulfilling of those things, which, without
Command, for Lucre sake, you now uphold
and cry up; and so are found only the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Antichrist,</hi> who Oppose the True Christ
(where he is witnessed and heldforth) yet under a
Profession of his Name; therefore he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
unto you Workers of Iniquity <hi>that he knows
you not,</hi> when you knock, and are not able to

the Ministers of the Gospel to take Tythes?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr. Answ.</hi> And in thy Answer, thou much
endeavourest to shelter and cover thy self by the

for thee, to prove that the Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
ever took TYTHES, or that unto them
Tythes belonged, as any who readeth thy
Answer with Understanding, may see, and also
see thy Shufflings, who runn'st into the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to maintain <hi>Tythes</hi> due to the Ministers
of the New Covenant, which is the End of
the Old, as in my last Reply is plainly proved,
and thou out of both to be shut; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou say'st, <hi>It is sufficient for thee, and other
Ministers of the Gospel, that there is no Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Gospel against the taking of</hi> Tythes, <hi>which</hi>
(thou say'st) <hi>we must produce, ere we can make the

                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Now, all People may consider how they

such slender Grounds as these, have and do take
the Tenth of the Increase of the Fruits of the
Peoples Labours, who many of them themselves
do rent and hire what they have, whereby you
have and do live at Ease, in Pride, Idleness and
Fulness, sporting in the Day time, and living in
Pleasures and Wantonness upon the Earth, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to any Rule or Example in the Scripture, from
the Ministers of the Gospel; and therefore this
your Ground and Foundation which thou hast here
laid besides the Scripture, to uphold Tythes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Scripture, will not stand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your Building must fall; for although there
were no Command in the Gospel against the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Tythes, yet it doth not prove, that the
Ministers of the Gospel are to take Tythes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was never allotted them; but that by the
Gospel Tythes are disannulled, and the Priesthood
changed, and the Law by which they both were
established, is fulfilled and done away, is clear by
the Scripture, and therefore unlawful now for any
to practise without a Command from God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is proved in my last Reply, and thou to be a

was before he was offered up, and then the Law
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:101884:188"/>
of Tythes was not yet fulfilled, and therefore not
disanull'd; and therefore strictly to be observed,
until Christ, the Everlasting Sacrifice was offered
up; and then the Apostles said, <hi>The Priesthood
being changed, there must of Necessity be a Change of
the Law,</hi> and so Tythes ended, as before is proved,
and therefore not for the Ministers of the Gospel
to take them as their Maintenance; and that
Scripture which thou hast quoted in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. shall
stand and witness against thee; for the whole
Chapter doth not at all prove Tythes due to the
Ministers of the Gospel, as any who read the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with Honesty will witness; for it doth not at
all mention Tythes, but only speaks of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Power, that as they had planted Vineyards,
so they might eat of the Fruit thereof, and as
they preached the Gospel, so they might live of
the Gospel; and this the Apostle writ to those,
whom he sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d, <hi>were the Seals of his Ministry;</hi> but
where are the Seals of your Ministry? are they
not the World who lye in Wickedness? where
is the Vineyard that ye have been planting these
many Years? Is it not still full of Bryars and
Thorns, and Weeds, and wild Plants, which
bring forth no Fruit, but cumber the Ground?
But keep in your own Vineyards, and rob not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and then you will not be such Thieves as
you are, but it will make you plant better, or else
to fall to some other Trade; and the Apostles Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was not of Man, nor by Man, being he was
not set up by Man; but yours is of Man, and by
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:101884:188"/>
a Law of Man, by whom you are set up, and by
whom you stand, as here in thy Answer thou hast
confessed; and yet the Apostle refused to use this
Power, and yet said, <hi>Necessity was laid upon him to
preach the Gospel;</hi> but what Power do you refuse,
be it right or wrong? and if that Earthly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
should be taken from you, which you have,
what would become of your Gospel? Nay, some
of you have said, that <hi>down with the Maintenance,
and down with the Ministry;</hi> and therefore forever
stop thy Mouth from taking the Apostle's Words
for a Cloak for thy Covetousness, who himself
cast out such from the Ministry, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and
therefore thou knewst, that none of these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
would serve for thy Ends and therefore thou
wouldst shelter thy self under the Powers of the
Earth, by whom thou art set up, whom thou say'st,
did give to the Ministers of the Gospel in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Thing of them, but by others Declarations, which
for your own Ends you have wrested to your own
Destruction and others, and so through your Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:101884:189"/>
and vain Deceit have spoiled the People,
<hi>and by feigned Words through Covetousness, have made
Merchandize of them,</hi> and so have deluded and led in
Blindness the People these many Years, only for
your own Carnal Ends; and that this is suitable
to what was paid in the old Testament, I also do
deny (and if it was, what is that to you? that
which was given in the Old Testament is disanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the New, and therefore no Rule for you)
and also that was given by the Lord to the <hi>Levites,</hi>
who had no other Inheritance in the Land, and
the Lord gave that which was his own, and he
gave a strict Command that it should be paid,
which stood in Force so long as the Priesthood en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
as is proved by the Scriptures, which thou
thy self hast quoted, which shall here stand against
thy self, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27. 30, 31, 32. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 18.
24. But the Lord did not give it since to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Ministers of <hi>England;</hi> but thou sayest, <hi>Man
gave it,</hi> and therefore gave that which was none
of their own; for it is unjust for any Prince or
Ruler, to give away the Labour or Inheritance of
his Subjects unto them that never laboured for it,
and unto these, who under Pretence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
do delude and beguile the Souls of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
for their dishonest Gain, as you professed
Ministers of England do; and therefore they
whose Eyes are opened do see you, and therefore
account it a Sin unto God to uphold you, or put
into your Mouthes, whom the Lord is against, and
therefore you even prepare War against them;
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:101884:189"/>
and it is neither pious nor lawful for any Prince or
Governour, to force any of his Subjects by a Law,
contrary to their Consciences: And also the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of the <hi>Levites</hi> was stated by a Law of
God, and yours by a Law of Man; and they were
ordained and set up by God, but you by Man, by
whom you are upheld and maintained contrary to
Scripture; so they came by the Will of God,
and you by the Will of Man; and they were
maintained by the Will of God, and you by the
Will of Man; and they were of God (as all his
true Ministers are now) and you are of Man (as
all the rest false Prophets and false Ministers ever
were) so that there is much Difference betwixt
you and them, and betwixt the Interest that they
had in Tythes, and the Interest that you now claim;
so that they that robbed them, robbed God, as in
the Scripture which thou hast quoted, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8.
which shall stand against thee: And if the Ground
of your Interest was well searched, it would be
found, that you have it from the Pope and his Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,
whose Supremacy your selves deny in
Words to blind the World, but in Practice you
own it, and claim it: And again, if this which
thou speakest of, was given to the Ministers of the
Gospel, then you that are Hirelings and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Anti-christ, have no Right nor Title in
it; and the Ministers of the Gospel, they also
do deny it, whose Care is to make the Gospel, free,
and without Charge, and therefore cannot oppress
any; neither will their Consciences serve them
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:101884:190"/>
to take the Increase of others Labours, by Law
or Compulsion; and therefore it is most just, that
the Labourer, should in Peace enjoy the Fruits of
his Labours, and such idle Drones as you (who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
labour for God, nor for the Good of Man;
but are the Destroyers both of Body and Soul)
should not eat, according to the Apostle's Rule in
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 10. And thus unto it you have no legal
nor civil Claim (as thou callest it) but your Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
is as a Mess of Pottage; neither is your Claim
and Title as lawful as a Son's is to the Inheritance
of his Father (as thou sayest) but you climb up
another Way, and so are Thieves and Robbers,

rather in thy Silence in it, dost yeild thy self out

Confession it is manifest, that neither you profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

And again, thy own Confession proves it, that
the greatest Part of your Church is <hi>Earthly-minded,</hi>
and no Wonder, while the Teachers themselves
are so; and thus <hi>your Church is the Synagogue of Satan,</hi>
which is built up of such Professors; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Worldly or Earthly-minded Professors, as the

you are glad to make use of a Law of Man,
contrary to the Practice of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
                  <p>And as for the express Provision, which the
Lord made for his Ministers and Messengers in the
New Testament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Reply,</hi> When Christ gave them their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
he said also, <hi>In whatsoever House they ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they were to eat such as was set before them:
For,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Workman is worthy of his Meat:</hi>
And this is all the express Provision that thou
canst find allotted to them in the New Testament;
and this was without any Law of Man too; for,
there was no need of any: for, if they did not
Willingly Receive them, they were not to Eat
with them, but to shake off the Dust of their Feet
against them; and that was all the Law they were
to take against such, which were Earthly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and Regardless of them: But this will not
serve you, because your selves are Earthly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:101884:192"/>
and therefore will have it of every one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they receive you, yea or nay, or else you
have a Law of Man to take Tribble Dammage:
And, instead of eating such as they will set before
you, you will have the Tenth Part of what they
have by Compulsion, you are such Devouring
Greedy Wolves. And what was before allotted
to the Priests in the Old Testament, is before suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proved to be nothing concerning you,
who profess your selves Ministers of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</p>
                  <p>And as for those Scriptures which thou quotest
in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. 5, 6, &amp;c. are also as nothing to my
<hi>Query,</hi> but are before answered in my last <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;</hi>
but yet these shall stand to witness against
thee to be a <hi>Lyar:</hi> For, let any who reads these
Verses see, if there the <hi>Israelites</hi> did shew any
Earthly-mindedness, or stood in need of a Law
to compel them, after they knew the King's Mind
(as thou accusest them) And thus, thou canst find
nothing, either in the Old or New Testament,
that will cover thy Deceit, but altogether witness
against thee; and therefore again thou fleest into
thy old Shelter, which is the <hi>Will of Man,</hi> by
which thou art set up and upheld, therefore a False
Prophet and a Deceiver, who abidest not in the
Doctrine of Christ: And it is no Pious nor Just
Act for them, as I said before, to take away the
Fruits of their Subjects Labours by a Compulsive
Law, to give unto such Earth worms as thee,
who care not how you get it, so you get, as thy
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:101884:192"/>
own Mouth confesseth; for thou sayest, <hi>It is a
Competent, though not a Liberal Maintenance;</hi> and
yet thou canst take it, and plead for it too, yea,
and of Worldly-minded People, which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
contrary to the Apostles Practice; and so
thou fulfillest the words which before I have spoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of thee: And whosoever deny you of <hi>Tythes,</hi>
do not Unjustly detain them (as thou say'st they
do) being you have no Right to them by any
Law or Command from God, or Example in the
Scripture, as before is proved; but only claim a
Title by the unjust <hi>Supremacy of the Pope,</hi> by which
your Fore-fathers, the <hi>Persecuting Bishops,</hi> were
upheld; and therefore, we, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do
teach People them, you to deny, which is not
contrary to the Practice of Christ or his Apostles
(as thou accusest us) for, saith Christ,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Beware of
False Prophets, that appear in Sheep's Cloathing, but
inwardly Ravening Wolves:</hi> By their Fruits they are
known, and by which sufficiently you are here
marked out; and the Apostles bid, <hi>From such turn
away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> as in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. And again, the Apostle
<hi>John forbids to receive such as abide not in the Doctrine
of Christ, or to bid them Good Speed,</hi> 2 John 9, 10.
And here both Christ and his Apostles sufficiently
taught People to deny you; and here thou art
proved a Lyar, who thus falsly accusest us, call'd
<hi>Quakers,</hi> in this to act contrary to the Practice of
Christ or his Apostles: and so, here thou, and
the rest of the professed Ministers of this Nation,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:101884:193"/>
are sufficiently manifest, what you are; so that
all men may see your Folly and Deceit, but those
who are blind, and love to have it so; and so the
Scripture is fulfilled upon you, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 30, 31.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> 12. Whether ever the Ministers of the Gospel
took any Necessaries of the World, as thou, and such
as thou, do all your Tythes and Maintenance? yea or
nay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pr. Answ.</hi> And in thy Answer, thou sayest,
<hi>Yea, they have;</hi> which to prove, thou quotest
<hi>Acts</hi> 28. 1, 9. where thou say'st, <hi>Paul took Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Barbarians:</hi> yet this not serving thy
turn, thou runnest to old Histories, which thou
callest <hi>Ecclesiastical Records,</hi> and say'st, <hi>They f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

One Thousand Five Hundred Years do testifie the same:</hi>
but yet doubting of this, thou say'st, as thou
saidst before, <hi>It sufficeth you, that there is no Law nor
Command of God to the Contrary; nor are Examples</hi>
(thou saist) <hi>needful for every thing, as to prove, that
Christ called any Shoemaker or Cobler to be a Prophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> But here again thou hast marked out thy
self to be a False Prophet, who runnest, and the
Lord never sent thee, and therefore thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eachest
for Doctrine the Traditions of Men, for the which
thou hast no Scripture, and therefore runnest to
Old Stories, to which I am not to give any Credit,
be they never so old, being they are not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Scripture (and therefore not Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal)
for, the Oldness of the thing doth not make
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:101884:193"/>
it Truth, though you have long thereby deceived
the Ignorant.</p>
                  <p>And as for that Scripture, which thou quotest
in <hi>Acts</hi> 28. 1, 9. then <hi>Paul</hi> was a Prisoner, and he
and the Souldiers that kept him, and the rest of
the People, were driven there by Storm upon the
Sea, so that in that Case the <hi>Barbarians</hi> took Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of them, and received them; but there were
many besides <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Centurion,</hi> to whom
<hi>Paul</hi> was committed, who were to take Care of
him: and also, that which the <hi>Barbarians</hi> did,
was Freely, and that which Nature bound them
to, being they were in that Strait, which was done
to many besides <hi>Paul,</hi> who were <hi>Heathens:</hi> So that
this doth not at all stand for thee, who art in thy
own Country, and yet takest all thy <hi>Tythes</hi> and
<hi>Maintenance</hi> of the World by Compulsion; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will this Excuse serve to shelter you <hi>Hirelings</hi>
and <hi>Deceivers,</hi> to say, <hi>That there is no Law nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God to the Contrary;</hi> for, it is False; for, Christ
commands his Ministers expresly, <hi>Freely to give, as
Freely they had received;</hi> and also charged them,
<hi>Where they were not Freely Received, to depart thence,
shaking off the Dust of their Feet,</hi> as before is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
And also, Oppression the Law of God is
against; and to take the Tenth, or Encrease of
the Fruits of the Peoples Labours, is a sore and
great Oppression, which the Land groans under,
and therefore a Sin; and yet the Gift doth so blind
your Eyes, that you cannot see all this; but
think, because there is no Scripture for you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:101884:194"/>
none against you. And though there needs
no Example so prove any <hi>Shoemaker</hi> or <hi>Cobler</hi> to be
a Prophet (as thou confessest, though in Scorn)
for it is a thing that none doth, who understands
the Scripture, being there is sufficient Proof, that
he called other Tradesmen; yet there is a Need,
that you might find so much as a Scripture-Proof
or Example for your Tythes and Maintenance
(who profess it to be your Rule) being it is a great
Oppression of the Land; and yet saist thou, <hi>It
doth suffice you, that there is no Law or Command to
the Contrary:</hi> Therefore this shews your Avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Minds, who are so willing to be blind in this
thing; but it will not, neither doth so easily suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
those that are oppressed by You, though You
regard it not, according to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s

to seek for them, to see whether these things
be true or no, which thou speakest of them; but,
as I said before, will conclude them to be false in
this thing, being the Scripture is altogether against
it, so that thou canst not find one Scripture to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie

this in the Scripture?</hi> thou answerest as far off again

who take Tribute and Custom, yea, and the Apostles,
and Christ himself: <hi>which to prove, thou quotest</hi>
2 Cor. 7. 8. <hi>and</hi> Luke 8. 23. <hi>but thou confessest,</hi>
That he is one that sets his Heart upon the Wages only,
and delights not in the Work, but is weary of the
same, and longs for the Shadow or Rest; <hi>which to
prove, thou quotest</hi> Job 7. 1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Here, thou impudent Lyar, for all thy
Shuffings and thy Coverings, thou canst not hide
thy self, but out of thy own Mouth shalt be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though thou here plainly denyest thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and thinkest it enough to answer for thy
self, thy Cause is so bad; for, thy Wages is not
alotted by God, neither hast thou any Scripture-Rule
to prove them (as is before proved) and
therefore it follows, <hi>that thy Heart is set upon thy
Hire,</hi> for which sake thou undertakest that Work
which thou professest; and it is for thy Hire's
sake that thou art not weary of thy Work, or
else thou would not own that which is so contrary
to the Scripture: so that thou canst not bring
one Scripture Proof for this thy Practice, and that
it is thy Hire that thou delightest in, is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apparent, by thy thus gaping for it, and seeking
to defend it, though altogether contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:101884:195"/>
And as for the Work thou and thy Brethren
profess, you are as Idle in it as you can, so that
you can but hold up the World's Custom, and
blind the People, that still you may Rule over
them by your Means; and thus it may plainly
be seen wherein is your Delight; and so out of
thy own Mouth judge thee to be neither Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable
nor Faithful, who art not ashamed thus
to seek to justifie thy self in thy Deceit, whenas
thy own Mouth confesseth, <hi>that it is not a Liberal
Maintenance,</hi> and <hi>that thou canst take it, and plead
for it:</hi> and therefore this Scripture, which thou
quotest in <hi>Job</hi> 7. 2. shall stand and witness against
thee, who, as a <hi>Hireling, agreest with the People for
so much a Year, and, as a Hireling, lookest for thy
Wages at the Year's End;</hi> but of thy Work there
is no Profit to any: and so with the Shadow thou
deceivest them for Gain, which doth so blind thy
Eye, that thou think'st all are like thee, though
they take that which is Freely administred to
them for their Temporal Necessities; which is
not an Agreeing with the People for so much a
Year, and to take it by a <hi>Law, whether they will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with you, yea or nay;</hi> which Weapons Christ
or his Ministers never made use of: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
thou Lyar, how darest thou to accuse Christ

Christ heal the <hi>Sick,</hi> or the <hi>Diseased,</hi> and the <hi>Lame,</hi>
and the <hi>Blind,</hi> or <hi>Teach the People, for Money or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?</hi>
Oh thou Blasphemer! forever stop thy
Mouth from naming his Holy Name, who dost

so slander him: Well mayst thou accuse and
slander his Servants and Messengers, which so
impudently dost it to him, who is our Lord and
Master. But as for <hi>Paying Tribute to Kings and
Governours in their Places;</hi> it is allowed of by
Scripture, which thine is not; and they are set
about <hi>Temporal Affairs,</hi> and <hi>are the Ordinance of God
for that Purpose, for to Govern and Protect the People in
Bodily peace and Quietness;</hi> which if they neglect,
will be laid to their Charge: But thou and thy
brethren pretend to <hi>Spiritual Affairs,</hi> and therefore
are to have <hi>your Rule</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> from Christ and
his Ministers, who were set about <hi>Spiritual Affairs;</hi>
the which thou canst not, but wouldst creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the Light; but by it are You found out, and seen

rather then thou wouldest yield thy Error in it

in former Time, that <hi>the Bishops and Pastors had not

judge thee guilty, and to be out of the Apostles
Practice; &amp; therefore these Scriptures will witness

the Ministry as they were; neither preachest freely,
as they did; neither labourest with thy Hands,
as <hi>Paul</hi> did, but only makest a Trade and a Gain
of the Apostles Words for thy own Ends; and
therefore what hast thou to do to mention Christ

or his Ministers, who art so plainly found out of
their Practice, or to call Christ thy Master, who
art thy self called <hi>Master,</hi> and so robbest him of his

<hi>Be not ye called Masters</hi>) and so art none of his, and
therefore hast nothing to do with that <hi>Liberty</hi>
which he hath given to his faithful Labourers,

Temples, that figure forth nothing but the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations

you have no Rule in the Scripture; and so you lead
them by Custom and Tradition: And also, thy

                     <pb n="357" facs="tcp:101884:203"/>
That <hi>you do not call your Assemblies, and the Places
where your Assemblies meet, both by one;</hi> for, here
thou callest the <hi>Place</hi> a <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> the
<hi>Congregation,</hi> as I said before.</p>
                  <p>And thou Blind Guide, where dost thou read in
the Scripture of <hi>Church-Doors?</hi> Be ashamed, and
blush, thus to presume in thy Blasphemy: And
therefore howsoever thou hast taken these Houses
to be, wherein Deceivers creep, as before is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and have taught the People so, to put them
out of Jealousie of You to be the Deceivers, doth
not at all excuse you from it; for the Apostle
himself taught in <hi>Private Houses,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 20. 20.</note> and <hi>Chambers,</hi>
and <hi>Private Places;</hi> and therefore, by that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
thou wouldst tax the Apostle to be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
if he was here, as thou dost <hi>James Parnel,</hi>
and those whom thou scornfully callest his <hi>Gang:</hi>
But where dost thou find such a Word in the
Scripture, which proceeds out of thy Malicious
and Evil Heart; but thy Reproaches unto us are
Riches (and thy Shame.)</p>
                  <p>And the Reason why those Houses near <hi>Alders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi>
(which thou so spittest thy Venom at, because
the People of God have used to meet there) may
not be called (as thou in Contempt dost term
them) as well as your Stone Houses be called
<hi>Steeple-houses,</hi> is, because they have Names fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for them already, for to distinguish them from
other Places; &amp; so also the word <hi>Steeple-house</hi> is the
sittest Name to distinguish your Meeting Places
from others; and also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to take from them that Holy
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:101884:204"/>
Name which only belongs to the Body of Christ;
and also, to wear out that Idolatry of the People's
Minds, which they through long Custom have
born to those Idolatrous Places: Neither do we
any more Reproach them in so saying, then Christ
and his Apostles did, in calling the <hi>Jews</hi> Meeting-Place
<hi>Synagogues,</hi> though thou highly dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Christ in calling them <hi>Churches,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
his Body: Have you no other Names to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
upon your Stone Houses and High Places,
but most blasphemously to call them by the Name
of God's and Holy Men, whom you are not
worthy to name, as you call your <hi>Colledges</hi> (which
are <hi>Synagogues of Satan,</hi> and <hi>Cages of Unclean Birds</hi>)
by the Name of <hi>Immanuel,</hi> and by the Name of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the like: If you had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them by the Name of <hi>Glazier's Hall,</hi> or <hi>Bull-and-Mouth,</hi>
or <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and the like, we should
not gain-say it: And therefore, in this the <hi>Jews</hi>
wil condemn you, who did not presume to call
their Meeting-Places by such holy Names, as
you presumptuously do, which is and hath been
a great Provocation of the People to Idolatry, to

And now thou comest to the Tryal, to prove it,
thou confessest, <hi>It is not necessary, but lawful only,</hi>
and that is, because there is no Command of God
against it, thou say'st, neither a Command for it,
but by Man; and thus you have long deluded the
Nations with your own Inventions, for the which
you have no Scripture; then how is it your Rule?

Man; but God is to be obeyed rather then Man,
and you do it not for the Lord's sake, but for to
please Man; for the Lord doth not require it at
your Hands: And now all the ignorant People,
who have been in this bewitched by you, may see
your Blindness, who have long made them believe
that it was an Ordinance of Christ, that their
Children should be sprinkled (and one of the Points
of Salvation, as you call them) and now nothing
but an Ordinance of Man, which will not stand
for thee neither; for in that thou lyest also, to say,
<hi>It is the Commandment of thy Governours;</hi> for in that
they leave every one to the Liberty of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
and all Laws and Ordinances afore-time

And now, doth the Holy Ghost teach thee to lye?
Oh thou Lyar and Blasphemer of the Holy Ghost,

Satan is high in thee, and thy Wickedness is great:
And which dost thou call <hi>thy Baptismal Water?</hi> this

in vain hast thou quoted any Scripture; for if any

                  <p>Pr. Answ. <hi>And in thy Answer thou hast stolen
the Apostles Words, which he speaks concerning

and Degree (<hi>thou confessest</hi>) is In Christ, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of the Father in the Hatred of Sin and Love of

all Iniquity,</hi> and <hi>Begotten by the Father,</hi> and <hi>Renewed

then by thy own Confession, None of

is the Faith of the Hypocrite?</p>
                  <p>Pr. Answ. <hi>And in thy Answer thou saist,</hi> Thy
Faith is a Trust in the Lord Jesus, to be holpen up again
from the Fall, or to be saved from the Hand of thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
or of all that hate thee, and so to be renewed through
him, to be enabled to serve him cheerfully, and without
Fear, in Holiness and Righteousness before him all the
dayes of thy Life: <hi>And thou saist,</hi> This Faith bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth Obedience, and purifieth the Heart, and maketh
you conformable to Jesus, so that thou hopest for no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
by his Death unless thou dyest with him to all known
Sins; but the Faith of the Hypocrite seeketh alwayes
something by or through Christ then what it should seek
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:101884:210"/>
(to wit) the putting off the Old Man, and the putting
on the New, which is created after God in Righteousness
and true Holiness: And herein, <hi>thou saist,</hi> doth thy
Faith differ from the Faith of the Hypocrite, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
from <hi>James Parnel's.</hi>

                  <p>

there is no putting off the Old Man, and putting
on the New,<note place="margin">John 15. 5.</note> but by and through Christ; which
is no more then what I should believe: And thy
Faith, which is contrary is the Faith of the
Hypocrite, which will perish, yea, and out of
thy own Mouth I shall prove it; for, by thy own
Confession thou art still in the Fall, in saying,
<hi>That thou trustest in the Lord Jesus, to be holpen up out
of the Fall again:</hi> Hereby it is concluded, that
thou art still in the Fall; for, if thou wast hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
already out of the Fall, then thou wouldest
have the End of thy Hope: But, 'tis like, this
Faith thou hast professed these many Years, and
hast been a Teacher so long, and yet it hath
not brought thee out of the Fall; and therefore
it is but a Borrowed Faith: And most of those
Expressions, thou hast stolen out of <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 71,
72, 73, 74, 75. which hath not purified thy
Heart from Lyes and Deceit; neither art thou in
Obedience or Conformable to Jesus Christ, who
abidest not in his Doctrine, but teachest for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
the Traditions of Men; neither art thou
dead with him unto all known Sins; for this is one,
to depart from his Doctrine, and such hath not
God: and this is proved against thee in many
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:101884:210"/>
things, as in taking thy <hi>Tythes</hi> and <hi>Maintenance</hi> of
the Peoples Labours, which many of them, it is
like, do want it themselves, which is a great Sin
and Oppression: and secondly, in <hi>Sprinkling In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi>
which is a great Delusion to the People;
and many other things, which are before proved
against thee, which that in thy Conscience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

and here out of thy own Mouth thou art found a

thou thy self, and thy Church, were proved to be

couldest declare the Mystery from others Words,
who experienced it, they that hear thee could not
discern it without a Single Eye, which appeareth
they have not, who are still Earthly-minded, by

<hi>thou saist, Judas</hi> was one; and the Apostle for a

Repentance, Faith and new Obedience, but fell away

                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> Here, thou Murderer of Souls, by thy

and drink Damnation to themselves, not discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Lord's Body, which the Natural Man

Ones, thou hast none in thy Flock; for thou
confessest, <hi>they are Earthly minded:</hi> And for what
Christ did, is a <hi>Mystery</hi> to thee, and that which
might be done for the fulfilling of what was before
decreed, which is nothing for thee to imitate:
And did not <hi>Judas</hi> eat and drink his own Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Neither doth these Scriptures prove that
the Apostles did the same as thou dost; for he
was far absent from them when he writ this <hi>Epistle</hi>
to them, as a Warning <hi>to take heed what they did:</hi>
neither doth that in <hi>John</hi> prove any thing to this

                  <p>Pr. Answ. <hi>And in thy Answer thou in words

thou knowest no other Place of Purgation; <hi>and also

neither art thou thy self come up to it, nor any
that are taught by thee; and therefore I hold
thee the greater <hi>Hypocrite</hi> and <hi>Deceiver,</hi> then if
with the rest of thy Brethren thou didst in words
deny it, unless in Life thou didst seal it; for,
Profession without Life and Power, hath ever been
a Dishonour to Truth and Religion: Therefore
silence Deceit, and cause not the Truth to be

                  <p>Pr. Answ. <hi>And in thy Answer thou canst bring

                     <pb n="375" facs="tcp:101884:212"/>
And secondly, <hi>thou saist, Israel</hi> in the general, to whom
<hi>David</hi> gave his Psalms to be sung, were the greatest
part Unregenerate, and men of the World. Thirdly,
<hi>thou saist,</hi> He gave them in Meeter or Measure to be
sung, as the Learned in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue know
well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> All are of the World that are not <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
which neither thou nor thine are, as before
out of thy own Mouth is proved; and also, all
that own not <hi>Quaking and Trembling by the Power of
God</hi> are also of the World, and know not God;
for, all the Holy Men of God, and <hi>David</hi> for
one (as is before proved) witnessed <hi>Quaking</hi> and
<hi>Trembling;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 12. 10. Jer. 10. 25. Mat. 12. 30. Ex. 19. 16.</note> and the <hi>Son of Man was to eat his Bread
with Quaking and drink his Water with Trembling:</hi>
And so you that despise <hi>Quaking</hi> and <hi>Trembling</hi> are
<hi>Heathens,</hi> that know not God: And also, the
Way is but one; and they that are not with us are
against us: But <hi>All</hi> Israel <hi>Trembled before the Lord,</hi>
who were not of the World, as thou belyest them,
who were the Lord's chosen People, in the Figure,
whom he had chosen out of the World: though
when they forgot their God, they were defiled
with the World. Neither canst thou bring any
Scripture-Proof to maintain, that <hi>David</hi> gave
forth his Prayers, his Prophecies, his Quakings,
his Roarings, his Cryings, and his Lamentations

them, seeing also that I have a Proof to the

contrary; for by your own Confession, they were
turned into <hi>English</hi> Meeter by <hi>Sternhold</hi> and <hi>Hopkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
and therefore stop thy Mouth thou Lyar.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>fourthly,</hi> Thou askest <hi>what Condition</hi> David
<hi>was in, into which every Man may not come in Time?</hi>
And <hi>fifthly,</hi> thou say'st, <hi>Are not</hi> David'<hi>s Psalms Part
of the Holy Scriptures which are permitted to all Men,
and are profitable for all Men to read.</hi> And <hi>sixthly,</hi>
thou say'st, <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>did read all the Old Testament
in Publick with a singing Voice, as the Learned know.</hi>
And <hi>seventhly,</hi> thou say'st, <hi>Did not the Lord by his
Servant</hi> Moses <hi>teach all</hi> Israel <hi>a Song of his own making?
as in</hi> Deut. 31. 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. And thou
say'st, <hi>We will not deny but</hi> David'<hi>s Psalms may have
the same Effects, even upon the Wicked,</hi> &amp;c. which is
false, for we will deny it, for the Wicked have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with them; for unto the Wicked God
saith, <hi>What hast thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that
thou shouldst take my Covenant in thy Mouth;</hi> and
here thy Heart hath deceived thee; neither doth
this prove that the World may sing <hi>David</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
in a Meeter, because it is possible to come
into his Conditions, but then they must come
out of the World; but I do not perceive that you
have a Desire to come into his Conditions, who
deny Quaking and Trembling, which was Part of
his Conditions: But those that do come into his
Conditions, need not take his Words, to sing in a
Meeter; but the same Spirit that taught him to
praise the Lord, will also teach them, which it
seems you are Strangers to, and therefore sing
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:101884:213"/>
Lyes in Hypocrisie. And as he said, <hi>He was not
puffed in Mind, nor had no scornful Eye,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 131. 1.</note> you also say

long, and watered his Couch with his Tears,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 8.</note> you also
[sing] you do so: And thus the Ignorant People
are led by you, to exercise themselves in Things
that for them be too high; and you that lead them,
cause them to err; And therefore, <hi>Wo unto you blind
Guides, and Deceivers of the People:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 3. 1. Isa. 24. 11.</note> Neither are
<hi>David</hi>'s Psalms, nor the rest of the Holy Scriptures,
for Drunkards, Swearers, Lyars, and such like
Persons, to make a Song on; for to such they are
sealed; and the same that gave them forth, the
same will open them, and they that can so read
them may, and so they are profitable: And how
the <hi>Jews</hi> did read the Old Testament in publick
(as thou sayst) doth not at all prove that you should
sing <hi>David</hi>'s Conditions in a Meeter, who are far
Strangers to them; so here thou might'st have
been silent from such Carnal Reasoning; but
that thou art glad of any Thing to cover thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
because the Scriptures will not. And that
Song that was given by the Lord to <hi>Moses</hi> for <hi>Israel</hi>
to sing, it was not in Meeter, neither other Mens
Conditions, but it was a Song the Lord had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them to sing, suitable to their Conditions,
but still this doth not prove, that the Lord gave
you <hi>David</hi>'s Conditions to sing in a Meeter, from
your light Minds, as you do; therefore silence De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
and let the Scripture alone in its Place, and
strive not to make the Lord the Author of your
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:101884:214"/>
Deceit: And thou say'st, <hi>His Prayers may teach them
to pray;</hi> but he saith, <hi>The Prayers of the Wicked are
Sin:</hi> And thus thou wouldst teach them to pray
by Tradition, and not by the Spirit; for they that
pray by the Spirit, need not others Prayers to
teach them, though ye that are ignorant of the
Spirit have nothing else: And thou say'st, <hi>His
Hymns may teach them to land the Lord;</hi> but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
saith, <hi>The Dead cannot praise the Lord, but the
Living;</hi> and none can praise the Lord but those
that know him; but the Wicked know him not,
and therefore their Prayers and Praises is Deceit,
though for a Cloak they steal their Words that
knew him; and thus thou wise Man, thy Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
perisheth: And thou say'st, <hi>His Afflictions
may order, support and comfort them, when they are in
the like Conditions:</hi> I say, till then let them alone,
and then you will know how to use them; but
while ye are blind, ye do abuse them, and are Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the only Comforter and Supporter, which
<hi>David</hi> witnessed in Affliction: And thou say'st,
<hi>His Prophesies and Promises may be the strengthning of
their Faith;</hi> Thou blind Hypocrite, what Faith
have the VVicked, who know not God? while
thou thy self, that art a Teacher, hast not Faith
to trust him for an Earthly Maintenance; what
then hath his Promises strengthned thy Faith, who
hast sung them and read them these many Years?
Neither are his Promises to the VVicked, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Word was in the Beginning, by which all Things
were made, which thou confessest to be Eternal,
Powerful and Living; and that Word which came
unto the Prophets, was as a Fire and a Hammer,
to beat the Rocks in Peices, then was it not Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful

and this was the same Word which was
published, which <hi>David</hi> there speaks of; and by
this Word were the Prophets all begotten and

<hi>There is a Redemption from the Curse of the Law, and

be redeemed from all Sin, and not from all Evil?
and from the Curse of the Law, and not from the
Guilt of Sin? And is not all this One, and by
One, and fulfilled in One? But it may easily be
concluded, that thou canst witness none of this;
for so long as thou art in the Fall, thou art under
the Curse of the Law and the Guilt of Sin, as
before out of thy own Mouth is proved; and they
that can witness this Redemption; are <hi>Christians</hi>
indeed, and cleansed from Earthly-mindedness;
all which thou nor thy Church are not, as before
out of thy own Mouth is proved; but are still in
your Iniquity, upholding the Works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and are not saved from your Enemies, that
are of your own Houses; neither is the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of the Law fulfilled in you; neither are
your Souls delivered out of the House of Bondage;
neither is Jesus your <hi>high Priest,</hi> who set up <hi>yourselves</hi>

Priesthood,</hi> which <hi>took Tythes,</hi> and so deny
Christ come in the Flesh, and therefore shall be

and whether they that know that Light, need any man

to teach them? and whether thou leadest up any under
thy Ministry, that they need not thee to teach them?</p>
                  <p>Pr. Answ. <hi>And in thy Answer thou confessest,</hi>
That Christ doth enlighten every one that cometh into
the World, because the Apostle affirms it, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9.
<hi>And secondly, thou confessest,</hi> That they which
have attained to the true Knowledge of this Light, need
not that any Man should teach them; for, they are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
taught of God, <hi>thou saist,</hi> Jer. 31. 34. <hi>But
thou saist,</hi> Thou denyest that we are so taught, or in

<hi>which to prove, thou quotest</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19, 20,

Lord never sent thee, who hast been a <hi>Teacher of the

and hast not yet brought any of thy Hearers to
the Knowledge of the Light; yea, thou num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brest
thy self amongst them whom this full Light
doth not yet shine, but stand in need of other
Helps and Teachers; then, thou <hi>Hypocrite</hi> and

the full Knowledge of the Light (as thou saist
they will witness for thee) whenas thou thy self
standest in need to be taught it, by thy own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession?
Therefore it may well be resolved, that
thou knowest not that Christ hath enlightened
evey one that cometh into the World, neither
wouldest confess it, but that the Apostle affirms
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:101884:216"/>
it in that Scripture which thou hast quoted in <hi>Joh.</hi>
1. 9. yea, that Scripture which thou quotest in
<hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. doth witness against thee and thy
Hearers to be yet Strangers to the Promises:

that is it thou openly strivest against; for then,
thy <hi>Diana</hi> would bring thee in no Gain, which is
thy greatest Care to uphold; and this is witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in thy Conscience, for a Truth against thee:
Yea, and this Scripture, which thou quotest in
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19, 20. will witness against thee, to be a
<hi>Belyar</hi> of the Apostle; for, that speaketh of the
<hi>Word Within, which shines as a Light in a Dark Place,</hi>
which thou art not yet come to know, &amp; therefore
thou denyest the Truth: But I tell thee, We are in
that Measure of Light, so that we are able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
thee, and shew thee thy Confusion and
Deceit: Therefore silence from bringing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

and to be a <hi>Guide to the Blind,</hi> a <hi>Light of them

and art not yet taught thy self; but art dark

Instruction thy self, by thy own Confession:
Therefore, what an impudent <hi>Lyar</hi> art thou, who

that thou needest no man to teach thee; but the
Prophets and Apostles were come to that before
they were made Teachers; and they by the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of their Ministry, turned many from Darkness
to Light,<note place="margin">Acts 16. 7. Eph. 1. 5. 1 Joh. 2. 22.</note> and brought them to the Knowledge of

That they that cannot witness Christ in them, are in a

Corrupt Men, though you do not see it, because

all along hitherto to set out thy self, and make a

Hypocrisie of thy Heart thou couldst not thereby

And instead of observing the Lesser Commands,
and leaving the Greater undone, you leave all
undone that will not stand for self; and preach
up and uphold these things for Commands, for
which you have no Scripture, and so preach for
Doctrine the Commandments of men,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 9.</note> as the
Outward <hi>Jew</hi> did: But if one ask you for your
Proof for these things, thou say'st, <hi>It sufficeth you
that there is no Command to the Contrary;</hi> yea, for
thy Self-covetous Ends thou art not ashamed to
fetch up old Commands (that were fulfilled, and
so ended) for a Cover for thy Deceit, as here
also thou wouldest seem to do in accusing us for
not paying <hi>Tythes</hi> exactly, as the <hi>Pharisee</hi> did,
which I know is the great Grief of thee and thy
Brethren, because we put not into your Mouthes,
and therefore ye even prepare War against us:<note place="margin">Mich. 3. 5.</note>
But when the <hi>Pharisee</hi> said, <hi>He paid Tythes,</hi> they
were then due; for the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> to which <hi>Tythes</hi>
belonged, was not yet fulfilled, and therefore not
changed, and therefore it was his Duty so to do:
But you Priests have so blinded the Pharisees and
Professors of these Times, that they are so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
in paying you <hi>Tythes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ez. 22. 28.</note> &amp; <hi>putting into your Mouths,</hi>
because you daub them up, crying <hi>Peace</hi> to them,
<pb facs="tcp:101884:221"/>
though they have no Command from God for it;
and you take it as exactly: but you have but few
such, that you dare trust without a Law; for
(as thou saist) <hi>The greatest Part of them are Earthly-minded</hi>
(like their Teachers) And how hast
thou been cleansing thy Out-side of the Cup, as
if thou wast unblamable in this Outward Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and so holy in thine own Eyes, that in
words thou professest Perfection, and as if thou
knewest the highest Estate of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and
wast in the pure Religion, without Spots, and
guided by God's Spirit, usually speaking by the
Motion of the Holy Ghost, but even condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thy Brethren, and wouldest not answer for
them; but saidst, <hi>Thou wast none of these Hirelings,
nor Greedy Dogs, &amp;c.</hi> but yet could not keep thy
Tongue from uttering forth the Foulness of thy
Heart, which hath overwhelmed thee all along,
and out of thy own Mouth hast been proved a
Lyar. And thus thou art plainly dealt with, and

though thou hast bin much labouring with feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
words of thy own Wisdom and Self-Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to deck and adorn the Outside, painting it
with Scripture-Words and Expressions, yet thy
Inside is so foul that it defiles the Outside also;
so that it makes thee odious to all but the Blind;
and manifests thy Heart to be yet uncircumcised
from Sin, and a Stranger to the Inward Cross, by
which thou art not crucified to the World, nor
the World to thee; for then it would not suffice
thee to take the Tenth Part of the Encrease of
the Labour of the Labourers, by the Will of
Man, without any Command from God, as thou
dost, living at Ease (like a <hi>Drone</hi>) upon the same;
and therefore thy Heart is far off Uprightness; all
which the Inward <hi>Jew</hi> (thou saist) doth witness:

any Thing that thou dost, in which the Scripture
will not stand for thee, it will in the same stand
against thee; and also when thou didst wrest any
Scripture for thy own Ends, it was made Use of to
witness against thee in the same; and how hast
thou answered by thy own Experience, whenas
thou stolest the Apostles Declaration, and set it
down, even Word for Word, to prove the Estate
of a <hi>Christian,</hi> whenas it was proved out of thy
own Mouth, that thou art not come to witness in
Possession the lowest Estate of a <hi>Christian;</hi> and
thus thou might'st have been ashamed to boast of

taught us to alter or violate the Civil Speeches and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of the Nation where we live, by which our Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to others is expressed, and accordingly expected, if
not commanded also? <hi>And thou quotest</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 32.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ is not your Teacher; for,
out of his Doctrine ye are found, in the Pride of
your Hearts, contemning his Speech and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
&amp; are not contented with your natural Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
but borrow of others; in which Custom
we are not to follow you, out of the Language of
the Scripture: and so here, by thy <hi>Query,</hi> you
express no Reverence of God, because to him you
use the Word [<hi>Thou</hi>] which you do account an
Uucivil Speech. Therefore now see what is that
which takes Offence at that which God accepts;
it must needs be of Proud <hi>Lucifer:</hi> and that same
took Offence at the Apostle, who said, <hi>Give No
Offence;</hi> yet the Truth is a Stumbling Stone and
a Rock of Offence: Therefore now see how thou
stumblest at the Noon-day, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 10.</p>

the Creatures of God are Good in their Places,

the Moderation; but cursed to you, who live
under the Curse, in the Lust, under whom the
Creation groans, who know not the pure Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that made all things, to teach you how to

whose Kingdom stands <hi>in Meats, and Drinks, and
Apparel, who are taking thought what to eat, what to

Age, who askest such a Childish <hi>Query:</hi> I might
as well ask thee, <hi>Where God enjoyned men to drink
Beer?</hi> For, <hi>Water</hi> is the Original of all Drinks;
for, in the Dayes of Old, <hi>Water was the Common
Drink:</hi> Hast thou not read of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s <hi>Well, where

not the Saints to sanctifie their Meats and Drinks by
Prayer and Thanksgiving, before and after they eat and

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> To the Pure all things are pure; but
thy Prayers are Abomination, who art in the Lust.

what Ornaments he approves of; and here thy

them) but with us there is no Respect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
neither taking thought what to eat, what
to drink, or wherewithal to be cloathed, as the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Many are called, but few chosen; and

said, <hi>If we let this Fellow alone, all men will go after

                     <note place="margin">John 11. 48.</note> which is the Cry of you and your Rulers now

24. 24. is it any great Wonder that your Doctrine
against <hi>Tythes</hi> should find so many willing, yea, greedy
Entertainers of it, as it hath done since it was first
broached?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The more is your Shame, who are Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
in this Age, that are so Earthly-minded,
who have so long taken their Money for that
which is not Bread,<note place="margin">Isa. 55. 2.</note> and their Labour for that
which profitteth not:<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 21, 22, 23.</note> Do You not herein mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
your selves to be such as run, and the Lord
never sent You, and therefore You profit not the
People at all, but they are still Earthly-minded?
How have You then sown Spiritual Things? But
I shall prove that the <hi>Earthly minded Ones</hi> still
stick unto you; for you have a Law, made by the
Will of Man, so that if they refuse to pay You,
and forsake You, then by it You cast them into
Prison, and by Your Law take Tribble Dammage;
and this they know, and therefore consult with
their Earthly Minds, that it is better to pay the
Lesser then the Greater, though the Lesser is a
greater Oppression: &amp; thus many deny the Truth,
<pb facs="tcp:101884:236"/>
though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are convinced in their Consciences
thereof: Therefore that which leads any from
You, to take up this Cross, to own the Truth,
and deny You of Tythes, the same crucifies the
Earthly Mind, and leads to suffer for Conscience.
And the Noble Spirit of <hi>David</hi> condemns You;
for whereas he refused upon Gift, You take upon
Gift;<note place="margin">Now there is much Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftrence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God and your Bellies.</note> and if They will not give it You, You
will take it by Force; therefore this Scripture
affords Witnesses against You: But hereby thou
confessest, <hi>our Doctrine costs them nothing;</hi> then
how saidst thou before, <hi>That</hi> James Parnel<hi>'s Gospel
was not without Charge?</hi> and thus out of thy own
Mouth thou art proved a <hi>Lyar.</hi>

Priests and Ministers of those Times, while they were
teaching the People, as many of you and yours have
done?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Both the Prophets, Christ and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
declared against the Deceivers, False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
False Priests and Hirelings; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were haled out of the Synagogues and out of
the Temple, as Christ told them, <hi>John</hi> 16. 2.
as we by the same Spirit do now against You, whom
we find in the same Steps; and here thou art an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
if this be it thou callest Disturbance:
But it is because You would bear rule by Your
Means, and suffer nothing to be published that is
against You, or strikes at Your <hi>Diana.</hi>

from his outward Calling, whereby he should maintain
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:101884:237"/>
himself and his Family? <hi>And thou quotest</hi> 1 Cor.
7. 20. Ephes. 4. 28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, it doth; and the Scripture holds
forth the same, that they were ordinarily called
from their Outward Callings, to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to every Creature: Neither doth either of
these Scriptures, which thou hast quoted, prove
to the contrary. And how many Scriptures didst
thou quote in thy <hi>Answer</hi> to my Fifteenth <hi>Query,</hi>
to prove that the Ministers of the Gospel might
forbear Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>king, and not to entangle themselves
with the Affairs of this Life, yet in all could not
prove thy self a Minister of the Gospel? and now
thou questionest the Truth of the Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
neither thou nor thy Brethren were called
according to Scripture: But whomsoever the Lord
calls unto his Work, he doth take Care both for
him and his Family; but You, that are not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by him, dare not trust him without a Law of
Man.</p>
                  <p>And in thy Ninety Eighth and Ninety Nineth
<hi>Query,</hi> thou seemest to accuse us with some that
turned from the Truth, and yielded to the Deceit
of their Hearts, and so gave Occasion to such as
thee, who wait for Occasion to Blaspheme the
Truth; but is is no new thing, but the same
which the Scripture declares of in divers places:
therefore saith Christ, <hi>Offences must come, but Wo
unto them by whom they do come:</hi> For, there were
then many such as thee in that Age, who (as
thou dost) waited for Occasion to blaspheme the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:101884:237"/>
Truth: But if thou hadst been then, how would'st
thou have accused Christ, who had but Twelve
Apostles, and one of them betrayed him, and
then hanged himself; and another denyed him?
Therefore let this stop thy Mouth for speaking E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
of the things thou knowest not. And as for
<hi>Spencer</hi> and <hi>Gilpin,</hi> whom thou here nominatest;
the Truth is sufficiently clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or Madness in any Sect or under any Doctrine, as there
hath done amongst your Hearers, especially where the
Number of Disciples was no more?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Look at Home, and answer thy self,
witness your <hi>UNIVERSITIES,</hi> as you call
them; for it is the Fruit of Your Studies, who
would find out that by Your Wit and Wisdom
which the Lord hath hid from You: And all that
You cannot settle in Security and Blindness,
You lead them into Madness, Confusion and
Distraction, if they do not in time forsake you,
as many will witness at this day, That they are
led by You into such a Wilderness, that they
know not which way to get out, neither do You
know how to direct them; for You are in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
your selves, and so the Blind leadeth the
Blind into the Ditch: Therefore this might
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:101884:238"/>
have stopped thy Mouth from Falsly Accusing
us. But I remember, <hi>TRUTH</hi> was ever accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>MADNESS</hi> and <hi>FOLLY</hi> by the Blind
World, who know not that Godliness is Great
Gain. And in thy Ninety Fourth <hi>Query</hi> thou
wast Questioning the Truth of our Doctrine
because of the Multitude of Disciples, and now
by the Fewness; and thus thou Contradictest
thy self.</p>
                  <p>And then, after much of thy Filthy Stuff,
which all along thou hast vented forth of thy old
Bottle against us (which upon thee I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
again, from whence it came) thou seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to accuse our Book, but dost not shew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and therefore I pass it by, as knowing thy
Lying Spirit: And then thou stealest the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's
Words for a Cloak for the Deceit of thy
Heart, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. 7, 8, 9. which the Apostle
spoak from a True and Upright Heart, but thou
from a False Deceitful Heart, as all along hath
been sufficiently proved, and thy Prayers to be
Abomination, and that thou hast nothing to do
to name the Name of God in thy Mouth, who
art a Worker of Iniquity and a Stranger unto
God, who art found out of his Doctrine; and
therefore with this Scripture I shall mark thee,
2 <hi>John</hi> 9. 10. that all may know thee, and turn
away theit Ears from thee, who art not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,

in the World, and In You to exalt and glorifie his
Name of Holiness amongst the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and them
that know him not, now in this Day, wherein
he is visiting the Earth with Judgment, and with
Mercy, and with a Mighty Power, to call to an
Account the Inhabitants of the Earth: And bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
are You that have hearkened unto his Voice;
Ye shall sing and rejoyce when others shall weep,
and mourn, and howl: Though amongst them
your Portions are Scoffings, Scornings, Mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Deridings, Back-bitings, Revilings, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions,
Stripes, Imprisonments, yet have
You learned to account these as Riches, who
know the Comforter within You and Your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
to live with You; I do rejoyce in all
these things, being now made Partaker of them,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:101884:243"/>
I am not unknown unto You; my Voice Ye know
of Old. O how do I long to see Your Faces,
but in that I am straitned for a time! My Life
is bound up in many of Your Hearts, which makes
me I cannot forget You; my Spirit cannot be
separated from You, though my Body is kept in
Strait Bonds; but the Straitness will be broaken,
when he hath perfected his Praise in them, who
is my only Keeper and Supporter.</p>
            <p>O ye Simple Doves, who sit without Guile
in Your Mouthes! O how I am ravished with the
Love of You, when I behold You in Spirit! You
that have given up unto the Death, to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
to the Sword and to the Fire, and have
patiently submitted unto the Father's Will, and
willingly sacrificed up your Darling; Your Faith
is unto You imputed for Righteousness: and the
God whom You have trusted and believed in,
will make You rich in him, and give You Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
incorruptible, and an Inheritance that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fades; in measure You can set to Your Seals
of what is written unto You.</p>
            <p>But some have hearkened unto the Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which hath brought Evil-Tidings of the
Good Land; and such have turned Back into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
and joyned with the Magicians thereof to
harden <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Heart against the Innocent, and
filled the Mouthes of the <hi>Heathen</hi> with Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Speeches: But let them go on; He that is
filthy, let him be filthy still; for, he cometh
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:101884:244"/>
quickly whose Reward is with him, to give unto
them according to their Doings: But all things
work together for the Good of You who stand in
the Faith, who are not moved with the Winds
that blow, nor the Storms that come against You,
who eye the Hand of Providence in all these
things, which bringeth Good out of Evil to
You wards, who abide in the Truth, and stray
not.</p>
            <p>So, as You have tasted, felt, known and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
of Him, so trust Ye in Him, and remain
in Your sure Confidence, which is begotten in
You by his Word; and be Ye as Lights in the
dark World both by Word and by Conversation,
that in all things Ye may be approved by the
Father's in Your Consciences, as Faithful and
Obedient Children, every one in Your Calling,
wherein you are called, that the Price thereof
You may obtain in the End of Your Race. O
lift up your Heads, and look up to the Father,
and see how he hath tendered You, and how his
Love hath been tendered towards You all along,
who hath not left You without Instructors and
Nursing-Fathers, who have watched over You
with tender Care: In much <hi>Love</hi> &amp; <hi>Tenderness</hi> am
I drawn forth towards You <hi>little ones,</hi> which springs
from the Root of the Vine, because you bear my
Father's Image. Long have I waited to write to
You, and lately I had an Opening of You, which
caused me to visit You with this <hi>Epistle;</hi> for, Ye
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:101884:244"/>

though I could not write; and now You must

through which comes the Ministration of Peace,
which doth the other exceed; but take Heed of

have its Work, in which wait for the fulfilling of
these Things, that within you may read them,
and the Life it self may shew forth it self, which

Therefore I say unto you all, Watch, that the
Pure may exercise your Minds, which is the Cross
to the Carnal, which crucifies the Carnal, and
mortifies the Deeds of the Flesh, and establisheth
Purity in the Heart, and brings forth the Fruits of
the Spirit; which is Love in a pure Life, that here
you may come to live, and walk, and grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Unity in your Measures; for that which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates
from the Unity is self, which causeth Love
to wax cold, but in the Love of God abiding, self
is denyed; for where self is owned, the Love of
God is denyed: So here is the Enemy of your own
House, that you are to war against, and in the
Light (which discovers self) is your Power and
Strength; and as you receive the Light, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Power to deny self in its Appearances, which
Power reconciles your Hearts together, and works
you into perfect Friendship &amp; Unity, which stands
not in the Will, but in the pure Nature, which is
the Cross to Will, which Nature the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear, which Nature breaks the World's Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship,
Love and Friendship, all which stands in
their corrupt Wills, wherein stands all their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms,
Fashions and Traditions, and all their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Profession, out of which also ariseth Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
against you who dwell in the pure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the single pure Language, which their
corrupt Wills cannot bear nor savour; but look
not out at what they can do unto you, knowing
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:101884:247"/>
that the uttermost is but to take the Life of the
Body; but eye the Lord your God in it, and count
it your Riches that you are found worthy to suffer
for Righteousness sake; for through many Tryals
and Tribulations you come forth pure unto the
Lord, and strong in the Faith.</p>
            <p>So the Lord God of Power be with you, and by
his mighty Power keep you low, and watchful in
your Conditions, that your Eternal Good you may
mind above all Things under the Sun, that every
one in the Truth received you may walk and grow,
daily dying unto the Things that perish, that in
the Life of God you may come to dwell, out of
the Creatures, and then the true Use of them will
be given you, and the pure Wisdom, as it was in
the Beginning, when Man was in the Right to
the Creatures, and here Paradice will be found;
but he that believeth maketh not hast, but by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
continuing in well-doing, you will reap if
you faint not, wherein I bid you you <hi>Farewel.</hi>

will prove and try Your Hearts, and let You see
how Your Hearts stand towards God, and what
therein is Head and Ruler; so that none of You
may be acted by a False Spirit, which begets into
a False Liberty, out of the Cross; but that your
own Wisdom and Reason (which argues against
the Light for a Liberty out of the Cross) may
all come unto the Death of the Cross, to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified;
for all that in You which would not be
tryed by the Light, springs from the Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

is the Cross to Your Wills, that by it You may

            <p>For, all You that are Bowing, and Crouching,

You which honours and worships the Beast, or

seeking to please the <hi>one,</hi> you displease the <hi>other,</hi>
and so beguile your own Souls, and are a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Honour of Man.</hi> And here all Men are honoured
in the Lord; but out of the Lord none are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured:
And they that are Proud, and High,
and Lofty, are out of the Lord; for that is one
of the <hi>seven Abominations.</hi> And here, by the
Light, all <hi>Respect of Persons</hi> is condemned, and the
Lord honoured in all, and all in him; which
Light condemns the Language of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and
begets into the plain single Language, which the
Beast-like Nature cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>if you seek to please Men, you are not the Servants of
Christ,</hi> Gal. 1. 10.</p>
            <p>And all you that still follow the Fashions of the
World (wherein is Excess) either in Meat,
Drink or Apparel; you are still alive in the
World's Nature, being conformed like unto the
World, and are not obedient unto the Light which
convinceth you of the <hi>Vanities of the World,</hi> and
the <hi>Fashions thereof,</hi> therefore by the Light in your
selves, which condemns all that in you which
would be exalted and esteemed in the World,
which would be like the World, and have the
Praise of the World, which is to be condemned
with the World by the Light which is not of the
World: And so <hi>Pride</hi> comes to be rooted out of

And all the <hi>Customary Words of the World,</hi> which
are by the Light condemned, which by the Light
are seen to be invented from that Nature which
knows not God, whereby God is dishonoured who
calls to all who will follow him, <hi>To come out from

Therefore touch not their <hi>Customs,</hi> but keep out
of their <hi>Fashions and Traditions;</hi> for they are all
Unclean; and <hi>own th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and follow the Light out or <hi>Babylon,</hi> and it will
lead you into the <hi>pure Religion, which is unspotted of
the World;</hi> and so will crucifie you to the World,
and the World to you: But that in you that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
that Scripture, <hi>Custom to whom Custom,</hi> that
is it which is willing to remain blind in <hi>Custom</hi> to
save its Life, which by the Light is declared and
condemned with the World, which would keep
in Friendship with the World, and in the Love of
the World, all which is at Enmity with the Light,
and is for Condemnation by the Light.</p>
            <p>Therefore, to the <hi>Light</hi> turn your Minds, that
by it you may judge all such Carnal Ends and
Reasonings, which would uphold these Carnal
Customs, contrary to the Light, which gave forth
the Scripture, by which you may see what <hi>Custom</hi>
the Apostle there spake of in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. as you
may read in <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 9. how <hi>he sate at the Rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Heathen,</hi> that are Vain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="449" facs="tcp:101884:250"/>
Therefore to the Light take heed, that it may
be your Teacher and Counsellor, that from it
alone you may Act and Speak, and so will you
find the Witness within your selves for what you
Act and Do.</p>
            <p>And all you that still pay the Priests <hi>Tythes</hi> and
<hi>Offerings,</hi> and are convinced of the <hi>Deceit of the
Priests,;</hi> you do deny Jesus Christ, the Son of
God come in the Flesh, who is the Everlasting
High Priest, the <hi>End of Tythes and Offerings</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Law; and do uphold <hi>Babel</hi> and the
<hi>Merchants of Babylon,</hi> and are throwing down with
the one Hand, and building up with another;
who cry against the Priests in words, as to be <hi>proud</hi>
and <hi>covetous,</hi> and yet put into their Mouthes for a
<hi>Peace</hi> sake with them; and so, while you put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Mouthes, you Uphold them; <hi>for their
Maintenance Upholds their Ministry:</hi> And here you
flee the Cross, and are <hi>Men pleasers,</hi> because you
would not suffer for the Truth you profess, and
therefore are denyed by them that dwell in the
Truth.</p>
            <p>But you that for Conscience cannot pay the
Priests <hi>Tythes,</hi> keep to that of God which convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
you in your Consciences, and it will carry you
out to suffer for Conscience sake; and so you
will have your Peace with God in your Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
though by Men persecuted. Or if you be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to Answer at their <hi>high Courts</hi> or <hi>Benches,</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:101884:251"/>
to the Principle of God in your Consciences,
you may appear before their Highest Judges; and
cast <hi>Slavish Fear</hi> aside, and stand in the Fear and
Counsel of God, and to their Faces Answer for
the Truth in Boldness against their <hi>Deceit,</hi> and let
the Truth confound them. And give up your
Bodies freely to suffer for the <hi>Truth of Jesus,</hi> that
the <hi>Heathen</hi> may know, <hi>That the Truth is in You.</hi>
And deny all those that receive <hi>Fees</hi> or <hi>Gifts in
their Heads,</hi> and keep to the Counsellor within:
<hi>If any Man wants Wisdom, let him ask it of God,</hi> where
you need not go out to Man.</p>
            <p>And all you that give <hi>Money to Repair the Idols
Temples,</hi> and are convinced in your Consciences
of the Idolatrous Worship that is therein upheld,
you are guilty with the <hi>Idolatrous Worshippers,</hi> who
do uphold their <hi>Idolatrous Places,</hi> and so uphold
their <hi>Idolatrous Worship;</hi> and here you cannot wash
your Hands of their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but are defiled with
them <hi>so long as you Uphold their Idolatrous Places.</hi>
Therefore to the Light bring all your Deeds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
by it all such Actions and Practices may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
and you separated from the <hi>Idolatrous Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;</hi>
and keep clean from its Polutions: and
suffer willingly the Spoiling of your Goods for the
Name of Jesus.</p>
            <p>And if you be called before Magistrates to
take an <hi>Oath,</hi> keep to that which condemns <hi>all
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:101884:251"/>
Oaths,</hi> which saith, <hi>Swear not at all, but testifie the
Truth from your Consciences in the face of all men;</hi> and
so you abide in the Doctrine of Christ, and out
of the Condemnation; for, <hi>They that Swear, fall
into Condemnation,</hi> saith the Apostle <hi>James,</hi> Chap.
5. 11. And though in the Time of the Law and
the Prophets on <hi>Oath</hi> for Confirmation among men
then was the End of all Strife; but Christ Jesus,
the <hi>Oath of God,</hi> the <hi>Fulfilling and End of the Law and
the Prophets,</hi> saith, <hi>Swear not at all, but let your</hi> Yea <hi>be</hi>
Yea, <hi>and</hi> Nay, Nay; <hi>for, what is more, is Evil:</hi>
And such as stumbles at this Language, accounts
the Cross <hi>Foolishness,</hi> and is for Death by the
Cross, And <hi>if you be crucified with Christ, you shall
reign with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so, to the Light in you all I leave you, by
it to be directed how to walk up to the Mind of
God, and own the Truth before all men, every
one of you faithful in your Measures, there to
grow out of the World, and the Deceit of the
World, to be kept clean from the World, in the
Fear of the Lord, using the World as if you used
it not, and then are you my Friends, and of my
Kindred.</p>
            <p>And this I was moved to give forth, for
the Directing of your Minds, lest any of you
should be choaked with the World's Spirit, which
I see working amongst you, which would <hi>keep Peace
and Friendship with the World;</hi> that by the Light of
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:101884:252"/>
Christ Jesus (where with you are all enlightened)
you may search out this Worldly Spirit, which is
in you, working against the Light, that by the
Light it may be rooted out; for, of a Truth, you
cannot serve them both; but while you are seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to please the one, you displease the other:
Therefore keep to that which separates from the
World; for, <hi>if God be on your side, who can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you?</hi> In which <hi>Confidence</hi> I rest, in <hi>Unity</hi>

was prophesied of by the Ministers and Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
or Light in the dayes of old, who suffered in
the like nature, by the same Generation, for the
same Testimony; and though yet the Lord suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the same Generation to act in their Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, and fill up their Measure of Wrath, it
is for the Manifestation of his Truth, and Exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Name of Power; and through all this
are we known and made manifest unto You, who
be in the Light; and the <hi>Heathen</hi> do come to

all this do we Rejoyce, and through our Sufferings
are Crowned, and do get Victory over the world
without as within: And though we are here kept
the Lord's appointed Time, yet (Friends) eye
the Lord in all these things, and look not out at
Man, or what Man can do, either for or against,
but eye God in all his Works, and in all his

been Your Head may be bruised; and so, Friends,
your Hearts come to be established and confirmed
in the unchangeable Truth, unto which You

Truth, to bear the Image of the Father of Truth.
So, all who own this Voice, unto the Witness in

            <p>So, while you have the Light, abide in it,
and in it you will see more Light; and sweep clean
within, and search every Corner, and suffer not
an Enemy in the House, and let not any evil thing

behold your selves, and be ashamed of your Pride &amp;
Arrogancy: and though there was a Time that
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his Will oppressed the Children of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
yet there came a Time that he felt the Hand of
the almighty God, &amp; thereby was <hi>Israel</hi> delivered,
and he drowned in the Sea: And though <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>
made an Image, and would have all to
bow unto it, or else be cast into the fiery Furnace,
yet there came a Time that he lost his Kingdom:
And though there was a Time that <hi>Haman</hi> was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
and <hi>Mordecai</hi> despised, and <hi>Haman</hi> made a
pair of Gallows for <hi>Mordecai,</hi> because he could not
bow unto him, yet there came a Time that <hi>Haman</hi>

exalted in his stead: Now read your selves and
your Portions; for in <hi>Haman</hi>'s Nature your are found
Lording over your Fellow. Creatures by your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Wills, as it doth appear by your Sternness and
Cruelty in Fining of them, and Imprisoning of
them that cannot bow unto you, nor put off their

upon the same Account, as you now do? But
whether was it by the Authority of God, or their
own Wills, that they commanded these Things?
and thereby try your selves, &amp; see what you would
do if you had a Law to shew for what you do, as
they had, seeing you act thus without Law; and
have no Law to shew for it, though you do it in the
Name of the <hi>Lord Protector of England,</hi> and so make
him the Protector of Tyranny and Oppression and
Cruelty, as ever was heard of in any Age, which
is contrary to his own Proclamations; and I do
believe he would be ashamed to own his Name to
such Practices; for if he should, he makes his
own Promises Vows, and Proclamations of none
Effect: And this the Lord God of Heaven and
Earth hath suffered long, but his Sword is drawn
and furbished, to cut you down all you high Oaks &amp;
tall Cedars, who oppress the little Shrubs, and
him too whom you call <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> if he wink

confess to be Just, though with weeping and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and gnashing of Teeth, because you have rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
him of his Glory and Honour, and taken it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your selves: And though in the Old Covenant
they bowed to one another, yet when Christ, the
New Covenant came, who is the End of the Old,
he spake unto his Disciples, and said, <hi>The</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

thus you bear the Sword in vain: And here is the

for I, deny any Thing to be Justice, or done by the

and Justice saith, <hi>I receive not Honour of Men:</hi> Now
here you have gotten the Name, but want the

Justice, you do them Injustice, and exercise the

For Truth and Justice now is risen and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising,
and it is you that are not subject thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
but stand in your own Wills to oppose it, and
are setting up and exalting your selves, even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

for it is he that is exalted in you; and though you
be exalted as high as the Heavens, and set your

            <head>To all You
Magistrates, Rulers
AND
OFFICERS,
Who Call Men to SWEAR,
and Imprison them if they will not.</head>
            <p>You are the Oppressors of Tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and do not allow Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and so break Your own; and also
You have a Law against Swearers, &amp; yet by Your
Law seek to compel men to swear: Oh! blush,
and be ashamed of your Profession, who thus Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
act: How dare You call Christ Your Lord
and Master, and do not the things that he saith?
for, he commands, <hi>Swear not at all, neither by
Heaven, nor by Earth, nor by the Head, because you
cannot make one Hair white or black, nor by any other
thing; but let your</hi> Yea <hi>be</hi> Yea, <hi>and</hi> Nay, Nay; <hi>for
what is more, is Evil:</hi> And so here You run from
the Doctrine of Christ, and hinder others, who
both swear your selves, and would compel others,
by Fining of them and Imprisoning of them; and
thus You run into the Evil, and would have all
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:101884:261"/>
with You in the Snares of the Devil: And now,
if you do run unto the Scripture to maintain
Swearing, and say, <hi>They swore in the Time of the
Law:</hi> I Answer, Christ Jesus, who is the End
of the Law, faith, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and if you
do alledge, <hi>That</hi> Moses, <hi>a Servant of God, swore;</hi>
I Answer, But Christ Jesus, the Son of God, saith,
<hi>Swear not at all;</hi> hear him: And if you do alledge,
<hi>That</hi> David, <hi>a Man of God, swore;</hi> I Answer,
But this is the Son of God, and <hi>David</hi> called him
<hi>Lord,</hi> who saith, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> him You are to
hear: And if You do alledge, <hi>That</hi> Saul <hi>swore in the
War;</hi> I Answer, He, who comes to End all
War and Controversie, who brings Peace and
Good-will towards Men, he saith, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi>
who is the Son of God; hear him: And if You
do alledge, <hi>They swore in the Time of the Prophets;</hi>
I Answer, Christ Jesus, the Fulfilling and End
of the Prophets, saith, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> And if
You do alledge, <hi>That they Swore in the Old Covenant;</hi>
I Answer, Christ Jesus, the New and Everlasting
Covenant, saith, <hi>Swear not at all; but let your Yea
be Yea, and Nay be Nay; for what is more;</hi> and here
You are shut out of the New Covenant, in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and so in the Kingdom of the Devil; for,
in the New Covenant no Swearer can come: And
if you do alledge that Scripture where the Apostle
said, <hi>An Oath for Confirmation amongst Men, to them
it was the End of all Strife;</hi> I Answer, He brought
this as a Comparison confirming the Covenant
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:101884:262"/>
that God had made, and confirmed it with an
Oath; but the Apostle brought it not to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Swearing or Oathes; but he spoak it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Jesus Christ, the Oath of God, which is
the End of all Oathes, Controversie and Strife,
who saith, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> And in the Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
they did use Oaths for the End of Strife
and Controversie, and to Confirm things amongst
them; so the Apostle brought that then as a
Comparison; but Jesus Christ, the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
which was confirmed by an Oath, and now
is the End of all Oaths, and Controversies and
Strife, who now saith, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
he declared against Strife and Controversie,
and he declared against Swearing; for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>Above all things, my Brethren,
Swear not at all; neither by Heaven, neither by the
Earth, nor any other Oath; but let your</hi> Yea <hi>be</hi> Yea,
<hi>and your</hi> Nay <hi>be</hi> Nay, <hi>lest you fall into Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
And here You are in the Condemnation, and
out of the New Covenant, and draw from the
Doctrine of Christ and his Apostle, who are in
the Oaths and Swearing, and <hi>compel</hi> others to
swear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore the greater will be Your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.
And if You do alledge that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where the Apostle said, <hi>Be subject to every
Ordinance of Man for the Lord's sake;</hi> I Answer,
Obey God rather then Man for the Lord's sake,
who saith, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and <hi>Why call you him
Lord, and do not the things which he saith?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:101884:262"/>
away with Your Profession of Christ, and
of Faith in him, and are so Faithless as to depart
from his Doctrine, and compel others to follow
You; hence You are found Traytors to him, and
Hypocrites, whom the Lord will judge, with
your Hypocritical Feigned Faith, who cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
one another without Swearing, and so think
all like your selves; but as many as believed,
were of one Heart and Soul, which was the End
of all Strife and Controversie; and they made
No Swearing amongst them, who were in the
Faith.</p>
            <p>Therefore, all You <hi>Magistrates, Rulers</hi> and <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi>
who are Swearing, and Compelling men
to Swear, now read your selves by the Light of
Christ, which searcheth Your Consciences, and
with it judge your selves; and Fear the Lord God,
and Tremble before him, who do so oppose his
Commands, and do Despight against the Spirit
of Grace; for, no Ignorance in this thing can
you plead: For, it is plain by the Light of God
in your Consciences, that you do Evil; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I charge You in the Presence of the Living
God, To take heed of Oppressing any Tender
Consciences, or Forcing any Tender Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or Fining them, or Imprisoning them for
Obeying God rather then Your Wills; for, if
you do, to be sure the Plagues and Woes of God
shall come upon you, and great shall be your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="474" facs="tcp:101884:263"/>
               <hi>And if you ask,</hi> How shall you do to End Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
and to Confirm a Truth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Answer,</hi> They that for Conscience sake dare
not Swear, they for Conscience sake dare not Lye,
but speak the Truth so far as they do know, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Hypocrisie; for, that that judgeth Swearing,
that also judgeth Lying, Hypocrise and Deceit;
and so by one Truth its confirmed: And as for
those that are without the Fear of God, who
scruple not at Swearing, they scruple not at Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for they that will tell a Lye in such a Case,
will also Swear and Lye: Therefore, whom you
find thus Deceitful, you may also exercise the
Law upon them as upon False Swearers, without
Winking at them; and that will bring them into
Awe and Fear of the Law, though they be out of
the Fear of God; and for this End was the outward
Law ordained: And thus you will be a Terror to the
Evil-doers, and a Praise to them that do Well;
for, if all did Well, what needs there a Law?
And so, as you stand here in all things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to your Places, discharging your Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Equity and Justice, without Partiality,
and then will you do that which is wholsom and
good in the Sight of God, and he will bless your
Proceedings; and thus you will be worthy of
double Honour, not with the Flattering Titles of
Men, or Respect to your Persons, in Admiration,
because of Advantage; but you will witness the
True Nobility, and deny all Flattery or Deceit,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:101884:263"/>
but your Honour will be of God; for, <hi>Them
that Honour God, them will God Honour;</hi> if you stand,
I say, in that Counsel of God, out of your own
Wills, Ruling for God, and not for your selves,
but for the Punishing of the Wicked, and the
cleansing the Land of Evil doers, that God may
be Honoured by your Faith, and Faithful, and Just
and Equal Proceedings. And so, I rest a Friend
to the Tender Consciences, and am subject to all
Wholsom and Good Laws &amp; Ordinances of Man
for the Lord's sake, and do honour all such Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
in my Heart, who observe this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without Flattery or Hypocrisie; but I
find some so worthy in the Nation, in whom
there is no Hatred, and the Unjust strive to put
them out, and so the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and must needs abound
with Corruption and Evil, Deceit and Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
and all Ungodliness, as it doth, seeing these
that are in Offices, who ought to suppress those
things, do countenance those things, and lay their
Law upon the Innocent and Righteous; and so,
as much as in them lieth, to exalt Iniquity, and
beat down and tread Truth under Foot: But the
God of Truth is arisen with a Mighty and a Strong
Arm, which they are not able to overcome; but
the more they stir, the more it conquers, <hi>who is
come with a Fan in his Hand, and will thoroughly purge
his Floor, and gather his Wheat into his Garner, and
burn up the Chaff with Unquenchable Fire;</hi> and thus
will he sweep away the Seed of Evil-Doers, and
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:101884:264"/>
Refuge of them with the Beesom of Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and so will he cleanse the Land of Evil-doers,
and make all you Careless Ones, that are
at Ease in your Lusts, all you Corrupt Unjust
Judges, Rulers and Officer, who are Partial in
your Judgments, and receive Gifts in your Hands,
and regard not the Cause of the Just; your Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
is coming on, and your Destruction is nigh

            <p>Now you are Warned, and a Servant of the
