            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For he sawe, that as in the small natiue seede of all growing or liuing things, is conteined the fourme that bringeth them to theyr perfection: so in certayne small and obscure mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Common wealth, consisteth no small encrease to the perfection of the whole.

But as in man (whome <hi>Plato</hi> calleth the lesse world) the vigour and agilitie of the immortall soule and minde neuer ceasseth from continuall moouing, but is euer exercised in excogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; inuentions of great things (herein resembling God, whose caract it beareth) by prouidence foreseeing, and by intelligence vnderstanding, and deuising what is to be done, and what to be eschewed, doth immmediatly mooue and rayse vp the faculties, powers, and members of the body to execute the same: Euen so, in the greater world, the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and vniuersall counsayle and consent of men, hath elected &amp; appoynted certayne principall men, to beare like rule &amp; aucthoritie in the body of the Common wealth, as hath the intellectiue soule in the members of our body to mooue and commaund the same. To Princes therefore, Counsaylours, Rulers, Gouernours, and Magistrates, as to the most intellectiue and sensitiue partes of the societie of men, hath God and Nature geuen preeminence and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of the Common wealth, that by their prouidence, wisedome, and ayde, it may vniuersally florishe, not only by iust administratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good lawes, with due correction of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactours, but also by lyberall rewarding of suche as haue well deserued, and especially by maynteinance of such Artes and Sciences, as the Common wealth can not well be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. And to drawe nearer to the applying of my simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, I say, that what so euer Vertue, what so euer Arte.

or the ingenious industry of men, hath to this day inuented, all the same is to be imputed to the beneuolence and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of such as haue honorably mainteyned, and freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded the trauayles, paynes, and charges of them that haue spent theyr lyues, goodes, and wits (as many haue done) in the inuentions of necessarie and profitable Artes and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

that it may heereby appeare that you haue attempted the same, rather for knowledge and vertues sake, then for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse of gaynes: as is furthermore well knowen by your fyrst vyages of discouerie attempted to <hi>Cathay,</hi> by the Northeast seas, vpon certayne losse and detriment, for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayne hope eyther of gaynes, or of any such way to be found, otherwise then by certayne likely coniectures: not much vnlike to the shining flowres of Marchasytes, which outwardly appearing in minerall mountaynes, are signes and tokens whereby is coniectured what metall is contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, and whether the same be to be folowed or not. And although it sometime so chaunce, that such signes are fayleable, shewing more in apparance, then they contayne in substance: yet are not such signes, tokens, or shewes to be contemned, but rather earnestly to be folowed, for as much as it hath been often prooued, and found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that by folowing the same, haue been found great and ryche mynes of mettalles, as <hi>Georgius Agricola</hi> in his bookes <hi>De rebus metallices,</hi> dooth largely declare and prooue by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples. But to write at large what great things haue proceeded of small and obscure beginnings, and in manner meere coniectures, it would so farre exceede the measure of an Epistle or Preface, that it would rather encrease to the iust quantitie of a booke. For in manner all the late disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueryes both of the Spanyards and Portugales, had theyr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of such small coniectures, with vncertayne hope (as it were <hi>praeter spem sub spe</hi>) vntyll God and good happe, by the constant trauayle and valiant minde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A voyage doubtlesse of suche difficultie, and in maner impossibilitie, that considering the infinite dangers thereof (as I haue learned by the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Steuen a Burrough,</hi> that was then the chiefe Pilot of the same voyage) it may seeme impossible that they should euer haue escaped, except the mightie hand of God, by the expert skylfulnesse of so excellent a Pilot, had deliuered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from those dangers. And although in deede (as religion bindeth vs) it is conuenient in all things to geue all honour, glory, and thanks to God: yet are we not thereby restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be thankefull to such men, as by theyr arte, ingenious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, trauayle, and diligence, haue dese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion, and alteration of all creatures that are contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the world of generation and corruption. And for this consyderation, certayne of the auncient Philosophers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it the soule of the world: Other, the eye: and other also the hart of the world. <hi>Plato</hi> also affyrmeth, that the soule of the world is the Sunne, and that all other lyuing things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue lyfe from thence. And hereof commeth the saying of the Philosopher, <hi>Sol &amp; homo, generant hominem:</hi> (that is) the Sunne and man, beget man. And therefore (as wryteth <hi>Marcilius Ficinus</hi>) of all Idolaters they are most tollerable that honor the Sunne for God. The which, although it be not, yet vndoubtedly are his effects so great and wonderfull in this inferiour world, that it may seeme in manner to be Gods Vicegerent, Liefetenant, and Viceroy, in all the works of nature, except where and when it pleaseth him in any thing miraculously, otherwise then by the common order and course of nature, to commaund the contrarie.</p>
            <p>And if it may not be tedious vnto you (right Honorable and Worshipfull) it shalbe a pleasure vnto me, for the better declaration hereof, to make a briefe discourse of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous and strange effects that are caused by the Sunne: which perhaps few haue done, otherwise then dispearsedly here and there, as occasion hath serued. Fyrst therefore let vs consyder what it hath done ouer the Equinoctial lyne, and vnder both the Poles at one instant, diuersly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traryly the one to the other. For so hath the infinite wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the great God of nature, the supreame Architec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the vniuersall world, disposed all things in such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect order, that to them that are vnder the Equinoctial, and haue theyr Horizon passing by the two Poles, the day is of twelue houres, and the nyght as much, and theyr yeere also is deuided into twelue monethes: But they that dwell iust and perpendiculerly vnder our Pole, and that haue theyr
<pb facs="tcp:11547:8"/>
Horizon passing ouer the sayd lyne, haue the day of the sixe monethes: That is to say, beginning from the tenth day of March, when the Sunne commeth ouer the sayde Horizon, vntill it returne to passe vnder the same at the tenth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember. And contrarywyse, one night of sixe moneths haue the inhabitantes vnder the Pole An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>articke: whose yeere (that is to say, all the course that the Sunne maketh by the twelue signes of the Zodiacke) is accomplished in one day and one nyght: a thing doubtlesse most wonderfull and marueylous. Lykewise, when we haue sommer, they that are vnder our Pole, haue the day of sixe monethes, and they of the opposite or contrary Pole, haue their night of the same length. Againe, when it is winter with vs, then vnder our Pole is the night of the said sixe monethes, and vnder the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite Pole, is the day of the same length. So that, as it were, course by course, when we haue the night, they haue the day: and contrarywyse, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue the day, they haue the night. The which, although it be so long, &amp; of so great space of time, yet is it not continually obscured with darkenesse. For the Sunne maketh his course in such order, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that part, liue not during that time altogeather in darknesses, as Moles liue vnder the ground, but as other creatures that liue vpon the globe and face of the Earth, they haue such lyght as may suffyse to susteyne and mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne their life. For the body of the Sunne declyneth no more either beneath the Equinoctial line, either aboue the same line (which is the Horizon to both the Poles) then 23. degrees, that is to say, no lower or higher then the Tropikes, which are no more then 23. degrees, or there about, from the sayd Equinoctial, that is their Horizon, as is aforesayd. And yet in these 23. degrees, he maketh not his course by the opposite Diameter, but goeth continually round about in circuite: so that his beames reuerberating heauen, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent such a manner of lyght, as wee haue in Sommer two houres before the Sunne rise. And this example whiche we haue taken of the diuersitie of the Horizons of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial, and vnder the two Poles, is to demonstrate the
<pb facs="tcp:11547:9"/>
marueylous effect that the Sunne maketh, departing from the xij. houres of the Equinoctiall (that is to say, from <hi>Aries</hi> to <hi>Libra</hi>) and comming by lytle and lytle, illuminating the Globe of the earth, and so reducing the yeere of xij. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes, into one onely day, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d one night, as is sayd before. Vnder the infinite varietie of the which course, sometyme with long dayes, and sometime with short, all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the world are fourmed and disposed, of such strength and complexion of body, that euery of them are proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of the Climate assigned vnto them, be it hote or colde, and may dwell and abide there, as in their naturall place and temperament, not lamenting, or desiring to dwell else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, so great a loue resteth in them to their natiue situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But not to depart from the vyage which the Sunne maketh in one whole yeere, as sometime approching neere vnto vs, and sometime departing from vs, I say, that at one selfe same time, in diuers partes vpon the round Globe of the earth, it causeth the Spring, Sommer, Autumne, and Winter. And neuerthelesse, at the same instant and punct of time, it maketh day and high noone in one place, and nyght and midnight on the opposite part. The which varietie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it appeare incomprehensible to the slendernesse of our wits, yet beholding the same with the eyes of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and therewith considering the vnestimable moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that the Sunne maketh continually, we shall fynde it to be true, hauing respect to the diuers situations of the earth, as it is continually illuminate more or lesse by the Sunne. And this varietie is made with such a harmonie and consonancie, and such a lawe perpetuall and immutable, that yf any poynt or pricke thereof should fayle, it is to be doubted lest the Elements should be confounded together, and returne to their first <hi>Chaos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to haue sayd thus much of the wonderfull effects of the course of the Sunne, it may suffise for an example to prooue how necessary a thing it is, not onely for all Pilots and Sea men to haue the knowledge heereof, but also for all other such as shall attempt great and farre voyages in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen
<pb facs="tcp:11547:9"/>

Wherein, what commendation you haue deserued, to the increase of your perpetuall fame and honour, I referre it to that I haue sayd before. And as touching Maister <hi>Ienkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> what trauayles, paynes, and dangers he hath susteyned, and hardly escaped, and what diligence and arte he hath vsed in the searching of strange countreys, and in the description of those his voyages, it were but in vayne for me to wryte much vnto you, vnto whome the same is better knowen then to me. And therefore to conclude, with rendering iust commendations both vnto you and him, I can say no more, but as <hi>Plato</hi> wryteth in his Booke <hi>De Legibus, Decens est eos ciues laudibus ornare, qui corporis vel animi viribus, res arduas praecláras que gesserunt, &amp; legibus libenter paruerunt.</hi> That is to say, It is decent to commend those Citizens, that by theyr industry of body and minde, haue done great affayres, and haue wyllyngly obeyed good lawes.

And although the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hold opinion, that it is not distaunt more then threé degreés and a halfe, yet to my iudgement, more credit ought to be geuen to the Astronomers, then to the Mariners, for as much as the Astronomers do knowe the places of the Starres, with theyr longitudes, latitudes, declinations, and right assentions, more perfectly and precisely then do the Mariners: For they accompt not onely by degrées, but also by minutes and seconds. But let none deceiue them selues through my opinion. Therefore, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer will precisely know it, let him take the highest altitude of the North Starre, which is his being ouer the pole, and the lesse altitude, which is his being vnder it: then take away the lesse from the more, and the halfe of that that remayneth, shall be the distaunce of that Starre from the pole of the world.</p>
