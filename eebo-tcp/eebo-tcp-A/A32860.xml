            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>This know also, that in the last dayes perilous times shall come.</p>
                  <p>For men shall be lovers of their owne selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to Parents, unthankfull, unholy,</p>
                  <p>Without naturall affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>
                  <p>Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more then lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of God;</p>
                  <p>Having a forme of godlinesse, but denying the power thereof.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O a discourse upon these words, I cannot thinke of any fitter introduction then that wherewith our Saviour sometime began a Sermon of his, <hi>This day is this Scripture fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> And I would to God there were not great occasion to feare that a great part of it may be fullfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this place.</p>
            <p>Two things are contained in it. First the reall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the generality of the men of the latter times, in the foure first verses. For by men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous boasters, proud, &amp;c. I conceive is meant, men generally shall be so, otherwise this were nothing peculiar to the last, but common to all times, for in all times some, nay many have been lovers of themselves, covetous, boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, proud, &amp;c. Secondly, we have here the formall and hypocriticall godlinesse of the same times, in the last verse,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107281:3"/>
having a forme of godlinesse. but denying the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which latter ordinarily and naturally accompanies the former. For as the shadowes are longest when the Sunne is lowest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as vines and other fruit trees beare the lesse fruit, when they are suffered to luxuriate and spend their sap upon superfluous suckers, and aboundance of leaves: So commonly we may observe both in Civill conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where there is great store of formality, there is little sincerity: and in Religion where there is a decay of true and cordiall piety, there men entertaine and please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and vainely hope to please God with externall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, and performances, and great store of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse for which Christ shall judge the world.</p>
            <p>It were no difficult matter to shew that the truth of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> prediction is by experience justified in both parts of it, but my purpose is to restraine my selfe to the latter, and to endeavour to cleare unto you, that that in our times is generally accomplished: That almost in all places the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Godlinesse is decayed and vanished, the forme and profession of it onely remaining: That the spirit, and soule, and life of Religion, is for the most part gone, onely the outward body or carcasse, or rather the picture or shadow of it, being left behind: This is the Doctrine which at this time I shall deliver to you; and the use, which I desire most heartily you should make of it, is this. To take care that you confute, so farre as it concernes your particulars, what I feare I shall prove too true in the generall.</p>
            <p>To come then to our businesse without further comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let us examine our wayes, and consider impartially what the Religion of most men is.</p>
            <p>We are baptized in our infancy, that is, as I conceive, dedicated and devoted to Gods service, by our Parents and the Church, as young <hi>Samuel</hi> was by his Mother <hi>Anna,</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107281:3"/>
there we take a Solemne vow, <hi>To forsake the Devill and all his workes, the vaine pompe and glory of the world, with all the couetous desires of it, to forsake also all the carnall desires of the flesh, and not to follow nor be led by them.</hi> This vow we take when we be children and understand it not: and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are there who know, and consider, and regard what they have vowed, when they are become men, almost as little as they did being children: consider the lives, and publique Actions of most men of all conditions in Court, City, and Country, &amp; then deny it if you can, that those three things which we have renounced in our baptisme, the profits, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and pleasures of the world, are not the very Gods which divide the world amongst them, are not served more devoutly, confided in more heartily, loved more affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, then the <hi>Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost,</hi> in whose name we are baptized? deny if you can the daily and constant imployment of all men, to be either a violent prosecution of the vaine pompe and glory of the world, or of the power, riches, and contemptible profits of it, or of the momentany or unsatisfying pleasures of the flesh, or else of the more diabolicall humours of pride, malice, revenge, and such like: and yet with this empty forme we please and satisfy our selves, as well as if we were lively borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by the Spirit of God, not knowing or not regarding what Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath taught us, That the <hi>Baptisme</hi> which <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> must save us, is, <hi>Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answere of a good consciene unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we are come to yeares capable of instruction, many (which is lamentable to consider,) are so little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themselves or others, that they continue little better then Pagans in a Common wealth of Christians, and know little more of God or of Christ, then if they had beene bred in the Indies. A lamentable case, and which will one
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107281:4"/>
day lye heavie upon their account, which might have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended it and did not. But many I confesse are taught to act over this play of Religion, and learned to say, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which art in Heaven:</hi> and, <hi>I beleeve in God the Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:</hi> but where are the men that live so, as if they did beleeve in earnest, that God is their Almighty Father? where are they that feare him, and trust him, and depend upon him onely, for their whole happinesse, and love him, and obey him as in reason we ought to do to an Almighty Father? who if he be our Father, and we be indeed his children, will do for us all the good he can, and if he be Almighty, can do for us all the good he will; and yet how few are there, who love him with halfe that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as Children usually do their naturall Parents, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive him with halfe that simplicity, or serve him with halfe that dilligence? And then for the Lords prayer, the plaine truth is, we lye unto God for the most part cleane through it, and for want of desiring indeed what in word we pray for, tell him to his face as many false tales as we make Petitions. For who shewes by his endeavours, that he desires heartily that <hi>Gods name should be hallowed,</hi> that is, holily, and religiously worshiped and adored by all men? That <hi>his Kingdome should be advanced and inlarged? That his blessed will should be universally obayed?</hi> Who shews by his forsaking sinne, that he desires so much as he should do the forgivenes of it? Nay who doth not revenge upon all occasions, the affronts, contempts, and injuries put upon him, and so upon the matter curse himselfe, as oft as he sayes <hi>forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespasse against us?</hi> How few depend upon God only for their <hi>dayly Bread, viz.</hi> the good things of this life, as upon the onely giver of them, so as neither to get nor keepe any of them, by any meanes which they know or feare to be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107281:4"/>
offensive unto God? How few desire in earnest to <hi>av<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yed temptation?</hi> Nay who almost is there, that takes not the Divells Office out of his hand and is not himselfe a tempter both to himselfe and others? Lastly who almost is there that desires heartily and above all things so much as the thing deserves to be delivered from the <hi>greatest evill,</hi> sinne, I meane, and the anger of God? Now beloved this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he that imployes not requisit industry, to obtaine what he pretends to desire, does not desire indeed, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pretends to do so: He that desires not what he prayes for, prayes with tongue only and not with his heart, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed does not pray to God, but play and dally with him. And yet this is all which men generally do, and therefore herein also accomplish this prophecy, <hi>having a forme of godlinesse but denying the power thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this were ill enough, were it in private, but we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse God Almighty also with our publike and solemne formalities, we make the Church a Stage whereon to act our parts and play our pageants, there we make a professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every day of <hi>confessing our sinnes with humble, lowly, and obedient hearts,</hi> and yet when we have talked after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, 20, 30, 40, yeares together, our hearts for the most part continue as proud, as impenitent, as disobedient as they were in the begining. We make great Protestations <hi>when we assemble and meet together to render thanks to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, for the benefits received at his hands;</hi> and if this were to be performed with words, with <hi>Hosann'as</hi> and <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> and <hi>gloria patri's</hi> and Psalmes and Hymnes, and such like outward matters, peradventure we should do it very suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently: but in the meane time with our lives and actions, we provoke the Almighty, and that to his face, with all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of greivous and bitter provocations; we do dayly and hourely such things as we know, and he hath assured
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:107281:5"/>
us to be odious unto him, and contrary to his nature; as any thing in the world is to the nature of any man in the world; and all this upon poore, trifling, triviall, no temptations. If a man whom you had dealt well with, should deale so with you, one whom ye had redeemed from the <hi>Turkish</hi> slavery, and instated in some indifferent good inheritance, should make you fine speeches, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine you with Panegyrickes, and have your prayses al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in his mouth, but all this while do nothing that pleases you, but upon all occasions, put all affronts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities upon you, would you say this were a thankfull man? Nay would you not make heaven and earth ring of his unthankfullnesse, and detest him almost as much for his faire speeches, as his foule actions. Beloved such is our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfullnesse to our God and Creatour, to our Lord and Saviour; our tongues ingeminate, and crie aloud <hi>Hosanna, Hosanna,</hi> but the lowder voice of our lives and actions is <hi>crucifie him crucifie him:</hi> We Court God Almighty, and complement with him, and professe to esteeme his service <hi>perfect freedome,</hi> but if any thing be to be done, much more if any thing be to be suffered for him, here we leave him, we bow the knee before him, and put a reed in his hand, and a Crowne upon his head, and crie, <hi>Haile King of the Iewes:</hi> But then with our Customary sinnes, we give him gall to eat, and vineger to drinke, we thrust a speare in his side, naile him to the Crosse, and Crucifie to our selves the Lord of Glory. This is not the Office of a friend to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile a dead freind with vaine lamentation. <hi>Sed quae volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit meminisse, quae mandaverit exequt,</hi> to remember what he desires, and execute what he commandes; so sayd a dying Roman to his freind, and so say I to you, To be thankfull to God is not to say, God be praysed, or, God be thanked, but to remember what he desires, and execute what he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107281:5"/>
commands, to be thankfull to God is certainely to love him, and to love him is to keepe his Commandements, so saith our Saviour <hi>Ioh. 19. If ye love me, keepe my Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements:</hi> if we doe so, we may justly pretend to thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which beleive mee is not a word, nor to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if we doe not so as generally we doe not, our talke of thankfullnesse is nothing else but meere talke, and we accomplish Saint <hi>Paules</hi> prophecy herein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: Having a forme of thankfullnesse, but not the reality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not the power of it.</p>
            <p>If I should reckon up unto you, how many direct lies every wicked man tells to God Allmighty as often as he sayes Amen, <hi>to this forme of godlinesse,</hi> which our Church hath prescribed, If I should present unto you all our acting of piety, and playing of humiliation, and personating of devotion in the Psalmes, the Letanies, the Collects, and generally in the whole service, I should be infinite: And therefore I have thought good to draw a vaile over a great part of our Hypocrisy, and to restraine the remainder of our discourse to the Contrariety betweene our profession and performance, onely in two things, I meane <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first for Faith, We professe, and indeed generally, because it is not safe to doe otherwise, that we beleive the Scripture to be true, and that it containes the plaine and onely way to infinite and eternall happinesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if we did generally beleeve what we do professe, if this were the language of our hearts as well as our tongues, how comes it to passe that the Study of it is so generally neglected? Let a booke that treates of the Philosophers stone, promise never so many mountaines of gold, &amp; even the restoring of the golden age againe, yet were it no mervaile if few should study it, and the reason is, because few would beleeve it.

But if there were a booke extant, and ordinary to be had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Bible is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which men did generally beleive to containe a plaine, and easy way for all men to become rich, and to live in health and pleasure, and this worlds happinesse, can any man imagine that this booke would be unstudied by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man? and why then should I not beleive, That if the Scripture were firmely and heartily beleived, the certaine and onely way to happinesse which is perfect and eternall, it would be studied by all men, with all diligence? Seeing therefore most Christians are so cold and negligent in the study of it, preferre all other businesse, all other pleasures before it, is there not great reason to feare that many who pretend to beleive it firmely, beleive it not at all, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weakely and faintly? If the Generall of an Army or an Embassadour to some Prince or State were assured by the King his Master, that the transgressing any point of his Commission should cost him his life, and the exact perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, be recompenced with as high a reward as were in the Kings power to bestow upon him can it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that any man who beleives this, and is in his right mind can be so supinely and stupidly negligent of this charge, which so much imports him, as to oversee through want of care any one necessary Article or part of his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: especially if it be delivered to him in writing, and at his pleasure to peruse it every day? Certainely this absurd negligence is a thing without example, and such as perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture will never happen to any sober man to the worlds end: and by the same reason, if we were firmely perswaded that this book doth indeed containe that charge and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, which infinitely more concernes us, it were not in reason possible, but that to such a perswasion, our care and diligence about it, should be in some measure answerable: seeing therefore most of us are so strangely carelesse, so
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107281:6"/>
grossely negligent of it, is there not great reason to feare, that though we have <hi>professors and protestors</hi> in aboundance, yet the faithfull, the truely and sincerely faithfull, are in a manner failed from the children of men. What but this can be the cause that men are so commonly ignorant of so many articles, and particular mandates of it, which yet are as manifest in it as if they were written with the beames of the Sun. For example; how few of our Ladies and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen, doe or will understand, that a voluptuous life, is damnable and prohibited to them? Yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith so very plainely; <hi>She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 6.</note> I beleive this case divinely regards not the Sex, He would say <hi>He</hi> as well as <hi>She,</hi> if there had beene occasion. Howfew of the Gallants of our time doe or will understand, that it is not lawfull for them to be as expensive and cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in apparell, as their meanes or perhaps their credit will extend unto? which is to sacrifice unto vanity, that which by the Law of Christ is due unto Charity; and yet the same Saint <hi>Paul</hi> forbids plainely this excesse even to women—<hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so let women</hi> (he would have said it much rather to the men) <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>array themselves in comely apparell, with shamefastnesse and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, not with embroidered haire, or gold, or pearles, or costly apparell;</hi> and to make our ignorance the more inexcusable, the very same rule is delivered by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> also, 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
            <p>How few rich men are or will be perswaded that the Law of Christ permits them not to heape up riches for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, nor perpetually to adde house to house, and land to land, though by lawfull meanes, but requires of them thus much charity at least, that ever while they are providing for their Wives and Children, they should out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease wherewith God blesseth their industry, allot the poore a just and free proportion? and when they have

And then on the other side they that maintaine the Kings righteous cause with the hazard of their lives and fortunes, but by their oathes and curses, by their drunkennesse, and debauchery, by their irreligion and prophannesse, fight more powerfully against their party, then by all other meanes they do or can fight for it, are not I feare very well acquainted with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the Bible, but that strict caution which properly concernes themselves in the booke of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> I much ddoubt they have scarce ever hard of it, <hi>When thou goest to warr with thine Enemies, then take heede there be no wicked thing in thee,</hi> not onely no wickednesse in the cause thou maintainest, nor no wickednesse in the meanes by which thou maintainest it, but no personall impieties in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that maintaine it.

But now for the third part of the caution, that, to deale ingeniously with you, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my owne soule, if I cannot other mens, that I cannot thinke of with halfe so much comfort as the former; but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107281:9"/>
seeing so many <hi>Ionasses</hi> imbarqued in the same ship, the same cause with us, and so many <hi>Achan's</hi> entering into Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with us against the <hi>Cananites,</hi> seeing Publicanes and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners on the one side, against Scribes and Pharisees on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; on the one side Hypocrisy, on the other prophanesse; no honesty nor justice on the one side, and very little pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the other; On the one side horrible oathes, curses, and blasphemies; On the other pestilentlyes, calumnies, and perjury: When I see amongst them the pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, if not the desire, pursued by Antichristian, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan, devillish meanes; and amongst us little or no zeale for reformation of what is indeed amisse, little or no care to remove the cause of Gods anger towards us, by iust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lawfull, and Christian meanes; I professe plainely I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without trembling consider what is likely to be the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of these distractions; I cannot but feare that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our cause may sinke under the burthen of our sins: And that God in his justice, because we will not suffer his Judgements to atcheive their prime scope and intention, which is our amendment and reformation, may either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us up to the blind zeale and fury of our Enemies, or else, which I rather feare, make us instruments of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice each against other, and of our owne just and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved confusion. This I professe plainely is my feare, and I would to God it were likewise the feare of every Souldier in His Majesties Army; but that which increaseth my feare is, that I see very many of them have very little or none at all: I meane not that they are fearelesse towards their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, (that's our joy and Triumph) but that they shew their courage even against God, and feare not him, whom it is madnesse not to feare. Now from whence can their not fearing him proceed; but from their not knowing him, their not knowing his will and their owne duty? not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107281:9"/>
knowing how highly it concernes Souldiers above other professions to be religious, and then if ever when they are engaged in dangerous adventures, and every moment have their lives in their hands, <hi>When they go to warre with their Enemies, then to take heed there be no wicked thing in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beloved, how many instances and examples I have given you of our grosse ignorance of what is necessary &amp; easie for us to know, &amp; to these it were no difficult matter to adde more. Now from whence can this ignorance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, but from supine negligence? and from whence this negligence, but from our not beleiving what we pretend to beleive? For did we beleive firmly and heartily, that this Booke were given us by God for the rule of our Actions, and that obedience to it were the certaine and only way to eternall happinesse, it were impossible we should be such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to our selves, such Traytors to our owne soules, as not to search it at least with so much diligence, that no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary point of our duty plainely taught in it could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly escape us. But it is certaine, and apparent to all the world, that the greatest part of Christians, through grosse and willfull negligence remaine utterly ignorant of many necessary points of their duty to God, and man: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is much to be feared, that this booke, and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Christ contained in it, among an infinite of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, labours with great penury of true beleivers.</p>
            <p>It were an easie matter (if the time would permit) to present unto you many other demonstrations of the same conclusion; but to this drawne from our willing ignorance of that which is easie and necessary for us to know, I will content my selfe to adde only one more taken, from our voluntary and presumptuous neglect to do those things which we know and acknowledge to be necessary.</p>
            <p>If a man should say unto me that it concernes him as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107281:10"/>
much as his life is worth, to go presently to such a place, and that he knowes but one way to it, and I should see him stand still or go some other way, had I any reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive that this man beleives himselfe? <hi>Quid Verba audiam, cum facta videam,</hi> saith he in the Comedy, <hi>Protestatio contra factum non valet,</hi> sayeth the Law, and why should I beleive, that, that man beleives obedience to Christ the only way to present and eternall happinesse, whom I see wittingly, and willingly, and constantly, and customarily to disobay him? The time was that we all knew that the King could reward those that did him service, and punish those that did him dis-service, and then all men were ready to obay his Commands, and he was a rare man that durst do any thing to his face that offended him. Beloved, if we did but beleive in God, so much as most Subjects do in their King, did we as verily beleive, that God could and would make us perfectly happy if we serve him, though all the world conspire to make us miserable, and that he could and would make us miserable if we serve him not, though all the world should conspire to make us happy, how were it possible that to such a faith our lives should not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable? Who was there ever so madly in love with a present penny, as to runn the least hazard of the losse of 10000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> a yeare to gaine it, or not readily to part with it upon any probable hope or light perswasion, much more a firme beleife that by doing so he should gaine 100000<hi rend="sup">ls</hi>, Now beloved the happinesse which the servants of Christ are promised in the Scripture, we all pretend to beleeve, that it exceeds the conjunction of all the good things of the world, and much more such a portion as we may possibly enjoy, infinitly more then 10000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> a yeare, or 100000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> doth a penny; for 100000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> is but a penny so many times over, and 10000<hi rend="sup">l</hi> a yeare is worth but a certaine number of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107281:10"/>
pence, but betweene heaven and earth, betweene finite and infinite, betweene eternity and a moment, there is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly no proportion, and therefore seeing we are so apt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trifling occasions, to hazard this heaven for this earth, this infinite for this finite, this all for this nothing, is it not much to be feared, that though many of us pretend to much faith, we have indeed very little or none at all? The summe of all which hath beene spoken concerning this point is this. Were we firmely perswaded that obedience to the Gospell of Christ, is the true and only way to present and eternall happinesse, (without which faith no man living can be justified) then the innate desire of our owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse could not but make us studious inquirers of the will of Christ, and conscionable performers of it; But there are (as experience shewes) very few, who make it their care and businesse to know the will of Christ, and of those few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, very many, who make no conscience at all of doing what they know: therefore though they professe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test they have faith, yet their protestations are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded against their actions, but we may safely and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably conclude what was to be concluded, That the Doctrine of Christ amongst an infinite of professors, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with great scarcity of true, and serious, and hearty beleevers, and that herein also we accomplish St. <hi>Pauls</hi> prediction, <hi>having a forme of godlinesse, but denying &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps the truth and reality of our repentance may make some kind of satisfaction to God Almighty for our hypocriticall dallying with him in all the rest; truly I should be heartily glad it were so: but I am so farre from being of this faith, that herein I feare we are most of all hypocriticall, and that the generallity of professors is so farre from a reall practise of true repentance, that scarce one in an hundred understands truly what itis.</p>
            <p>Some satisfie themselves with a bare confession and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107281:11"/>
either that they are sinners in generall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that they have committed such and such sinnes in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which acknowledgement comes not yet from the heart of a great many, but only from their lipps and tongues: For how many are there that do rather complaine and murmure that they are sinners, then acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it? and make it upon the matter rather their unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and misfortune, then their true fault, that they are so? such are all they who impute all their commissions of evill to the unavoydable want of <hi>restraini<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

All such as lay all their faults upon <hi>Adam</hi> and say with those rebellious Israelites (whom God assures that they neither had nor should have just reason to say so) <hi>That their Fathers had eaten sowre grapes, and their teeth were set on edge.</hi> Lastly all such as lay all their sinnes upon <hi>divine prescience, and prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination,</hi> saying with their tongues, O what wretched sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have we beene, but in their hearts how could we help it, we were predestinate to it, we could not do otherwise.</p>
            <p>All such as seriously so perswade themselves, and thinke to hide nakednesse with such figg leaves as these, can no more be sayd to acknowledge themselves guilty of a fault, then a man that is borne blinde or lame, with the stone or gout can accuse himselfe of any fault for being borne so; well may such a one complaine and bemone himselfe, and say, O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this unhappinesse! but such a complaint is as farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a true acknowledgement of any fault, as a bare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of a fault is farre from true repentance:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107281:11"/>
for to confesse a fault is to acknowledge, that freely and willingly, without any constraint, or unavoydable neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, we have transgressed the law of God, it being <hi>in our power by Gods grace</hi> to have done otherwise. To aggravate this fault is to confesse we have done so when we might easily have avoyded it, and had no great nor violent temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to it; to pretend any great difficulty in the matter is to excuse and extenuate it: but to say that all things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it was absolutely impossible for you to avoyd it, is flatly to deny it. Others there are that thinke they have done enough, if to confession of sinne they adde some sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for it; if when the present fit of sinne is past, and they are returned to themselves, the sting remaining breed some remorse of conscience, some complaints against their wickednesse and folly for having done so, and some inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to forsake it, though vanishing and ineffectuall. These heate-dropps, this morning dew of sorrow, though it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vanish, and they returne to their sinne againe upon the next temptation <hi>as a dogg to his vomit</hi> when the pang is over, yet in the pauses betweene, while they are in their good moode, they conceive themselves to have very true, and very good repentance; so that if they should have the good fortune to be taken away in one of these <hi>Intervalla,</hi> one of these sober moodes, they should certainly be saved; which is just as if a man in a quartane Ague, or the stone, or goute, should thinke himselfe ridd of his disease as oft as he is out of his fitt.</p>
            <p>But if repentance were no more but so; how could St. <hi>Paul</hi> have truly sayd, <hi>that godly sorrow worketh repentance?</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <note place="margin">1 Cor 7. 10.</note> man knowes that nothing can worke it selfe. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect is not the house which he builds, The Father is not the Son which he begets, the Tradesman is not the worke which he makes, and therefore if sorrow, godly sorrow,

            <p>To this purpose it is worth the observing that when the Scripture speakes of that kind of repentance, which is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorrow for something done, and wishing it undone, it constantly useth the word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107281:16"/>
who miscall not presumptuous and deliberate Sinnes by the name of imperfections; but seriously and truly endeavour to be perfect; onely I forewarne you that you must never looke to be admitted to the wedding feast of the Kings Son, either in the impure raggs of any customary sinne, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>wedding garment</hi> of Christian holinesse; onely I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne you that whosoever lookes to be made partaker of the joyes of heaven, must make it the cheife, if not the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly businesse of his life, to know the Will of God and to doe it; that <hi>great violence</hi> is required by our Saviour for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Kingdome, that the race we are to run is a long race, the building we are to erect is a great building, &amp; will hardly, very hardly be finished in a day, that the worke we have to doe of mortifying all vices; and acquiring all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian vertues, is a long worke; we may easily deferre it too long, we cannot possibly begin it too soone. Onely I would perswade you, and I hope I have done, that that repentance which is not effectuall to true and timely conversion will never be available unto eternall salvation. And if I have proved unto you that this is indeed the nature of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, then certainely I have proved withall, that that repentance wherewith the generality of Christians content themselves, notwithstanding their great professions what they are, and their glorious protestations of what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be, is not the <hi>power</hi> but the <hi>forme;</hi> not the truth but the shadow of true repentance, and that herein also we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> prediction, having a <hi>forme of godlinesse, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>And now what remaines but that (as I said in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,) I should humbly intreat and earnestly exhort every man that hath heard mee this day, to confute in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar what I have proved true in the generall. To take care that the sinne of formality, though it be the sinne of our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107281:16"/>
times, may yet not be the sinne of our persons, that we sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy not our selves with the shadowes of Religion, without the substance of it, nor with the <hi>forme of godlinesse</hi> without the <hi>power</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>To this purpose I shall beseech you to consider, that though sacrificing, burning incense, celebrating of set fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivalls, praying, fasting, and such like, were under the Law, the service of God commanded by himselfe, yet whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they proceeded not from, nor were joyned with the sincerity of an honest heart, he professeth frequently almost in all the Prophets, not onely his scorne and contempt of them all, as fond, empty, and ridiculous; but also his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, loathing, and detesting of them as abominable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Sacrifice of the wicked is abomination to God,</hi> Prov. 15. 8. <hi>What have I to doe with the multitude of your Sacrifices? saith the Lord,</hi> Esay the first, <hi>I am full of the burnt offerings of Rammes, and of the fat of fed heasts, when ye come to appeare before mee, who required this at your hands? Bring no more vaine oblations: Incense is an abomination to mee, I cannot suffer your new moones, nor sabbaths, nor solemne dayes, it is iniquity even your solemne assemblies: My soule hateth your new moones, and your appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted feasts, they are a burthen to me, I am weary to beare them; and when you shall stretch out your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you, and though you make many prayers I will not beare, for your hands are full of bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And againe <hi>Isa. 66. 3. He that kills an Oxe is as if he slew a man, he that sacrificeth a Lambe as if he cut off a Doggs necke, he that offereth an oblation as if he offered Swines flesh, he that burned incense, as if he blessed an Idol;</hi> and what's the reason of this strange aversion of God from his owne Ordinances? it followes in the next words, <hi>they have chosen their owne wayes, and their soule delighteth in their abominations.</hi>

Terrible are the words which he speaketh to the same purpose in the prophecy of <hi>Amos</hi> chap. 5. v. 21, 22, 23. <hi>I hate, I despise your feast dayes, and I will not smell in your so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne assemblies, though you offer me burnt offerings and meate offerings, I will not accept  them, nor will I regard your peace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi>

            <p>Now beloved, if this hypocrisie, this resting in outward performances, were so odious to God under the law, a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion full of shadowes, and ceremonies, certainely it will be much more odious to do so under the Gospell, a religion of much more simplicity, and exacting so much the greater sincerity of the heart, even because it disburdens the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man of the performance of Legall rites and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances. And therefore if we now under the Gospell, shall thinke to delude God Allmighty, as <hi>Micholl</hi> did <hi>Saul,</hi> with an Idoll hand somely drest instead of the true <hi>David.</hi> If we shall content and please our selves, with being of such or such a Sect or profession, with going to Church, saying, or hearing of Prayers, receiving of Sacraments, hearing, repeating or preaching of Sermons, with zeale for Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or zeale against them, or indeed with any thing besides constant piety towards God, Loyalty and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards our Soveraigne, justice and charity towards all our Neighbours, temperance, chastity, and sobriety towards our selves, certainely we shall one day find, that we have not mocked God, but our selves, and that our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among hypocrites shall be greater, then theirs.</p>
            <p>In the next place let mee intreat you to consider the fearfull judgement which God hath particularly threatned to this very sinne of <hi>drawing nigh unto him with our lipps, when our hearts are farre from him:</hi> It is the great judgement of being given over to <hi>the spirit of slumber and security,</hi> the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all forerunner of speedy desolation and destruction, as we
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107281:17"/>
may see in the 29 <hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>Esaiah,</hi> from the 9 to the 14 <hi>vers. Stay your selves and wonder, cry ye ont, and cry, they are drunken but not with wine, they stagger but not with strong drinke: for the Lord hath powred out upon you the spirit of deepe sleepe, and hath closed your eyes. The prophets, and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.</hi> and after, at the 14 <hi>vers The wisedome of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hidde.</hi> Certainely this judgement if ever it were upon any people, we have cause to feare it is now upon us. For if the spirit of <hi>deepe sleepe</hi> were not upon us, how could we sleepe so securely even upon the brinke of the pit of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? how could we proceed on so confidently in our mirth and jollity, nay in our crying sinnes and horrible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, now when the hand of God is upon us, and wrath is gone out &amp; even ready to consume us? &amp; if the wisdome of our wise men were not perished, how were it possible they should so obstinately refuse the security offered of our lawes, liberties, and religion by the Kings Oath, by his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations on himselfe, and his posterity in case he should vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate it, by the oathes of all his Ministers not to consent to or be instruments in such a violation, by the so much desir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Trienniall Parliament,</hi> from which no transgressor can possibly be secure; and instead of all this security, seeke for it by a civill warre, the continuance whereof must bring us to destruction and desolation, or else he hath deceived us by whom we are taught. <hi>That a Kingdome divided against it selfe cannot stand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what was the sinne which provoked this fearefull judgement? What but that which I have laboured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of, and to disswade you from, even the sinne of hypocrisy; as we may see at the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verse: <hi>Wherefore saith
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107281:18"/>
the Lord, for as much a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> this people draw neare me with their mouth, and with their lips doe honour mee, but have removed their heart farre from mee; and their feare towards mee is taught by the precepts of men, therefore behold I will proceed to doe a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailous worke amongst them: for the wisedome of their wise men shall perish, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider Thirdly what woes, &amp; woes, &amp; woes our Saviour thunders out against the Scribes and Pharisees for their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy, <hi>Woe be unto you Scribes, and Pharisees Hypocrites,</hi> and againe and againe, <hi>Woe be unto you Scribes, and Pharisees, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites:</hi> Beloved if we be hypocrites as they were, <hi>Tith mint and Cumin, and neglect the weighty matters of the Law, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and justice and mercy,</hi> as they did: <hi>Make long prayers, and under a pretence devoure Widowes houses,</hi> as they did; <hi>Wash the outside of the dish and platter, while within we are full of ravening and wickednesse,</hi> write Gods Commandements very large and faire upon our <hi>Phylacteries,</hi> but shut them quite out of their hearts: <hi>Build the Sepulchres of the old Prophets, and kill their successors,</hi> in fine, if we be like <hi>painted Sepulchres</hi> as they were, <hi>outwardly garnished and beautifull, but within full of dead mens bones and rottennesse,</hi> wee are then to make accompt that all these woes belong to us, and will one day over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take us.</p>
            <p>Consider lastly the terrible example of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira,</hi> and how they were snatcht away in the very act of their sinne, and that their fault was (as the Text tells us) that they lyed unto God. Beloved, we have done so a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand thousand times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our whole lives (if sincerely exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) would appeare, I feare, little lesse but a perpetuall lye; hitherto God hath beene mercifull to us, and given us time to repent, but let us not proceed still in imitating their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:107281:18"/>
fact: lest at length we be made partakers of their fall.</p>
            <p>God of his infinite mercy prevent this in every one of us, even for his Sonne our Saviour Jesus Christ's sake; by whom and with whom, in the unity of the holy Spirit, be all honour and glory to the eternall Father world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end:</p>
            <closer>Amen.</closer>
