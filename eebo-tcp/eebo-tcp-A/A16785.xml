            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that haue been raiſed in vvhat

vvas for pretended treaſons, ſeditions,
diſturbances, diſobedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, and vndue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnes

vvhich is not repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to any lavvful

               <p>Therfore vvhat ſtatutes ſo euer they

vvhich haue no affinitie in nature and
condition, by the lavv of God or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:23255:74"/>
Nations, Chriſtian or Heathen, to the

diſturba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is but to ſeeke mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to haue the bloud of innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men,
that neuer committed treaſons nor treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
againſt any Prince or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvealth:
it is to make our liues and
deaths odious, and the true cauſes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
vnknovven to the vvorld, baptizing
that by the name of treaſon and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
vvhich is mere matter of religion,
ſoul, and conſcience.</p>
               <p>Vvhat hath Maſſe, Matins, Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
Abſolution, beades, Agnuſdeies,
and other conſecrated tokens of our
communion vvith al the Churches of
Chriſt through al ages, vvhat affinitie
haue they in nature vvith treaſon? Sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
they not in al Nations round about
you vvith the high duety and loyaltie
that belongeth to Princes? is there any
definition or deſcription of that treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:23255:75"/>
vvhich can of reaſon include the
premiſſes, or proue them treaſons? And
though the lavves may make things
treaſon, vvhich before vvere not, yet in
making them ſo, conſideration is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaies
had of the qualitie and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition
of the faultes and offenſes. For, as to
make the ſaying of Diuine ſeruice after
the rites of the Catholike Church, to
be Simonie, vſurie, felony, or aduou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
vvere ridiculous and impoſsible: ſo
it is impoſsible to make theſe matters
of mere religion, in true and proper fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,
the offenſe of treaſon or diſloyaltie
to the Prince or Commonvvealth.</p>
               <p>Neither doth euery commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of the Soueraine (though in things
lavvful) not fulfilled, make the offenſe
treaſonable: much leſſe, either vvhen
it concerneth matters, merely repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
to Gods vvord and our dueties to the
Diuine Maieſtie, as it did in Daniels
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:23255:75"/>
and the Three childrens caſe:<note place="margin">Dan. 3.</note> or in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
not truely ſubiect to any temporal
King or his lavves. For, if ſuch a Prince
ſhould make the like lavv that Darius
did,<note place="margin">Dan. 6.</note> That no man ſhould pray to any
God, other then him ſelf, for certaine
daies: al the lavves in the vvorld can not
make the refuſant a traitour, nor bound
to obey, more then Daniel vvas then:
not onely becauſe lavves euidently
vniuſt and againſt God, may not be
obeied: but for that the prayer to the
true God, and ſeruing him, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to any duety that the ſubiect
ovveth to his Soueraine, by Gods lavv
or nature: and therfore can not be made
treaſon in true and proper ſpeach. The
Churches holy Sacrifice, Seruice, and
Sacraments, and conſecration or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of creatures by the vvord of God
and prayer, haue no qualitie or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of treaſon or crime againſt the
<pb facs="tcp:23255:76"/>
maieſtie of the Prince, or the repoſe of
the people.</p>
               <p>But if in making ſuch factes treaſon,
the meaning be nothing els, but to
make them puniſhable by death and
othervviſe, as treaſons by the ſtatutes of
the Realme are and ought to be: then
haue vve the pitifulleſt iniurie in the
vvorld, that bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g no traitours in deede,
yet vve muſt ſuffer the ignominie and
paines of treaſon: and ſo much the
greater, that it is done by pretenſe of
lavves, and publike authoritie, then if it
vvere done (as it hath been in Holland,
Zeland, and ſome part of France) by
barbarous crueltie of Heretikes, the
Prince and Commonvvealth not agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therevnto.</p>
               <p>For it is a greuous ſinne, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable,
vvhen a vvhole State agreeth
vpon any iniquitie. And vve think
verily, God vvould haue taken ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23255:76"/>
vpon our poore Countrie, if
her Ma.<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> of great clemencie had not
ſtaied the execution of ſo vniuſt and
intolerable diſorders: though diuers
mo then her Highnes knovveth of,
haue fealt the extreme ſmart therof in
moſt cruel ſort: God turne his iuſt ire
from vs for the ſame.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing a ſtaffe is eaſily found to
beat a dogge, and vvith lions, eares be
often hornes, and ſuch caſes of religion
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience muſt needes be ſo extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely
puniſhed: Vvhy do they reduce
our offenſe rather to Treaſon, then to
Hereſie? If our doctrine be vvicked, our
actions ſuperſtitious, our vvorſhip of
God ſacrilegious, idololatrical, or any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe
vntrue or vnlavvful:vvhy are vve
not condemned of ſuch crimes, rather
then of treaſon or vnduetifulnes to our
Prince? for if they be faultes, they are
directly againſt Gods honour, and but
<pb facs="tcp:23255:77"/>
indirectly and conſequently againſt the
Prince.</p>
               <p>But for the better enterance into Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſme,
and entertaining the ſame, the
old lavves peraduenture for puniſhing
Heretikes, vvere repelled: or becauſe
they can not ſo eaſily determine, vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vve be Heretikes, or our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
vvho haue been dubbed vvith that
name ſo long by the lavves both ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

vvhich alſo yeld vs (the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts

both the name of Catholike, vvhich
vvith S.<note place="margin">Cont. ep. Fund. c. 4.</note> Auguſtine vveighed ſo much,
and al the properties and preſcriptions

they thought it a neerer vvay to make
vs traitours, then Heretikes, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
vs for pretenſed fedition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie,
then for errour in doctrine, or

authoritie to the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to determine together vvith their
Conuocation of the Clergie, vvhat is an
errour or an hereſie:yet it is not like they
vvil agree of any ſuch thing ſhortly.</p>
               <p>This alſo being a common thing in
times of errour and diſorder, to make
the fault committed, or ſaid to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt the Prince, greater and more
puniſhable, then the offenſe done dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
againſt God: againſt the Common.
vvealth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the Church: againſt
the body, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the ſoul: more a do
about Caeſars tribute, then Gods due: as
both in al other things, and in the very
title of Supremacie is plaine. Vvhere the

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23255:78"/>
And in that caſe it muſt needes ſo be:
the crovvne being not a ſpiritual digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but a temporal: the perſon of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
not ſpiritual, but temporal: the Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

vvhich our Aduerſaries them ſelues can

that Realme (vvherof, ſo God ſaue our

not be iuſtly attributed but to the firſt

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:23255:102"/>
ſociety of the Catholike Church and
kingdoms.</p>
               <p>Hereof proceedeth the multitude of
nevv Sectes, directly tending to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance

Vvhich Sectes in this caſe muſt needes

can hardly be diſcouered: and, by the

               <p>Catholikes abhorred theſe mutations

or dangerous to the Politie.</p>
               <p>And maruel it is in our eies, that
