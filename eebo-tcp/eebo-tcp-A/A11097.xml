            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Of famous Doctors, do applaud these three:</l>
               <l>First, <hi>Doctor Dyet,</hi> a right sober man,</l>
               <l>That nere disorderd courses ran:</l>
               <l>But keepes such rules as nature holdeth good,</l>
               <l>For to preuent corruption of the bloud.</l>
               <l>He is no glutton, with the filthy swine,</l>
               <l>Nor drownes his wits, as drunkards do with Wine:</l>
               <l>But by his temperate carriage liueth long,</l>
               <l>Keeping an able body, sound, and stronge.</l>
               <l>Next <hi>Doctor Quiet,</hi> of a modest life,</l>
               <l>That alwayes doth auoyde contentious strife,</l>
               <l>He enters not into the swagg'ring fits,</l>
               <l>With those whom rage depriueth of their wits.</l>
               <l>For euery light occasion to contend,</l>
               <l>Not caring whom it bee (with foe or friend)</l>
               <l>To vexe himselfe, in fretfull furyes rage,</l>
               <l>For all these passions he can well aswage:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16717:3"/>Whereby he keepes himselfe in perfect health,</l>
               <l>Esteeming more of that, then <hi>Cressus</hi> wealth.</l>
               <l>The third is Doctor <hi>Merry-man:</hi> whose dyet</l>
               <l>Doth keepe himselfe, and all his friends in quiet,</l>
               <l>With disposition of a pleasant sort,</l>
               <l>And men of wit will vnto him resort:</l>
               <l>To driue away dull melancholy mind,</l>
               <l>Which to a madding frenzy is inclynd:</l>
               <l>This <hi>Doctor,</hi> honest recreation vseth,</l>
               <l>And such iests as are here, he often chuseth:</l>
               <l>Not to offend, but like <hi>Democritus</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That laugh't at th' <hi>Athenians,</hi> he doth thus;</l>
               <l>He makes but merry with some shallow braynes,</l>
               <l>And smyles at many in their knauish vaines:</l>
               <l>And if that any discontenment grow,</l>
               <l>Tis not his fault, but theirs that take it so.</l>

                  <l>Great Satchell scrips, that shut with leather flaps,</l>
                  <l>And each a Dogge to eate his Maysters scraps.</l>
                  <l>Theyr shooes were Hob-naile proofe, soundly bepegg'd,</l>
                  <l>Wrap't well with clouts, to keepe them warmer legg'd:</l>
                  <l>Sayes one to to'ther, come, hange care, lets drinke,</l>
                  <l>Our trade is better then a number thinke:</l>
                  <l>For I, my wife, and Iacke, ply vp and downe</l>
                  <l>To make our ery day, worth halfe a Crowne.</l>
                  <l>Most townes in <hi>Flanders,</hi> I haue learn'd to name,</l>
                  <l>And am a poore distressed Souldier lame.</l>
                  <l>And sometimes I their charityes desire,</l>
                  <l>Like one hath lost all that he had by fire:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="tcp:16717:24"/>Fire (quoth t'other) come along mad knaue,</l>
                  <l>Lets go where we some watering place may haue.</l>
                  <l>Wher's the best Beere to giue a man content?</l>
                  <l>I haue a penny that was neuer spent.</l>
                  <l>And twenty slaues, I Gentlemen did name,</l>
                  <l>Before I could be mayster of the same:</l>
                  <l>To many an Asse I do <hi>the worship</hi> giue,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>With Lord preserue your goodnesse while you liue:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Now <hi>Iesus</hi> prosper you by Sea and Land,</l>
                  <l>And blesse you Maister, all you take in hand.</l>
                  <l>God keepe your limbs, and Lord increase your store,</l>
                  <l>I eate no bread to day, (but dranke the more.)</l>
                  <l>For <hi>Christ</hi> his sake, make this same vp a penny,</l>
                  <l>Thus do I angle Siluer out of many;</l>
                  <l>I, when I haue it for my speaking faire,</l>
                  <l>If he were hang'd that gaue it, I neare care.</l>
                  <l>The other Begger laugh't, and did reply,</l>

                     <hi>Roger,</hi> of that same humour right am I.</l>

                  <l>And vnto any knaue such words alow;</l>
                  <l>I will not want that till my tongue do frayle,</l>
                  <l>But preethee come, let vs go find this Ale.</l>
                  <l>I am as dry, as euer was March-dust,</l>
                  <l>And heres a groat I meane to spend it iust:</l>
                  <l>Well sayd old <hi>Tom</hi> (sayes tother) if thou do,</l>
                  <l>My groat shall go, and my <hi>Tobacco</hi> too.</l>
                  <l>Although a Beggers creadit be not great,</l>
                  <l>We will be Gentlemen in our conceit:</l>
                  <l>I thinke my selfe as good a man each way,</l>
                  <l>As he that goes in Veluet er'y day.</l>
                  <l>Weele spend a Crowne, and drinke carowses round,</l>
                  <l>Before some Churles are worth ten thousand pound:</l>
                  <l>Ther's nothing but a payre of stocks we feare,</l>
