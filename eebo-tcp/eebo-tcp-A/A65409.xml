            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN one reflects upon the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Conduct of the Late King <hi>Iames</hi>
both before and after his Accession
to the Crown, and the dismal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
thereof to these Three
Kingdoms, and at last to himself, I
cannot but regret the Fate of those
Princes, that abandon their true Interest, Reason,
Conscience and Honour, to <hi>Iesuitick</hi> Councils, and
enslave themselves to a Party, justly abominated by
the better part of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church it self, for their
gross Encroachments upon Religion, Morality, and all
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106558:4"/>
that's Sacred among men. When I look back to the
many Tragedies acted by that Fraternity, both in this,
and the last Age, scarce a Kingdom or State in <hi>Europe,</hi>
where their Villanies have not come up to the utmost
reach of depraved Nature: When I call to mind the
Horrid Desolations, Murders and Wars, they have been
instrumental of, in the most remote parts of the
World; witness some Millions of Souls in <hi>Iapan,</hi> and
other parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> sacrific'd not many Years ago, to
their Ambition and Intrigues, under the Notion of
propagating the Catholick Faith; I say, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
all these things, I am the less surprized with the
dismal Effects of their Councils in <hi>England,</hi> since the
same Fate attends them every where. But I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
That among all the Martyrs to <hi>Loyola</hi>'s Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
there is none more justly claims our Compassion,
than the Late King <hi>Iames.</hi> To see a Prince, naturally
of no bad Temper, imposed upon by these zealous
Bigots, to trample upon the Religion and Liberties of
His People, contrary to Fundamental Laws, and the
most solemn Promises and Oaths, under the false Mask
of Piety and Zeal to the Catholick Faith, and at length
to find him seduc'd to abandon His Kingdoms, and
thereby an absolute necessity put upon the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives
of the People, to fill up His Throne, vacated
by His own Fault, is a Subject that naturally displays
the vanity of human Greatness. And I may add,
That the unaccountable Doctrine of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi>
as it was the Source of a great many Mischiefs among
our selves, so what has befallen that King, may be
partly imputed to it; for the believing, That without
controul he might do what he pleas'd, encourag'd him
to take such measures as have brought upon him all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106558:4"/>
his Misfortunes. I cannot but at the same time repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to my self, with that emotion of mind the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
Passenger looks back upon the devouring
Billows he has lately escap'd, the dismal Scene of Ruin
that so lately threatned us, and that Abyss of Misery
we had certainly been plung'd into e're now, if his
present Majesty had not opportunely delivered us from
the very Jaws of Death and Ruin.</p>
            <p>That any of the Protestant Perswasion at home,
should be sound Repiners at this mighty Deliverance, is
in my humble opinion, an unaccountable piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
and Weakness at once; When all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
States abroad, look upon this great Revolution
in <hi>Brittain,</hi> as the most happy Providence that has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
on the Theatre of <hi>Europe</hi> this Century of Years.
The late mighty Enterprize of His Majesty, was the
Result of the united Consultations of all the Foreign
Protestant States and Princes in this part of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
who setled upon it, as the last Cast of the Dye,
for their Religion and Liberty; and with a trembling
Expectation, made Vows to Almighty God, for the
Success of an Attempt, they wisely soresaw, carried
in its Womb, the Fate not only of these Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
but of all the Reformed Churches of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Heaven had smil'd upon this stupendious
Attempt, and had beyond the usual Tract of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
vouchsafed us a Deliverance scarce equal'd in
the Records of Time, Who would have imagin'd that
<hi>England</hi> should produce such a sort of Monsters, as seem
to be in love with Slavery and Ruin, the necessary
Consequences of their Folly? And that there are such a
sort of Men, we have a plain Demonstration in these
unhappy Wretches that have so industriously dispers'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106558:5"/>
through this great City, that Paper called, <hi>King</hi>
James <hi>His Declaration to all His Loving
Subjects in the Kingdom of</hi> England. A Paper,
I could have wish'd for King <hi>Iames</hi>'s own Honour had
been buried in Eternal Oblivion, since it contains a
heap of Falsities, that was below a Prince to affirm,
and which are known to be so, by no fewer than the
people of Three Kingdoms. In giving my Reflections
upon this Declaration, the Respect due to one that
was lately a Crowned Head, with some other just
motives, obliges me to do it with more reservedness
than perhaps such a Paper deserves; and instead of
a needless exposing a Prince, that has His Honour too
much sunk already, in the eyes of all <hi>Europe,</hi> I shall
with all the Calmness and Candor possible, examine
the Declaration it self, without Reflections upon the
Prince whose it is; and shall not omit one single Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in it, that can be interpreted even by Himself,
of any Consequence.</p>
            <p>Thus His Declaration begins, <hi>Altho the many
Calumnies and dismal Stories, by which
Our Enemies have endeavoured to render Us
and Our Government odious to the World,
do now appear to have been advanc'd by them,
not only without any ground, but against
their own certain Knowledg; as is evident
by their not daring to attempt the proving
these Charges to the World, which we cannot
but hope, hath open'd the eyes of Our good
Subjects, to see how they have been imposed
upon by designing men, who to promote their
own Ambitious Ends, care not what Slavery
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106558:5"/>
they reduce Our Kingdoms to.</hi> It seems King
<hi>IAMES</hi> continues in His wonted road, of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
wrong measures both of Persons and Actions,
which has been the occasion of all His Misfortunes.
When he talks of his Enemies, that have rendred him
and his Government odious to the World, He mistakes
himself, if he means those Worthy Patriots, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
weary of his insupportable Incroachments upon
the Religious and Civil Liberties of these Nations,
did lend a hand, to deliver themselves and Fellow-subjects
from a Ruine that seem'd almost inevitable.
But if He had been at the pains to make an impartial
Survey of his own Actings, and the pernicious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of a sort of Men about him, He might easily come
to know, That His only and real Enemies were those
Popish Emissaries, that valued not how much His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
suffer'd, nor His Crown were indanger'd, if so
be they might bring about their own hidden Designs;
and were willing to sacrifice both Him, and His Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
to their own by-ends Never Prince was so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
in His Cabinet-Councel as He; and that <hi>false
light</hi> which led Him to imploy none about Him, with
any intimacy of confidence, but those of His own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion,
prov'd an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> that cheated Him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Paths never trod by any of His Predecessors, but
to their destruction. If He had been so happy, as to
have continued in His most Secret Councels a great
many Persons of the Reform'd Religion, whom He
kept at a distance, though to amuse the Nation He
allowed them the empty Names of Privy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors;
He had not brought three Kingdoms to the brink
of Ruine, nor upon Himself so hard a fate. Yet I
must acknowledge some part of the obligation we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106558:6"/>
have to these Gentlemen, that of late had the sole
conduct of King <hi>IAMES</hi> His Affairs; For in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Him such Counsels as His greatest Enemies could
have wish'd Him, they prov'd the occasion of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at this day happy under the Auspicious Reign of
Their Majesties, being Princes of the same Religion
and Interests with Their People; And we may justly
say, as <hi>Themistocles</hi> of old, <hi>We had undoubtedly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd,
if we had not perish'd.</hi> How little is King <hi>Iames</hi>
oblig'd to His Secretary that penn'd this Declaration,
since he so foolishly rakes up the Remembrance of
those things that made Him and His Government
odious to the World, by the names of Calumnies and
Stories, which it was so much his Master's Interest
to bury in silence? Good God! Were the late pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
and baresac'd Incroachments upon the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Laws of the Nation, but Calumnies? Were
the open Violations of Solemn Oaths, Promises and
Ingagements, but Stories? Does King <hi>IAMES,</hi> or
His <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Councellors imagine, that we have
so soon forgot His <hi>Promises made in Council</hi> not many
hours after His Brother's Death, and his conspicuous
Breaches of them not many months thereafter? Can we
allow our selves to forget, that all the Trusts both in
<hi>Court, Bench, and the Army,</hi> were fill'd up with these very
Men, whom Reiterated Laws had rendred incapable
of them? Was a <hi>Person's sitting at the Council-board,</hi>
whose very being found in <hi>England</hi> was death by the
Law, but a mere Calumny? Can a few months be able
to obliterate the Memory of that Affair of <hi>Magdalen
Colledge,</hi> one of the most open Invasions of Property
that could be? Have we lost the Remembrance of
that Illegal <hi>Ecclesiastical Court,</hi> and the Tyrannick
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106558:6"/>
Judgments past therein? Have we not seen a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Prelate</hi> suspended from his Function, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
because he would not do what he could not,
that is, for not condemning a man unheard?
Have not we seen Seven of the <hi>Spiritual Peers</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> sent Prisoners to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and brought
as Criminals to the Bar, for barely representing the
Reasons, why they could not obey an Arbitrary
Command, contrary to their Conscience? Both <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and our Neighbouring Nation have too many
Reasons, to remember the Late King <hi>Iames</hi>'s assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to himself an <hi>Arbitrary and Despotick Power,</hi>
not only to dispence with Laws, and the firmest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
but to act diametrically opposite to them.
Can King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Oratory persuade us, That the
continuing to Levy the <hi>Customs and additional Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,</hi>
(which had been only granted during the Late
King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Life) before the Parliament could
meet to renew this Grant, was but a Calumny?
Was the strange Essay of <hi>Mahometan Government,</hi>
acted at <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Lyme;</hi> and the no less strange
Proceedings of that Bloody Chief Justice, in his We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Circuit, (justly term'd <hi>his Campaign,</hi> for it
was an open Hostility to all Law) for which, and
the like Services, he had the reward of the Great Seal,
were they all but Stories? We have too good Reason
not to forget the many Violences committed by the
Soldiers of a standing Army in most Parts of <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which are the most severe and insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Invasions of Property.</p>
            <p>These, and such like, with a great many more,
were the things that render'd King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
justly <hi>Odious to the</hi> Brittish <hi>World,</hi> and made
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106558:7"/>
these three Kingdoms groan after Liberty. If so
grave and Tragick a Subject, could allow it, I could
be almost tempted to laugh at that Expression in
the Declaration, of his Enemies not daring to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the proving these Charges to the World;
which is all one, as if a Man in the severest fit of
the Gout, should be desir'd to prove that he is so,
when the Sense of the Pain proves too sad a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer
of his Distemper. And indeed, this part of
King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Declaration merits no other answer, than
that of the <hi>Philosopher,</hi> to him who deni'd motion,
When making a step up and down the Room, he
vouchsafed him no other Refutation of his Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Assertion, than these two words, <hi>hicne Motus?</hi>
In fine, It will be equally impossible to persuade
the World, that these Actions, that render'd King
<hi>Iames</hi>'s Government <hi>Odious to the World,</hi> were
but Calumnies and Stories, as to persuade a Man
upon the Rack, that he feels no pain. How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily
have the Penners of this Declaration, stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
upon that Expression, <hi>of his Enemies not
caring what Slavery they reduce the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
to? Quis tulerit Gracchos?</hi> That King <hi>Iames</hi>
had in a great measure, enslav'd these Nations, and
was upon the Ripening his designs, in Conjunction
with <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> to teach us a <hi>French kind of
Subjection,</hi> has appear'd in legible Characters, by
the whole Scheme of his Actings: But, since his
present Majesties Accession to the Throne, there is
not the least footstep of Slavery left us; we are
blest with a King that takes the Advice of his
Parliament, and owns no distinct Interest from that
of his People; a Prince, who to deliver us from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106558:7"/>
and Slavery, has ventur'd his <hi>All,</hi> and who
by his Conduct at home, and his Allies abroad,
is capable to render us happy, if our own Divisions
and Folly do not precipitate us into an inevitable
and unpitied Ruin.</p>
            <p>In the next place, King <hi>Iames</hi> tells us, <hi>That
since his Arrival in</hi> Ireland, <hi>the Defence
of his Protestant Subjects</hi> (as he calls them)
<hi>their Religion, Priviledges and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
is especially his Care, with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of his own Rights. And to this
end, he has preferr'd such of them, of whose
Loyalty and Affection he is satisfied, to
places both of the highest Honour and
Trust about his Peson, as well as in his
Army.</hi> The reading of those Lines, puts me in
mind of the Parallel so exactly observ'd betwixt
the <hi>French</hi> King, and King <hi>Iames,</hi> in all their
Conduct, and particularly in both their way of
asserting the calm Methods us'd by them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Protestant Subjects. When that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemy of the Christian Part of</hi> Europe (as the
present Pope was pleased to call him) had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
all the <hi>Nero</hi>'s, and <hi>Iulian</hi>'s of old, in the
art of Persecution, and had render'd himself abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
to the World, by the Cruelties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by his Dragoon Missioners upon those very
People that had done him the best Offices,
and preserved the Crown upon his Head in his
Minority; yet at the very same time, <hi>Lewis</hi>
the <hi>14th,</hi> and his Ministers, have had the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to affirm, That no other Methods were
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106558:8"/>
us'd to convert these poor Victims, but those
of fair Persuasion and Calmness. Just so King
<hi>Iames,</hi> that he may follow as near his Copy as
possible, having since his Arrival in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
abandoned the Protestants of that Country to
the merciless Rage of an Enemy irreconcilable,
from both a Principle of Religion and Civil Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
who within his View have laid desolate
whole Counties, and acted Barbarities proper
only to themselves, and their <hi>French</hi> Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates;
and by which they have forc'd away
a great many Thousands from their Country,
at the point of Starving, having sav'd nothing
of their Fortunes from so universal a Calamity.
Yet, notwithstanding all this appears in the
Face of the Sun, King <hi>Iames,</hi> that he may not
come short of his Patron, boldly affirms, That
the Religion, Priviledges and Properties of his
Protestant Subjects (as he names them) are his
chiefest Care over and above. What a gross Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
is it to common Sense and Reason,
that a Prince bigotted to the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, and
enslav'd to Jesuitick Councils, should make that
Religion, which in his Opinion, is an <hi>execrable
Heresy,</hi> become his <hi>equal Care,</hi> with what he calls
the <hi>Recovery of his Right?</hi> Sure I am, in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
he has mightily overacted his part, and
nothing but a belief capable to receive <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi>
can be persuaded of the fair meaning
of it. If the Proposition could possibly admit
of a favourable Construction, then it must
necessarily follow, That King <hi>Iames</hi> is of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Communion than that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106558:8"/>
were a great injury done him to suppose, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he has given us such convincing Proofs
to the contrary: For every <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick is
obliged to look upon the Protestants as <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
and their Religion as <hi>Heresy;</hi> and we
have once every year the <hi>imaginary Successor of
Saint</hi> Peter, formally Cursing us in Person;
and from his plenary Power, declaring us to
be fallen from all our Civil Rights. If King
<hi>Iames</hi> had said, The Protestants are his Care,
meaning the Conversion of them to his Religion
by the calm methods of a Dragoon Mission, he
would have found no great difficulty to have
been believ'd. But to affirm that, <hi>That pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent
Northern Heresie,</hi> the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<hi>was his care,</hi> is, indeed a stretch beyond
the ordinary pitch of Jesuitick Equivocation it
self. We have had occasion enough to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Charity of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
those of our Religion; It has been both
fervent and burning: And lest we should forget
what has been done in former Ages, <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Savoy</hi> have of late set before us new instances of
the Charity of that Church. No doubt King
<hi>Iames</hi>'s sincerity in this assertion, <hi>is</hi> the same with
that of all his Promises: And, albeit when he was
upon the Throne, we were told in some of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,</hi>
That we were bound to obey <hi>without
reserve;</hi> it's hardship upon hardship to be oblig'd,
now when he is justly Abdicated, to <hi>believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reserve.</hi>

But, that we may the easier be persuaded of
King <hi>Iames</hi>'s care of the Protestants of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and their Properties, let us take a short glance
of the great favours he has bestowed on them,
since his Arrival there. One would think, that
a Man's <hi>Estate, his House, Furniture, his Arms,
Money, Chattels, and the like,</hi> were included un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the word <hi>Property:</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> his care
has been so transcendently great of this sort
of Property, that there are at this day, in
<hi>England</hi> and the Neighbouring Nations, Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Gentlemen, Clergy, Merchants, and Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
whose Estates, seiz'd upon by King <hi>Iames</hi>'s
Order, amounts to more than Four Millions of
Pounds <hi>Sterling:</hi> If any doubt the Truth of
this, I refer them to the List and Account,
taken of the <hi>Irish</hi> Protestants by the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
appointed by the King for that effect.
Neither is there, at present, one single Protestant
within that Kingdom, that can rationally assure
himself of one moments possession of what the
Barbarous <hi>Irish</hi> has left them yet undestroyed.
Who knows not, That upon-weighty Reasons,
the Wisdom of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> thought it
very dangerous to trust the Natives of <hi>Ireland</hi>
with Arms, knowing from many funest Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences,
they were a People impatient of the
<hi>English Yoake,</hi> and ready to accept all occasions
to throw it off. But King <hi>Iames</hi> treads quite
another Path; instead of dis-arming these his
<hi>darling Wild Irish,</hi> they are the only People
he can trust, as knowing their surious Zeal to
His Religion, and their Hereditary hatred to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106558:10"/>
the <hi>English</hi> Nation, renders them fit Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to execute the Designs concerted betwixt
Him, and his Intimate Allie, the <hi>French</hi> King:
And, which, to capacitate them the better to
effectuate, he has wisely dis-armed before-hand,
the whole Protestants of that Kingdom,
and prepared them ready Victims for their
Bloody Enemies, when ever it shall be time
to give the Blow. I confess, it requires the
greatest stock of patience, to hear one boldly
affirm his Care of my Life, and at the same
time to see him give me up, bound and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceless,
into the Hands of my cruel and mortal
Enemies.</p>
            <p>There is another transcendent Instance of
King <hi>IAMES</hi>'s <hi>Care of the Protestants
in</hi> Ireland, <hi>their Religion, and Property,</hi>
which merits to be engraven in <hi>Corinthian</hi> Brass,
to Posterity. All that are in the least acquainted
with the Laws and Affairs of that Kingdom,
know, That the <hi>Act of Settlement</hi> is the great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Protestants, their Religion, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
and the Fundamental Right they have to
their Estates, conquer'd from the Rebellious <hi>Irish,</hi>
at the expence of their Blood and Treasure.
By this <hi>Act,</hi> the <hi>lasting Landmarks</hi> are sixt among
the Protestants themselves, and between them
and the Natives. This is indeed the <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
of the Protestants of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the true
<hi>Basis</hi> of their Liberties and Properties; upon the
taking away of which, the Superstructure must
tumble to the ground. Now King <hi>IAMES</hi>'s
<hi>Care of the Protestants</hi> is of so high a nature, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106558:11"/>
in His first Speech to His <hi>Mock-Parliament,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
all of Papists (except about Five or
Six) <hi>May</hi> 7. he assures them, <hi>He would consent
to the enacting such Laws as might relieve them
of the Act of Settlement.</hi> And <hi>May</hi> 10. we find
it moved in the House, <hi>That nothing could be more
advantageous to the King and Countrey, than to
destroy the horrid barbarous Act of Settlement;
and whosoever shall alledg the contrary, shall be
deem'd an Enemy to both.</hi> Thereafter we find it
mov'd by one of the <hi>Worthy Members</hi> of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<hi>That the Act of Settlement should be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
burnt by the Common Hangman.</hi> Behold the
transcendent Care of King <hi>IAMES</hi> for the
Priviledges and Properties of the Protestants of
<hi>Ireland!</hi> His accustomed Zeal obliges him at the
first meeting of His <hi>Packt-up Popish Parliament,</hi>
to put them in mind of the best methods to
Repeal the <hi>Great Security of the Protestants
Estates.</hi> His impatience to have this done, could
not stay till it had been propos'd by any of the
Members themselves; He must needs demonstrate
his tenderness to his <hi>belov'd Irish,</hi> by leading them
the way how to break off the <hi>English</hi> Yoak, and
make an inroad upon those Properties the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
had acquired at the expence of their Blood.
As I intimated before, it was ever the Maxim
of <hi>English</hi> Policy, to bridle in the unwearied
Attempts of the <hi>Irish,</hi> for regaining their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
by a good standing Army in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
consisting of Protestants: But here we have
another Testimony of King <hi>IAMES</hi>'s Care
of the Protestants, in His turning out of all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106558:11"/>
in the Army, those of that Persuasion, to
make room for others of his own Religion. It
was the Policy of all Nations to keep the People
they had conquer'd, in as great ignorance of the
<hi>Art of War,</hi> as possible, lest sometime or other
they might shake off their Yoke, by a vigorous
Rebellion. But King <hi>IAMES</hi> inclin'd to
take other measures, and be at the greatest pains
to teach an <hi>ind<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cible Nation</hi> the use of Arms, that
they might learn in due time to shake off the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the other part of the above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Assertion,</hi> That he had advanced several
of the Protestants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to Places
both of the highest Honour and Trust
about His Person, as well as in His
Army.</p>
            <p>To pass a just judgment upon this Assertion,
we need only consider What sort of Persons are
at present about King <hi>IAMES</hi> both in <hi>Civil
and Military Capacities,</hi> and we shall find it hard
to meet with one single Person of the Protestant
Persuasion in the number. I could heartily wish,
that all King <hi>IAMES</hi> His Actions could as
easily admit an excuse as this; For the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
assum'd upon Him by <hi>Monsieur d' Avaux,</hi> and
His other <hi>French Guardians,</hi> puts it almost beyond
His Power to employ <hi>English Roman Catholicks,</hi> far
less <hi>English Protestants.</hi> At <hi>the Council-board</hi> we
find none of the Protestants. The Offices of
<hi>Lord Lieutenant, Chancellor, Privy Seal, Secretary
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106558:12"/>
of State, Commissioners of the Treasury, Lord
Chief Iustice, Sollicitor General, Attorney General,
and all the Places of the Long Robe, are enjoy'd
by</hi> Roman Catholicks. As to Military Capacities,
there is not one single <hi>Garisen, Fort, nor Castle</hi>
within the whole Kingdom, except <hi>London-derry</hi>
and <hi>Iniskilling,</hi> but are fill'd up with both Popish
Governors, Officers and Soldiers. In the Army,
all the Field Officers are either <hi>French,</hi> or Native
<hi>Irish</hi> of the same Religion: Yea, the <hi>French's</hi>
absoluteness both at the Council-board and the
Army, has of late given the greatest Jealousie and
Discontent to some that have done King <hi>IAMES</hi>
the best service.</p>
            <p>In the end of this first Paragraph we are
told, That King <hi>IAMES, by granting His
Royal Protection to such, whose minds
were shaken by the Arts of His Rebellious
Subjects, has dispell'd their Apprehensions,
and effectually secur'd them against the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
even of their private Enemies.</hi>
And then adds, <hi>His ears have been always
open to their just Complaints: And so far
has His Royal Mercy been extented to
those that were in Arms against Him,
that He has actually pardon'd several hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of them, and most notorious Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
are kept in an easie Confinement.</hi> In
reading this Period, I find King <hi>IAMES</hi> would
impose upon our Belief and Senses something as
much contradictory to it self, as <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi>
and the one as hard to be digested as the other.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106558:12"/>
The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> tells us magisterially, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
our Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Taste, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
together, to assure us, that the Bread and Wine is
<hi>really such,</hi> yet we must not give credit to these fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Senses of ours; but take it upon trust, from the
Church, That what our Senses tell us to be Bread
and Wine, is quite another thing; and that there is
nothing there left of any such Elements, after once the
Priest has mumbled over <hi>the three Words.</hi> Thus,
King <hi>Iames,</hi> having long accustomed himself to an
<hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> over our Persons and Properties, when
King; He cannot refrain from venturing an Essay of
it upon our Reason and Senses, even when he is laid
aside: For, albeit our Senses are continually enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with hundreds of Objects, that bear in upon
our Reason, a certain Perswasion that the poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are every day flying away from
that Country, at any rate, to avoid the many Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities
exercised upon them; and that that Kingdom
is become the Scene of Misery and Dissolution; yet
King <hi>Iames</hi> would have us wisely lay aside these mean
helps of Sense and Reason, and <hi>take it upon his bare
Word,</hi> that there is no such thing; which I think very
few will be inclinable to do. If what is asserted upon
this subject be true, and consequently our Senses and
Reason so strangely beguiled, it necessarily behoves us
to pass no milder Judgment upon those Noblemen,
Bishops, Gentlemen, and Persons of all ranks, that
have left their Country, since King <hi>Iames</hi>'s arrival
there, but that they are <hi>quite out of their Wits:</hi> For
what better Name can be given to Persons that have
left their Country, Estates, and Employments, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
here the <hi>greatest Objects of Charity,</hi> when not
only they might have been safe at home, but <hi>secured
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106558:13"/>
against the attempts of their private Enemies?</hi> In
this Word <hi>private Enemies,</hi> we are obliged to King
<hi>Iames</hi>'s Secretary (whether out of Ignorance, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
I know not) for a fairly insinuated distinction of
the Protestants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> their <hi>private</hi> and <hi>publick
Enemies.</hi> We know that all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks are
tyed, by the dictates of their Church, to be Enemies
to the Protestants; and to extirpate them, when it
comes in their power: And this, as flowing from a
publick interest of Religion, may justly be termed a
<hi>publick Enmity:</hi> But the Natives of <hi>Ireland,</hi> over and
above that publick quarrel of Religion, have a private
one of Revenge, for recovering from the Protestants
their Lands acquired by the Sword; and no age has
passed since the Conquest of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but what has
afforded bloody proofs of the revengeful Spirit of that
People, upon this score. If <hi>free quartering, plundering,
robbing, disarming, seizing on Estates, imprisoning,
murdering in cold Blood,</hi> and the like, <hi>be a securing
these poor Protestants against their private Enemies,</hi>
they have no reason to complain of King <hi>Iames</hi> his
Conduct: But, alas! to be ruin'd, and in the mean
time to see the Authors of it boldly affirm, that they
do us all the Offices of Kindness, is the hardest of
fates. I would fain know where are these hundreds
that he has pardoned; for those that flee every day
from that unhappy Countrey, cannot instance us a
single one of them: And for these that are kept in such
<hi>easie confinements,</hi> their condition, of all Men, is most
deplorable, seeing they lie at the Mercy of an Enemy,
that waits but for a favourable juncture, to Sacrifice
them to their Revenge. What sort of <hi>securing,</hi> the
Protestants of <hi>Ireland</hi> meet with, against their <hi>private
Enemies;</hi> and what is the ordinary effect of <hi>Protections</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:106558:13"/>
given to these poor credulous People, will appear by
this one instance, among thousands of others, of a
Protection given to a Farmer, in the County of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim,</hi>
in these Words, <hi>I</hi> Richard Hamilton, <hi>Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General
of his Majesties Forces in</hi> Ulster, <hi>do
hereby receive into his Majesty's Protection, the
Body and Goods of</hi> James Hunter, <hi>of</hi> Bullymenach, <hi>in
the County of</hi> Antrim, <hi>Yeoman; and do promise and
oblige my self, that none of the Army shall molest and
hurt him, or take any thing from him. Given,</hi> &amp;c.
The poor <hi>protected Man,</hi> thus noos'd, returns to his
House, and follows his labour; but anon, down comes
upon him the Rabble of the Army, like an inundation
of <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals;</hi> sweep all before them, and
leaves nothing behind them, but a <hi>starving Family.</hi>
The wretched Man making his address to <hi>Hamilton,</hi>
receive this cold answer; <hi>I promised to protect you
from the Army, but I have no power to restrain the
Rabble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning of the second Paragraph, we are
told <hi>of the Care King</hi> James <hi>has taken of the
Church of</hi> England, <hi>that they be not disturbed in
the exercise of their Religion, and possession of their
Benefices; and that all Protestant Dissenters en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
Liberty of their Consciences, without the least
molestation. And out of his Royal Care for the
prosperity of his People</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>he has
recommended to his Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the first thing
necessary to be dispatched, to setle such a security
and Liberty, both in Spiritual and Temporal
Matters, as may put an end to these Divisions,
which has been the source of all their Miseries;
being resolued, as much as in him lies, to cut all
Liberty and Happiness on his People so far, as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106558:14"/>
to put it out of the power of his Successors, to
invade the one, or infringe the other: And this, he
takes God to Witness, was always his design.</hi>
The first part of this long period, is but a repetition
of what had been formerly said, in the first Paragraph,
<hi>of the Protestants, their Religion, Privileges, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
being his chief Care;</hi> and what truth, that can
bear, we have shewed already. There is one thing,
that I find King <hi>Iames</hi> was ever inclinable to value
himself upon, and which he here likewise mentions;
<hi>I mean, his tenderness to Protestant Dissenters,</hi> and his
Principle for <hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi> They are very
thick sighted, that could not discern what lay at the
bottom of this Liberty, and what could be the true
motive that should have induced one of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s
Religion to do it? But because he has been at the
pains, so often, during his Reign, to assure us, That it was
his Opinion Conscience should not be constrained, nor
People forced in Matters of Religion; and particularly
in his Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, dated
<hi>August</hi> 4. 1687. I'll beg leave to say, That in this,
King <hi>Iames</hi> is no obedient Son of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
for it has, over, and over again, decreed the <hi>extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of Hereticks:</hi> It encourages Princes to it, by
the offer of the Pardon of their Sins: It threatens them
to it, by denouncing to them not only the Judgments
of God, but that which is often more sensible, the loss
of their Dominions. It's true, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us, <hi>The
Church does not always execute her power of deposing
Heretical Princes, though she always retains it;</hi> and he
gives a very good reason for it, <hi>because she is not at
all times in a capacity to put it in Execution:</hi> So the
very same Reason, might have made it unadviseable
to King <hi>Iames,</hi> when he was so liberal of his Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106558:14"/>
to extirpate Heresie, because it could not be
then easily done: But we see the Right remains intire,
and is put in execution, in such an unrelenting manner,
in our neighbouring Countries, that it has a very ill
Grace, to see any Member of that Church pretend to
be against <hi>constraining the Conscience,</hi> in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
And when we consider, that neither the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
and true Interest of <hi>France,</hi> nor the greatness of
their Monarch, could withstand these bloody Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
that are indeed parts of that Religion; I could
never see any reason to induce us to believe, that the
late Tolerations of Religion were proposed with any
other design, but either to divide the Protestants
among themselves, or to lay them asleep, till it was
time to give the alarm for destroying them. And that,
in the Opinion of that Church, the Glory of extirpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Heresie, is valued above all other great Actions, we
have a remarkable instance in that famous Harangue,
made by the Bishop of <hi>Valence,</hi> to the <hi>French King,</hi> in
the Name of the <hi>Convention of the</hi> French <hi>Clergy at
St.</hi> Germane, in <hi>Iune</hi> 1684. where that Prelate having
recounted the <hi>innumerable Conversions made by that
Kings Orders, Cares, and Liberalities,</hi> to use his very
Words; he subsumes thus: <hi>Ie bien même, que se
chercherois vainement dans les sicoles passés, que l' appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerois
vainement a mon secours, touts les éboges des pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miers,
et des plus saints Empereurs. It were,</hi> says he,
<hi>in vain to search into the Ages past; It were in vain to
call to my assistance all the Panegyricks of the first and
holiest of the Emperours:</hi> And afterwards he treats him
with the Title of the <hi>Great Restorer of the Faith, and
extirpator of Heresie;</hi> and tells him, that <hi>these infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
surmount all his other glorious Titles.</hi> And then,
speaking of his Masters great Victories in <hi>Germany,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106558:15"/>
Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. and the Peace of <hi>Nimiguen,</hi> made upon
the back of them, he concludes thus: <hi>That the Fruit,
which the King had received by that Peace, made it ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apparent, what was the principal end he aim'd at, in
his Victories;</hi> meaning, <hi>the Extirpation of Hereticks.</hi>
The late King <hi>Iames,</hi> has always copied so fair after
<hi>Louis le Grand,</hi> That we have no Reason to question,
but in this so glorious a work, of <hi>extirpating Heresie,</hi>
he would have come up to the Original, if his Designs,
and a favourable juncture of time had concurr'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>When he tells us, <hi>That the first thing he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
to his parliament, is, to settle such a
Security and Liberty, as may put an end to these
Divisions, which have been the source of all our
miseries,</hi> I find the greatest exactness of Truth, in
these Words, if we but take them in the sence and
meaning of the Speaker, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Prince.
For, albeit we all know, that the first thing recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by King <hi>Iames,</hi> to his <hi>Irish</hi> Parliament, was, The
repealing the <hi>Act of Setlement;</hi> which is, indeed, the
great Charter, by which most of the Protestants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
their Estates: And tho' the destroying that <hi>Act,</hi>
gives a mortal blow to the Protestant Interest in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
yet, according to the native Principles of King
<hi>Iames</hi> his Religion, the repealing of this <hi>Act of Setle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
may well be called, <hi>The setling a Security,
that may put an end to their Divisions, which has
been the source of all our Miseries:</hi> That is to say,
King <hi>Iames,</hi> from a Principle of Religion, is resolved
to remove that <hi>Barrier,</hi> that protects the Protestants
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in their Separation from the Church of
<hi>Rome;</hi> That by its removal, he may be in a capacity
conform to the Holy Dictates of that Church, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106558:15"/>
the laudable Example of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. to put an end to
all Divisions in point of Religion, by forcing them to
return to the Mother-Church, by <hi>the calm Methods</hi> of
late, so happily used in <hi>France.</hi> And this, I am very
inclinable to believe, he may, with a safe Conscience,
<hi>take God to Witness, was always his Design.</hi> I am some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
surprized to hear King <hi>Iames</hi> his Secretaries, pop
out their Master's secret Designs, that were so much his
Interest to conceal; but the Truth is, we knew them
before, to our Cost; and we hope, are on the way, to
be sufficiently secured against any further Effects of
them.</p>
            <p>In the end of this Paragraph, we are told, <hi>That se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Protestants, are now returned to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and Habitarious; and that more would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
if the Ports were open: But the Usurpers,</hi>
(as he pleases to call their present Majesties) <hi>know too
well the Sincerity of his intentions, to permit a
free Passage for them.</hi> This, indeed, is all of a piece
with the rest. We are Witnesses, every Day, of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of poor Protestants of that Country, grasping e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Opportunity, they can at any rate purchase, to
abandon their Homes, and all that's dear to them, that
they may but escape with their Lives: And I defie any
of King <hi>Iames</hi> his Friends, to instance me one single
Person, <hi>of any Condition,</hi> that have dared to return
Home, since his Arrival in <hi>Ireland;</hi> none of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so far in love with Destruction, as to venture on
his Protection. In this <hi>Epithet,</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> is pleased
to bestow on their Majesties, he imitates his Patron,
<hi>Louis le Grand;</hi> who, I confess, has the greatest Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Hatred against his Majesty, as being the <hi>great
Supporter of the Liberty of</hi> Europe; and who, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with his Allies, is best able to bring to Reason
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106558:16"/>
that <hi>insupportable Enemy</hi> of <hi>Christendom;</hi> yea, of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
it self. It were an impertinent piece of Boldness,
or rather, unpardonable Impudence, to offer to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
their Majesties from that injurious Designation;
since the Wisdom and Power of the Parliament, is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amount
to all private assertions of their Majesties just
Right: And that the most, if not all the Crowned
Heads, and Soveraign Princes, and States of <hi>Europe,</hi>
not only rank our present King, among the best and
greatest Kings of <hi>England;</hi> but promise to themselves,
from his Assistance, to bridle <hi>Louis le Grand</hi> within
his proper <hi>Boundaries.</hi> It was ever looked upon as a
Principle of common Law; That an Heir in <hi>Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
has just Cause to sue him that is in Possession, if
he makes <hi>Wastes</hi> on the Inheritance that belongs to him
in Reversion. That the Heir of a Crown should inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
when he sees him that is in Possession, hurried on
by bad Counsels, to subject an independant Kingdom,
to a Foreign Jurisdiction, is much more reasonable,
since the thing is of much more Importance; and that
this was King <hi>Iames</hi> his Case, is apparent, by the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
of the Earl of <hi>Castlemain</hi> at the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi>
and the rather, that by a great many Statutes, it was
Treason to have Correspondence with that See: This
joined to the setting up of a pretended Heir, in such a
manner, as the whole Kingdom believed him supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious,
was a just and lawful Ground for one <hi>Sovereign
Prince</hi> (such as his Majesty was when Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>)
to make War against another, that had so abused his
Power; and 'tis an unquestionable Maxim among Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers,
<hi>That the Success of a just War, gives a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Title to that which is acquired in the Progress of it.</hi>
Therefore, King <hi>Iames</hi> having so far sunk in the War,
that he both abandoned his People, and deserted the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106558:16"/>
Government, all his Right and Title to the Crown
did thereupon accrue to his present Majesty, in the
<hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Conquest:</hi> So that he might have lawfully
then assumed the Crown: But his present Majesty
chose rather to leave the Matter to the determination
of the Peers and Representatives of the People, assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with all Freedom in the Convention, who did
thereupon declare him King; so that, tho' he was
vested with a just Title of Conquest, he chose rather
to receive the Crown by their Declaration, than to
hold it in the Right of his Sword. This I thought fit
to say, not so much for Confutation of the injury
done their Majesties in the above-mentioned Designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which needs not my Pen; but to state their Right
to the Crown in such a Light, as may remove need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
scruples of swearing Allegiance to them.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the third and last Paragraph,
King <hi>Iames</hi> tells us, <hi>That nothing but his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to justice, could prevail with him to
such a Proceeding, as that of his Care of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Subjects in</hi> Ireland; <hi>and hopes his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Subjects in</hi> England (as he calls them) <hi>will
make a Iudgment of what they may expect from
him.</hi> Indeed, it is no difficult Matter, to make a
Judgment of what we may justly expect from him,
if ever Divine Judgment, as the Reward of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
for so great a Deliverance, should permit us
to fall again under the heavy Yoke of a Popish Prince,
whom we have so justly and happily thrown off. King
<hi>Iames</hi> is of a Religion, that has, in a famous Council,
decreed, That <hi>no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks;</hi>
much less with Subjects, that he looks upon, as so
many <hi>Rebels;</hi> and will not miss to treat them as such,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106558:17"/>
whenever they give him the Opportunity of doing it.
For his greatest Admirers do not run to that heighth of
Idolatry, to imagine him so much <hi>Angel,</hi> as not to
take all Methods to revenge such an Affront, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
himself at our Cost, from such Treatment for
the future. The Apprehensions of which Resentment,
would strike such Terror in Men's Minds, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would be capable to divert them from offering
up <hi>All,</hi> for an Atonement; and <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi>
will be thought a good Bargain, if they can but save
their Lives. Then we might lament our Miseries,
when it should be out of our Power to help them;
for a <hi>Prince of</hi> Orange, is not always ready to rescue
us, with so vast expence, and hazard of his Person.
And I must say, if ever our Madness should hurry us
thus far, we should become rather the Objects of
Laughter, than of Pity.</p>
            <p>Therefore, King <hi>Iames promises and declares, That
nothing shall ever alter his Resolutions to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
such, and no other methods, as by his said
Subjects in Parliament, shall be found proper
for their common Security, peace and happiness.</hi>
Such silly bates as these, will not now take; and here
is a great deal of Pains lost, to perswade us to relie
upon Promises, so often made already, and as often
broken. What Adjournments, Prorogations, and
Dissolutions of Parliament, we have had of late, is
not easie to be forgotten. We have found, to our
sad Experience, that the Interest of the Court, and
that of the People, were two incompatible things;
and to endeavour a Redress of the least Grievance, <hi>in
a Parliamentary way,</hi> was not only a vain Attempt, but
a design, branded with the infamous Name of <hi>Dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106558:17"/>
to the Government.</hi> I need not be at the Pains
to repeat all the Promises made by King <hi>Iames,</hi> of the
same Nature with this in his Declaration; and how
well they were observed, we all know. Yet I cannot
but take notice of <hi>one,</hi> made in his first Speech to his
Privy-Council, an hour after his Brother's Death,
printed by his own Command, in these Words: <hi>My
Lords, before I enter on any other, I think fit to say
something to you, since it has pleased Almighty God to
place me in this Station; and I'm now to succeed to so
good and gracious a King, as well as so very kind a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I think fit to declare to you, That I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to follow his Example; and most especially, in
that of his great Clemency and Tenderness to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
I have been reported to be a Man for Arbitrary
Power; but that is not the only thing, that has been
said of me: And I shall endeavour to preserve this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
both in Church and State, as it is now by
Law established. I know, the Principle of the Church
of</hi> England <hi>is for Monarchy, and the Members thereof
have shown themselves good and loyal Subjects; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall always take care to defend and support it.
I know the Laws of</hi> England <hi>are sufficient to make the
King as great a Monarch as I can wish: And as I shall
never depart from the just Rights and Prerogatives of
the Crown, so I shall never invade any Man's Property.</hi>
He that can reconcile this Speech, with King <hi>Iames</hi>
his after Actings, is the fittest Person I know, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the Popish Notion, of our Saviour's Body being
in a thousand distinct Places at once. In these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
he takes it very unkindly to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
a Man for Arbitrary Power, and promises a
great many things, that are contradictory to it; but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106558:18"/>
how well he deserved the Character, all his Conduct
has made it appear, with a Witness.</p>
            <p>We have one of the most remarkable instances of
King <hi>Iames</hi>'s being against Arbitrary Power, in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1686/7. for a <hi>Toleration
in Scotland;</hi> where we find these new coin'd Words,
thrice made use of, <hi>Our absolute Power;</hi> with this
addition, <hi>Which all our Subjects are to obey without
Reserve.</hi> Now <hi>Absolute,</hi> in its natural Signification,
importing the being without all ties and restraints;
then, the true meaning of this, seems to be, That
there is an inherent Power in the King, which can
neither be restrained by Laws, Promises, nor Oaths;
for nothing less, than being free from all these, renders
a Power Absolute. Though the Term <hi>Absolute</hi> was
enough to stretch our Allegiance; yet that which
comes after, is yet a step of an higher Nature, tho'
one can hardly imagine, what can go beyond <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Power;</hi> and 'tis in these Words, <hi>Which all our
Subjects are to obey, without Reserve.</hi> This is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the carrying Obedience many degrees beyond
what the Grand Seignior yet ever claimed; for the
most despotick Princes in the World, before <hi>Lewis le
Grand</hi>'s time, thought it enough to oblige their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to submit to their Power, and to <hi>bear</hi> whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they thought fit to impose upon them: But, till
the fatal Days of the Dragoon-Conversions, it was
never so much as pretended, that Subjects were bound
to obey their Princes, <hi>without Reserve;</hi> and to be of
his Religion, because he would have it so; the only
convincing Argument used by these <hi>booted Apostles</hi>
of late. So, without doubt, this Qualification of the
Duty of Subjects, was industriously put in here by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106558:18"/>
King <hi>Iames</hi> his Jesuitick Counsels, to prepare the
Protestants of <hi>Scotland</hi> for a terrible <hi>Le Roy lê vent,</hi>
since the poor Pretensions of Conscience, Honour,
Religion, and Reason, would have been reckonded as
<hi>Reserves</hi> upon their Obedience; which were all, by
the Expressions, shut out.</p>
            <p>Before I leave this Paramount instance of King
<hi>Iames</hi>'s assuming to himself an <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what the Great <hi>Turk</hi> claims, and contrary to
his own reiterated promises, I must take notice of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
very <hi>comprehensive expression</hi> in that same Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for a Toleration in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and it's this. <hi>We
think fit to declare, That we will not suffer Violence to
be offered to any Man's Conscience, nor will we use force,
or INVINCIBLE NECESSITY upon any Man,
on the account of his Perswasion, nor the Protestant
Religion.</hi> When I first read these Words, I easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
what caution was used in the choice of them;
for it is clear, the general Words of <hi>Violence</hi> and
<hi>Force,</hi> are to be explained and determined by these
last, of <hi>INVINCIBLE NECESSITY:</hi> So that
King <hi>Iames</hi> very wisely promised only, to lay no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Necessity on his Subjects; but for all <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities</hi>
that were not <hi>Invincible,</hi> they might expect
to have felt a large share of them: For Disgraces,
want of Imployment, Finings, Imprisonments, and
even Death it self, are all <hi>Vincible</hi> things to a Man
of a firmness of Mind; yea, the Violence of Torture,
the Furies of Dragoons, and the Precedents, used of
late in <hi>France,</hi> might have been fairly included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Promise, since a great and sublime Soul, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with an extraordinary measure of Grace, might
be able to support under them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:106558:19"/>
Now, since we have had so many experiences,
of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s faithfulness to his Promises, before
he abandoned the Government, I pray, what Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
has he of late given us, that he will be more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
of his Word, then hitherto he has been. Sure,
the reducing Hereticks to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> is no
less Meritorious than before; nor King <hi>Iames,</hi> by
breathing a little of the <hi>French Air,</hi> and <hi>concerting
Measures</hi> with <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, become less
Bigot.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> concludes his Declaration with <hi>assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his pretended Subjects, That if, within
twenty Days after his appearing in person with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
England, <hi>they return to their Obedience, by
deserting his Enemies, and joining with him,
he will grant them his full pardon, and all past
miscariages shall be forgot.</hi> This merits no other
Answer, but what has been already said: Only this,
he must have the worst Opinion of the frailty of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, that can be brought to believe, That
any Man, not altogether divested of his Reason, can
be prevailed with, to join King <hi>Iames,</hi> though he
were in <hi>England,</hi> except he be of that Religion
that obliges him to assist a Prince, that sets up so
fairly forthe Glorious Title of the <hi>Extirpator of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie;</hi>
and to venture all upon the uncertainty of
seeing their Church Triumphant. And if there be
any of the Protestant Perswasion, so strangely infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated,
as but to wish his Return, I shall entertain
them with no other Answer, but the recomending to
them that place of Holy Writ, Preached upon before
the House of Commons, of late, by an eminent
Divine, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. v. 13, 14. <hi>And after all that is come
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106558:19"/>
upon us, for our evil deeds, and for our great-trespass,
seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our
Iniquities deserve, and hast given us such a Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
as this: Should we again break thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and joyn in affinity with the People of these
abominations; wouldst not thou be angry with us, till
thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be noremnant,
nor escaping?</hi>
