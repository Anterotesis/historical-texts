            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But the Infantes (which haue not the vse of reason) cannot vnderstande the fayth of Chryst (and muche lesse embrace and professe it) wherfore, it cannot stande with the worde of God that Infantes should be baptised. No doubt (chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten reader it is not possible that any shoulde be acceptable before God, without fayth. For so writeth Paul to the Hebrues. xi.

the whole world and preach the Gospell vnto all creatures. These wordes sowne, that the Apostles myght not chose them anye peculiar nacion to preach vnto, nether Iewe nor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyle, nother Greke nor Romain. But their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was into al the world, yea. &amp; to preach to all creatures the Gospel of God. No naci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no estate, condicion or degree, excepted. As wel were they bound to preache to the plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as to the prynce, as well to the labourer, as to the lorde. God hath no respect to the per son, All the sonnes of Adam are of one degree in the syght of the Lorde. Here was no menci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made Infantes neither of anye other age. But I am sure ther is no man so farre wyde as once to thynke that the Apostles were here in commaunded to preache vnto Infantes. For they as beastes lacking the vse of reason cannot receiue the fayth that hath his begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of hearyng (as saynt Paull wryteth) in this text therefore is no precepte of Infantes ether for the Baptisynge of theim other elles the leauyng of them vnbaptised. The precept that is heare geuen is none other but to go in to al the world and to preach the Gospel to al nations, estates and degrees. Then is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed the promyse of the free mercye of God towardes all the worlde, that is, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer should beleaue and be baptised should be saued, but he that wyl not beleue shalbe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Here is it manifest, that without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue, Baptisme auayleth not. For he that wyl not beleue shalbe condempned. But heare we must beware that we do not by these wordes condemne all Infantes and yong chyldren, be

cause they haue not the power to vnderstande and beleue. For this part of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> text partaineth no more vnto them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other (concerning the precept of the preachyng) doth. This place of scriptur therfore, is to be vnderstanded of them onely that haue the vse of reasone to per ceiue and vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de the preachyng of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell: and yet wyll not embrace it, and receyue baptisme, the signe of the washynge of theyr sinnes by the preciouse bloude of our sauiour Christe shedde for the rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption of the world. As for the other texte, that is of Paule to the Hebrues the. xi. chapit. wherin is declared that without faieth non can he acceptable to God: apparteyneth also vnto suche as are of yeres of discrecio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For in al the chapter, is ther none rehersed but such as were of age &amp; discrecion. Wherfore we maye iustly inferre herof, that it is not possible that any persone shoulde bee acceptable vnto god in hys workes, without the worke that he doeth, do proceade of a pure and sincere fayth. For as the prophet Esaye, sayth in his. lxiiii. chap. Out workes are al as the cloth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is defiled with menstruous bloud.
