         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>FOr although this way and order was firſt ordained for the good and bettering of Chriſtian Congregrations, yet wofull experience hath proved it to be very prejudicious and injurious, through the ignorance of ſome, and malice of others, againſt the ſtreight way of the Lord, and the Children thereof, for whereas the Elderſhips ought to have proceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule, for the increaſe of grace, love and knowledge, and the maintenance of peace and amitie, for the flouriſhing of true and pure religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, inſtead thereof, they have acted by their owne corrupt mindes and wils, and vented their hatred and ſpleen, and have prevented truth, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted falſhood, and where there was quiet and peace before, they have now raiſed up diſcord and diſſention, and inſtead of denying themſelves, and bearing with, and edifying one another, they have deſtroyed and devoured each other, witneſſe the third Claſſis of <hi>London,</hi> and the aſſemby of <hi>Syon-</hi>Colledge, which Committee as they call themſelves, did declare in print to all the world, that this forementioned government was the will and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Jeſus Chriſt, and avouched it to be <hi>jure divino,</hi> and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves made additionall Orders, without notice to, or leave given them by the Parliament: That all Elected Elders of every Pariſh, ſhould have their names very fairely written, and ſet upon the Church doore, deſiring any whomſoever, that could make exception againſt any thre mentioned they ſhould be heard, at ſuch a time and place, where the Triers would ſit and

receive all ſuch accuſations, they obſerving no rule or directions therein, provided by the Ordinance of Parliament, neither for the time limited, nor the particulars enumerated, nor the competetency or number of witneſſes required, whereby illimited Juriſdictions, innovations, and arbitrary proceedings may be avoided, and as this lawleſſe Committee then, and the Triers afterwards declared their owne wils, ſo they all acted as corruptly; for I knew a man then choſen an Elder in one of the pariſhes of the third Claſſis, whoſe election was with the greateſt freedome and affection of the Pariſhioners, as any that hath been choſen, the man being auntient in the Congregation, and had gone through moſt Offices amongſt them, and it ſo fel out at the ſame time, there was another younger, yet a richer Pariſhioner, choſen alſo, that was one of the Triers nominated in the Ordinance, who cauſeleſly, divers times before had declared himſelfe an oppoſer, of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and in the Veſtry he affirmed, the Party they had choſen ſhould never be allowed of, and preſently uſed all his endeavour, to finde cauſe of excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ſuch a malicious and inveterate manner, as the whole Pariſh tooke notice of it, ſo that at the next Veſtry, ſome of them blamed him, that the State having appointed him a Judge, he ſhould ſo maliciouſly make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the Accuſer, the Proſecutor, the Condemner, and Executioner and all: To whom he made this anſwer againe, he whom you have choſen ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be allowed of, and I will never give him the right hand of Fellowſhip, nor be reconciled unto him; upon his thus ſpeaking, the oppoſed Elder deſired the Pariſh to take notice of two things, in his implacable adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; Firſt, That he ſets up his owne will, above the Ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which gives you power to chooſe your owne Elders, and leaves it not to his perverſe will and pleaſure, and againe he ſuperſedes all the reſt of the Triers and Judges, for the Ordinance refers the Tryall and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to nine men, or any fix of them. And Secondly, he exalts himſelfe above God, and his Ordinances, in ſaying peremptorily againe and againe, I will never be reconciled; for Gods word commands, and his ſervants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the contrary; wherefore I pray (ſaid he) obſerve what an unworthy Elder, and Judge you have choſen to governe you, for his oppoſition is not ſo much againſt me, as againſt you all, for your yea, is his nay, and you claime a Publique intereſt in me, but he denies it you, from the which to be excuſed, tends to my particular eaſe and freedome; and truly, as this his beginning was vile and corrupt, ſo his proſecution abundantly exceeded in hatred and malice, for in all haſt, he cauſed divers exceptions to be drawn up againſt him, which he pretended to be ſcandalous, both in practiſe and Judgement, and upon ſummons, the accuſed appeared, and after their Clerk had read the exceptions, he required a Copy of them, which being denyed by the <hi>Prolocutor,</hi> (which afterwards through much importunitie was obtained) he then preſently diſclaimed and diſavowed ſo many of

them as tended to practiſe, and that moſt of them were falſe in many reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and requiring them to proceed, by the rule limited to a year before, for the time, the enumeration in the Ordinance for the particular matters, and two honeſt Chriſtians at leaſt for evidence? doe you tell us of the rule wee ſhould walk by (ſay they) we would have you know we are not tyed to the letter of the rule, but the meaning of it, is left to our judgements: I hear you, ſaid he, but I never heard before of a myſtical humane Law, &amp; I tel you all plainly, that if you wave the letter of the Ordinance of Parliament, which is your direction to trie me by, then I would have you know, I have as much power to try you all, as you all have to trie me; and added that he was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to finde them ſo unlimited and arbitrary in their proceedings; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the exceptions in practiſe were vaine and frivolous, and no way or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Ordinance, I will not now mention them, but referre them to another day of hearing, and proceed to give you a Breviate of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions touching ſcandalous judgement: The firſt was that he had affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the firſt day of the weeke was not commanded in Gods word to be a Sabbaoth. He anſwered, I have ſo affirmed, and if it be an errour ſo to ſay, then ſhew me it commanded in the word of God, to which they did not reply, but proceeded and ſaid, it was further objected againſt him, that he denied the moralitie of the Sabbaoth. He ſaid, before I can properly and clearely anſwer you, I muſt aske you a queſtion, what you meane by Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth, whether the ſigne or the thing ſignified? And alſo what you meane by moralitie, becauſe, I do not finde the terme in our Engliſh tongue, uſed in the Scripture? The <hi>Prolocutor</hi> or <hi>Moderator,</hi> being at a pauſe, I anſwered, I affirme that the command of the ſeventh day, extended not to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Gentiles, and I think you are all of my mind, or elſe you would obſerve, and not prophane it as you doe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I do hold that which the ſeventh dayes reſt did ſignifie, doth remaine and continue to the end of the world, and in ſome reſpects forever alſo, and pulling out a Bible out of my pocket, read part the of third and fourth Chapters of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and opened to them thoſe Scriptures, that ſpeak of the Sabbaoth, or reſt of God, before mentioned, alſo by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſaying, <hi>To day if you will heare his voice, harden not your hearts, leaſt you enter not into his reſt,</hi> &amp;c. And againe, <hi>Wee that have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, have entred into his reſt, and have ceaſed from our workes, as God did from his,</hi> proving to them by the Scriptures, that the reſt that remained unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, was a ſpirituall reſt, and not a corporall, and you that are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters here, ſaid he, know well enough, that it is concluded in the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of all Chriſtian Churches, their confeſſions, that the command for ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the firſt day of the weeke, is an Ordinance of the Church, but they being weary of his expoſition and exhortation, they replyed little, and leſs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165886:5"/>
to the purpoſe, but proceeded to further exceptions, and ſaid, that he was accuſed for affirming, that divine examples, doe not alwayes binde the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a Chriſtian, to which he anſwerered, that in ſaying ſo, he ſaid no more, then what themſelves juſtified, for ſaid he, there is a divine example, that the baptizer and the baptized, deſcended perſonally into the water to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and you baptizers follow not this holy example; they replyed, it was not the cuſtome of this Country: Behold ſaid he, your hands and your tongue, and all that you doe, is againſt you, to juſtifie that to be lawfull in your ſelves, which very thing, you accuſe in me for a ſcandalous excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Theſe and ſuch like, they debated ſome three or foure houres, but I will not tell you for ſhame, how ſhamefully they parted from my Friend, leaſt you ſhould be aſhamed to heare it: But to put a face upon the buſineſſe, they ſummoned him twiſe or thriſe afterwards, to make him wait, but they durſt not diſpute, and he finding their delayes, were to the Pariſhes preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, in their right, and for their ſatisfaction, he made the caſe knowne to that worthy, and now Right Honourable Counſellour, whoſe place is too high to declare his name, in ſo low a diſcoverie as this; yet I cannot doe leſſe, then tell you his judgement was, that the Triers had much wronged the accuſed, in not bringing his accuſers, face to face, according to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parliament, in ſuch caſes provided, and commanded him to tell them ſo from him, which Meſſage he delivered to them, the next time they ſate; which when they heard, they told him they did not believe him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he required them as they had power to take an Oath, ſo they would give him his Oath to confirme the truth of it, and when they would not, required what anſwer he ſhould returne to him that ſent him, they ſaid, that they could not approve of him to be an Elder, he deſired their reaſons, and their hands for his removing, that the Pariſh might chooſe another, all which they unworthily denyed him, notwithſtanding the Ordinance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them.</p>
               <p>If ſuch groſſe injuries as theſe, through ſelfiſhneſſe and carnalitie, have been done by the beſt and choiceſt Preſbyters, by the Judgers and Triers, ſuch as were heedfully and conſideratly appointed, by immediate Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Parliament, and if it be ſo with the beſt, what can wee expect from the choice of the multitude, both Parochiall and Claſſicall, of which if I had but time to tell you, would make both your eares to tingle, to heare what ignorance, contradictions, nonſenſe &amp; impentenency they are guilty of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Pride, vaine glorie and hypocriſie: yet a hint of it you ſhall have in the Chapter following.

            <p>For page 5. and the laſt line, he is as corrupt in his expreſſions, as he is in his deluſions, for the Apoſtle doth not ſpeake in his language of the Saints bodies in the reſurrection of the juſt to call them earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and beaſtiall, like the beaſtly Spirit he is lead by, but being guided by the holy Spirit of truth, cals them incorruptible, immortall, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bodies <hi>&amp;c. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. and proves plainely that the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body (that which the Captaine denyes) to be an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable truth, by the common and dayly experience of the ſowing and growing of ſeed, verſ. 37, 38. thou ſoweſt ſome bare graine of wheate or other <hi>(which is not quickned except it dye)</hi> but every ſeed

            <p>Furthermore as Capt. <hi>Norwood</hi> doth in his Confeſſion of Faith, pag. 1. in words acknowledge the divine nature of the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, as giving to him the name and title of infinite power and wiſdome in Creation, according to that which is written, <hi>By it all things were made, and without it, was made nothing that was made:</hi> ſo farr his expreſſion is true, what ever his meaning be of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but whereas he further ſaith, which is alſo called Chriſt the firſt borne, or only begotten of the Father, or the annointed, theſe titles or appellations cannot relate to his divine nature alone, but his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, as the name Jeſus or Chriſt was given to his perſon, when he was circumciſed, his proper name by which he was known from other men So the Prophet <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 27. applies the appellation of the firſt borne, to Chriſts humane nature; as a King in his glorious Kingdome (and yet not divided from his divine) <hi>I will make him my firſt borne higher then the Kings of the earth, pointing to the time when he ſhall take unto himſelfe his great power and perſonall reigne:</hi> Agreeing with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other expreſſion of his, in the <hi>Pſal. 2. 6.

Likewiſe the Capt. applies the terme only begotten of the Father to the divine, which moſt properly is applyable to Chriſts human nature, his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and ſo doe the Prophets and Apoſtles ſpeake Pſal. 2. <hi>This day have I begotten thee,</hi> God the Father ſpeaking to God the Sonne, in and by <hi>David,</hi> and ſo the Apoſtles teſtifying to Chriſts incarnation, death and reſurection, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 30. they prove it by the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall words, foreteling of Chriſts comming in the fleſh, <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee,</hi> and they add for further proof of Chriſts humanity, verſ. 35. wherefore he ſaith alſo in an other Pſalme, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption, Pſal.</hi> 16. which words point plainly to Chriſts body in the Sepulcher, and in proofe hereof the Author to the Hebrews is beyond all exception, for in this

reſpect only of the perſonall ſuffering of death, he was made a little lower then the Angels, who as touching his divine nature, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them, but in regard of his humanitie in ſuffering inferiour, now ſee (moſt ignoble Captaine) how your oppoſition exceeds the curſed Jewes crucifixion, for they did but kill that body of his which through the power of God was raiſed the third day, but you utterly deſtroy, deny, &amp; annihilat that body, and roared it out dayly to your deluded Diſciples, that Jeſus Chriſt is a quallitie, and no way to be conceived or underſtood perſonally for that you make an Allegorie.</p>
            <p>Obſerve further, that whereas this Captaine unwarily hath joynd theſe termes annoynting and annointed together, thereby as he ſaith to declare the ſecond glorie or manifeſtation of one Unitie in the Trinitie, and yet plainely abnegating and denying the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, how the infiniteneſſe of unction, in any true conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration can be ſaid to be annointed within it ſelfe, implies finiteneſſe, and for as much as the finite annointed is inferiour to the fulneſſe of annointing being infinite, I know not how he will cleere his owne words from obſurditie, but in this groſſe miſtak he concurreth with his Friend Mr. <hi>Royle,</hi> which makes the letter of the Scriptures, that ſpeake of Chriſts humane nature, to be but figurative expreſſions, and fulfild in every one of them by ſeverall removes and degrees of diſpenſations, as you may ſee more cleerely opened in the 4. and 8. pages in the <hi>Lamp of Light</hi> following.

And Secondly, he overthrowes all future hopes whatſoever, and affirmes there is no other reſurrection, glorie, or happineſſe then what is enjoyed in men, in this curſed world, in this vild and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible body, by which it plainly appeares the man is both ignorant and deſtitute of the lively faith, and aſſured hope of Gods elect, for which there needs no greater proofe againſt him then his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which wild and mad doctrine, is further diſcovered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demed in the Lamp and cure following.</p>
            <p>Againe, the Capt. ſeemes to vaunt much of his knowledge of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and hell, and ſaith that there is no other of neither, but what is now in mens bodies, a thing as ſtrange as the reſt, yet that he may be prov'd deluded, we muſt firſt conſider that the terme heaven is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly taken, and hath different meanings in the Scripture: firſt in a ſtrict, ſecondly in a more generall ſence; in a ſtrict ſenſe, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meant the doctrine and beginning of the Kingdome of Heaven ſometimes the righteouſneſſe of the Kingdome, ſometimes the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdome, ſometimes the glorious Kingdome it ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together conſidered, ſometimes the contenent and place of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes perfection. And ſecondly, in a more generall ſenſe, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the doctrine, and place of the Kingdomes regeneration, now as I formerly told your Brother Royle, in <hi>Cure of deadly doctrine, pag.</hi> 4. that the truth of tearmes is the preſervation of proprieties, which here now I ſhall more cleerely open to you; And Sir, I pray take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, for you to ſpeake indefinitely, as you have done of a tearme, which admits of ſuch different exceptions, in ſo doing you have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken altogether unprofitable, becauſe in ſuch caſes, the definition ſhews the meaning, not the tearme, ſo that in the rule of reaſon, no man can expect a full anſwer to a doubtfull aſſertion, yet that you may be anſwered we will preſume your intention that, by the tearm Heaven, you meane the place, and everlaſting glorious ſalvation of the Saints, now the Scripture ſhews the place, in which they ſhall injoy eternall ſalvation to be without them, <hi>I go to prepare a place for you,</hi> (ſaith their Lord) again <hi>I wil prepare a place for my people, &amp; they ſhal be removed no more,</hi> now this holie place promiſed, is the new heavens, and new earth, in which dwelleth righteouſneſſe, in which place there ſhall be no evill nor ſinne, nor curſe, nor death nor ſorrowing, nor crying, even ſuch a place of holineſſe and perfection, as Adam injoyed in his innocencie, which place was not contained within his body, but his body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

            <p>Conſider likewiſe how the Saints deſired expectation is to be cloathed upon with their houſe that is from Heaven, which is ſuch an extraordinary glorie as <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Elias</hi> was cloathed with in the holy Mount, which were viſible and tranſparent beauties as wel as internal: And in the morning of the Saints awaking, at the general reſurrection they ſhal ſhine (ſaith the Prophet) as the brightnes of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever. and ſo ſaith our Saviour and <hi>Emanuel, As truly God, ſo truly man, whom you deſpiſe and ſcorne, thus underſtood and acknowledged, nevertheleſſe at the end of this world, when the time of ſeparation ſhall be betweene the Children of the Kingdome, and the Children of the wicked one, Then ſhall the righteous ſhine forth as the Sun, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their Father,</hi> and this is added, <hi>Who hath eares, let him heare,</hi> which hearing eare, your Declaration ſhews you have not, as certainely as any thing you want in the world beſides, and when theſe things come to paſſe, as truly ſpeedily they ſhall, then ſhall you be forced to confeſſe a Hell without you alſo, as well as a Hell within you, and condemned with ſhame, and cloathed with confuſion, as with a mantle, when the undying worme is ſpread under you, which ſhall alſo cover you; then ſhall you ſee him and his, whom you now blaſpheme and perſecute, to be perſonally glorified, but your ſelfe juſtly and everlaſtingly tormented and condemned except you repent: in the meane while I leave it to all people, to whom theſe preſents ſhall come, to judge if you be not a lying deluded Prophet.</p>
            <p>And as I feare not to undertake the Captaine of my Lords enemies, although he be an uncircumciſed Goliah, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a leader of the hoaſt of the huge Camp of the Philiſtims, the Lords adverſaries: ſo I feare not likewiſe to reprove all ſuch Miniſters, of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, that pretend to feed and lead the Lambs Army, and to be Shepheards of Gods holy flock, and yet doe let ſuch Wolves as theſe, to worrie and deſtroy the harmeleſſe ſheep, and ſo ſmite the Shepheard, as to kill and crucifie him the ſecond time, and this done, not in a corner but in the ſheepfold, before all their faces, and yet not one of you have had a word to ſpeake, for your pretended Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, nor his faithful Servants, I could tell you where in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> both publiquely and privately, by men of your owne coate as you call them, as well as by others at <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Canterbury</hi> and all over the Nation, of which the cure behinde will tell you more, how theſe corrupt, abhominable and rotten doctrines have been plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced and put to ſale, to the killing of the head of Chriſts Church, and the poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Members thereof, and yet not one of you all as I know of, have appeared in the cauſe of truth againſt them; now how will you acquit your ſelves from that wofull ſentence, and lamentable reward of unprofitable Servants, without repentance I cannot tell you, but I admoniſh you all to looke about you, for the houre of account and reckoning is very nere comming, of which ſaith he that is your Friend, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi>
