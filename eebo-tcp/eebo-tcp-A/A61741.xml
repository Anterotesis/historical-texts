         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

when her Father know it, he kept her in, and
never allowed her to ſee him afterward, but when her
full time came that ſhe ſhould be delivered, there was
hired a <hi>Sedan</hi> to fetch a Mid-wife, and they carried her
through ſo many by Alleys and Lanes, and being
Night, ſhe knew not which way, nor where ſhe went,
but they conveyed her to a houſe, where in the firſt
Room ſhe came in, thare was a very large Fire, and
ſix Gentlemen all Maskt, the Mid-wife being amaz'd,
ſhe asked them if they had any thing for her to do,
they replyed they had, whereupon one of them had
her up in another Room, where four Gentlemen were
in black and Maskt, and a very hanſom young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
in paine, crying and taking on very much,
the Mid-wife deſiring her to be patient, there was
no fear of her ſafe delivery, but ſhe ſaid it was not that
troubled her, but ſhe ſaid that when ſhe was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſhe muſt be Burned in that fire that was below,
within an hour after ſhe was delivered: After ſhe had
Delivered the Woman, one of the Gentlemen gave
her Thirty Guines in her hand, and ſent her away in
the Sedan, ſhe was hardly got down ſtayers, but ſhe
heard her ſcreech and cry. This action was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ſo ſecreetly, that the Midwife cannot tell in what
part of the City it was acted, wiſhing ſhe could make
a further diſcovery of thoſe unnatural and Bloody

            <p>
               <hi>JOhn Adams,</hi> the Committer of this Barbarous
Murther, which we are goeing to relate, lived
at a place called <hi>Streton</hi> in the County of <hi>Sallop,</hi>
as an hired (though not menial) Servant to <hi>John Harris</hi>
a Sawyer in that Town, and had workt with him
Several yeares, and during all that time, carryed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
very civilly and honeſtly; but ſee! what a
mighty Temptation is money, and how dangerous a
thing it is to ſet our Hearts upon Covetouſneſſe, and
getting Riches by unlawful means; this ſtory is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a moſt pregnant Inſtance; For though this poor
man had hitherto led an unblamable life, yet not being
ſolidly grounded in virtuous principles, or to ſpeak
more properly, wanting the grace of God, without
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35164:3"/>
which all our Inclinations are evil, altogether evil,
and that Continually; he was no ſooner Baited by the
Devil with an opportunity, but he Committed one
of the moſt Barbarous Crimes that has been heard of
in our Age, though to fruitful, and every day teeming
with freſh and unheard of Aſſaſſinations, and bloody
Cruelties; For about the moneth of <hi>July</hi> laſt, his
Dame (who managed the buſineſs of a Dary diſtinctly
by her ſelf, as her husband did his own trade) haveing
ſold two Cows, and received the Summ of Ten
Pounds for them, which this <hi>John</hi> their man very well
knowing, preſently began to harbour the accurſed
thoughts of Robbing her of this money, and propoſed
ſeveral ſtratagems in his wicked Brain for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of this deſign; At laſt the Devil and he
concludeb their Conſultation in a Reſolution which he
forthwith Reſolves to put in Execution, And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
on the 13. day of <hi>January</hi> inſtant, his Maſter
haveing taken ſome worke at a place called <hi>Cardington,</hi>
about Eight Miles from <hi>Streton,</hi> went out ſomewhat
early in the morning with this fellow, intending to go
thither to his buſineſſe, But <hi>John</hi> heareing as we ſaid
before, concluded on his black Project, in order thhre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
purpoſely leaves ſome of his Tools behind at
home, and when they had wlakt about a mile, All of
a ſudden, Cries out to his Maſter, that he had forgot
them, who preſently bid him run back for them, and
ſaid that he would walk on before, which was what
his man deſired; Accordingly the fellow came back
towards the houſe, approching within ſight of it, and
revolving in his mind what he was going about, his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35164:3"/>
Conſcience as yet not wholly ſeared, began to fly
in his face, and check him from ſo baſe an Action,
though at that time (as he has ſince affirmed) he
meant his Dame no hurt, but only to have bound her
or the like, and taken her mony, and ſo have run clear
out of the Country, but then he began to fear, ſhe
knowing him ſo well, Hue and Cry would be ſent
out after him, and that he ſhould not cleverly eſcape,
whereupon he began to think of waveing the deſigne
wholly, and doubtleſſe had ſo done, If the Devil
(who always attends perſons that go on ſuch diſperate
attempts, ſtill pricking them forwards to their finial
diſtruction) had not ſtept in Juſt in the nick to confirm
him in the aforeſaid Helliſh Reſolution, and render
it more hainous, by adding the Guilt of Murther to
the Crime of Theft; For as he was walking near the
houſe in the feilds thus melancholly, and troubled in
his thoughts, not knowing what to do, Behold to his
apprehenſion, two men in black (undoubtedly two
Feinds in Maſquerade) appeared to him, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the cauſe why he was ſo Melancholly, and aſſured
him it lay in their power to help him, whatſoever
the matter might be, He thereupon reveals his mind
to them, and ſaid his Dame had received Ten pounds
which was now in the houſe, and that he had a mind
to it, but did not know how to get it ſecurely, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
one of the ſeeming men pulled out a long knife
with a black haft, and turning crooked, almoſt like a
little Scymetar from under his Coat, and ſaid (as he
ſince atteſted at his death) go and Cut thy Dames
Throat whith this, and thou ſhalt never be diſcovered,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35164:4"/>
nor ſo much as miſtruſted to be concerned in it, and
beſides, ſhalt never want as long as thou liveſt, upon
which perſwaſions, He takes new Courage to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
the villany, and receiving the fatall Knife from
them, goes boldly with it to the houſe, where he found
his Dame Innocently, all alone, at her Wheel a Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but little Dreaming that the tread of her life
was ſo ſoon to be Cut off; ſhe no ſooner ſaw him,
but very kindly ſhe demanded the reaſon of his ſo
ſudden unexpected return, but his heart was too much
ſet upon wicked deeds to anſwer her with words, and
therefore inſtead of a reply, he run up furiouſly unto
her, and draging her by the hair to the ground, with
the aforeſaid Knife barbarouſly Cut her Throat,
makeing an Orifice about Seaven Inches long, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
two deep, ſo that her Wind-pipe was Cut clear
aſunder, At which inforced paſſage her affrighted
Soul waſted forth in a Crimſon Flood, and left her
ſoon breathleſſe Corps weltring in its own blood on
the Floor whilſt the inhumane Murtherer greedily fell
to Search and pillage the houſe, but looking through
the Window ſaw his Dames Daughter comeing along
the next field, having been at Mill at the next
Village; He now knew not what to do for he found
he ſhould be diſcovered if he did not diſpatch her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
and therefore ſlipping behind the door, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Knife ready Juſt as ſhe came in, he Caught
her about the Neck, and Cut her Throat in the ſame
manner as he had done her Mothers, and then apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf again to Ranſack the houſe, where at laſt he
found the ſaid 10. Pounds in mony, and two Gold
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35164:4"/>
Rings which he put into his Pocket, And to Cover his
bloody Fact, Sets the houſe on fire, Concluding that
people would Judge it came by Accident and that the
two Women were Caſually burned in it, and haveing
ſet the Thatch all on fire he got away undiſcovered by
any, but it happened that a Butchers boy coming pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
by with ſome Cattel ſeeing the houſe on fire
gave notice to the neighbours, who came in ſo Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
that in ſhort time they quenched it, and then
found the two Bodies, their hinder-parts allmoſt
Burnt to peices, but their Heads and ſhoulders un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht,
ſo that their gaping Wounds ſtill with freſh
Blood plainly appeared, whence it was evident that
they muſt have been Murther'd, and the Houſe ſet
on fire on purpoſe, but who ſhould do it, they were
Ignorant, till providence diſcovered it: For the
Murtherer, though before he reſolved to run quit
out of the Country, yet had not now power ſo to do,
nor yet durſt he appeare abroad, but lay Lurking in
Woods, and out-barns thereabouts, and the next
Night Robed another houſe, but met with very little
booty, his abſenting himſelf made his Maſter and all
others Conclude him the perſon guilty, and at laſt
upon ſtrict ſearch they found him on the top of an
Hay-Reeke, and look the money and Rings in his
Pocket, Upon his Examination before a Juſtice, he
Confeſſed the whole matter; and being Committed
to Goal, was at the Quarter-ſeſſions of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi>
Condemned to dye, and be Hanged up in Chains
near the place where he did the Fact; Before his
