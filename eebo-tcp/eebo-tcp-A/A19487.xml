            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This emboldeneth mee to offer to your Highnesse patronage this little Treatise which first I dedicated to your Highnesse honorable seruant, of good memory, the Earle of Dunbar, and presented to himselfe in writing, while hee was here in this Country, but before it could be finished by the Printer, he was taken away
<pb facs="tcp:9459:3"/>
by bitter and vntimely Death. For so, after that memorable saying of <hi>Plinius secundus,</hi> iustly may I tell it. <hi>Mihi acerba semper, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matura videtur esse mors illorum, qui immortale aliquid parant: Nam qui voluptatibus dediti quasi in diem viuunt, viuendi causas quotidiè finiunt, qui vero posteros cogitant, &amp; memoriam su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<q>————<hi>Nam vulneramentis Intempestiuè, qui mouet illa, nouat.</hi>
               </q>
Yet when all is reckoned to the vttermost, our account in the end is, that we can lose nothing by the death of any, so long as we enioy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of your Highnesse life, which I pray God may be long and happy, exceeding all our dayes, who from our young yeares hath felt the sweetnesse of your Maiesties most wise, and peaceable regiment. For what he was, eyther for grauity in conuersation, or wisedome in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, he was it by your Highnesse instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as a Disciple trayned vp by your selfe: who out of the treasure of your Princely minde can imprint the like stampe of good things in others, which you did in him, if so be (which

I must craue pardon to speake) your Highnesse fore-gather with such another obiect, as hee was, whereupon to worke. For as the Sunne in the firmament suppose he shine alike vpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Palaces at one time, yet doth most illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate those, which haue most ample windowes to receiue his light: so that if any of them be not sufficiently lightsome, the fault is not in the Sunne, but in themselues, for hee is alike good vnto them all, if they were alike capable of his goodnesse, so is it with a King in the middest of his Nobles, Counsailours, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall seruants. But least I goe beyond my line, profering to stretch mine arme higher then my stature may carie it, I returne to my humble supplication, that seeing he who now translated to the Court of heauen, leades there a happy and blessed life, hath no other meane on earth, whereby to liue among men but by his good name. Your Maiestie who gaue him a wealthy and honourable life for his vertue, while he was in the body, will continue to keepe life to his name, when himselfe is gone. For thus euen in the estimation of Ethniques who had but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures light, is <hi>alterum patrimonium,</hi> which in this earth is the iust reward of a vertuous life;

And for this cause that your Highnesse vvill

            <p>For your life toward God hath beene religious, as the priuate exercises of godlinesse, customable to your Lordship by your selfe and with your fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and the publique reuerence of the word, and obseruance of the Saboth in euerie place doth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. Toward his Maiestie faithfull, from a most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection, from whom yee haue learned to rule others, by learning to obey him: <hi>Optime e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim imperandi rationem tenent, quieam bene parendo didicerunt.</hi> In your selfe a rare exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of humilitie in honour, of grauitie, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and sobrietie in the middest of wealth, and that in all the parts of your Lordships behauiour. Which is not a small thing, if it be considered, that as men of honour, when they doe euill <hi>plus exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo peccant, quam culpa,</hi> are more hurtfull by their euill example, then by their euill deede; so if they liue godly, they doe not so much good to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by well doing, as to others by their good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Toward euill men a iustitiar, not flexible

from equity for feare or fauour. Toward good men courteous. Toward all men conscientious, that in no part of the land is there any found to murmure, or charge your Lordship with vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, vnlesse it be such who in their blindnesse thinke the seruite of God according to his word a seruitude and bondage, not knowing <hi>quod sic ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uire Deo, est regnare.</hi> And esteemes the law of a lawfull King a tyrannie, who because they would doe all things <hi>per vim potius quam virtutem,</hi> by violence rather then vertue; whose pleasure is to liue controling all, vncontroled of any, like <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods,</hi> or the <hi>sonnes of Anak,</hi> therefore they grudge as Malecontents, that the law of the King is not, as <hi>Anarxexes</hi> spake of the lawes of <hi>Solon,</hi> like the webbes of the Ettercope, through which the greater Flyes may breake at their pleasure: where as among all reasonable men, it hath euer been receiued, as a principle, <hi>beatam esse rempub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam, in qualex dominatur,</hi> that the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is happy, in which the law hath dominion.</p>
            <p>But to returne to that which of all humane te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie is the greatest, the honorable estimation his Maiestie these thirtie yeares by-gone without repenting hath had of your Lordship, stands in the hearts of all his well affected subiects, as a great commendation of your qualities, for, <hi>The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of a King is in a wise Seruant</hi> (said <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) and the honour whereunto your Lordship by

his Maiestie is preferred, is esteemed most iustly so much the more honourable, for that the Patron of vertue, for vertues sake hath aduanced you to it. Thus by a right <hi>Marcellus,</hi> hath your way to the Temple of honour, beene by the Temple of vertue.</p>
            <p>For this moderation of life so euident in your Lordship, as I haue said, euen among the naturall Philosophers was accounted for true wisedome, and learning. The practise of that golden pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Nosce teipsum,</hi> they esteemed to consist in the gouernment of a man his person, and actions according to the rule of vertue, this they called the matter of wisedome, without which others, were they neuer so learned, were accounted to haue had, but the words of wisedome, such as many now a dayes we haue among vs, with whom it fareth, as of olde with <hi>Thales Milesius,</hi> who going out on a night to his contemplation, while hee gazed on the starres, hee fell into the ditch. Many such Disciples I say hath he left behind him, who looke so high with their learning, that they take no heede to their owne feete, to gouerne their waies with knowledge, they thinke it sufficient to commend them, that they haue trauailed through many parts of the world, haue read much, and gotten some introduction to Sciences, when as in the meane time they neuer trauailed within themselues, neuer entred into their owne
<pb facs="tcp:9459:5"/>
hearts, neuer read the booke of their owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and haue not learned to know, farre lesse to rule themselues by wisedome.</p>
            <p>But leauing them, I trust your Lordship will still continue to seeke the perfection of true wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and knowledge there, where ye haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the beginnings, for as <hi>the beginning of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is the feare of the Lord,</hi> said <hi>Salomon,</hi> so said he also, <hi>The end of all is, feare God, and keepe his commandements:</hi> this is the whole duety of man.</p>
            <p>For this cause haue I here presented to your Honour this Description of a Christian, which not without great labour I haue collected these tenne or twelue yeares by-gone, out of the word of God, that in it your Lordship may see, what manner of man a true Christian is, how his heart is continually at his right hand, his minde vpon good things, his will waiting vpon his superiour, how a good conscience is his Paradise on earth, out of which hee will not goe, how his eye is in his forehead, vsing so the time present, that hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides for the time to come, thinking on his end, and fore-seeing that wrath which is to fall on the wicked, that he may eschew it: how he refraines his speech, when time of silence is? how he speakes in season the words of knowledge, how he ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his pathes, and ordereth all his way with equitie. In a word, how he is restored by grace
<pb facs="tcp:9459:6"/>
in the regeneration to the image of God, which was his most ancient glory communicated to him by his Maker in his first creation, as more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly will appeare in the <hi>Anatomie</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>In reading whereof, where your Lordship findes a conformity with it, I am sure it will be the matter of your ioy, and thanksgiuing to God, for the beginnings of his grace in you, where not, I hope it will encrease your Christian care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to a further perfection, vnto the which these prayers interiected betweene Gods precepts, and the Christians practise in euery Chapter, for your Lordships speciall vse, I trust in his grace shall be profitable for you. I haue knowne by occasion that your Lordship makes conscience of the exercise of prayer in priuate, and delights in it. I haue therefore taken the more paines to let your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship see, how God in his word teaches his children to pray in the <hi>language of Canaan,</hi> that is, in such words as are dyted by his owne Spirit, and so comming from himselfe, we may be sure will be the more welcome, and acceptable to him againe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered in a golden censure, which is a heart purified by faith, through the mediation of Iesus Christ our Lord.</p>
            <p>Accept therfore (right Noble Lord) this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Man, who as one, who being likest vnto that which you are, at least which through grace
<pb facs="tcp:9459:6"/>
would be, lookes for protection vnder your sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and offereth himselfe ready to recompence your Lordship with some comfort and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at such time as your Lorship may haue the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to conferre with him. Thus from mine heart praying vnto God for the continuance of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with you, which is the fountaine of all prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, both in this life, and in the life to come. I rest.</p>

righteousnesse, must proue vs to be the children of God, <hi>For if wee say wee haue fellowship with God, and walke in darknes, we lie, and do not truly,</hi> and <hi>if any man be in Christ Iesus he must become a new creature,</hi> let vs studie to proue our new generation by our new man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, conforming our selues to the rule of a Christian conuersation. A patterne and example whereof I haue gathered out of holy Scripture, and proposed vnto thee, wherein thou shalt see first how the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian who by his first birth was borne a Naturall man, by his second becomes a Christian, with such other things as with his new birth he receiues to make him a new man. Secondly, what is the disposition of his inward man, by which hee walkes with God. And thirdly, the disposition of his outward man, by which he walkes among men, and that in all the points of his conuersation both inward and outward. Euery one whereof as ye haue them set downe particularly in seuerall Chapters, so doth euery Chapter consist of these foure things. First, Gods precept to the Christian: secondly, the Christians prayer to God: thirdly, his practise of both: and these three haue you set downe in words of holy Scripture alanerly. The fourth is, in the end of euery Chapter some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations teaching vs how to make our owne profit of the words of God. This is the order I haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued here: for the Christian, because hee knowes that he is bound to liue to the Lord, and not to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, doth in all his waies set before him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of his God. And next, because hee knowes his owne Naturall inability to fulfill these commandements, he turneth all the precepts of God into prayers, the vse whereof I hope in all the parts of thy life, shall not be vnprofitable for thee. And
<pb facs="tcp:9459:10"/>
last of all, hee liues in a continuall practise of those du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ties of godlinesse which God in his word hath commanded him, and he himselfe doth pray for.</p>
            <p>Now in the end I haue onely to obuiate two sorts of men: by the one it is surmized that I haue plowed with the Heifer of another, specially of <hi>Cashmannus,</hi> who hath written before me, <hi>de nouo homine:</hi> by the other it may be obiected that I haue presented an imperfect image of a Christian, and haue left out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which profitably might haue beene poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out concerning him. For the first, as I giue thanks to God for the labours of that worthy man: so if I had borrowed any thing from him, I would neuer thinke shame to confesse it: <hi>nam ingenui pudoris est, vt ait</hi> Plinius, <hi>fateri per quos profecerimus, &amp; haec quasi merces authori iure optimo pensitanda est, ne fures esse videamur:</hi> but the truth is, that many yeares before he came in this Country, this <hi>Anatomie</hi> was drawne and portraited, as now you see it.

And therefore had I rather by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of some good, lay open my infirmities to the censure of men, then to hide by idlenesse my talent in the earth, and so to incurre the indignation of my Maister.

Secondly, it is called the old man, in respect of the new man arising to succeed in his roome, to the possession of soule and bodie, which before we possessed by him. And thirdly, because in the godly this corruption waxeth weake and infirme, wearing daily neerer and neerer to death, after the manner of old men.</p>
                  <p>But it is to be marked, that in these two last<note place="margin">14 Sinfull nature is neuer old in the wicked.</note> respects, sinfull corruption of nature is named the old man, in men regenerate onely, and in no other; for in men vnregenerate, their corruption shall for euer possesse them, it increases vpon them, and is yong, strong, and liuely, euen when they themselues are weake, and wearing to the graue.</p>

As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> grieued Israel forest, when they stroue fastest to libertie; and as that dumb spirit tormented that yong man worst, when he saw he was to be cast out of him, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 25. So Sathan troubles the godly most heauily, when hee sees the time of their deliuerance from his seruitude and bondage neerest.</p>
                  <p>But our comfort is, that God is faithfull, as he begins the worke, so will he finish and end it:<note place="margin">17 But he fights in vaine, for God wil finish it.</note> Strong is Sathan indeed, but Christ our Lord is that <hi>stronger one.

Surely they doe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dishonour the Lord, who in their words say they are the sonnes of God, and yet in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions resemble the image of Sathan.</p>
                  <p>The Regeneration againe of the body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists<note place="margin">19 Regeneration of the body consists in two.</note> also in two; first, in a right vsing of the members of our body, as weapons of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to serue God, which we are taught to doe by grace: Next, in a full deliuerance of them from mortalitie and corruption.</p>
                  <p>Of this, it is cleare that the Regeneration of<note place="margin">20 Regeneration will not be perfected til the resurrection.</note> the whole man will not be perfected till the day of resurrection, called for that cause by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, the Regeneration, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 28.

                  <p>The third thing required, is attention: for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen<note place="margin">18 Thirdly, that the heart be stablished by attention and consideration.</note> as a tumbling and rowling eye seeth not those things which are before it; so a wandring mind not stablished by consideration and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine contemplation, cannot see the Lord.</p>

                  <p>But miserable are the wicked, for they sauour<note place="margin">22 To the naturall man nothing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours well but dongue.</note> onely those things which are after the flesh, like those vncleane beasts in the Law, which creep with all their foure vpon earth, senting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but dongue, the puddle being more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to such filthy swine then the pearle. Woe be to them, for euen in the Gospel of grace they smell no other thing but the sauour of death.</p>

Seeing we see that the first
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:9459:31"/>
stands effectuall vnto this day, shall we thinke that the second can be ineffectuall? No indeed, he is not blessed of the Lord, who growes not in grace.</p>
                  <p>For it is promised vnder Christs kingdome,<note place="margin">4 For growth is a grace promised vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the kingdome of Christ.</note>

And except we finde this change wrought in vs, we cannot as yet say that we are translated into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The growth of a Christian is expressed in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">5 The growth of a Christian compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the growth of a childe vnto an olde man.</note> Scripture by sundry similitudes: first hee is compared to a childe that growes till hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a man. It is thought strange to see a man of many yeares, who yet in stature, strength, and wit, went neuer beyond the measure of a childe, such a one is counted for a monster, and truly no better is the carelesse Christian, who after so many yeares profession, growes not in grace nor knowledge, but still remaines a childe in vnderstanding.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he is compared to a trauailer that<note place="margin">6 Compared second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9459:31"/>
to it: so the Christian forgetting that which is behinde, endeuors himselfe to that which is before, following hard towards the marke, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Iesus. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
                  <p>But the wicked, <hi>ambulant in circuitu,</hi> they still<note place="margin">7 The miserable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, in which they labour continually without making ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther progresse or profit.</note> goe on in a compasse, walking round about in the circle of their sinnes, from one to another, and returning backe againe to the same, like the blinded horse, who labours and drawes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Mill continually, but at euening is in the same place, wherein he was in the morning. So they being borne in sinne, goe about in sin, like blinded captiues of Sathan, hauing no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refreshment, but to exchange one sinne with another, and at last they die in their sinnes, for whom it had beene good that they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beene borne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, his growth is compared to the<note place="margin">8 The growth of a Christian compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thirdly to the growth of a tree.</note> growth of a tree, which being planted by the riuers of waters, hath abundance of moisture and sappe, and bringeth out fruit continually, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. specially to the Palme tree, which all seasons of the yeare is both flowrishing and fruitfull, as Naturalists write of it.</p>

cornes, so doth the Christian by degrees grow to his perfection.</p>
                  <p>And fiftly the Christians grouth is expressed<note place="margin">10 Compared fiftly to the rising of the Sunne till the noon day.</note> by the rising and ascending of the Sunne, which encreaseth and shineth more and more to the noone-tide of the day. For as for a declining time, or an euening, wherein his light should die out, the Christian by the grace of God shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer know it, for he that illuminateth him is that bright and excellent <hi>Sunne of righteousnesse,</hi> who is euer gloriously rising, and neuer declining nor going downe.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, hee is compared to a burning<note place="margin">11 And last to the light of the golden candlesticke conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually supplyed by Oyle.</note> Lampe, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. or to that golden candlestick whereunto through the seauen pipes of gold, Oyle is carried continually from the two Oliues that stand before the ruler of the world, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4 2. whereof it comes to passe, that his light can<note place="margin">Zach. 4. 2.</note> neuer faile.</p>

                  <head>THE OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>THE Christian yee see hath foure suites of<note place="margin">1 The Christians foure suites of apparrell seueral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered.</note> Apparrell; three whereof hee puts on ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily in this life, the fourth is his holy dayes garment: for when the weeke of his warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare is ended, and the Sabboth comes, which is the day of the consummation of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with Christ, after which shall neuer come a night; then shall his Father cause his best robe to be brought out, and shall couer him with it.</p>
                  <p>His first garment is the garment of Christs<note place="margin">2 The garment of imputed righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse defends him from Gods wrath.</note> righteousnesse, which on the part of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imputed to him, that is, by the free gift of God, giuen to be his owne; and on his part, receiued by faith, and couered therewith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends him against the stormy and consuming wrath of God.</p>
                  <p>By this righteousnesse of Christ is not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that holinesse of his diuine nature, which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:9459:36"/>
is incommunicable, neyther that righteousnes<note place="margin">3 By this righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nor humane nature.</note> of his humane Nature, consisting in a perfect obseruance of the Law Morall, which hee neuer transgressed in thought, word, nor deed, and by vertue whereof Christ the man was sufficiently able to inherit life by the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the couenant of worke: <hi>Doe this and liue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that righteousnesse which hee as our<note place="margin">4 But that acquired righteousnes which he purchased by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> suffering.</note> Mediator, by fulfilling that singular Law of a Redeemer, hath acquired and purchased, that hee might communicate it to his brethren, for their saluation, who had none of their owne by which they could be saued.</p>
                  <p>For this singular law of a Redeemer, which<note place="margin">5 Of the singular law of a Redeemer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vpon Christ.</note> was neuer imposed to man, nor Angell, but onely to Iesus Christ, required that he should loue God and his brethren in such sort, as to beare in his owne body the punishment of their sinnes, and satisfie the iustice of God to the vttermost for them, that so the praise both of Iustice and Mercy might be reserued vnto God.</p>
                  <p>If all <hi>Adams</hi> posteritie had perished in sin,<note place="margin">6 How the praise both of Gods mercy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and iustice is preserued by Christ.</note> where should haue beene the praise of Gods mercy? and if their sinne had not beene pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, where should haue beene the praise of his iustice? but the Lord Iesus hath vindicated the glory of both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:9459:37"/>For this law of a Redeemer, found out by the<note place="margin">7 How Christ hath fulfilled that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Law of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, to purchase vs a righteousnesse by which we might be saued.</note> meruailous wisedome of God, as the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus did willingly accept it for the loue hee bare to the glory of his Father, and saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his brethren, so hath hee perfectly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled it. In his blessed body hee bare our sinnes on the cursed tree; the chastisement of our peace was laid vpon him, hee hath satisfied the Iustice of his Father, and so hath purchased a righteousnesse, not for himselfe, hee needed it not, but that as I said, hee might communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it to his brethren.</p>
                  <p>And this garment of righteousnesse, is so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect<note place="margin">8 This righteousnes is perfect, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers all our filthy nakednesse.</note> that it couers all our nakednesse from head to foot, both of the Soule and Body, for in both he suffered. His blessed head was crowned with thornes, that hee might satisfie for the proud imaginations of our braine: His hands and feete, which neuer offended, were pierced with Nayles, that hee might satisfie for the vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous deedes wee haue done with our hands and feet, and so of the rest of his sufferings.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Iacoh</hi> couered with the garment of his<note place="margin">9 How by it, wee are not onely pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of euill, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so blessed with all good.</note> elder brother got the blessing, so wee couered with the sweet smelling garment of our elder Brother the Lord Iesus, are acceptable to God, for in him the Father is well pleased.</p>
                  <p>The second garment which vnder this the Christian puts on, is the garment of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9459:37"/>
compact as wee said of many vertues,<note place="margin">10 Of the garment of inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, wrought in vs by Christ.</note> both these at one instant are giuen to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, the one defends him from the wrath of God, the other sanctifieth and reformeth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Nature.</p>
                  <p>Other garments may couer the nakednesse,<note place="margin">11 For Christ as hee couers our naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so hee cures our diseases.</note> and filthie sores of the bodie, but cannot cure them. This garment both couers and cures our filthy nakednes: it turnes our sicknes into health: our darknesse into light: for whosoeuer puts on the Lord Iesus for his righteousnesse to iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, puts him on also for holinesse to sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; so full of Grace and Vertue is the Lord Iesus, that not onely by the merit of his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings doth hee pacifie the wrath of God towards all them in whom hee is, but also by his vertue sanctifieth them, by creating a new minde and a new heart in them, hee maketh them new creatures.</p>
                  <p>The third is, a suite of complete armour, most<note place="margin">12 This garment of holinesse cannot be kept without the whole complete armour.</note> necessarie for the Christian, for Sathan enuying this new happinesse of man, endeuours continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to defile, or rent in pieces our garment of holinesse: sometime hee assaults our Patience: sometime our Temperance, &amp;c. so that it is not possible for the Christian to keepe vnviolated the seuerall pieces of his holy garment, vnlesse hee put on the whole complete armour of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:9459:38"/>The seuerall pieces of armour, requisite to<note place="margin">13 Why this armour is called the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God.</note> preserue the seuerall graces of the Spirit, are set downe, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. called there the armour of God, both because it is that God furnisheth vs with them, and also because no other then these can serue vs in the spirituall warre-fare.</p>
                  <p>For in the bodily war-fare, men common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">14 Wee must not sight with our enemies by such armour as they vse against vs.</note> doe resist their aduersaries by such weapons as their enemies doe impugne them with all: but in the spirituall, if wee sight against Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than in his Instruments, with such weapons as they vse in sighting against vs, the aduersarie shall easily ouercome vs.</p>
                  <p>And therefore as <hi>Dauid</hi> cast from him the<note place="margin">15 As <hi>Dauid</hi> fought with <hi>Goliah</hi> with armour far vnlike to his.</note> armour of <hi>Saul,</hi> and tooke him to weapons farre vnlike those that <hi>Goliah</hi> brought against him: so must wee, when wee goe out in the name of God against that vncleane vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised Philistim, cast from vs carnall weapons, and take vs to the armour of God, if we would be sure of victory.</p>
                  <p>That is, wee must not render euill for euill,<note place="margin">16 So must we ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come euill in the wicked by good.</note> nor rebuke for rebuke; but if our enemies curse vs, let vs blesse them; if they persecute vs, let vs pray for them, that so we may ouercome euill with good.</p>
                  <p>The last garment is his Sabboth dayes<note place="margin">17 Of his garment in the life to come.</note> garment, which in this life is not put vpon him, but is kept in his Fathers Treasure till

                  <head>THE OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>AS in the first creation, God began at the<note place="margin">1 In the new creation God begins at the light.</note> light, so in the second, he begins at the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of the mind; and the mind changed and renued by the Lord, worketh a change also of the will, and affections.</p>
                  <p>Naturally the minde of man is darke, proud,<note place="margin">2 The minde of man by nature is, first, darke; secondly, proud; thirdly, prophane.</note> and prophane; the ignorance that is in it, being both a punishment of mans first sinne, a sinne it selfe, and the cause of all other sinne.</p>
                  <p>For man aspiring to an higher knowledge<note place="margin">3 Some knowledge left in the minde of apostate man to make him inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable.</note> then God vouchsafed vpon him, lost the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge wherewith God endued him by creation, except some generall notices of good and euill, which like sparkles of fire couered with the ashes of mans corrupt nature, are left in him to make him inexcusable.</p>
                  <p>By his first creation he was made a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion<note place="margin">4 Man by his first fall is become a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of beasts.</note> of Angels, but falling from that honour, hee became a companion of beasts: and hath so far degenerated from that which God made him, that hee hath assumed the very properties
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:9459:46"/>
of beasts, wherefore also God giues vnto him<note place="margin">Bern. in Cant. Serm. 53.</note> the name of a beast: <hi>Quidenim, an non tibi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur ipsis bestijs bestialior homo ratione vigens, &amp; ratione non viuens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now seeing restitution is proclaimed<note place="margin">5 If now he fall by despising grace, he shall goe to a worse estate.</note> in Christ, how carefully should hee take heede to himselfe, that hee despise not grace which is offered: by his first fall hee fell from light to darknesse, his second fall shall cast him into vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darknesse: the transgression of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes, made him a companion of beasts, but the contempt of the couenant of grace, shall make him a companion of damned Diuels.</p>
                  <p>And as this ignorance is a punishment of<note place="margin">6 Ignorance is, 1. A Stone. 2. A Punishment of sinne.</note> mans first sinne, so is it also a sinne, as is euident out of 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>The Lord shall appeare in sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire to render vengeance vnto all them that know not God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is a cause of other sinnes, as we<note place="margin">7 3. A Cause of sinne</note> are taught by the Apostle. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles wer strangers from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them. As <hi>Balaam</hi> went on blindlings in an euill course, because he saw not the Angell standing with a naked sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, so the wicked walke boldly in their sins, because they know not the danger thereof.</p>
                  <p>A body destitute of eyes, cannot discerne the day from the night, a friend from a foe,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:9459:47"/>
nor the pit from the plaine; no more can a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin">8 A cause also of a most fearefull dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> minde discerne the manifold snares of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, but as our Sauiour saith, <hi>where the blinde leads the blinde, both of them must fall at length</hi>

                     <hi>into the ditch:</hi> so where a blinded minde is the directer of a corrupted will, what can the end be but fearefull damnation? and yet no better is mans miserable estate by Nature.</p>
                  <p>But this naturall ignorance is remoued in<note place="margin">9 Light created in the minde by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</note> the regeneration, and a holy light created in the minde of man, which the Lord workes by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as hee opened the eyes of that blind man<note place="margin">Math. 9. 29.</note> by degrees.</p>
                  <p>And this light as it increaseth in the minde,<note place="margin">10 Euery knowledge doth not sanctifie.</note> hath alwaies following it holinesse and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; not that euery knowledge doth sanctifie and humble him that hath it: for albeit the Lord il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminateth euery one that comes into the world yet doth hee not sanctifie euery one; yea, there is knowledge in many which doth not hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but puffe vp; not conuert, but conuince.</p>
                  <p>The Gentiles were endued with great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<note place="margin">11 Gentiles and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Christians shut vp the light in the prison of their vnrighteousnesse.</note> of God the Creator, by the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but they with-held it in vnrighteousnesse, to their iuster condemnation: the bastard Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians of our time, are endued also with the knowledge of God the Redeemer, by the light of the word, but it is likewise shut vp in the prison of their inordinate affections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:9459:47"/>For either in their actions they neuer seeke<note place="margin">12 For either they seeke not the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of light, or else they doe against it.</note> counsell at the light, which God hath put in their mindes, or else if at any time the light that is in them warne them of the good which they should do, and reproue them for the euill that they haue done, it is oppressed and borne downe by the tyranny of their sinfull affections.</p>
                  <p>But this liuely knowledge created in our<note place="margin">13 Liuely knowledge workes humilitie, and banisheth a three-fold pride.</note> mindes by God in the regeneration, doth work in vs both humilitie and holinesse: For first it banisheth out of our mind that threefold natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pride which is in it, to wit, Blinde pride, Foolish pride, and Vaine pride.</p>
                  <p>Blinde pride, is when <hi>decepta &amp; deceptrix co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitatio,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">14 Blinde Pride.</note> the deceiuing and deceiued cogitation of mans minde makes him to thinke hee is far better then indeed hee is; and this may be seene in many, who are proud without any cause at all.<note place="margin">15 Foolish Pride.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Foolish pride, is when a man is puft vp with that which he hath, as if it were his owne; this is, as if the Axe should take to it selfe the praise of hewing, or the Pen should vsurpe the praise of writing or the Wall should waxe proud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Sunne shines vpon it: so is it with the man who waxeth proud because God hath loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon him, and doth any notable worke by him.</p>
                  <p>Vaine Pride, is when a man is puft vp with<note place="margin">16 Vaine Pride.</note> that which hee hath indeed, but it is without

him, like <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> glorying in his gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Image, and worldlings proud of their gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious apparrell: surely it is the pittifull folly of a base minde, for a man to thinke that any thing can make him great, which is lesse then himselfe: but it is the recompence of mans er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that because he lost the glory which God gaue him, he vainely seekes his glory in things which cannot profit him.<note place="margin">17 Pride both a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full euill.</note>

                  <p>But our Sauiour by his example hath taught<note place="margin">18 Humilitie taught vs by the example of our Sauiour.</note> vs, that an humble minde is the way to an high and glorious estate, therefore it is recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to vs in that pretext; <hi>Let the same minde be</hi>

                  <p>Neither peace nor grace can be in that soule,<note place="margin">19 No peace can be to a proud heart.</note> in which is not Humilitie: Peace cannot be to him, because hee seeketh his owne glory, and not the glory of God, therefore doth the Lord alwayes resist him; yea, at peace with himselfe can he not be, but as a tree on the toppe of a mountaine, which is tossed with euery winde, so is a proud man perturbed with euery acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that fals out contrary to his humour, but humilitie is the resting bed of the soule, <hi>Learne of me</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>that I am lowly and meeke, and</hi>

                  <p>COnscience is to be considered in her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">1 Conscience consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Nature.</note> and Office. As for the nature of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, it is better felt then it can be discerned: for in it wee feele not onely an vnderstanding power, as is in the minde, but also an agent or working power, as is in the will; so that it is not a faculty Theoricke onely, as the vnderstanding, nor practicke onely, as the will, but compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and mixt.</p>
                  <p>And that it is a different facultie from them<note place="margin">2 It is a different fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie from the will and minde.</note> both is euident by this, that it sits in the soule
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:9459:56"/>
as a Controller both of the thoughts, of the minde, and desires of the will.</p>
                  <p>As for the office of Conscience, we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine<note place="margin">3 Conscience consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Office.</note> it thus. It is a spirituall iudge, depute by God the supreame iudge, and placed in the soule of man, to determine of all his actions, with him, to excuse him, or against him, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him, and that for the conuersion of some, and conuiction of others.</p>
                  <p>First then it is Gods deputie which vnder him<note place="margin">4 The word of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science imports that another with it is vpon our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.</note> houlds court in the Soule of man: for euen the word of Conscience imports that there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it vpon the knowledge of our secrets; Science may be of one alone, but Conscience is of moe then one which are priuie to the same knowledge.</p>
                  <p>The same is euident from this, that Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence<note place="margin">5 God and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence know our deeds together and will iudge them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note> is said to beare witnesse; where, of necessitie wee must distinguish betweene him to whom the witnesse is borne, and him of whom it is borne: the witnesse bearer is Conscience, the partie of whom the testimonie is made, is man. The great Iudge, who together with Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence knowes our secrets is God: wherefore also Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> couples God and Conscience toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for they know our deeds together, and will iudge them together.</p>
                  <p>That Conscience is Gods deputie, it warnes<note place="margin">6 Conscience is Gods deputie, and therefore not to be despised.</note> vs, not to despise the iudgement of Conscience,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9459:56"/>
for the Lord in the end will ratifie the sentence of Coscience. If Conscience vpon light con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn vs, God who is greater then Conscience,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 20.</note> and knowes much more then Conscience doth know, will much more condemne vs.</p>
                  <p>An example whereof wee may see cleerely<note place="margin">7 The sentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Conscience will be confirmed by God.</note> in <hi>Adam,</hi> who immediately after that hee had sinned ranne away, and hid himselfe among the bushes: No man pursued him; no Angell reprooued him, the Lord was not yet come to iudge him, onely he found himselfe condemned in the iudgement of his owne conscience, which he could not abide, and the Lord when he comes condemnes him for the same fact, for which his conscience had condemned him before.</p>
                  <p>And from this also that Conscience is Gods<note place="margin">8 The maiestie and authoritie of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, it stands against all the world.</note> deputie proceeds the authoritie of Conscience, whose sentence is pronounced with such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie and power, that albeit the whole world would oppone vnto it, yet neither are they able to revoke it, nor resist it. Wherefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> sets<note place="margin">1 Corinth. 4. 4.</note> the sentence of his Conscience that did iustifie him, against the calumnies of all men whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that did condemne him.</p>

                  <p>As for the first, we may feele in experience, that wee doe nothing, which Conscience writes

                  <p>As for the second, like as Conscience know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">14 In euery action Conscience deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines with vs or against vs.</note> and registreth all that wee doe, so in euery action, it determineth eyther with vs, or against vs, accusing or excusing vs.</p>
                  <p>And in this determination Conscience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth<note place="margin">15 In determining of our doings Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence proceedes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to light.</note> according to her light, which is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; either the light of Nature, or the light of the Word.

                  <p>

                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:9459:59"/>And therefore seeing wee can neyther get<note place="margin">22 Good to agree vvith conscience in time.</note> Conscience corrupted to conceale our faults, neither yet smothered &amp; put out by any length of time, as is manifest in <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren, whose<note place="margin">Gen. 42. 21.</note> Consciences troubled them in Egypt, for that crueltie which many yeares before they had done against their brother in Canaan: but that still if wee doe against God, Conscience will speake against vs, it is good for vs to agree with Conscience in time, and in all our wayes to seeke her approbation.</p>
                  <p>Now the ends for which God hath vnder<note place="margin">23 For what ends is Conscience placed in man.</note> himselfe deputed Conscience in the soule of man, are the conuersion of his owne, and iust conuiction of his enemies: for herein greatly appeareth his equitie towards all men, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall loue and fauour towards his owne.</p>
                  <p>As the Lord hath protested by an oath that<note place="margin">24 Conscience proues that God desireth not the death of a sinner.</note> hee desireth not the death of a sinner; so by his deed he declares it in this, that he hath put in man a warner to fore-tell vnto him that heauie wrath, whereinto he will fall, vnlesse in time he repent, and turne from his euill wayes.</p>
                  <p>And wonderfull it is how this shall conuince<note place="margin">25 The vvicked who liue against Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, vvill before conuicted.</note> the wicked man in the houre of death, when their conscience shall stand vp before the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Iudge, and testifie against him in this manner; O Lord I haue giuen this man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as thou deputed me, warning euery day

for his sinnes, and hath terrified him for them, but hee would not receiue my correction. Oh that impenitent men could consider how this despising of Conscience shall be a great aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of their iudgement!</p>
                  <p>But on the other part, to the children of God,<note place="margin">26 Vse of Conscience to the godly is: 1.

                  <p>Secondly, when they goe wrong, it is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine<note place="margin">27 2.

                  <p>Thus we see how it is a great benefit to Gods<note place="margin">28 A feeling consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence a great benefit to Gods children.</note> children, to haue a liuing, feeling, and wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conscience: for eyther it keepes them that they do not euill, or that they continue not in it, as we may see in <hi>Dauid,</hi> whose Conscience was more troubled for cutting the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then <hi>Saul</hi> was for cutting off the liues of fourescore seruants of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Wheras on the contrary, the Lord in his anger<note place="margin">29 A conscience past feeling is vvrath to the vvicked.</note> suffers Sathan so to benumbe the conscience of the wicked, as if they were burnt with an hot

                     <hi>are in heauinesse through manifold tentations:</hi> the like we finde in our owne experience.</p>
                  <p>As wine failed euen in that banquet at which<note place="margin">2 Comfort is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time scant euen in the heart of the Christian.</note> Christ was present; so comfort sometime is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, euen in that heart wherein Christ dwels, but as in the one hee turned water in wine in the end, so in the other shall he turne all sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row into ioy at the last.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:9459:89"/>The causes of griefe in a Christian are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:<note place="margin">3 Causes of griefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising from our selues are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> the first is the consideration of that which wee haue beene: the second is the consideration of that which we are: the third, the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which we would be, and are not.</p>
                  <p>As for the first: so long as a man and his sin<note place="margin">4 A man so long as he is in his sinnes thinkes them no cause of griefe.</note> are one, he neither feeles the weight of it, nor the wrath that followes it, but reioyceth in that which should be the matter of his griefe, but so soone as man by grace is parted from his sin, then becomes sin a burden to him, and a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his griefe, which before was the matter of his ioy.</p>
                  <p>One example of this we haue in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who<note place="margin">5 An example hereof in <hi>Dauid.</hi>
                     </note> hauing committed adultery, and going about to cloake it with murther, was neither troubled himselfe with this abhominable sinne, nor yet would haue others troubled with it, and therfore wrote he to <hi>Ioab</hi> a command, indirectly to slay <hi>Vriah,</hi> and there withall subioyned; <hi>let not this</hi>

                     <hi>trouble thee:</hi> but how much it troubled him when God renued him by repentance, the 32. and 51. Psalmes doe testifie.</p>
                  <p>Another we haue in the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">6 Another in <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </note> who while hee was in his sinnes persecuted with pleasure the Saints of God: but when God sundred him from his sinnes, what a griefe that sinne in speciall was to him, he witnesseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; <hi>I am not</hi> (said hee) <hi>worthy to be called an</hi>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:9459:90"/>
                     <hi>Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For when the Lord looseth a sinner from his<note place="margin">7 When God looses a man from sin, he binds him to an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of sinne.</note> sinne, hee bindeth him to a perpetuall hatred of his sinne: and therefore is it, that when hee hath taken away the guiltinesse of a sinne, yet hee will haue the memory thereof to remaine: for as thornes which are euill in the garden, are<note place="margin">Why the memory of sinne remaineth when the guilt thereof is remoued.</note> good in the hedge to fence it; so sinnes which are euill in the affection, hindring the growth of grace in the soule, are good in the memorie, to humble vs for our former sinnes, and guard vs against sinnes to come.</p>
                  <p>And this godly sorrow for sinne committed,<note place="margin">8 Persian Kings could suffer no mourners in their presence, but it is not so with God.</note> being no other but the dolors of our new birth, should not discourage Gods children, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are to be comforted with it. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord our God is best pleased with vs, when wee are most displeased with our selues. Mourners might not stand in presence of the Persian Kings, therefore <hi>Mordecai</hi> clad in sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, got not entrance at the Kings gate; but whom doth the Lord comfort? is it not those who mourne? to whom grants hee most familiar accesse? surely, to those that are most entirely humbled and cast cowne before him.</p>
                  <p>Then are wee most welcome to God, and<note place="margin">9 The Lord liketh our mourning countenance best.</note> our face most pleasant vnto him, when it is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with the teares of repentance: therefore is it his comfortable speech to his Church, <hi>My</hi>

                     <hi>shew me thy face.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the second: the consideration of that<note place="margin">10 The Christians tentations are a griefe to him.</note> which wee are, is also to a Christian the matter of his griefe; first, in regard of our continuall temptations to sinne, Sathan euer seeking to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his old possession in vs. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Israel, so Sathan followeth the redeemed man, doing all that he can to bring him backe againe to his former seruitude and bondage.<note place="margin">11 And his manifold crosses.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, also in regard of our manifold crosses and troubles which like vnto the waues of the sea, one after another, come vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>And herewith also comes in the troublesome<note place="margin">12 And the troubles of Gods Church.</note> estate of Gods Church: as good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was not so merry for the preferment he had in the Court of King <hi>Artashashte,</hi> as sorrowfull for the desolation of Ierusalem; <hi>why should not</hi> (said he)<note place="margin">Nehem. 2. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>my countenance be sad, when the citie of my fathers lyeth waste?</hi> so is it with the Christian, though his owne particular estate, be neuer so good, yet is it his griefe to see the Church of God in trouble.</p>
                  <p>The third matter of our griefe ariseth of the<note place="margin">13 And the long delay of that promised Kingdome.</note> consideration of that which wee are not, but would be. The Christian hath some liuely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taste of the excellent pleasures of the life to come, and therefore it is a griefe to him to be holden from it, and a ioy to remoue toward it;
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:9459:91"/>

                  <p>The health of conscience consists in these two; first, in a sense of Gods mercy pardoning our

                  <p>And the disease or trouble of conscience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth<note place="margin">3 Where-from the disease of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence proceeds, to wit.</note> from the contrary euill: for if the soule be forsaken for a time, it becomes vnable for spirituall exercise.

                  <p>Whereupon there followeth such a distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature<note place="margin">5 Trouble of minde distempers the whole body.</note> of the whole body, that as <hi>Dauid</hi> felt in himselfe, the moisture thereof is turned into the drought of Sommer: the reason hereof is<note place="margin">Psal. 32.</note> giuen by <hi>Bernard,</hi> the soule hath vnder it a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,<note place="margin">Bern. in paruis. serm. 48.</note> which it gouernes, aboue it the Lord, in<note place="margin">August. in Ioan. tract. 19.</note> whom it rests. <hi>Viuificat Anima &amp; viuificatur:</hi> if that life by which the soule liueth relinquish it, that is, if the help and comfort of Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

                  <p>But the other is worse, when not onely hee<note place="margin">7 The second to a fearefull consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> forsaketh them, but also as it were, doth pursue them with his wrath: this is like vnto a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full consumption, which if it continued would vndoe them: <hi>Infernus enim quidam animae rea</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>But as for his owne Children, hee markes<note place="margin">3 But his Image is communicated to his children onely.</note> them from the rest of the world by his owne image: and this is it wherein we should chiefly try our selues whether wee be the workmanship<note place="margin">How wee may know whether we be Gods workman ship by the new creation, or no.</note> of God by regeneration, as we are his creatures by the first creation or not: and this tryall is to be made by our similitude and conformity with him.</p>

                  <p>Patience, as saith the Apostle, is a grace very<note place="margin">5 A description of the Nature of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> needefull for vs, to sustaine vs in the doing of Gods will, and in the expectation of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.

                  </p>
                  <p>The euils which with Patience wee must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, are not the euils of sin; for it is not Patience

but effeminate feeblenesse to suffer it, but the<note place="margin">6 Patience suffers not the euils of sinne but the euils of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> euill of affliction. Againe, the good which wee will not forsake, is as saith the Apostle, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the good will of God, &amp; the better things which God hath promised, and wee doc hope hereafter to obtayne.</p>
                  <p>The second is the necessitie of Patience. In<note place="margin">7 Patience necessary for two causes: 1. Because the good that God hath pro mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> dis not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently performed.</note> two respects Patience is most necessarie: first, the good which God hath promised and wee hope for is suspended and delayed for a time: which time though in regard of the dispenser it be short, because hee knowes when hee will giue it, yet to the expectant it is very long, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue we need with Patience to wait for it.</p>
                  <p>Next because of the present manifold euils<note place="margin">8 2. Because of the present euils, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with now wee are exercised.</note> wherewith in this life we are exercised.

                  <p>For the Lord made not man for himselfe, that<note place="margin">2 Man first made for God, secondarily for man.</note> hee should locke vp and keepe within himselfe all the good that God communicated to him: but as first hee made him for his owne glorie, so secondarily for the vse and edification of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men.<note place="margin">3 Therefore hath God giuen him a minde by which he hath intelligence with God, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily organes by which he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with men.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore hath not onely giuen him a minde, by which he may haue intelligence with his maker, but also therewithall Organes and instruments of the bodie, by which wee giue and receiue intelligence of our inward motions one of vs from another.</p>

How great benefits these are, and how necessary to entertaine fellowship among men, is best knowne if wee looke vnto those who wants them.

                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:9459:112"/>God hath giuen vnto man two eares which<note place="margin">5 The fabrick of mans eare, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to heare.</note> being at one time affected by the voyce, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the sound coniunctly: they are not set within the head as is the tongue, but set with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out on eyther side of the head continually open, to teach man how by all occasions he should be swift to heare, saith <hi>S. Iames,</hi> such instructions as may make him wise toward God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore also hath he made them vpright<note place="margin">6 But to heare onely such things as come from God.</note> toward heauen, because they should be open to those things which are of God, but many haue their eares like vnto the eares of those Dogs, which are closed aboue, but open beneath, such are worldlings, who haue an eare to heare those things which are of the earth, but not those which are of God.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But vnder Christs kingdome it is promised<note place="margin">8 An eare opened to God is a great grace.</note> that he will open the eares of the deafe, <hi>Esay.</hi> 35. and it is performed in our regeneration. Vnder the Law a bored eare was an argument of

perpetuall subiection; and vnder the Gospell: an eare inclined to heare the Lord is a sure ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of an heart brought in subiection to God, readie to be gouerned by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of his voyce.</p>
                  <p>And as by Christs grace our eares are opened<note place="margin">9 How the Christian closeth his eare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sathan.</note> to God, so are they closed vpon Sathan: the Christian as he will not speake filthie language, so he will not heare it. As he will not murther with his hands, so stops his eares from hearing of bloud, <hi>Esa.</hi> 33. and as hee will not slander with his tongue, so will hee not receiue in his eares a false report, when another hath made it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>For I pray you what difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene<note place="margin">10 As he wil not carry sathan in his tongue to lye, so not in his eare to receiue a false report.</note> the willing reporter and receiuer of a false tale, but that where the one carryeth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than in his tongue, the other carryes Sathan in his eare?</p>
                  <p>The forger of falshood is the striker of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans<note place="margin">11 The author, hearer and reporter of lies compared together.</note> coine; the willing hearer is Sathans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setter; and hee that after hearing reports it for a truth which he knowes not to be true, is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans ventor: this man turnes his eares into his eyes, while as that which he hath heard, hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth out for as vndoubted a truth, as if he had seene it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore is it that as the mouth tastes the meat, and lets none goe downe to the stomack,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:9459:113"/>
vnlesse it be approued; so the eare of the godly<note place="margin">12 The eare is the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the soule.</note> tastes words, and lets none goe downe to the soule which is not from God.</p>
                  <p>And herein the Christian takes not so much<note place="margin">13 A Christian mesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth words by their owne weight, not by the qualitie of the speaker.</note> heed to the speaker, as to that which is spoken, were the person neuer so honourable; yea, like an angell of God, the heart that feares God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues not his speech without examination; so <hi>Mary</hi> discussed in her minde the words of the Angell, and thought with herselfe, <hi>What manner of salutation may this be?</hi>

                  <head>THE OBSERVATIONS.</head>
                  <p>IT is not possible to keepe the heart in a good<note place="margin">1 The heart cannot be kept, vnlesse the senses be kept.</note> estate without diligent obseruation of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, no more then a besieged Citie can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, where the ports thereof are neglected, and left open to euery one that likes to enter into it.</p>
                  <p>There are two sorts of euils within vs which<note place="margin">2 Two sorts of euill in man, 1. <hi>innatum,</hi> 2 <hi>seminatum.</hi>
                     </note> trouble vs; first, <hi>malum innatum;</hi> secondly, <hi>malum seminatum:</hi> the first is euill bred in vs of our owne nature; the other is euill sowne in vs by that Wicked one: yet is there no man of so quick a sense, that he is alwayes able to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betweene these two.</p>
                  <p>Both of these euils haue their passage by the<note place="margin">3 Both of these haue their course by the senses, for euill bred within vs breakes out by the senses.</note> senses: for the one, <hi>malum innatum,</hi> home-bred corruption, cannot lurke within, but seeketh to burst out at the senses, to the infection of others, according to that of our Sauiour; <hi>Out of the heart comes murthers, adulteries, &amp;c.</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall passages of this infecting euill are the eye, and the mouth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:9459:117"/>The other againe, <hi>Malum seminatum,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaied<note place="margin">4 And euill without vs is conuayed in by the senses, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the eye and eare.</note> to the heart by the subtiltie of Sathan, from exterior obiects, vnto which he laboureth to allure the heart, that hee may diuide it from God. And this euill is conuaied to the heart specially by the eye and eare: whereof it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with what continuall care the senses are to be obserued, that from without, euill come not to make the heart worse then it is, and from within, euill come not to infect others that are without.</p>
                  <p>For as that Citie is in great danger, which<note place="margin">5 A Christian like a besieged citie that hath traitors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</note> hath not onely without it strong enemies assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, but hath also within it false traitors to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray it: so is it with our soules, who without vs haue Sathan with his inuisible legions of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wickednesse, and visible armies of worldly allurements ready to impugne vs: and within haue our owne traiterous affections confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with him ready to betray vs.</p>
                  <p>And therefore (as I said) great need haue we<note place="margin">6 We haue need ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to watch that these two armies of euils doe not meet within vs.</note> to watch ouer our selues, that these two corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are as seuerall armies against vs, meete not together: for if <hi>Malum seminatum</hi> come in to strengthen <hi>Malum innatum,</hi> they shall breed a very dangerous and hard battaile vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>Whereas if wee take paines to fortifie our selues against the enemie that is without and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:9459:117"/>
to slay the corruption that is bred within vs, so<note place="margin">7 We must fortifie our selues against both.</note> soone as it is conceiued, wee shall possesse our selues in peace. It is great wisedome to fight with our enemie when hee is weakest, the best time to slay a Cockatrice is while it is in the shell, before it come to be a Serpent: if we dash<note place="margin">8 It is best to sight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of euils with in vs.</note> not the heads of the infants of Babell, they will breed vs more trouble, when they come to be stronger men. Sinne is a strong enemie when it is in the Cogitation, stronger when it is in the affection, strongest when it breakes out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to action, confirmed in strength if wee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in it. Therefore euen the beginnings of it are to be resisted.</p>
                  <p>This as I said cannot be done without a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent<note place="margin">9 The soule cannot be kept if Sathan possesse the ports of the Bare and the Eye.</note> custodie of the Senses, specially of the Eare, and the Eye; these are the first ports at which Sathan carryed in death to the soule of our mother <hi>Euah:</hi> for by hearing the seducer her heart was infected, and by looking out of her corruption to the forbidden Tree, shee was entangled in the actuall transgression of Gods commandement.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, many wayes in Nature hath God<note place="margin">10 The Eye sees not it selfe, and therefore hath need of the help of another.</note> warned vs that the eye hath need with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care to be obserued: for albeit it be a liuely Organe of sight, yet it sees not the owne selfe, and therefore hath neede to be helped with the counsell and custodie of another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:9459:118"/>Againe, God in Nature hath prouided a<note place="margin">11 The couering made by God for the eye warnes vs it should not be open to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obiect.</note> couering for the eye, which with a meruailous volubilitie openeth and closeth at the pleasure of man; wherein the Lord who hath done all his workes in great wisedome, hath warned vs that it is expedient sometime the eye be closed, and not holden open to euery obiect.</p>
                  <p>There are two rules good to be obserued for<note place="margin">12 Two rules good for gouernment of the eye:</note> the gouernment of our eyes: first, that before we open the bodily eye to looke to the creature, wee first open the eye of our minde, and looke<note place="margin">The first rule is, that wee looke to God before wee looke to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> to the Creator, otherwise if wee looke to the creature before wee looke vnto God, wee shall assuredly be snared.</p>
                  <p>As God hath giuen vs an eye to see his<note place="margin">13 For as God hath giuen vs an eye to see his works, so an eye to see himselfe.</note> workes, so hath hee giuen vs an eye whereby we may see himselfe: shall wee thinke hee will haue vs to looke to the Sunne, and not to him that made the Sunne? Let the eye that lookes to God, direct the eye that lookes to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and we shall looke out without danger.</p>
                  <p>It is said of <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, that his eyes<note place="margin">14 How <hi>Adams</hi> eyes were opened after the fall.</note> were opened; which is not so to be vnderstood as if they had beene closed before, but because where before all that hee saw was good: now his eyes were opened to see his euill which before he had not, and therefore could not see it.</p>
                  <p>And no better are the eyes wherein his mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable posteritie foolishly reioyceth; they haue
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:9459:118"/>
eyes in some part to see their misery, the fruit<note place="margin">15 So are the eyes of his miserable poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> of their sinne: they haue eyes to looke to the baites of pleasure and profit, wherewith they are snared vnawares, but haue not eyes to looke vnto the Lord.</p>
                  <p>As the beasts in looking to other creatures<note place="margin">16 Man by nature loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth as the beast, regarding nothing but the belly.</note> regard nothing but the commoditie of their belly: where they see any thing that may serue vnto it, they lay downe their heads; where not, they goe by it: so naturall men looke vnto the the creatures, seeking, <hi>vt addant aliquid ventri, non menti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Euah</hi> looked to the apple, and thinking<note place="margin">17 As <hi>Euah</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no more in the apple but that it was good for meat.</note> it good for meate, plucked it, but considered no more: so her children when they looke to the fowles that flie, to the fishes that swimme, to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good and pleasant creature in the kinde, of all they gather no other collection but they wish for their bellies sake it were in their hand.</p>
                  <p>Thus where the sight of Gods creatures<note place="margin">18 Creatures far abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by naturall men to couetousnesse.</note> should work in the heart of man a reuerence &amp; loue of God, a meditation of his goodnesse with thanksgiuing, it produceth onely an inordinate and sensuall couetousnesse of the creature.</p>
                  <p>Others againe, looking to the creature more<note place="margin">19 Creatures also to an euill gouerned eye are the snares of concupiscence.</note> negligently then they should, are snared before they consider of it; so <hi>Sichem</hi> in looking to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> in looking to <hi>Bathsheba:</hi> for it is come to passe by a most iust recompence,

                  <p>But the wicked eye of that euill one, enuies<note place="margin">2 Sathan makes man count it lawfull meat which God cals vnlawfull, or by the contrarie.</note> that man should enioy this great goodnesse of God, and therefore as he tempts man to think that meat lawfull which God hath proclaimed to be vnlawfull, for so he did to our Parents in Paradice: so also he tempts man to count that meat vnlawfull, which God hath proclaimed to be lawfull, that so by one of two extremities, he may snare the consciences of men.</p>
                  <p>This is that Doctrine of diuels, so called by<note place="margin">3 Doctrine of Diuels defended by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</note> the Apostle, which forbids to marrie, and commands to abstaine from meat, which God hath created to be receiued with thanks, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 4. and now is set out to the world by that

                  </p>
                  <p>First then in eating hee lookes vp to GOD, and receiues his meat with prayer and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, and that for two causes.</p>
                  <p>For hee knowes that man liues not by bread<note place="margin">7 For it is not bread but Gods blessing that maintains life.</note> onely, but by euery word that commeth out of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:9459:132"/>

                  <p>On the other hand Prayer drawes downe a blessing vpon the workes of our hands. The

marriage of <hi>Isaac</hi> could not but prosper, for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
                     <note place="margin">8 Actions begun and prosecuted with prayer cannot but prosper.</note> in the beginning of it sought Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by prayer: <hi>Eliazer</hi> in procuring it, he vseth prayer: <hi>Rebecca</hi> her parents and brethren sent her away by prayer: and <hi>Isaac</hi> receiued her with Prayer. Thus our workes sanctified by prayer, shall prosper; and if wee call the Lord to the beginning of our actions, wee shall not faile to see his blessing vpon the end of them.</p>
                  <p>The second action of the hand is to worke<note place="margin">9 The second action is to worke with them in our calling</note> in the lawfull trade and vocation whereunto God hath called vs. A lawfull trade I call that manner of life which is allowed in the word of God, and these are of diuers sorts: for God in his wisdome hath so distributed his gifts among men, that vnto none hath he giuen all, but hath made euery one to stand in neede of the help of another.</p>
                  <p>Religion then takes not away lawfull Trades<note place="margin">10 Religion takes not away lawfull trades and vocations.</note> and vocations, but rather establisheth them. When those men of war asked <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist what they should do, they receiued this answer; <hi>doe violence to no man, neither accuse any falsly, and be content with your wages:</hi> he commanded them not to forsake their calling, but the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of their calling. Thus <hi>Cornelius</hi> after his conuersion to be a Christian, remained a Captaine: and if Religion take not away the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:9459:139"/>
calling of a Souldier, farre lesse are we to thinke it takes away other callings.</p>
                  <p>Onely it correcteth the abuses of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,<note place="margin">11 Onely it corrects the abuses of them.</note> whereby men adde to the good ordinance of God, the deceit of Sathan: vsing a lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in an vnlawfull manner as when the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in making of his merchandise vseth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull ballances, or weights of a double mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. As indeed there is no calling in the world so good, which hath not the owne worme to corrupt it.</p>
                  <p>The third action of the hand is to stretch<note place="margin">12 The third action is to stretch them out to the poore.</note> out, and giue to the poore. It is true of all the godly, which <hi>Salomon</hi> saith of the godly wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; <hi>She stretcheth out her hand to the wheele, and then shee stretcheth out her hand to the poore:</hi> for after that God hath increased them in their lawfull calling, then of their aboundance they giue to the needie.</p>
                  <p>The Lord hath made some of his children<note place="margin">13 Why God hath made some rich, others poore.</note> rich in worldly things, and others hee hath made poore, that the one should be examples of mercy, the other patternes of patience in his Church.</p>
                  <p>Vnder the Law God fore-warned Israel, that<note place="margin">14 As we take from God so should we giue to the poore.</note> the poore should euer be with them, and our Sauiour hath sore-warned vs of the same vnder the Gospell: and therewith the commadement is giuen; <hi>With-draw not therefore thine hand</hi>

The goodnesse of God is extended to all, hee makes his Sunne to shine, and his raine to fall, euen vpon those which are vniust; teaching vs not to neglect, farre lesse to contemne other men, who are Gods creatures, euen then, when for their euill qualities, wee may make iust ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception against them, that so wee may be the children of our heauenly father.</p>

                  <p>Thus are we taught that it is a more blessed<note place="margin">18 A more blessed thing to giue then to receiue.</note> thing to giue then to receiue, if eyther we will follow the Lord, or his most excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in heauen and earth.</p>

                  <p>Or like that cursed gulfe in the salt and dead<note place="margin">20 Compared to the lake of Sodome.</note> sea, which swalloweth vp the whole riuer of Iordan into her bosome, and is neither her selfe bettered thereby, neyther yet sends out any part thereof againe to the good of others: such cursed creatures are they who receiue good things from God in great abundance, and are neyther changed by them in themselues, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet will suffer any of those goods to flow from them to the benefit of others; their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine hearts hauing caused to them withered hands which are able to giue nothing.</p>
                  <p>Or if at any time they giue, it is as if their right hand should giue vnto their left, that is,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:9459:140"/>
they giue to their owne onely. Or as if the<note place="margin">21 If worldlings giue they are like clouds powring raine on the Sea.</note> Cloudes being full of raine and standing ouer some thirstie ground should be carryed away by the winde to disburthen her treasures of water in the Sea: so doe they while all they giue is bestowed on such as haue more then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and that vnder hope of a greater benefit to returne to themselues againe.</p>
                  <p>To moue vs therefore to the performance<note place="margin">22 Motiues to almes giuing.</note> of this christian dutie, wee will shortly consider the losse that comes by neglect thereof, and the great vantage by the faithfull discharge of it.</p>

                  <p>And because his Master is in heauen, and himselfe on earth, hee waites most diligently on his Master in those places of earth wherein most frequently hee appeares, that is, in the

assembly of Gods Saints in his holy Temples, for those are the places vpon earth which are most like vnto heauen.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, because with his feete he treads<note place="margin">13 With his feete hee treads vpon earth but vvith his face he looke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to heauen</note> vpon earth, and with his face lookes vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; hee delighteth not much in those workes by which the earth may be gained, but rather in those by which the great and excellent glory of heauen may be obtayned; for euen by this that God hath made him to tread vpon the earth, he learnes to despise the earth, counting the best things that are in it but dongue, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Lord Iesus.</p>
                  <p>The Church is described hauing the Sunne<note place="margin">14 So the vvhole Church is described hauing the World vnder her feete.</note> and the twelue starres on her head: for Christ and the doctrine of the Apostles is as a Diadem of beauty to her, the Moone figuring the world, shee hath vnder her feete: it is a shame to alter this order, as carnall men doe, who tread Christ and his word vnder their feete, and putteth the world as a garland vpon their heads: but the Christian will neuer place that in his hart, nor vpon his head, which God hath placed vnder his feete.</p>
                  <p>Thus, while as hee walketh vpon the earth<note place="margin">15 Thus vvalking on earth hee keepes an heauenly minde.</note> with his feete, hee keepes within him an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly minde, and so ordereth his wayes as may best serue to prepare a way for his ascension to his Lord.</p>

If otherwise he be to go to a work which is indifferent, such as is his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily recreation by honest game, he wil not moue his foot vnto it, till first in his conscience hee be sure of license obtained from his Lord.</p>
                  <p>But in all this let the Christian remember,<note place="margin">17 Sathans snares laid in all his vvayes.</note> how he is greatly enuied by Sathan, who in all his wayes hath spread out deceiueable snares, wherein to trap him; <hi>Psal.</hi> 57. at least to make him if he can, stumble and fall.</p>
                  <p>Therefore first of all hath the Christian need<note place="margin">18 Against vvhich the Christian armeth himselfe vvith pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp; consideration.</note> to pray continually, that the Lord who keepeth the feet of his Saints, would saue him from the snare of his enemie.

                  </p>
                  <p>And herewith all let the Christian ioyne these meditations. Seeing thou lookest at length to be partaker of this glory of the Saints, that

                  <p>It is one of the continuall cares of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian<note place="margin">12 A Christian flyeth the companie of the wicked for feare of the euill they may doe him.</note> to slie from euill company: first, for feare of the euill the wicked may doe to him: for the nature of things is such, that when good is ioyned with the euill, the good is sooner cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the euill, then the euill is rectified by the good.</p>
                  <p>And this the Spirit of God doth teach vs<note place="margin">13 How dangerous their company is in the iudgement of Gods spirit.</note> both by significant Phrases, and cleare exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: Can a man take fire in his bosome, and walke vpon coales and not be burnt? Canst thou be a brother to Dragons, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to Ostriches, and not sauour of their wildnesse?</p>
                  <p>How often haue men of most excellent<note place="margin">14 Men of excellent graces haue beene hurt by the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the wicked.</note> Graces, and singular vertues beene snared by the Companie of the wicked. In the Court of Egypt, <hi>Ioseph</hi> was snared to sweare by the life of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> In the companie of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims godly <hi>Dauid</hi> was drawne to be a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembler, and was forced to shew himselfe in armes against Israel, though sore against his heart: In the Hall of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the Apostle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was tempted to denie his Lord and Maister. Yea, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> did warne
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:9459:151"/>
                     <hi>Caesarius,</hi> the least euill wee doe incurre by keeping company with the wicked, we are blackt with their smoake, if we be not burnt with their fire.</p>
                  <p>Neyther doth the Christian slye the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie<note place="margin">15 A Christian also slies the company of the wicked for feare least he doe them euill.</note> of the wicked, for feare of the euill they may doe to him onely, but also for feare hee doe euill vnto them: for wicked men, when they see that godly men doe not abhorre their company, are so much the more strengthened and confirmed to proceede on forward in their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the Christian in ioyning himselfe<note place="margin">16 A Christians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect in all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie is first to doe good.</note> to any company, doth euer keepe this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold respect: first, to doe good if hee may: secondly, to get good. If hee doe come into the companie of euill men, hee hath a care both by admonition and conuersation to make them better; if they doe blaspheme, hee doth blesse; if they goe to excesse, hee doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himselfe to sobrietie, euer keeping a godly care by his example to doe them good, at least that by their euill example he receiue not euill.</p>
                  <p>His second respect in haunting companie,<note place="margin">17 Secondly, to get good.</note> is to get good: and therefore his delight is in the fellowship of the Saints of God. He know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that grapes cannot be gathered of thornes, nor sigges of Thistles: hee hath an eye to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:9459:151"/>
the trees of righteousnesse, which are planted<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 8.</note> in the house of the Lord, that by mutuall faith hee may both giue and receiue comfort from them.</p>
