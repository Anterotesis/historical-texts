            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Diſcourſes have been Printed upon
the ſame Argument and Occaſion. But
when You were pleas'd to make it Your
Requeſt, I thought Obedience would be
better Reſented than Excuſes; and was
therefore willing, rather to Publiſh my
Own Infirmities, than to Incur the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Diſrepect or Diſobedience to
my Superiours, to whoſe Commands I owe
an Abſolute Deference and Regard.</p>
            <p>I wiſh the Performance had been more
Worthy of Your Names: But ſuch as 'tis,
it is with all Humility Addreſs'd to You,
as the Only Opportunity I have yet had,
of making thoſe Publick Acknowledgments
that are Due for Your ſingular Favours
to my Self, and for Your Generous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
to the Clergy of this Place; few
Corporations (if any in the Kingdom)
<hi>Voluntarily Contributing</hi> as You do, out
of Your Publick Revenue, above <hi>Eight
Hundred Pounds per Annum</hi> towards
<pb facs="tcp:105319:4"/>
the Maintenance of the Clergy and Schools.
But what ought to be dearer to us than
this, is, the Charitable Conſtructions You
put upon our Labours, Your early and
conſtant Attendance, and ſolemn Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at Church; Your frequent receiving
Monthly Sacraments, and Your ſober and
exemplary Converſation; which as they
beſpeak a true Senſe of Religion, ſo alſo
Your ſincere and ſteady Affection to the
preſent Eſtabliſhment of our Church. And
becauſe nothing is ſo much wanting to
make us the happieſt Church in the World,
as <hi>Reformation of Manners,</hi> Your late
Orders for the better Obſerving the <hi>Lord's
Day,</hi> and Your putting the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> in
brisk and vigorous Execution againſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs
and Immorality,</hi> give us no ſmall
Hope, that as You have already put a ſtop
to the preſent Growth of Debauchery
among us, ſo alſo, that hereafter You will
more effectually Suppreſs it. If this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
be any way Inſtrumental in promoting
<pb facs="tcp:105319:5"/>
ſo good a Work, it will anſwer Your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign

they delay the Execution of Juſtice upon

Diſcourſe of the Words, as moſt ſuitable to

            <p>They contain a very ſharp and cutting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
upon ſome ſoft, and eaſie, and careleſs
Magiſtrates; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Growth and Predominancy of
Wickedneſs is owing in a great meaſure to the
Negligence and Remiſneſs of thoſe in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
who are intruſted with the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

is, That the like Sovereignty was inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

And although this Power was lodg'd in ſuch ill

Prejudice of Chriſtianity, and in perfect oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Intereſt and Propagation of the

and aſſert <hi>their Power to be of Divine Inſtitution</hi>

himſelf upon the <hi>Power he had to Crucifie and
Releaſe him,</hi> our Bleſſed Saviour is ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting

Nay, both St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> make

<hi>Paul</hi> in that known place of the 13<hi>th Chapter</hi>
to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he calls the <hi>Higher Powers
God's Miniſters</hi> no leſs than three times in two
Verſes;<note place="margin">Rom. 13. 4, 6.</note> and when he calls them ſo, 'tis with
reference to that <hi>Power</hi> they were intruſted with
of puniſhing Offenders, and executing Wrath
upon thoſe that do Evil. 'Tis obſervable, That
tho' the Emperours theſe Apoſtles lived under
were ſome of the very Worſt or Heathens, tho'
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105319:10"/>
they nail'd the one Apoſtle to the Croſs, and
ſtruck off the Head of the other, yet theſe very
Apoſtles tell us, that God made them <hi>His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
in the Execution of Juſtice, and entruſted
them with the Sovereign Power of the Sword.
Now, if God, <hi>under the Goſpel,</hi> put a Sword into
the Hands of <hi>Heathen Emperours,</hi> who made ſo
ill uſe of it, as to oppoſe the Preaching and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of Chriſtianity, and to perſecute and
kill the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians, we
can't think that he deſign'd to wreſt it out of
the Hands of <hi>Chriſtian Princes,</hi> when there is
the ſame neceſſity and occaſion of Correcting
Sin, and when they may manage it more for the
Honour and Glory of God, and the Promotion
of Piety. No, if the Heathens abuſe of their
Power did not vacate their Commiſſion, how
much more ſhould the prudent and ſober, the
regular and impartial Adminiſtration of this
Power confirm and eſtabliſh Chriſtian Magiſtrates
in the uſe and exerciſe of their Authority? I am
ſure, ſo it has been underſtood in all Chriſtian
States, every one of them claiming the like Power
of puniſhing Offenders, as has been exerciſed
by former Kings.</p>
            <p>There's little queſtion then to be made, but
that all Supreme and Subordinate Magiſtrates
have a Power to coerce and puniſh Criminals:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105319:11"/>
'Tis well if thoſe that are in Authority would
conſider, that this Power of theirs is not ſo much
a <hi>Privilege and Royalty,</hi> which they may uſe

which they are <hi>oblig'd</hi> to under the ſevereſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties.

and particular Account for their Neglect, Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management,
and Male-adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>Supreme Magiſtrates <hi>are</hi> God's Miniſters, <hi>and
'tis expected, that ſuch ſhould be Faithful to
their Maſter, that they ſhould Aſſert, Vindicate,

as Great as the Greateſt of them are, they are</hi>

one Day give an account, and a very ſevere
one too, hereafter, for the abuſe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery,
according to that of</hi> Solomon, Eccleſ. 5. 8.
If thou ſeeſt the Oppreſſion of the Poor, and violent
Perverting of Judgment and Juſtice, marvel not

               <hi>That he that Rules over Men muſt be juſt,

holy <hi>David</hi> ſeems to have had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
in his Eye, and to have made his Rule
and Model of Government; inſomuch, that

executed Judgment and Juſtice unto all his People.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 8. 15.</note>
And indeed, you have him laying a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for this Character, as ſoon as ever he
came to the Throne, or (as ſome think) when
he had but a proſpect of it. So early do you
find him reſolving,<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 101.</note> to govern firſt himſelf,
and then his Court, and then his whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
with ſuch care and caution that good Men
might ſecure themſelves of his Favour, and the
wicked be afraid of feeling the Severity of his
Diſpleaſure. <hi>I will behave my ſelf wiſely in a
perfect way; I will walk within my Houſe with a
perfect Heart; I will not know a wicked Perſon.
He that walks in a perfect way ſhall ſerve me;
he that works Deceit ſhall not dwell in my Houſe.</hi>
And, as the Concluſion of all, ſays he, <hi>I will
deſtroy all the Wicked of the Land, that I may
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105319:12"/>
cut off all wicked Doers from the City of the Lord.</hi>
And if the <hi>Seventy fifth Pſalm</hi> were Compoſed
by the ſame Pious King, you have him <hi>there</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
the like pious Reſolution, and that at
a time when there was the greateſt Occaſion and
Neceſſity for interpoſing his Royal Authority,
<hi>when the Earth (i. e.</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Juda)
and its Inhabitants</hi> threatned its Ruine by an
univerſal Diſſolution of Manners, <hi>when wicked
Men lift up their Horn on high, and ſpake with a
ſtiff neck, i. e.</hi> when they bad open defiance
to all Divine and Humane Laws, <hi>then, even
then</hi> did the Holy <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> interpoſe with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Courage and Magnanimity, every way
becoming a King in ſuch a deſperate Juncture;
<hi>then</hi> did he reſolve <hi>to cut off all the Horns (i. e.</hi>
all the Power) <hi>of the Wicked</hi> and Prophane, and
<hi>that all the Horns of the Righteous ſhould be exalted.</hi>
But whether <hi>David</hi> were the Author of that
Pſalm or no, 'tis not to be doubted but that
the 72 Pſalm was of his own Compoſing, the
Title of which is a <hi>Pſalm for Solomon,</hi> and was
made by <hi>David</hi> (as 'tis ſuppoſed)<note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 1.</note> when
<hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, and <hi>Zadok</hi> the Prieſt (by

Throne: In <hi>which Pſalm</hi> he prays, <hi>That God
would give his Son</hi> Solomon <hi>his Judgments and

his Righteouſneſs, that ſo he might judge his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

that he might keep the ſimple Folk by their
Right, defend the Children of the Poor, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh

more behind, which very well deſerve your

ſhould have been mention'd before, if we had
regarded the Age they lived in. The one is
<hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 1. 3.</note> the other is <hi>Moſes. Job</hi> is called the <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
i. e.</hi> one of the greateſt Men in all the <hi>Eaſt;</hi>
in all probability he was a King; and if <hi>his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions</hi>
were <hi>not ſo large,</hi> yet his <hi>Power might
be as great</hi> and abſolute, as any Monarchs at this

and Authority, by what we read <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. 7,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he was not contented with the bare

too much Credit in all Ages.</p>

               <note n="*" place="margin">Plutarch. Rom. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popth.</note> 
               <hi>Cato the Elder</hi> was wont to ſay, That he
wou'd rather be unthankful for a good Deed,
than not puniſh a bad one; which as 'tis an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the ill Opinion he had of Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
ſo alſo of the Neceſſity there was of Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive
Juſtice. Nay, he thought ſoft and eaſie
Magiſtrates intolerable in a Government, and
not only ſo, but that even their ſuffering Death
was a ſmall Compenſation for the Damage and
Injury the Publick ſuſtain'd through their Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and Remiſneſs.</p>
            <p>Such a violent Propenſity to ſin there is in all
of us, that all Nations have thought it <hi>abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neceſſary</hi> to reſtrain it by the ſevereſt Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
To this purpoſe is that Obſervation of
a <hi>Heathen Philoſopher,</hi> That tho' ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have differ'd in the ſeveral Puniſhments they
appointed for the Violation of Religion and
good Laws, yet they were all agreed in affixing
ſome Puniſhment or other upon ſuch Violation.
But the ſevereſt Penal Laws are but a dead
Letter without Execution, and ſignifie no more
than if they had never been made at all: To
have ſuch Laws made, and not executed, is an
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105319:14"/>
Argument of Weakneſs, either in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Governours, that they <hi>cannot</hi> or <hi>dare not</hi>
Puniſh; and ill Men take occaſion thence to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
themſelves in their Wickedneſs, when Laws
or Magiſtrates <hi>want Power</hi> or <hi>Courage</hi> to reſtrain
them. And no wonder indeed, for if even the
<hi>vigorous Execution</hi> of Laws is little enough, and too
little <hi>effectually to prevent,</hi> or <hi>wholly to ſuppreſs</hi>
and obſtruct the growth of Impiety; what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
muſt it of neceſſity make, <hi>if all Reſtraint and
Oppoſition</hi> be removed out of the way? When
the Flood Gates are once broken down, 'tis a
Miracle if an Inundation does not follow. <hi>David</hi>
was of invincible Courage, and was reſolv'd (as
you have heard) to do what in him lay, to put an
early ſtop to the growth of Debauchery and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs
in his Reign; and for fear that his own
perſonal Endeavours might prove ineffectual, he
calls in all good Men to aſſiſt him in ſo Pious a
Work;<note place="margin">Pſal. 94. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Who will riſe up for me againſt the evil
Doers? or who will ſtand up for me againſt the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Iniquity?</hi> And yet after all, notwithſtanding
the Deſign was ſo Pious in it ſelf, and was moſt
vigorouſly Proſecuted, yet the Succeſs anſwer'd
not Expectation, as we may probably conjecture
from the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s own Complaint of an univerſal
Degeneracy and Corruption of Manners that <hi>ſtill</hi>
prevailed:<note place="margin">Pſal. 12. 1.</note> as, That <hi>the Faithful were miniſhed
from among the Children of Men;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 14.</note> 
               <hi>That they were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105319:15"/>
Corrupt and Abominable in their doings, and that
there was not one that did good, no not one:</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that <hi>Rivers of Water ran down his Eyes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 136.</note> to
conſider that all the ſeverity he had uſed, could
not totally ſuppreſs that depravation of Manners
that was become univerſal in his Days. But if ſo
Epidemical a Diſeaſe was not to be <hi>perfectly cured</hi>
all on a ſudden, yet however, Time and a ſevere
Courſe of Phyſick, <hi>might very much correct it.</hi>
Now, if even the ſevereſt Execution of Laws has
not had that Succeſs, as totally to prevent and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the growth of Profaneneſs, I leave it to you to
gueſs what a diſmal Conſequence muſt inevitably
follow a total ſuſpenſion and relaxation of thoſe
wholeſom Laws. <hi>If Mens hearts are fully ſet in
them to do Evil, becauſe Sentence againſt an evil
Work is not executed ſpeedily,</hi> what would they
do, what would they not do, if it were not
executed at all? If the very <hi>Delay</hi> of Juſtice
would encourage Sin, How much more would a
<hi>total Obſtruction of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall be better able to judge of the ill Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of this, by producing an Inſtance or two of
what Diſorders have been occaſion'd by too great
Remiſneſs and Indulgence of Government. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
Nazianzen</hi> was prevail'd upon to intercede
with the Secular Power for ſome Favour to be
ſhew'd to the <hi>Apollinarians;</hi> but when he ſaw
how ill it ſucceeded, and what ill uſe they made
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105319:15"/>
of it, he wrote back to the Preſident in this
manner, <hi>I now own my Interceſſion on behalf of
theſe Men to be unſeaſonable, ſince I find they make
not ſo good uſe of your Indulgence, as to be reclaim'd.</hi>
But no Inſtances like thoſe that are taken out of
the Word of God. If you look into the <hi>Book of
Judges, Chap.</hi> 18. 7. you'll find the People of
<hi>Laiſh dwelling quiet and ſecure:</hi> It had been a good
Character of a People, if it had been a true Quiet,
and well-grounded Security; but (as 'tis there
added) 'twas a <hi>Careleſs</hi> and Supine Security,
which in all probability made them indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in Luxury and Senſuality. And this, it
ſeems, was occaſion'd either by their having no
Magiſtrates at all, or by the ſhameful Remiſneſs
of thoſe they had; for ſo it follows, <hi>There was
no Magiſtrate in the Land, that might put them to
ſhame in any thing they did;</hi> and no wonder then
that they became an eaſie Prey to the firſt Enemy
that Attack'd them. <hi>Laiſh</hi> had the Character of
a ſweet and plentiful Country, it being a Place
<hi>where there was no want of any thing that was upon
the Earth,</hi> ver. 10. A pity it was that ſo good
a Place ſhould want good Magiſtrates! From
whence 'tis natural to obſerve, That though a
Country abound with every thing deſirable, and
want nothing elſe but a good Magiſtracy, yet
they want that which will make them a happy
People. This was what <hi>Laiſh</hi> wanted, <hi>There
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105319:16"/>
was no Magiſtrate among them; i. e.</hi> they had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
none at all, or as good as none; for there
was none that took due care to execute his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
none that reſtrain'd them from Sin, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
them for it, or ſo much as fixed any Mark
of Diſgrace upon them; <hi>There was none that put
them to ſhame for any thing they did:</hi> And this
proved in the end the Ruine of that People, and
ſo it will prove of any Perſons whatſoever. Thus
there was nothing perhaps that contributed more
immediately to the Wickedneſs, and in effect to
the Ruine, of <hi>Eli</hi>'s two Sons, than the too great
Indulgence of their old compaſſionate Father;
who, being a Judge as well as a High-Prieſt in
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhould have made it his Buſineſs to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
and puniſh Vice ſeverely and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially,
where-ever he ſaw it, but eſpecially in
his own Family. But it ſeems that good Man
was of too mild and eaſie a Temper, and his
natural Affection to his Children, made him
forget the Duty both of a Parent and a Judge;
for when their Sins became ſo ſcandalous and
notorious, that the Congregation publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
againſt their Lewdneſs and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
<hi>Eli,</hi> inſtead of Puniſhing his Sons ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for their Wickedneſs, inſtead of turning them
out of the Prieſt's Office, for Deſecrating and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning
their Sacred Character, and inſtead of
calling them to a more ſevere Account for their

Mildneſs;<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 22, &amp;c. Vid. Sanctium in 1 Reg. c. 2. §. 90, 91, &amp;c. Id. in cap. 3. §. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Why do ye ſuch things?
for I hear of your evil Dealings by all

               <hi>Sons of Belial;</hi> indeed, their

<hi>i. e.</hi> it had made them throw off the

God thought fit to deſtroy them. Neither is this
all, but obſerve how ſeverely God dealt with
<hi>Eli</hi> and his whole Family for this neglect. Theſe

Tenderneſs to them: Yet this very thing was ſo great
a fault, that it blemiſh'd his whole Life, and God

I am ſure Juſtice ſhould begin where Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
does, and where Reformation ſhould begin,
and that is at Home; which if it did, would ſilence
ſome of the ſtrongeſt Exceptions that are made

which was never more verified in any Age than

            <p>The Government we live under is certainly the
moſt happliy Conſtituted in the World, as having
provided the beſt Laws to prevent, reſtrain and
puniſh the growth of Impiety; but how faintly
they have been put in Execution, appears by the

meet with the greateſt Severity, as having given
occaſion and encouragement to the moſt Profligate

Since Sin then is the natural and neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of Impunity, and that Impunity will be
charged home ſeverely one day, as the Effect of
Magiſtrates Negligence and Remiſneſs. Give me
leave in the</p>
            <p>Laſt place, to ſhut up all with a Word or two
of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured in the former part of my
Diſcourſe to Aſſert and Vindicate your Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Power; what remains, but that you do
your ſelves that Right to vindicate your own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
by more cogent Arguments than any I
have uſed? That is, by duly exerting it to thoſe
good Ends and Purpoſes for which it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to your Truſt; that you put the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
Laws of this Kingdom in brisk and vigorous
Execution, and reſcue them from that Contempt
which long diſuſe and former miſmanagement have
brought upon them. For however the Clemency
of the Government has thought fit to ſuſpend for
the preſent ſeveral <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
made againſt the publick Exerciſe of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Religions, yet there are <hi>other Penal Laws, thoſe,</hi>
I mean, <hi>againſt Profaneneſs and Debauchery;</hi> which
remain ſtill in full force, and require nothing but
a couragious Magiſtracy to put them in Execution.
And herein do I find all Parties agreed: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
difference there is among us, as to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Penal Laws</hi> relating to Religion, all good
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105319:19"/>
Men of every religious Perſuaſion are unanimouſly
agreed, as to the expediency and neceſſity of their
Execution againſt all Irreligion and Debauchery.
Certainly the Execution of them could never be
<hi>more ſeaſonable,</hi> nor was ever <hi>more neceſſary</hi> than in
that looſe and diſſolute Age we live in; which
ſeems to be diſtinguiſh'd from all preceding <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
by this peculiar Character, That 'tis the moſt
knowing, and withal the moſt prophane and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
Age that ever yet appear'd in the World.
<hi>Such open Profanation of the Lord's Day, ſuch hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
Oaths and Imprecations, ſuch beaſtly Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Debauchery, ſuch abominable Lewdneſs
and Laſciviouſneſs</hi> was never known, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
in any Chriſtian Age or Kingdom, as is
now publickly profeſs'd and practis'd, to the great
Scandal of Religion. The Confideration of this
has animated ſome ſober Perſons, even of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

well if the Heats of all Sects and Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

the inſolent Growth of Impiety and Profaneneſs,
and to oppoſe and withſtand the common Enemy
of our Religion. If the Management of theſe
Societies be as regular and orderly as their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns

Thoſe then that will not be ſubject out of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple

2. <hi>Impartially,</hi> upon all Immorality whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

the Great as well as the Small,</hi> your neareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
within your own Gate, as well as the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
feel the Severity of the Law, in caſe they
deſerve it. This is what we are taught to pray
for, <hi>That all that are put in Authority, may truly
and indifferently miniſter Juſtice to the puniſhment
of Wickedneſs and Vice, and to the maintenance of
true Religion and Vertue.</hi> Juſtice is viſible even
in ſmall Matters, <hi>in Aniſe and Cummin,</hi> as well
as <hi>the weightier Matters of the Law;</hi> and he that
fails in the one, 'tis greatly to be fear'd will be
defective in the other. Our Bleſſed Saviour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
told us,<note place="margin">Luke. 16. 10.</note> 
               <hi>That he that is unjuſt in that which
is little, which be unjuſt alſo in much.</hi> This is ſo
far from being Severity, that I am perſuaded it
may prove great Charity and Kindneſs to a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal;
the Puniſhment of ſmall Sins often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
