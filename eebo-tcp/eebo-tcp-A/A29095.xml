            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

what he ſaid was true, that there is no new

be ſorrow and ſuffering. Perſecution is not

my dear Friends, wonder not at the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

THus have you Reader, by my ſcant Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
a Catalogue of very choice
Sayings and Expreſſions, the which you
ſhould lay up in your heart, that you may
be able to lay it out in your Life, when
ſuch ſad occaſions ſhall call you to it: It is
uſual with the World to wonder at every
thing that is not wicked; But alack poor
Souls, when they ſhall, as I hope they will
come to have a ſenſe of their Sin, which is
the cauſe of ſufferings here and hereafter to
all Eternity; I heartily wiſh that that
word Eternity was more minded, and more
made of then it is at this Day. To tell
you what is minded, which you cannot but
mind; the Pride of your Looks, the Pride
of your Locks, the Pride of your Gate and
Geſture, the Pride of your Garb and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
the Pride of your outward Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the Pride of your inward In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
<pb facs="tcp:103748:9"/>
and what follows, Poverty, a
puniſhment who hath no pitty.</p>
               <p>This good Man met with many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
in the World, yet waded through the
worſt of them all, and is now launcht into
the Ocean of Eternal bliſs, the which is
poſſible for you likewiſe to injoy, following
his Directions. And as they are the adviſe
of ſo Grave a pattern, I hope they will not
be ſlighted, but ſeriouſly ſought for by all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
ſober, ſollid Servants of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
