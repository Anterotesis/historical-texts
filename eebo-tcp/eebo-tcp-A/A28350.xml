         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

pride will be there: If you
please to take an Hackney, I

Your most humble Servant, your very humble servant sweet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>

Monsieur Flash,</hi> &amp; the Lord <hi>Gallant,</hi> will be all on horseback:

Mr. <hi>Belt,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Feather.</hi> Mr. <hi>New Exchange</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>Old,</hi> will

Mrs. <hi>Totherday,</hi> and <hi>Ioan hold my Staff,</hi> they cannot abide nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor indeed any of the new Gently, which I hope God

be all in a Coath together; Sin, Guilt, and a little, Content wil

Eternity follow after. Rev. 6. 8. <hi>After the black Horse, and the
pale Horse, death and hell follows,</hi> &amp; a cursing of the Ministers,
who are apt to dine with them, speak to them, and yet wink
at them: <hi>Martins, Pauls, Covent Garden,</hi> this is a judgement
of God, and the greater, because so little minded.</p>
            <p>Madam, I had rather beg my bread from door to door,
then be in the case of some of these Ladies, which are as beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as Angels, but more miserable and poysonous than Toads.
Let me live with one of them under a stone, and die with a dog
in a ditch, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ather then in a golden bed in one of their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>And your vain Roysters are as bid: young Gallants
that are sporting and courting these dancing shadows at
the brinks of hell: and are ever studying how to please
their lusts, and their lmps, one way or another, which
they are ever waiting on; they think there is no heaven,
but if there be, and a hell too, What will become of them?
I had rather fear the worst, the best will help it self: But if
they go to that, farewell <hi>Hide-Park, May day,</hi> and pleasures
too. The Fishes never get up, that once fall down into the
dead Sea, called <hi>Mare mortuum;</hi> the River <hi>Nilus</hi> carrieth
them thither, but fetcheth not them back: Pleasures carry
thousands, but sorrow fetcheth none, from the dead Sea, and
the deadly Lake, where streames of brimstone ever run over
and over their heads, hearts and souls, that fall into that.

               <hi>Tophet is prepared of old,</hi> yea <hi>for the King;</hi> that is the greatest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and <hi>the breath of the Lord like a Stream of brimstone kindles it,
Isa.</hi> 30. 33. I know many will not mind this, and Mrs. <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi>
is putting on her gown, but I would she would put on
Christ and his righteousnesse. Rev. 6. 18. <hi>Buy of me glod,</hi>
sayes he, <hi>that than may the rich, and white rayment, that thou
may the cloathed, that the shame of thy nakedness may not appear.</hi>
This rayment I had rather have, than a skin to cover my
bones, naked soules are more common and miserable than
naked bodies a thousand times, but not half so much pitied
by the world; some had rather be dead than not in the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and cloathes to put on, on such a day as this; others ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
buried alive, than want Christ, and the righteouness of
Christ. Run to my Taylor, bring them done or undone cryes
Mrs. <hi>Would be gone;</hi> fetch my green petticote and my white
sattin mantle, my Lady <hi>Impatience</hi> stayes for me; yea; and
some body else too, and will have you when you take your
short journey, if you have not Christ to go a long with you to
your long home, and you may chance quickly to be there as
well as at the Park: what is your life but a vapour or a shadow
sayes <hi>Iames, ch. 4. v.</hi> 24. Some Ladyes get the Pox, and die
with a fear, others get a Cold and die with a Feaver, few live
long that do not die soon, eternall life is the fruit of a short
living unto Christ, and eternall death is the wages of an old
sinner, <hi>the wages of sin is death,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. Yea, of all sinners
that have not Christ, and the righteouness of Christ; for curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is every one that continueth nor to doe all that is written
in the Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gal. 3. 12.</p>
            <p>Madam, some are of the opinion that no unsanctified La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
shall go to heaven, nor no ungodly Lords go to hell,
providing they beleeve and repent; but if they do not so, and
be throughly washed in <hi>Iudah's</hi> Fountain, Zic. 13. 1. the
fountain which God hath set open for sin and uncleanness;
both Lords and Ladies too shall be eternally damned, and
thrown into the midst of slames, hell and divels: Lords and
Ladies, have more reason to be damned than poore people
a thousand times, for where much is given, much will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
Matt. 25. 30. they sin more, and draw more to sin,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40784:4"/>
and yet may best serve God, besides they are many of them
the very factors and purveyors of hell; a great road leads
to a great Town, and a great man to a great devill: some
goes to the bridge foot to drinke wine, and others to the
devills mouth in following them, they ride on poor mens
backs, and devils ride on theirs, the Prince of the Air that
now rules in them; Ephes. 2. 2. yea, both are carried somtime in
close Sedan, but to day they are more open; doe not you
see the Lord of <hi>Kill Chicken,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Be graceless,</hi> one
eats both full of sin and good creatures; it is pity mountain
Larks should feed such Swine, Kites are too good for them
that doe nothing but eat, drink, and put it out; some study
<hi>Musick,</hi> Doctors kill many, but a good book never hurts; O
<hi>Timothy,</hi> give thy self to reading, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> but many go
to hell a pick-pack, more through the dirt and cares of the
world, for that brings death, yea, double death often. I had
rather fast, then least where there is nothing but chit-chat,
sin and my Lady <hi>Complement;</hi> but the masking is a wicked
thing, where the woman comes in mans habit, like the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill

her Hector mony, he hath his pleasure, the other hath the
soul, all loose that for a moments lust, which is more worth
than a thousand worlds, Matt. 16. 26. If a man be worth
five hundred pound a year, and spend it in racing, he shall
go on foot, and young Mr. <hi>Fool</hi> that doth the like in Coaching,

I saw a Beggar put into an open Coffin, with an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Bay leaves, Rosemary, sweet Bryar, and Flowers,
who was a drunken rogue, and his wife worse, yet she
cried at the putting of him in, (O Christ) my dear heart;
The Surgeon wraps up some in a Sear-cloth, for which
many mourn, but not one of a thousand mindes where the soul
is, when the body is in a green bag: the Lord of <hi>Rack-tenant</hi>
had sixteen great lights, silver Candlesticks, a velvet foot-cloath,
three mourning women, and a many taffity scutchins
about his Lady, but their sins were these, they were devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
hard, miserable to their servants, and worse to their
tenants, proud and discontented at the tax, but their great sin
was unbelief, and yet they heard much: I had rather be guilty
of many sins, than some one sin, espeically of that of unbelief,
which damnes thousands, John. 3. 35. some will not believe a
wise man, others, a friend, nor the wife the husband, if she be
a little jealous, but one of five hundred, I think, do not
believe there is a Christ, or at leastwise live to Christ, amongst
your Gallants, which come to nought. 1 Cor. 2. 6. And
if a man doth not really beleive in Christ, and in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
live to Chirst, he can never be saved by Christ, John. 3.

            <p>But that man that is damned takes little pleasure when
the devils tells him, there was such a Coach, and such a
Coach, so many six Horses, and so many mourners, and but
two or three rejoycers among them all, little legacies were
straight forgot, to morrow is a new day, and the pleasures of
this is gone already: The Lady <hi>Be weary</hi> is going, Mrs. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delight</hi>

pretend to own, and at somtimes will say and swear, they

new course, but if they miss of it, they shall certainly burn as
many thousand years in hell, as there be speres of grass in <hi>Hide-Park</hi>

an eternal separation, for one shall eternally be saved, and

this little Chapter and the former, and then see there what

in pleasure all your dayes, minding nothing but that, and
all that do so are dead while they live, 1 Tim. 1. 5, 0. The
woman that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives: in the

dead body stretched out; they that live and delight in sin
have their eyes to close, and their dead bodies to stretch out,
friends will do that one day, and God another day will call

Whither goe I? Lord, I am but a poor little gnat, worm, or

butter fties; there is more glory and variety of beauty in
the weeds of one Corn field; yea, in a little Dasie, than in
one of us, Luk. 12. 27. But why came I, Lord, why came I
into this world? was it to play, sport, court and complement
my soul away? or was it to mind, love, fear, serve, own and
honour thee? Dost thou give me being, beauty, riches, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

is salvation tendered to you, if you will accept it, do not say,
to morrow, do not say, we will have none of this salvation
which Christ and all the Prophets of Christ yet tender unto
you, and abuse not that rich and free-grace, which brings and
tenders salvation to all men, but to you especially; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat

once those unkind and churlish <hi>Gadarens</hi> did, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 16. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
their swine before Christ the Lord of life and glory,
who only hath immortallity dwelling in himself, and dwelleth
in that light which is unaccessible, the onely Prince and
Potentate, who shall be revealed in due time, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 6. 14, 15.
In the mean time, charge them that be rich to be rich in good
works, and prefer not every lust, rattle, toy and baby, before
the Lord of life and glory, who hath the keys of death and
hell in his hand, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 18. an absolute power over you
Saints, Angels, Men and Devils, to dispose of you and them all
as he pleaseth, either for light, life, and glory, or wrath hell,

though his Kingdome be not of this world, yet his Kingdom

            <p>Be wise O ye Lords and Ladies of <hi>England,</hi> and kiss with a
kiss of obedience, subjection and affection, this Son and
Son of Sons, Angells are the Son of this Son, which now we
do behold, and Christ who is fairer than the Children of men,
is the Son of Saints and Angels too, shall he be yours, O ye
Stars of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; glory of our Nation in a common sense,
shall he be your Sun, and shall he rise this night with healing
in his wings on some of your soules, who are as black as the
nether Hell, notwithstanding all your outward lustre. Oh let
him arise there now, the Sun and glory of the world is setting,
if he shall let him, his wings are the wings of true affection,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40784:10"/>
his wings are the wings of safe protection, who shall harm
if God be (and he will be) with you, he will and shall keep
you in life, death and eternity, in the hour of temptation,
yea, in that hour when all those whose souls are built upon
the sands of common Christanity, much more of vain delight,
shall come tumbling down with a vengeance, when the winds,
and the rain, and the storms of conscience come with Hell,
death and a thousand despairs at their heels. But that they
may never come, shroud your selves under those wings that wil
now imbrace you, and let the everlasting armes of mercy fold
you up in the bosome of divine love, joyes and sweetness, and
that it may so do, stand open, yea stand open, O ye everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

sung glory to God in the highest, peace and good will to

his name shall be called Iesus, for he shall save his people from
