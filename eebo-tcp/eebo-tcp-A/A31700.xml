         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>be Religion and not Faction, &amp; so far indulge it,
as Conscience may be satisfied and Ambition disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed:
This can be done by none, but by one
who has been bred up in some acquaintance with
Moderation, and has not sworn to advance a
Party. Christian Religion has been too far clogg'd
by Ornament, Superstition, Superstructure, Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
unnecessary Questions, &amp; more unnecessary
Determinations, ever to hope that any one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
shal subdue the other by Argument or dint of
Reason so as to bring them over; then there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
nothing but Force, which is of such ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that it is the only way to Banish all
sense of Religion out of the World: Therefore a
mutual Forbearance, an Allowance or permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Indulgence to Mistakes or Pre-possessions,
is all that is left, and more than this Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
invent with any good meaning to his fellow-Creature.
A Prince who has been used to this,
who is not startled at Names, who desires to be a
Father to his People, and not a Tool to his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46111:2"/>
Priests, is the Prince that <hi>England</hi> wants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prudence,</hi> tho of so large an extent, as to
seem to include all Virtues. <hi>Nullum numen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>best
si sit Prudentia:</hi> yet it properly means in
a Prince, that admirable forecast of Events, that
dexterous Rencountering of Accidents, that
sagacious discovery of secret Machinations both
at home and abroad, so as to prevent them in
their birth, and above all, the understanding
of the Interest that his People is engaged in by
their Circumstances. A Nation is composed
of private Men; all brought up very near in the
same Customs, and Instructed much by the same
sort of Teachers: the Prince must take them as he
finds them. He that would introduce Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
into <hi>Holland,</hi> which will drown for Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at any time, or settle a Re-publick in <hi>France,</hi>
which will and does as eagerly fight for Slavery,
will have a Task of no small performance. <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
has always been the Trimmer between these
extreams; and tho that be a troublesom Office,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46111:3"/>
and sometimes may be unable to keep all steddy,
yet the inconveniency is soon felt on either side,
and as soon remedied by the weight of Interest:
But a wise Prince will easily keep the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
quiet, if he reflects, he can only be safe by
preventing the excess; they who would make
him Absolute, would kill him with kindness,
make him debase Human nature, divest his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of their Reason, by which alone Men can
obey sweetly, and at last expose him to all the
Rage and insolent Infidelity of mercenary Guards
and senseless Slaves; And those who would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe
him of necessary Power, would make him a
restless Tool to ambitious Projects, uncapable of
protecting his People, a perpetual Martyr to Fears
and Jealousies, while he would be endeavouring
to perform his Office; all his Actions liable to
Misconstructions, and in short, put him into so
regular a Diet, that the least good Meal of Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Power would prove a Surfeit. Therefore
the Prince we want, is one accustomed to the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46111:3"/>
Projects of others, us'd to preside in popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Assemblies, that so fathoming the Depth of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Combinations, he may see the danger of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
colourable Pretexts by arbitrary Proceedings,
and likewise avoid splitting upon the Sand of too
much Confidence in his own Judgement and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement.
In short, he that has managed great
Councils, will never be managed by little ones,
and so never drawn aside from his People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valour</hi> is so essential a Quality in a Prince,
that it is part of his being. <hi>Omnia sunt Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diipedissequa;</hi>
and the Sword is delivered to
him by a more divine Commission than any other
of his Attributes, God allowed the Plea in his
own People, when they rejected the Government
of the Priesthood, to demand one to lead them in
and out to Battel. Since the peaceable princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Christianity, which endeavoured to tame
the ferocity of Heathenism, have not been able en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to banish Arms and War, and that at least
defensively, it must be allowed; `tis most certain,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46111:4"/>
that a Prince without <hi>Valour</hi> is not to be relied
upon for Protection: and tho of late perhaps
some have troubled the World without that person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Quality, yet our Nation will always have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Veneration for one who shall head it in
glorious Actions. What will they have then for
a Hero, who from his first Manhood has with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the torrent of impetuous Invasion, who has
in the midst of Fire, and Smoak preserved all the
Security and Calmness that Men have at leisure
hours, and yet shewed all the Spirit and Conduct
that Danger required. There goes a great deal
to the making of a General, but much more to
have a Soveraign be eminent in Generalship; and
when such a Prince falls to a Nations lot, they
may boldly hope to find respect in the remotest parts
of this habitable World, particularly having
Fleets to carry the Glory of their Prince to the
Antipodes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Justice</hi> is the finishing of that true Picture of
God Almighty, a Prince, that which makes him
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46111:4"/>
look lovely in the Eyes of all his Subjects, from
the highest to the lowest; but it must be tempered
with <hi>Mercy,</hi> which is properly the Justice of his
own Nature, the other is the utmost result of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Reason into Rules called Laws, of which the
Prince is the Guardian, and ought particularly to
watch the Administration of them, for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be strained or slakened without ajarring in the
Harmony of Government. At this most admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Qualification are levelled all the Batteries of
the Rapacious or the Flattring; Here they place
infallibility, and would have the Prince believe
that his will is the Fountain-Head, that all the
Streams may take what Channel he pleases, and
this that some of them may be diverted to their
use. Few Men trust to Merit, most to Favour,
that makes them strive for Power, and make it
uphold its own Extravagancies, even with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of the Princes safety and the Peoples quiet:
And so unhappily fertile are unjust Acts, that they
beget one another, and like the Plagues of Egypt,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46111:5"/>
do but harden Hearts: Nothing can so soon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
a Government as the want of Justice. Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Bodies are never dissolved till they are in a
state of War, and they are never so, till every
Man is his own Carver, for want of an equal
distributive Power.</p>
            <p>A Prince therefore whose Birth and Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has been in a Country where Laws flourish,
and Property is sacred, whose Nature is just, and
Temper merciful, who has refused Sovereign
Power, because he would be true to his Trust, who
has over-worn Fears and Jealousies, where they
were supported with specious Pretences and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Assistances, who has gained his Enemies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd
his Opposers, and powerfully protected his
Friends, that Prince, if we are wise, may make us
happy.</p>
