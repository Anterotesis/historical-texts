         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe question concerning the true frame of the Lords Tabernacle, the New
Testament Church, in point of Government, hath been a Ball of disput long
tost in this Island; this Contest might have long since had its exit, and issued in
sound and solid Peace, and union upon this head, had we all with a single heart and
eye, looked to the Patern shewed upon the Mount, and listned to the discoveries so
often made to us, from the lovely Oracles of the Word, Ezek. chap. 43. v. 11.
<hi>of the form of the House, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out thereof,
and the comings in thereof, &amp; all the forms thereof, and all the Ordinances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and all the forms thereof, and all the Laws thereof, that we might keep the
whole form thereof, and all the Ordinances thereof, and do them.</hi> Had we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the wisdom of the flesh, and got the penitent heart, and been ashamed for
all we have done amiss; and, (as the Author of this Paper well expresses it in
his Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ace) preferred Religion to Interest, and the power of Godliness to that of
Dominion. But restless Ambition, and love of Dominion over the House of God,
and over their Brethren, and fellow servants, as they began in the Christian Churches
Infancy, and had an early tincture in the Apostles (though our Lord nipt the first
budds of this bitter Root, and crusht this Cockatrice in the shell, shewing them,
that humble Ministerial Diligence was the apex of their greatness) so the fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of this distemper continuing in most men, and by the influence of Satan u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
mans wicked heart, diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sing it self in after Generations, hath been a spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gangren, still hindering the reception, and improvement of this Ordinance, of
the Gospel Church-Government, whereof Scripture and Experience are irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
witnesses. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us: the mystery of iniquity was working
in his time, and the Embrio of the Prelatical Hierarchy, and a Papistical, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
then formed; which we find after stirring in the counteractings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of a <hi>Diotrophes,</hi> (that early aspiring Primat,) even unto the Apostle
<hi>John.</hi> Hence the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> in his exhortation to Pastors of the Church, doth so
en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xly dehort them from those two grand &amp; Satanical enchantments, <hi>viz. Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and <hi>Lording over Gods Heritage;</hi> which no doubt had its influence for
checking these evils for a considerable time. But the early-sown tears of the Evil
one, did by piece-meal discover themselves, first, in the advance of <hi>Beza's</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<hi>Episcopacy,</hi> the fixt Moderator, or proestos, which was next, (by the
influence of the restless temper) screwed up to the <hi>Satanical,</hi> as he calls it, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Diocesion Prelacy, swall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Power of Pastors in Government; then the ascension was made to the Arch-bishops,

of the Papal Monarchy at last. The Lord having in this evening of time, and
the days of Reformation, by the light of the Gospel, discovered the mystery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and of the Papal Hierarchy consequently; and caused his People to hear his
call, to come out of <hi>Babylon, and be separated from that detestable Synagogue,</hi>
the Reformed Churches has generally had so deep a sense of the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>exion of Popry
and Prelacy, that together with the one, they found themselves oblidged to reject the
other; and in their Confessions, and by the Writings of their most famous, burning
and shining Lights, have witnessed against this corruption of Government, as well
as against that Synagogues errors in point of Doctrine; whereof the Patrons of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pry
are so convinced, that one of them, <hi>Nicholas le Maistrie,</hi> in a piece, Entituled,
The Restauration of the ancient principality of <hi>Bishops,</hi> dedicated to Cardinal
Richeleiu, Printed at Paris anno 1633, In the Dedicatory Epistle informs, that
the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jesty of the Pontifical and Episcopal Iurisdiction is so conjoined, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated
together, that the enemies cannot so guide their hands, but with the same
audacity, wherewith they assaulted the Pope's Crown, they likewise shaked the Bishops
Myters, and as it were with one bloody Wound pierced both their sides—that
when, and where the Pope's greatness is violated, the splendor of the Episcopal is
grown contemptible. Hence we see it comes to pass (saith he) by a certain
divine assent and counsel, that the Authority of Bishops should be expelled out
of the same Province, out of which unhappy lust had thrust out the Papal Majesty.
By what methods the Episcopal Hierarchie hath been retained in our neighbour
Church of England, and what has been the issues thereof, what wrestlings against
it, what disputs and discoveries of its evils, by the famous Divines of that Church,
untill it came to be condemned, and voted against by both Houses of Parliament, and
by the venerable Assembly of Divines at Westminster, anno 1600, we cannot now
resume, nor shall we trace the long tract of doleful effects, corruption of judgment and
practice, barbarous and bloodie Persecution, funest inextricable Broils, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions
among all Ranks, advances of Popery, and desolation of our Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which has attended (as alway before) the late erection of it in this Land, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
our honourable Estates of Parliament discovered their deep sense, in condemning,
and abolishing it in the late happy Revolution.</p>
            <p>But the Iudgment and Writings of so many Divines, and Churches abroad,
stricking against this Hierarchy, being found by the Promotters of that interest, such

shake off, and dissolve the same: Hence, since the late erection of prelacy, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Pamphlets have appeared, endeavouring to reconcile this Hierarchy with the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Reformed Churches, and the most famed Writers thereof. But with
what success they have managed this work, the impartial and judicious have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

searched out, and by the outmost Artifice of near drawn Sophistry, and by the most
remote consequences, stretched upon the tenter pins, to reach such a Conclusion.
Hence, not only their Commentaries upon the Scriptures, and divers Passages of
their other Writings, have been pitifully curtell'd and disjoynted, but their very

visage and stain of lying and detractions, and false witness bearing in the judgment
even of sober Heathens, and of all men of the most common sense, or morality,
had been with a conscientious conviction duely pondered, they had never abandoned
themselves to such impious folly. The practice of abusing and counterfiting Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
for the advantage of their Cause, hath been so much condemned in Papists,
(those sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ves of the man of Sin, given up to the power of lyes and delusions) that
Protestants might, even upon this ground, have been long since ashamed of it. It
had been every way a more generous undertaking, to have offered their Answers to
the Pleadings and Arguments of those Divines against the Hierarchy, and to have
endeavoured by, fair wrestling, to wring these Weapons out of their hands, rather
thus faintly to abandon the Disput, and pretending an accord with their Antagonists
than upon this head. But what has been observed of <hi>Ignatius</hi> writings, that they suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Martyrdoom when he was gone, hath been the fate (sure) of the Writings of
these Divines, which notwithstanding, have hitherto, and will yet farther speak for
themselves.</p>
            <p>For the Essays of the Author of this Paper, in this method, I shall not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipat,
what is performed in the ensuing Reply, by offering here a previous large
discovery of its unsoundness; only, I may be bold to say, never any was more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
than he, in this undertaking, and that upon first reading of the Pamphlet,
these things were obvious, and may be so to any considering Person. (1.) That
the series and structure of his reasoning do clearly involve <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
comparing his inferences with the Passages cited; and that he thus
crosses his character of <hi>Excellent,</hi> which he bestows upon their Writings, 2dly,
That disguising the Bishop, making <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> to owne, by his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet
of the <hi>President Bishop,</hi> he would seem to plead only for the constant Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
or Proestos, early brought in, and that he intends no further improvement of
these places of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza;</hi> or to stretch their principles in Judgment to any
<pb facs="tcp:103487:4"/>
greater length, yet notwithstanding in the series of his reasoning, ascribing a preheminence in
Office, and Iurisdiction to this President over other Ministers, yea, &amp; such as extends to a whole
<hi>Province or Patriarchat;</hi> he shewes the Inconsistency of this smooth, but foolish pretence, and
hath made it as transparent, as the Cristal of the watch, <hi>3dly.</hi> Insome of his citations,
particularly in that which is adduced to prove <hi>Definition. 4th,</hi> his abuse and mistaks is so
very gross and palpable, that any who reads some lines foreward will find his Inference in
terminis contradicted, that it's truly a wonder how any of common sense, or ingenuity, who
ever read the place, could be guilty of so bold, or ignorant Forgery. <hi>4thly,</hi> That either
crassly, or willingly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e has been ignorant of, and dis-ingenuously cocealed <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi>'s
distinction of the <hi>Ordinary and Extraordinary Church-Officers,</hi> and takes his measures of
their Iudgment, anent the constant Government of the Church, from what they
speak of the Office of Apostles, and Evangelists; whom, all that ever read these Authors, must
needs acknowledge, that they hold to be Extraordinary and expired. <hi>5ly,</hi> That as some of
his citations are so palpably remote, from what he has adduced them to prove, that they do
not so much as relate to one and the same purpose and subject; so all his demonstrations are
founded upon gross mistakes of the <hi>subject and state of the question;</hi> and thus in stead of a
mounting to demonstrative Arguments (and these so evident as to be presented in a Euclyds

            <p>He addresses in his Preface the <hi>moderat Presbyterian,</hi> but certainly the man Proselyted
to this Perswasion of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> as pleading from Scripture, for the Divine Right of
the President Bishop, with Preheminence in Office and Iurisdiction over the Pastors of a whole
Province, or Patriarchat, (which is the white of the Mark, that all his proofs are levelled
at) ceases to be either <hi>Moderat,</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> not Presbyterian, because imbracing a
Perswasion, and principles diametrally opposit to that Government; not moderat, because assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the power of a Prelat, which is beyond all limits of equity and moderation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaches
upon Presbyters and Pastors Office and Authority, allowed them in Scripture, and
likewise, because holding no just or moderat opinion of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> who never asserted
such a thing, but do hold the quite contrary.</p>
            <p>The Author offers his Essay to the Moderat Presbyterian's <hi>Censure and Ingenuity;</hi> and I
am hopeful, that what is here replyed, shall be found such a just and ingenuous Censure, and
Discovery of his mistakes, as do merit his acknowledgments, and will obtain the same, if he be
endued with that Moderation, Charity, Self-denyal, and love to the power of Godliness,
which he has here pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est; and however, will come under the favourable Construction of a
just and ingenuous Censure, with all who are truely of this frame.</p>
            <p>One thing I am fully agreed in with this Author, <hi>viz.</hi> That if picques and recentments were
kendled into Charity, and prejudices, and worldly designs laid aside, Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to Interest, and the power of Godliness to that of Dominion, the powers of Hell
could not make this Protestant Church divide about Church Government. I am confident,
were we all sincerly of this Frame, We should quickly unite, in acknowledging the true Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the House of God, which has had so evident an influence upon the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and joyntly, and zealously oppose that Prelatical Hierarchy, which has had so deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
an influence upon profanity and Error, and has been the great bane of both <hi>Purity</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:103487:4"/>
               <hi>Unity</hi> in his Church, and I am bold to add, That had we all been so happy, as to be under
the influence of this excellent Soul-frame, here described, we had never seen such a Pamphlet
as this Essay of his, nor any of this nature, wherein there is so sad a presence of Picques and
Resentments, to Charity, prejudices of Education, and Worldly designs, Interest, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Hierarchical Dominion, to true Religion, and the power of Godliness; and no doubt,
if that Prayer of his for purity and Vnity, in order to the ends which he mentions, be so hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as be professes, the discoveries here made, will set him to endeavour our Vnion upon other
grounds and principles, than these presented in his Pamphlet, <hi>viz.</hi> by an adherence to that
Presbyterian Government, now happily restored in this Church, which <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> do
so enixly and evidently plead for, as being recommended (to use his own method and words
in arguing) by the Divine institution, the Apostolick practice, the reception of the primitive
Church, and the solemn approbation of a Revelation from Heaven. Otherwise if he, or such
as he, professing Learning and knowledge, and by the more polite Logick Methods, to plead for
Truth, and to lead us in to the sense of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> upon this head, continue to ply such
Artifices, they will deserve such a lash, and Censure, as I find <hi>Lactantius</hi> in another case,
put upon a Philosopher, in his time. <hi>Nam si qui nostrum affuerunt quantumvis temporum gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia

            <p>For the Grounds of my undertaking this Reply, and the manner of performance,
take this just and true Accompt. This Paper was, a little after it came abroad,
put into my hand by a Gentleman, who, together with a Minister, requested my
undertaking the Vindication, of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> from the Imputation thereof,
which I declineed upon seueral Grounds, which appeared to me considerable; for
beside my Dissability, and the then publick hurry and consternation upon occasion
of the Viscount of Dundee, his prevalency in the North, my own personal Circumstances
were such, as did put considerable Remora's and Impediments in my way,
which might deterr from such a Work as this, being then far from my Books, lyable
to many Tossings, and several important Ministerial Duties, so exercising me,
that I could promise my self no suitable opportunities, or help for this performance;
espeicially having upon first view of this Pamphlet discovered, that as a full and
exact perusal of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> was needful for a satisfying Confutation, so the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

mistakes were so palpable, that probably it would be reckoned by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of all who should see it, as among those thing—Quae <hi>spreta exolescunt;</hi>
and like Beslus in the Commedie be secured from Censure in its own want of worth;
or if any Answer were judged requisit, this Work would be performed by some bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hand than mine, and to much more advantage; and indeed I was once inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that this was done by a person of known ability for such undertaking. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pressed by the persons before mentioned, to take this Paper to consideration, I
did at some spare hours, mould this ensuing Answer, intending at first my own
privat satisfaction only, and of some Friends, which after a considerable times
lurking, I caused Transscribe, and some having perused it, whose judgment I am
bound to reverence, who encouraged to a publication as useful, I have yeilded to
this motion, If the Prolixity offend, I have this Apology, that having many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
while a Writing, I could but now and then take a little touch of it; and

and upon a review of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> drawn out these Positions, contained
in <hi>Cap.</hi> 1 I judged it would make this Reply more full &amp; clear to annex them. like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the Authors Demonstrations being made up of References to his premised De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions, Postulatums, and Axioms, this put me some way under a necessity of a
compendious Resuming of what is Answered upon them; since an Answer to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
(which are the Elixir distilled from his former Chapters of Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Postulatums and Axioms, and the main Projection thereof) made up of meer
References, though in it self sufficient, yet to most Readers would appear too mean,
obscure, and superficial. I did also judge it not improbable, that some Readers
would in the first place, if not only, view what is Replyed to his Demonstrations;
who thus have a compendious view, of what is Replyed to the whole Pamphlet, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to them, rendring the Eversion of his Demonstrations the more convincing
and conspicuous, and likewise the solidity of the Counter-Demonstrations subjoyned.</p>
            <p>I have traced the Authors Method, as in the Series of the matter; so likeways
in Tendring the Passages cited only in English, except in some few places. It seems
he mainly Addressed the plain English Readers, and so do I in this Answer, I
hope the Passages cited, will be found justly Translated, and that I am so far from,
designing any advantageous Addition or Interpretation, that on the contrary, through
study of Brevity, the Weight and Emphasis of some places is obscured.</p>
            <p>The slow appearance of this Reply in publick, will seem no strange thing to any
who consider the account of this Vndertaking, immediatly Premised. If what is
here offered, shall be found a Word in season, for Vindicating Truth, and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the hearts of any sincere contenders for the Faith, I have my Design in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and the upright Readers also in the Perusal. If this shall meet with opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from a proud, hardned, and self-conceited Party of Men, who continue to
state themselves in Terms of Contradiction to the true Government of this Church,
and her just and legal Establishment, as it will be no surprisal to me (the morning
Light of Reformation being to such as the shadow of death) so, under the safe,
<pb facs="tcp:103487:5"/>
and honourable Conduct, and Shield of Truth, I will not be afraid, how weak soever
in my self, to speak with them in the gate. The weakest Believer, and follower of
the Lamb, can do some thing for Truth, and finds the way of Truth their
strength, and the strongest, proudest Adversaries can do nothing against it. It
is certainly a great piece of the work of our day, to plead <hi>for our Mother,</hi> according
to our capacity, when so many are pleading against her (and her provocations most
sadly) as also to plead with her, that her Abominations may be put out of the
sight of her provocked jealous Lord. The Adversaries have (<hi>Proteous</hi> like)
formed themselves into various versatile shapes, and taken odd measures in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
her Restauration. When of a sudden, the Dragon (as it were) was with his
Angels cast to the Earth, Prelacy, and Supremacy, together with the Agents and
Instruments thereof baffled, and pull'd down by a Parliamentary Decision, these
men were for some times amused into a silent Consternation. But streight this Essay
pleading for a president moderat Episcopacy, in an Ingine set a-work to restore and
heal the Beast of its deadly Wounds, but this project is found ineffectual, Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Government being Established in the hands of Presbyterians. But behold ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Engine and Method of opposition, they do closely but vigorously assist at this time
the Armed Rebels, within and without the Kingdom. But these men (the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
Reed they lean to) are broken and brought under, and the Waters over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows
this Hiding-place, and Refuge of Lies. Another method of assulting this
Church is, to ply the King with their Oratory, or if he be inexorable to them, the
Church of <hi>England</hi> must be set upon this work. and carressed with the outmost Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and Artifices; the <hi>English</hi> Service must be set up in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
meetings, and Pamphlets spread through England, stuff'd, with Tragical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of their Sufferings, and with whole Legends of manifold lies and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
cast upon our Assemblies, and the faithful Ministry of this Church, as also
upon several persons of eminency concerned in promoting the Lord's Work. If this
will not do, and the bright beams of discovered Truth, and our Churches innocency
dispel this Cloud, the fruitful invention of these Assailiants sets a-work another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,

               </p>
               <p>4. The reason of this is, that all Pastors or Presbyters, have one and

               </p>
               <p>5. The passage, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 7. proves aboundantly, that there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt Bishop and Presbyter, the Apostle using both names
indifferently, as <hi>Ierom</hi> hath observed. Therefore the Office being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

to give this Official name (Bishop) to one, robbing the rest of the
Pastors, thereof; <hi>Ibidem.</hi> And if he quarrel the robbing of them, of
their Official Name, therefore much more the robbing them of any piece
of their Official Power and Authority.</p>
               <p>6. The Bishops, to whom <hi>Paul</hi> committed the Charge of the Church

               <p>14. The fixing of President Bishops, over Church Judicatories,

House of God; the hedge and wall of the Doctrine, without which
it cannot be kept pure: The want of which Government, is the cause,
why the Gospel is preached to many in wrath. All are to contend for
this Government, who wish well to this Church, and to oppose the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>introduction

               </p>
               <p>17. There was among the Apostles met together, no distinction of

which shortly turned into <hi>Satanical, Beza</hi> on <hi>Acts.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
               <p>18. The Apostles had an <hi>immediat</hi> Call to their Office, to which
Office was annext an <hi>extraordinary measure</hi> of the Holy Ghost, which
is Termed <hi>Infused;</hi> This immediat Call is the true and genuine Mark
of the Apostolick Calling, which expired with the death of the Apostles
themselves, when they had fulfilled their work in framing Churches. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists
were assumed by the Apostles without the Churches suffrage,
because the Churches were not as yet Constitte, and were sent hither

of Evangelists peculiarly so called, as <hi>Timothy, Titus, Luke,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Beza</hi>

               <p>19. The Apostolick Office lay in this, to Constitute Churches through
the whole World, by a sort of peculiar right, as appears from Christ's
Command, and their whole History; therefore Churches being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute,
this Office also of necessity was taken away; it is therefore a
Tyrannical Term, for any to profess himself, an Apostle by succession,
Evangelists being Attendants, and helpers of the Apostles, as was <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> who is by name called an Evangelist, this Office was therefore

               <p>8. The divine Bishop, or who is institute by divine Right, is the

<hi>Pastor,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, that the holy Ghost made Bishops to feed
the Church of God. <hi>Acts. 20. 18.</hi> and this is the proper name of them

was not brought in, from the Word of God, is evident from this,
that we cannot find in the New Testament the least jot, from which we
may draw such a conjecture; for altho there is no doubt that all things
ought to be done orderly in the house of God, and that therefore there
has been some President in every meeting (whom <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>

not, but only that he admonished the Presbyters, whom he sent for, of
their general and common duty. Thereafter he adds, that as an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist,

Prysbyters, and for a time constitute there, by Apostolick Authority,
he did administrat the Affairs of that Church, and that though it were

be denyed, that he could have obtained any power over the Presbytery
of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> if he did not been an Evangelist, adding this reason, that

call himself a fellow Presbyter, that if all eminency of one Pastor over
his Colleagues had been forbidden, or rather never brought in by Men,
the ensuing contests about Supremacy, had never rent the Church,
so far is this Device from being a remedy of Schism; and finally he
tells us upon his head, that as this humane Episcopacy came in by a

he makes them assert, as extended to a whole Diocess, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
or Patriarchat, as he calls it. For proof of which, several pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> (but of <hi>Calvin</hi> especially) are adduced.</p>
               <p>Wherein in general, his obvious Perversion and Abuse of these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
is evident to any that compares his Assertions, and Citation;
First, in that <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> are supposed by him, to hold the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
and Evagelistick Inspection, and Authoirty, which are suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Scriptures here cited, and in the passages of <hi>Calvins</hi> Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
here adduced, to be ordinary, and of perpetual necessity. Thus
he grosly perverts the subject and state of the Question, which is this,
What is that ordinary ministerial Authority, and these Officers, which
they hold to be of a perpetual continuing Nature and Necessity? and not
what they might suppose to be <hi>de facto,</hi> in the Churches infancy, exercis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
by the Apostles or Evangelists; So that if we can prove, that these
Divines, did not judge the Authority and Power of Apostles and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists,
or their formal Office as such, to be of a moral nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the Church, or that there are constant necessary Officers
succeeding them, in preheminency or superiority in office, all that he says
falls to the ground. To prove this, first in general, it is evident from what
is said, that both <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> with all sound Protestant Divines,
do hold the Offices of Apostles and Evangelists, and consequently their
official Power, as such, to be expired, and that neither of them are suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103487:13"/>
                  <hi>in idem officium, § eundem ministerii gradum,</hi> this is evident to
all who have read these Divines; and for evincing it, I would but ask
this Pamphleter, whether <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> do not hold and suppose,
that our blessed LORD was, when upon earth, the Churches visible
universal Head and Monarch, and that the Apostles afterward had an
universal, unconfined Inspection and Authority over the whole Church;
and that particularly and Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi> who outlived all the rest, had
solly, as an Apostle, an universal Authority and Inspection over
the same; but will he, or any man of common sense, infer from this,
that <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> are for a moral standing Primacy over the
Church universal, or a visible political Head, and Deput-Vicar under
Christ? Certainly he would rationally assert this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

against <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> to be very gross and impertinent, and no less is
his own throughout this Pamphlet.</p>
               <p>2. If these Divines do hold that Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons, are
the only standing Church Officers, of a moral nature, perpetual use
and necessity; Then they did not hold the Office of Apostles and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists
to be such, or their proper O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them, as in that capacity, to be of this nature; But the first is true,
<hi>ergo</hi> so is the second; the Ma;or is evident, for this man will not say that

and that Apostles and Evangelists were not distinct from, and superior
unto them in their Official Power: The Minor is evident from what is
above adduced from <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza;</hi> Yea, even from his own Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Calvin,</hi> to confirm <hi>Axiom</hi> third, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Instit. lib. 4. Cap: 6.
Sect: 11.</hi> The Primacy of the <hi>Roman See</hi> takes not its Original from
Christs Institution, nor the custom of the Ancient Church, as the other
Offices have done, (<hi>viz.</hi> of Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons, <hi>cap: 4
Sect: 1</hi>) mentioned already. Now surely if he had judged other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
perpetual and warranted by Christs institution, and the antient
Churches practice, he would not in this place have mentioned with
such Emphasis these three only, and none else, when in opposition to
the unlawful Popish Primacy, he is shewing what Offices <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
and the ancient Churches Custom will allow as warrantable.
To shew it further, take this passage of <hi>Calvin,</hi> (whom I find our
Pamphleter doth mainly insist upon) speaking of <hi>Philip</hi> the Evangelist,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103487:14"/>
he tells us that Evangelists were set in the middle betwixt Apostles and
Doctors, had an office next to that of Apostles, that they might every
where preach the Gospel, for no certain station was assigned to them;
Now to make their Office and Authority ordinary, in <hi>Calvins</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
this Author is obliged by his Argument to say, that he held
them to be fixed to some certain Station, for in <hi>Postulatum 2,</hi> he holds
that according to <hi>Calvin, Timothy</hi> in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> were
from the nature of their Office invested, with a fixt power of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Jurisdiction in these places.</p>
               <p>3. If these Divines held the Apostolick and Evangelistick Inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Authority, to be moral and perpetual, then they behoved to
hold it such, either as one and the same with the pastoral Office, and a
superior degree thereof, or as an Office specifically distinct, and supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior;
But neither of the two can be said to them: not the first, for
we heard them both assert, that all Pastors do hold one and the same
Function, and that none of them have any official Authority over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
particularly we heard that <hi>Calvin,</hi> (whom our Phamphleter
mainly appeals to) upon <hi>Phil. 1.</hi> reprehending the abuse of the Word
[Bishop] in appropriating it to one Pastor only, he gives this Reason;
<hi>That from this abused Signification of the Word, there hath followed this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
that as if all Presbyters, were not Colleagues, called to the same Function,
one hath usurped to himself a Dominion over the rest, under pretext of this
new Appellation,</hi> So that he holds the Pastoral Official Authority, to
be one and the same in all Pastors, and none to have an Authoritative
Inspection over the rest.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Calvin</hi> could not hold this fixed Preheminent Authority to
be continued in the Church, as importing an Office specifically distinct
from, and superior to that of the Pastor.</p>
               <p>First, for the Reason already given; for since that supposed inferior
Officer were thus, both an <hi>ordinary Officer,</hi> and were likewise <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenter</hi>
a <hi>Pastor.</hi> How could <hi>Calvin</hi> quarrel a distinction, and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity
of a Name to point out a superior Pastor? or how could he
affirm that all Pastors without exception have one and the same
Function?</p>
               <p>2. We heard that <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> do hold that the Apostles, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists,
had no fixed Station, over which they were set; and so
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103487:14"/>
could not as in that capacity, have any fixed Power of ordination and
jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>A second perversion of the Doctrine, and sense of these Divines in
this point, and false Supposition, which this Authors arguing is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon, is this, that he distinguishes not, their <hi>simple Narration</hi> of
a practise from their <hi>positive Approbation</hi> of it; which any man of sense
will distinguish in any Author, and which if confounded, we cannot
eschew the horrid Blaspheming of the Spirit of God in Scripture. To
clear this, take an undenyable instance from <hi>Calvin,</hi> (whom as I said
our Author mainly appeals to) To prove his, 2 <hi>Postulatum, viz.</hi>
that in <hi>Calvins</hi> judgment, the Church warrantably retained the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of one single Person, preheminent in Office unto other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
he cites <hi>Calvin instit: Cap. 4. Sect. 2.</hi> Where <hi>Calvin</hi> shews, that
Presbyters in all Cit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, choose one out of their Number, to whom especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
they gave the Title of Bishop, lest from a parity Division might arise;
That <hi>Jerom</hi> says at <hi>Alexandria</hi> from <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangelist, to <hi>Heracleas</hi>
and <hi>Dyonysius,</hi> Presbyters always placed one in a preheminent degree,
whom they called a Bishop. The same we heard <hi>Beza</hi> acknowledge,
as to the matter of Fact. Now I say it is gross Perversion from <hi>Beza</hi> or
<hi>Calvins</hi> Narration of this matter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>act, to infer their Approbation of
the Practise. 1. For that clear demonstrative Reason already ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p>2. This cannot be held and obtruded as their Judgment, without
contradicting them in other places, and making them inconsistent with
themselves, which this Author, who holds their Writings, (and that
deservedly) to be excellent, must by all means eschew, for as we
heard <hi>Beza</hi> evidently disown this practise of the fixed President, and
his appropriat Name of Bishop, as giving the rise to all the ensuing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Church-Government, so doth <hi>Calvin</hi> evidently on <hi>Phil.</hi>
1. forecited, condemn two points of this Practice. First, in setting one
Presbyter in a superior Degree over another, for he affirms they are all
Colleagues, called to one and the same Function, having the same
Work, the same Ordination, the same Official Power and Authority;
<hi>ergo</hi> he ownes a perfect Parity, and disowns an Imparity in the Offic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
and preheminency in Degree in one above another, and therefore by
further necessary consequence, he disowns and cannot allow of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103487:15"/>
Practice of this at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as warrantable.</p>
               <p>2. If <hi>Calvin</hi> disowns this Imparity and Dominion, as fomented and
having its rise from the appropriating the Name [Bishop] to one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
rather than to another, then he disowns the appropriating the
Name to this preheminent Presbyter, as a badge of this Preheminency,
and by consequence the practice of this at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> but so it is that
<hi>Calvin</hi> (which we also have evinced of <hi>Beza) In terminis,</hi> condemns
this appropriating of the Name Bishop, to one Pastor, for the end
mentioned, therefore he condemns this practice in so far. We heard
that upon <hi>Tit. 1. 7.</hi> he collects the Identitie of the Bishop and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Office, from the Apostles using both Names indifferently; <hi>As
also,</hi> (saith he) <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rom</hi> hath observed, and that more hath been ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to mens pleasures, and inventions, than did become, in preferring
mens habituated terme, to the Language of the Holy Ghost; And
speaking of the first Moderator's early brought in, he shews that the
Name of the Office <hi>viz.</hi> (that of Bishop) is commune to all; And
that to rob the rest thereof, is injurious and absurd, a perversion of
the Holy Ghosts Language, and prophane Boldness; and that upon
<hi>Act. 20. 28.</hi> He concludes that all the Presbyters, have both Name and
Thing of the Scripture Bishop, appropriat unto them.</p>
               <p>Here let any rational Man judge, especially from what is above
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
1 Chapter; If <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> make not the Name and Thing
of a Scripture Bishop proper to every Pastor, and consequently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
not the above-mentioned Official Difference, and appropriating
the Name Bishop, to a supposed preheminent Pastor, above another at
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> as a perversion and abuse of the Spirit of Gods Institution,
and Language in Scripture. And whether it be not most consonant to
Reason, to collect <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Calvins</hi> Judgment, upon their Assertions
and Inferences from Scripture, when reasoning the Point <hi>ex professo,</hi>
rather than from their simple Narration of a matter of Fact, and practice
of the Church.</p>
               <p>If he say that his third <hi>Postulatum,</hi> speaks only of what the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church retained in <hi>Calvins</hi> Judgment. I answer, First, what will
a simple Practice in it self signifie, to infer a Rule and Duty, without
any more; Or <hi>Calvins</hi> Narration, to infer his Approbation. 2. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<hi>Postulatum 2.</hi> and his Assertion of <hi>Calvins</hi> Judgment, anent the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103487:15"/>
fixt Power of Ordination and Jurisdiction, which <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>
exercised over other Ministers at <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> with <hi>Definition 3.</hi>
Anent and President Bishop, his preheminent Office, in Ordination o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
other Ministers, and what he asserts (<hi>Axiom</hi> 3 and 4.) <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>Calvin</hi> holds this to be necessary to the very Being of the Church, it's
evident, he must be thus understood, as asserting <hi>Calvin</hi> Approbation
of the practice. This Man will not deny that the state of the Question
is, what the Church retained upon Divine warrand, in <hi>Calvin</hi> and
<hi>Beza's</hi> Judgment. Thus we have laid open his fundamental Mistakes,
ad perversion of these Passages of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> cited by him;
consequently discovered, his arguing in this Pamphlet, to be founded
upon a meer <hi>petitio principii,</hi> and <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi,</hi> and that he intertains
himself, and imputs to <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> that Error (which I find as an
Error in the first Concoction, marrs the whole Disgestion of <hi>Sarav:</hi> his
arguings against <hi>Beza) viz.</hi> That the different and extraordinary Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
of Christs first Ministers, the Apostles and Evangelists, doth
also diversifie the Essentials of the Pastoral Office it self, so as to infer
different standing Degrees thereof, an Error, which though frequently
told of by <hi>Beza,</hi> he doth nothing but repeat in his whole Dispute;
But that our Authors Mistakes may further appear, we do proceed to
a particular Examination of his <hi>Definitions, Postulatums,</hi> and <hi>Axioms,</hi>
and the Propositions, Demonstrations, and Corollaries drawn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>

by this Pamphleter to Calvin and Beza, wherein is discovered his
gross Perversion of the Doctrine of these Divines.</head>
               <p>I Confess, that upon first reading of these Definitions, I was a little
surprised, to find this Man, (who by his Profession, no doubt is
skilled in the Nature and Terms of Definitions) Found these Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon what he here cites out of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> and to present

                  <head>Defin. 1.</head>
                  <p>The first is this, The Power of Ordination, is that Right in the
Governours of the Church, to separate Persons duely qualified unto
the holy Ministry of the Gospel. To prove this Definition to be <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins,</hi>
he cites <hi>instit. Lib. 4. Cap. 4. Sect. 2.</hi> annexing these words, this
is to be considered, that only the Pastors, and not the whole Multitude

                     <head>Answer.</head>
                     <p>Hence I infer, First, these Governours who have Right in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are the Pastors in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s judgment. 2. If Pastors, as such; <hi>then
all Pastors,</hi> for a <hi>Quatenus adomne valet consequentia.</hi> 3. Pastors, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
such, having in <hi>Calvin's</hi> Judgment one and the same Office, being
called to the same function, and no preheminency in one over another
allowed, as we heard him above assert; <hi>Ergo</hi> in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment, all
Pastors have the same and equal Authority in Ordination. 4 The Pastor
being with <hi>Calvin,</hi> the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Office of Apostles, and Evangelists being expired, as is above
cleared: <hi>Ergo</hi> in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment, all who have an ordinary standing
Interest in Ordination, as Church-Officers of Christ's appointment have
it equally, and no ordinary Officer of the New-Testament-Church, hath
a supereminent and peculiar Interest therein.</p>

                  <head>Defin. 2</head>
                  <p>The second <hi>Definition</hi> is, That the power of Jurisdiction, is that
Right, in the Governours of the Church, to make Cannons which are
wanting, or to execute these already made, for the Regulation of Church
Members. To prove this, <hi>Calvin</hi> is adduced on <hi>Tit. ch. 1 v. 5.</hi> The
words cited are, we learned indeed from this place, that there was no
such equality among the Ministers of the Church, but that some one was
pre-heminent in Authority and Counsel.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Answer.</head>
                     <p>In Answer to which, First, I Note the impertinency of this Passage,
to prove the power of Jurisdiction, here Defined, which speaks only
of <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> in Church Governours, not of <hi>the Object of it,</hi>
whereof this Definition speaks.</p>
                     <p>2. Since the power of Jurisdiction, is correspondent and adequat to
the power of Ordination, as our Author expressly assert, (Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103487:16"/>
3. compared with Axiom 2.) an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> withall, since it is made good,
that with <hi>Calvin,</hi> the power of Ordination is one and the same in all
Pastors, as being the highest ordinary Church Officers; Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
inevitably, That with him the power of Jurisdiction, is the same,
and equal in all Ministers of the Word.</p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Definition</hi> seems too narrow, if we take it as importing, all
that's beyond that Power of Ordination, first described, that is all the
exercise of both the Keys, which will far go beyond the limits of this
Description. Besides, these Cannons must be limited by the general
Rules of the Word, in <hi>Calvin's</hi> Judgment, for speaking of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
Decision (<hi>Acts 15.</hi>) He says, they would not step beyond the
limits of the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Next, for that Preheminence, which <hi>Calvin</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes
to those Officers in Authority and Counsel.</p>
                     <p>I Answer first, What ever this Preheminence was, <hi>Calvin</hi> limits it
to that State and Time of the Church, for he says <hi>Tun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> or at that time,
wherein those Offices did exist, which he holds to be extraordinary,
there was such an Official difference, as is mentioned, otherwise, if our
Author say he means a standing Pastoral fixed Authority, he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
him in a double contradiction; first, in that he says, The Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
were Coajutors of the Apostles, and fixed to no Station. 2. In
that he shews upon the <hi>7. v.</hi> of this Chapter, that there is no Official
difference, in the pastoral Office. Again, <hi>Calvin</hi> shews upon the same
place, that <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyns him not to take an arbitrary power over this
Church, but only to preside over the Elections, as Moderator.</p>
                     <p>This will be convincingly evident, to any that will be at the pains
to read <hi>Calvin,</hi> upon that 5 and 6 <hi>verse,</hi> For</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> He asserts, That <hi>Paul</hi> had deputed to <hi>Titus,</hi> a Vicarious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
in his own room, and that the Apostles having a transient
unfixt Ministry, being about to spread the Gospel every where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved
when going from one place or City to another, to surrogat fit
men to finish what they had begun.</p>
                     <p>2. He asserts <hi>in terminis,</hi> that this Vicarious Office and Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was <hi>ultra ordinarium Pastorum munus,</hi> beyond the ordinary Office
of Pastors, and that the trust put upon him of Exedifying this Church,
was of that Nature; and in this states the difference betwixt his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration,
and that of the Pastor, which is ordinary, in that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103487:17"/>
are set over Churches already Formed and Constitute; But <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
had an Office beyond this, <hi>viz.</hi> To give this Form to Churches,
not as yet modelled, as to Government; asserting evdently, that the
Evangelistick Office of <hi>Titus,</hi> in so far as extended beyond that of the
Pastor, did suppose the Church as yet, <hi>in fieri,</hi> as to its Constitution;
Yea, and the Existence of the Apostolick Office too, upon whose foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
these Evangelists were to build, and exedifie what they had
begun. 3. He asserts expressly, That the preaching Presbyter and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
is the highest ordinary Officer set in the Churches. 4. He moves
an Objection, whether this power of <hi>Titus,</hi> did not seem to infringe
the Judicial power of the Colledge of Pastors, or their consistorial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisive
Authority in Government, and Answers, that matters were not

rather then the other. 2. How will this consist with what he asserts,
that according to <hi>Calvin,</hi> the power of Jurisdiction is of alike nature,
and correspondent to that of Ordination; The preheminence in Office
and Jurisdiction, being one and the same, in Axiom. 2.</p>
                     <p>If this Power of Ordination, is to be ballanced in <hi>Calvins</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Assisting Ministers, how will he make his Proof quadrat to
it, <hi>viz,</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> laid Hands on <hi>Timothy</hi> alone, and no Minister else;
If he infer the Power of his President Bishop from this Assertion, he
must call it a <hi>Sole Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. I confess he did well to put in the Clause of a <hi>Fixed Power,</hi> but
he must add another Clause and Qualification, <hi>viz.</hi> an <hi>Ordinary Power;</hi>
And if he can prove from <hi>Calvin,</hi> that either Apostles or Evangelists
exercised a fix'd ordinary Power of Ordination over any particular
Churches, his Proof will speak home to the Point; and if we can
prove the contrary from <hi>Calvin,</hi> he is but beating the Air, and rolling
<hi>Ssiphus</hi>-Stone in this Matter. Now this our contrary Proof from <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
is very easie, for on this 5th Verse, he says, that <hi>Apostolis nulla cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
statio erat assignata,</hi> that they had no fixed Station, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neither a fixed nor ordinary Power, thus upon 1 <hi>Corinth. 12. 28.</hi> he
says, <hi>Paul</hi> reckons up both perpetual and temporary Officers; the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
was that of Apostles, who were appointed to found Churches,
and erect Christs Kingdom therein, whose Office shortly after ceast and
evanish'd; the Apostles were appointed to spread the Gospel through
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103487:18"/>
the World, and had no certain Charges and limits of Paroches, but
wherever they came, were to deliver their Message, wherein they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

he tells us that the Apostles Office, was to Preach the Gospel in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
place they came into. To plant Churches and erect the Kingdom
to Christ, so that they had not every one peculiar proper Churches as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed

Apostles, Prophets &amp; Evangelists, but without Pastors &amp; Doctors, there
can be no Government of the Church, <hi>Ergo</hi> according to <hi>Calvin,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the expired Offices of Apostles and Evangelists, this Government
doth subsist. At the Close, he commends <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Saying, That
there is one Episcopacy, which is Christ's alone, whereof every Minister
hath intirely a part that none lift up himself above his Fellow. Thus
in <hi>Instit. lib. 4. cap. 3. sect. 4.</hi> speaking of this place of <hi>Paul</hi> in descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the New Testament-Church-Officers, he Characterizeth the
Apostles thus, that they were the first Founders of the Church through
the World, in Preaching the Gospel every where: The Evangelists
thus, that they were in Dignity inferior to the Apostles, yet next to
them in Office, and consequently did represent them as supplying their
Rooms, such were <hi>Luke, Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> and such like also the 70
Disciples, which Christ appo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

These three Functions (<hi>viz.</hi> Apostles Prophets &amp; Evangelists,) (saith
he which seems most consonant to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Scope &amp; Words, were not for

he thus exp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esseth himself as before, their Fellow-Pastors and
Doctors, which the Church can never want; and the 5th Section he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103487:18"/>
begins thus, We see what Ministry and Offices in the Government of
the Church were Temporary, and what Offices were instituted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
continually, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From all which I dare refer it to any man of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
and Conscience, whether <hi>Calvin</hi> hold not</p>
                     <p>First in general, That the Official Power of Apostles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
was temporary, and expired with themselves.</p>
                     <p>2. That neither the one, nor the other imported a fixed Inspection
over any particular Church.</p>
                     <p>3. That both did suppose the Churches <hi>in fieri,</hi> and were exercis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in erecting, and edifying of Churches accordingly.</p>
                     <p>4. That neither the one nor the other was to incroach upon, or in

                     <p>Finally, To make it further convincingly evident that <hi>Calvin</hi> placed

                        </gap>oves, that in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment,
the Power of Ordination is a Collegiat Power, seated in the Meeting
of Pastors, and exercised by their joynt decisive Suffrage.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, For that Passage here Cited by him. I Answer first, These
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103487:19"/>
Words here Cited are not found on that 6th <hi>Vers. lib. edit: mihi
M. D. LXXII.</hi> Secondly, Granting them as here set down. <hi>1. Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
makes it doubtful, whether this Rite was not in the Churches
usual Practice performed by one in Name of the rest. 2. He holds it
debateable, whether <hi>Paul</hi> speaks not of the Imposition of Hands, in
order to Gifts, where no formal Ordination followed, as <hi>Rom. 12.
1 Cor. 13.</hi> of of-Ordination; and inclining to the last Opinion, he makes
this place parallel with <hi>1 Tim. 4. vers. 14.</hi> upon which place he says,
they judge right who take the Word [Presbytry] collectively, for
the Colledge of Presbyters. So that <hi>Calvin</hi> will be found to hold, that
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Imposition of Hands, though solely, will nothing derogat from
the ordinary Collegiat Power of the Presbytry. 1. Because the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
of Gifts thus, was his Apostolick Priviledge. 2. The simple
Imposing of Hands alone will import no sole Authority, since ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Pastors might intrust the Ritual Performance to one in their Name.
3. As no Apostolick Prerogative was in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Sense to encroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ordinary Power of Pastors, and consequently not this of <hi>Paul</hi>'s
sole Imposition of Hands, though supposed, so his Supposition anent
the <hi>Presbytries</hi> Authoritative Concurrence in this Action, clearly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws
our Pamphleters pleading and scope.</p>
                     <p>To the proof of the second Branch, anent a fixed preheminent Power
of Jurisdiction, in this President Bishop, which our Author endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to evince from <hi>Calvin Instit. lib. 4. cap. 4. sect. 2.</hi> It's answered
(beside what is said above) That 1. the Word (always) is not found
in all that Section. 2. <hi>Calvin</hi> clearly asserts, that this Titular Bishop had no dominion over his Colleagues, but what parts (not whatever
parts) the Consul had in the Senat, to report Matters, ask Votes,
Consult, Admonish, govern the Action by his Authority, and see it
Execute, which was by Common Council decreed; <hi>Ergo,</hi> his Office
was not so preheminent in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment, as to Infringe the joint
Collegiat, Decisive Power of Presbyters, to whose Votes, he was
tyed; and what differed this from that of a Moderator, if we except his
being fixed.</p>
                     <p>Next, Whatever Power he might Exercise beyond that of a Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,
<hi>Calvin</hi> tells us, that this was <hi>Humano consensu inductum pro
temporum necessitate,</hi> by Humane Advice and for the times Necessity;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103487:19"/>
therefore he holds it not to be received for a fixed divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
citing <hi>Ierom</hi> for the Judgment of the Ancients on this point,
who asserts upon the Epistle of <hi>Titus,</hi> the Bishop and Presbyter to be
one, and the then Bishops, to have had this preheminency from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Custom, and not Divine Institution. 3. He acknowledgeth,
(<hi>Sect. 1.</hi>) that whatever sincere Aims the Antients had, in conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Scripture in their Church-Government, yet they keep not
that Path-Rode exactly, but had their Abe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ations from it, and in a
Word, towards the Close of that second <hi>Section,</hi> he tells us that this
President Bishop, was subject to the Assembly of his Brethren; so
that a fixed preheminent President Bishop, having an Authority pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminent over the Votes and Suffrages of Presbyters, and not subject
to the, with a peculiar Title of Bishop, as thus preheminent, was
not received by the Church <hi>de facto</hi> in her first purest times, far less
<hi>jure divino;</hi> and never after Warrantably, or as a Divine Officer in
<hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment; from all which it is demonstratively evident,
that our Pamphleters 3d <hi>Definition,</hi> is none of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s, but a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera
of his own Fancy. We come then to the 4th <hi>Definition,</hi> which
is this.</p>

how in the same place, he antidots this mans washpish extraction out

in this <hi>Postulatum,</hi> will bear no conclusion, of his owning such a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Subordination among Ministers. as this man imputes to him; but
that his Doctrine, and Principles utterly overthows the same. Proceed
we to the second <hi>Postulatum,</hi> which is thus.</p>

                  <head>Postulatum 2.</head>
                  <p>That <hi>Timothy</hi> in the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> in the Church of
<hi>Crete,</hi> were from their Offices preheminent to other Ministers, invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a fixed power of Ordination, and Jurisdiction, regulated by
Cannons, and ballanced by assisting Ministers, To prove this, he cites
<hi>Calvin, 1 Tim. 1. 18. v.</hi> asserting that <hi>Timothy</hi> was not one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Ministry, but one next to the Apostles, who in the frequent
absence of <hi>Paul,</hi> was in his place. Also, on <hi>Tit. 1. v.</hi> 5. where he
says, That besides the ordinary Office of Pastors, <hi>Titus</hi> had this charge,
That he should constitute a certain Form of Church Policy and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
and likewise ordain Ministers over the Churches.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Answer.</head>
                     <p>To this I answer in general, that it is already made good, from clear
and positive Assertions of <hi>Calvin,</hi> that the Office both of Apostles and
Evangelists, is expired, and that no preheminent Office, over that of
the Pastor, is in his Judgment continued in the Church; so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
preheminent power over ordinary Pastors, <hi>Calvin</hi> may suppose,
at this time existent in <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus,</hi> it will never reach this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleters
conclusion, anent his asserting a moral standing preheminence,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103487:21"/>
in any ordinar Church Officer, over his Colleagues, which is the point
he undertakes to prove.</p>
                     <p>2. Particularly, if he will prove any thing to his purpose from <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi>
he must shew us his assertion anent a <hi>fixed,</hi> and not only so, but
likewise, (as is said above) an <hi>ordinary Power,</hi> or of a Moral perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Nature, in Ordination and Jurisdiction, over other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and exercised by <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus;</hi> which that <hi>Calvin</hi> disowns, is
evident thus.</p>
                     <p>1. They whose Office, and Official preheminency consequently, was
correspondent unto, and of a like extent with that of the Apostles,
these had no fixed Presidency over any one Church; but in <hi>Calvin's</hi>
Judgment, the Office and Official Preheminence of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi>
was of this nature: <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Assumption is proved from this, that
<hi>Calvin</hi> asserts, (as is above evinced) the Evangelists Office to be next
that of the Apostles, and that their work was to Preach the Gospel e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where, and supply the Apostles rooms, when going from one place
to another.</p>
                     <p>2. They whose official Preheminence, and formal Office, supposed
the Churches <hi>in fieri,</hi> and was appointed for assisting the Apostles in
Exedifying them, they had in <hi>Calvins</hi> Judgment, no fixed moral or
standing Preheminency over Ministers and Churches; else we shall
suppose the Christian Church in its model of Government to be still
(with him) <hi>in fieri,</hi> and the Apostolick Office formerly existent,
which we heard above, both <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> disown; but the Office
of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> in <hi>Calvins</hi> Judgment was such, as we heard also
above. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. They whose Official Power, is expresly by <hi>Calvin</hi> distinguished,
from that power which is ordinary and of perpetual necessity in the
Church Government, their supposed Preheminency lays no foundation
for a fixed moral president, preheminent Bishop, over Ministers, as of
perpetual necessity in the Church, unless he will make <hi>Calvin</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to himself, assert one and the same Office, and Power to be
ordinary, and extraordinary, perpetual and temporary, continually
necessary, and not necessary; but so it is that <hi>Calvin</hi> thus distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
the Office of Evangelists, from the Pastoral perpetual Office, as we
heard above. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:103487:22"/>
4. They who by their Office were fixed to no particular Station,
or Church in <hi>Calvins</hi> Judgment, they had no fixed preheminent Power,
in Ordination and Jurisdiction over other Ministers; else they should
be by their Office, fixed, and not fixed. But so it is that in <hi>Calvins</hi>
Judgment, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were set over no particular Station, as we
heard him above assert. <hi>Ergo</hi> no Evangelists properly such, were in
<hi>Calvins</hi> judgment fixed to any particular Station; as we heard him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
assert. But <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were the Evangelists properly such,
as we heard also him affirm. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Finally, so absurd is this mans assertion here, that his pretended
proofs out of <hi>Calvin,</hi> furnishes sufficient Weapons to overthrow it;
For,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> If <hi>Timothy</hi> was none of the <hi>common ordinary Ministry,</hi> but the
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Depute, sustaining his place in his frequent absence, then
(as we heard <hi>Calvin</hi> above argue and assert) his Official Inspection, was
neither ordinary, nor fixed, over any one Church; <hi>Ergo,</hi> It laid no
foundation in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s judgment, for a moral fixed President Bishop,
with Official standing Preheminency, over Ministers and Churches, as
he would make <hi>Calvin</hi> affirm.</p>
                     <p>2. That Office or Charge, which was beyond the limits of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
power of Pastors, that Office and Power in <hi>Calvins</hi> judgment,
is extraordinary and expired; but such was in his judgment the Power
and Office of <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Crete,</hi> as his second passage adduced, by our
Pamphleter makes it evident, and several other places of <hi>Calvin,</hi> of
which above. The Major is evident in this, that with <hi>Calvin,</hi> The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
labouring in the Word and Doctrine, is the highest ordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
of a necessary standing nature, as we heard him above assert. The
Minor is evident in this plain assertion set down, by this man himself.</p>
                     <p>3. If we shall compare these places adduced by him, with <hi>Calvins</hi>
Comment: upon the whole Context, this mans absurd imposing upon
him will be further evident; <hi>Calvin</hi> shews in the Argument of the
first Chapter, that many things at <hi>Ephesus</hi> were wanting, which need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Paul's</hi> interposed Authority to set in order; and upon the 1. verse,
as also in this Argument, he shews, that it was not to <hi>Timothy</hi> alone
he wrote; and upon the 3. verse, that, that Churches necessity forced
<hi>Paul,</hi> to demit such a dear Coajutor to supply his place there, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103487:22"/>
this 18 verse he tells us, that for this end Prophesies went before
on <hi>Timothy,</hi> because he was appointed to hard and great matters, for
(says he) he was not, <hi>è vnlgo,</hi> of the ordinary class and rate of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
but next to Apostles, that therefore he had need of a singular
Testimony, that it might appear he was chosen of God himself, that
then it was not ordinary or common to be honoured with Elogies of
Prophets, but in <hi>Timothy</hi> there were peculiar Causes, therefore God
would not have him set about his Office, but fitted with prophetick Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
nor to be admitted by men, until approved by his own Voice,
as it was with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> when sent to teach the Gentiles. In
which words let any man judge, whether <hi>Calvin</hi> doth not hold his
Office extraordinary, both upon the account of his Mission, his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Gifts, and the nature of his work and Inspection, as upon the same
ground, he holds the Office of Apostles to be such. In the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> he shews that <hi>Paul</hi> hasting else where, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
to <hi>Titus</hi> the prosecuting of his own Work, and this as to an
Evangelist, who was not of the ordinary rate of Ministers, that <hi>Paul</hi>
wrote to him to arm him with his own Authority, upon the 6 v. that
he was set by the Apostle, as the Moderator in the ordination of Pastors,
that that work might be orderly done, and upon the 7 v. he expresly
asserts the Identitie of the Bishop and Presbyters Office as the same, and
upon the 5 v. asserting the same thing, he shews that he had no arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power in this matter, but that of a Moderator, that sustaining
<hi>Pauls</hi> room, and having his place as it were assigned to him, the Apostle
will have him acknowledged as his Vicarious Substitute, that <hi>Paul</hi>
leaving that place, left Work for others, as he was at <hi>Corinth</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Builder,
but others built on his Foundation, the Church still stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in need of Pastors for her increase. But least we take <hi>Titus</hi> work
to be no other than what is competent to ordinary Pastors, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rids Marches thus, <hi>Sed ultra ordinarium pastorum munus, &amp;c.</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the ordinary Office of Pastors, <hi>Titus</hi> had the care of constituting
the Church committed to him; Then (as is above-observed) he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
him in this, from Pastors, who are set over Churches reduced
unto Form; But <hi>Titus</hi> (saith he) had a Work beyond this, even to
form Churches not as yet molded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after stating the Question,
whether <hi>Titus</hi> had not in appearance a Kingly Power over the Colledge
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103487:23"/>
of the Pastors, and their decisive Authority, he answers, as is said above,
that his Power was not arbitrary, but that of a Moderator <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here
let any judge, if <hi>Calvin</hi> assert not that <hi>Titus</hi> his Inspection, and work
was extraordinary, as suited to that Exigence, Case and Time of the
Church, and consequently that it was Temporary and not fix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <head>Answer.</head>
                     <p>The absurdity of this Inserence, from <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Assertion, is above
fully cleared, and that <hi>Calvin</hi> ownes not a president, with a power in
Ordination and Jurisdiction, or preheminent unto other Ministers, or
a power Paramount unto their Collegiat, Decisive, Suffrage, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
no warrantable practice of the Church hereanent, as this
man absurdly infers from his Words, to make which evident,</p>
                     <p>First, I enquire, What he means by the <hi>Government of one single
person, and a preheminence in Office;</hi> neither Matter, nor Words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so found in this passge of <hi>Calvin</hi> here cited? If he mean such a

Fellows?</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103487:23"/>
that it doth infringe their Decisive, Conclusive Suffrage, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
a sole Preheminence in Ordination and Jurisdiction, as he must
needs hold, and doth assert (<hi>Axiom</hi> 2. compared with <hi>Definition</hi> 2 &amp; 3.)
This to be <hi>Galvin</hi>'s Judgment, <hi>Calvin</hi> in the very next Words gives
him the Lie, for he adds immediately, <hi>neque sic in hon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

superior,</hi> &amp;c. neither was he so Superior, as to have Dominion over
his Colleagues, but what Power the Consul had in the Senat, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the Votes or Sentences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again this man acknowledges in
his Citation, to prove Definition 3. That <hi>Calvin</hi> asserts the Power of
this President Bishop, to be like that of the Consul in the Senat, but
will he dare to say, that the Government of the Senat, in <hi>Calvin,</hi> or
any knowing mans Judgment, was confined to the person of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul.</p>
                     <p>2. We said above, that <hi>Calvin</hi> acknowledges, the Ancients their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berration
from the Scripture Rule, in their Church Government, and
that this Custom in his own and <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Judgment, was brought in
<hi>humano consilio,</hi> and <hi>pro temporum necessit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t,</hi> by humane Advice and
Counsel, and according to the times exigence, wherein he clearly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes,
this from a Divine Institution, authorizing a divine Office
of Gods Appointment, for he presently cites that place of <hi>Ierom</hi> upon
<hi>Titus,</hi> (mentioned above) wherein he shews that by divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Church was governed by Presbyters in common; And that
the then Bishops power was only by Custom, not authorized by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Appointment; So that our Pamphleter will never be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
from these words, <hi>Calvins</hi> Recommendation and Approbation
of this practice, but on the contrary, <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Ierom</hi> both, doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
what ever thing in this practice, was an incroachment upon the
Presbyters divine Power, was a humane Device and sinful Usurpation,
which would be convincingly evident to any that considers.</p>
                     <p>3. That this Practice of appropriating the name [Bishop] to one,
is (as I did above clear) <hi>in terminis,</hi> condemned by <hi>Calvin,</hi> as an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
of the Holy Ghosts Language, and making way for one Pastor,
his encroaching upon the Power of his Colleagues. We told him that
upon <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. having asserted the Identity of the Bishop and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,
he tells us, that this place is made use of by <hi>Ierom,</hi> to prove
Presbyters Divine Paritie, he adds, <hi>postea invaluit usus,</hi> &amp;c. afterward
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103487:24"/>
Custom prevailed, that he whom Presbyters set over their collegiat
Meeting, was only called the Bishop, but this had its Original from
the custom of Men, but is not at all grounded upon Authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
In which words, this practice (which our Pasqueller would
make us believe hath <hi>Calvins</hi> Approbation) is clearly Reprobat, as an
Aberration from the Rule, and Institution which first took place, and
no man can be so irrational, as to imagine that <hi>Calvin</hi> would put this
Censure upon the singularity of the <hi>name Bishop,</hi> as appropriat to one
Minister, and not also upon the singularity of an <hi>Official Preheminence,</hi>
which this man pleads for. Two words more I add on this, that if
this man will allow <hi>Calvin</hi> any Interest, and consent in, and to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the <hi>French Church,</hi> he is there told by <hi>Calvin,</hi> that the true
Church ought to be governed by that Policy, which Christ hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
<hi>viz.</hi> that there be Pasters, Presbyters, Elders and Deacons,
and as to a preheminent fixed Presidency, they do thus <hi>in terminis</hi>
disowne it. Again we <hi>believe that all true Pastors wherever they be, are
endued with equal and the same Power, under one Head and Bishop CHRIST
IESVS;</hi> Thus expresly disclaiming this preheminent Power in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Jurisdiction, (which our Pamphleter makes <hi>Calvin</hi> owne)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or any supposed President or Pastor, with official power over his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues,
and that upon the same ground of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which we heard
mentioned, and approved of <hi>Calvin, viz.</hi> That Christ hath in him the
original sole Episcopacy, whereof in a perfect Parity, he has imparted
to every Minister an intire and equal share.</p>
                     <p>Next, I offer to him the sense of the famous <hi>Doctor Reynolds,</hi> upon
these words of <hi>Calvin,</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Sir Francis Knolls,</hi> cited at large
(<hi>Petri. Hist. part 3. pag</hi> 400 and 69, 70, 71.) upon <hi>Ieroms</hi> words, <hi>à


Marco Evangelista,</hi> the Doctor proves, that by the Decree of the <hi>4th</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of <hi>Carthage, cap</hi> 3. anent Presbyters interest in Ordination, (which
proves, saith he, that Bishops ordained not then in all places alone, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
<hi>Ierom</hi> says, <hi>Quid facit excepta ordinatione,</hi> &amp;c.) And by <hi>Ierom</hi>'s
proving Bishops and Presbyters to be all one in Scripture, and even in
the right of Ordination. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. That <hi>Ierom</hi> could not mean Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
in <hi>Alexandria</hi> to have had this sole Power. And as for that
place of <hi>Calvin (instit: lib. 4. cap. 4. Sect.</hi> 2.) cited then by Doctor
<hi>Boncroft.</hi> (anent whose Sermon he wrote that Epistle) he shews, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103487:24"/>
                        <hi>Calvin</hi> relating the practice of choosing one to proceed, and giving him
the Name of Bishop, doth notwithstanding shew that he was not above
the Presbyters in Dignity and Honour, or to rule over them, but was
appointed only to ask the Votes, to see that performed that was agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon by common consent; And having shewed that this was brought
in by consent of Men, in <hi>Ieroms</hi> Judgment, he adds that <hi>Ierom</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
shews, how ancient the Custom was, from <hi>Marks</hi> time to <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clas,
&amp;c.</hi> In which words of <hi>Calvin</hi> (saith the Doctor) seing that the
Order of the Church hath evident relation to that before described, and
that in describing it, he had said the Bishop, was not so over the rest in
honour, yet he had rule over them, it follows that Mr <hi>Calvin</hi> doth not
so much as seem to confess, on <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Report, that ever since <hi>Mark</hi>'s
time, Bishops have had a ruling superiority over the Clergy: Adding, that
it may easily be made appear from many places of <hi>Ierom</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> both,
as well as from this passage, it's evident that neither of them doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
Bishops to have had all that time, such a Superiority as <hi>Boncroft,</hi>
fathered upon them. Wherein the Doctor clearly affirms and proves,
that neither of these places of <hi>Ierom</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> would bear, either an
Assertion of this matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> the forementioned President his
exercising a sole Episcopal Authority, or their approbation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
of one single person, preheminent in Office unto other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
as this Pamphleter suggests. Proceed we to the <hi>4th Postulatum,</hi>

                     <p>First, we have proved upon <hi>Definition</hi> 4, that <hi>Beza's</hi> taking this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
for one single person, by whom the rest were to be admonished, will
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103487:25"/>
infer in <hi>Beza</hi>'s Sense no preheminence in Office, and Authority over his
Colleagues.</p>
                     <p>2. That <hi>Beza</hi> disownes even the inference of the necessity, of a fixed
Moderator, as necessary following upon his Assertion; Yea,</p>
                     <p>3. That he holds this practice of the fixed Moderator to be founded
only upon a humane Custom; and such a Custom as gave a rise
to Antichristian Tyranny; and consequently that the Ministers of
these Churches, are owned by <hi>Beza</hi> as Colleagues, of equal Power and
Authority with the President, though by him immediately be-spoken,
and so by clear and necessary consequence further, their continuing
faithful in their Administrations, can import nothing more in <hi>Beza</hi>'s
sense, in the words here cited, then a faithfulness in the exercise of their
joynt Collegiat Power and Authority, which <hi>Beza</hi> holds, was our
Lords Institution, and then existent. Thus we have seen this mans <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulatums,</hi>

               <head type="sub">THe Axioms in point of Church Government, imputed by this Pamphleter to
Calvin, examined, and found impertinent to fortifie his Scope and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.
The first of these Axioms is this.</head>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Axiom. 1.</head>
                  <p>THe regular Call of any Minister already Ordained, is from an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of an Inferior, to another of a preheminent Station. To
prove this, <hi>Calvin</hi> is adduced on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13. saying, That because in
one or two Centuries, after the Death of the Apostles, it was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Custom, that from the Order of Deacons, the Presbyters were
chosen, therefore commonly they have exponed this place, of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
to a superior Degree.</p>
                  <p>First, as to the pertinency of this Citation, to prove the <hi>Axiom</hi> as
here set down, I answer.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Answer.</head>
                     <p>First <hi>Calvin</hi> hath no such words, that it was the <hi>Constant</hi> or <hi>Vniversal</hi>
Custom in these Centuries, to Ordain Presbyters, after this manner, as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103487:25"/>
this man would insinuat, all that <hi>Calvin</hi> says, is that <hi>invaluerat usus,</hi>
this practice came in use and prevailed, through process of time, but
it might be so, though it was neither universal nor constant, through
all times and places.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>Calvin</hi> disowns both this Custom as constant, and necessary, and
likewise the Exposition of this passage, of, and its Application to
such a Custom, as is evident to any that will read him upon that place,
for to these words here cited, he adds, <hi>quasi Apostolus,</hi> as if the Apostle
called to the Honour of the Presbyterat, such as have acquit themselves
faithful Deacons—then adds, although I do not deny, that the order
of Deacons may sometimes be a Seminary, out of which Presbyters
may be taken; Yet I do more simply take <hi>Pauls</hi> words, that they are
worthy of no small honour, who do well acquit themselves in this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
because it is not a base, but a very honourable Office;
so that what ever this man would make of this <hi>Axiom</hi> [that the regular
Call of a Minister already ordained, is from an Inferiour to a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent
Station] <hi>Calvin</hi> doth neither absolutely hold this, as always
necessary, and cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>quently the <hi>Axiom</hi> is not true in his Judgment,
nor doth he hold, that the practice as to matter of fact, was constant
and universal.</p>
                     <p>3. Giving, not granting, that <hi>Calvin</hi> held the Custom, to have
been throughout these Centuries, to ordain none Presbyters, but such
as were before Deacons, unless he can prove, that <hi>Calvin</hi> held the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
to be founded on divine Warrard, this will only prove that <hi>Calvin</hi>
held it to be an <hi>humane Custom,</hi> and consequently alterable; <hi>ergo</hi> in
<hi>Calvin's</hi> Judgment, this cannot found a Maxim or Axiom, at to that
which is always necessary to be done.</p>
                     <p>4. Granting the utmost which <hi>Calvin</hi>'s words may be drawn to, when
stretcht upon the Tenter-pins till they crack, <hi>viz.</hi> that every Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Minister, must be first a Deacon before he be Ordained, <hi>ergo</hi>

Again what means he by [any Minist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>] if all Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103487:26"/>
are various sorts of Ministers under the New Testament, Apostles, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
Pastors, Deacons, who have all their formal Successors accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Calvin;</hi> How doth he infer <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment, as to the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Call of all, from what he Asserts as to the practice of one? Again
what calls he [a Minister already ordained?] Can there be any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
or Church-Officer who is not ordained? Ordination being rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to some Church-Officers Administration. Finally, what means
he by the [regular Call] of this ordained Minister? If his Instalment
into a higher Office, then this is formally his Ordination; So that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiom</hi>
will run thus, the regular Ordination of any Minister already or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
is from an Office of an Inferiour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is both redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
in sense, the Ordination of one already ordained, being necessary
from a lower to a higher Station, and likewise impertinent to his Scope
and Design, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> to prove that none were ordained Pastors, who were
not first (in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Sense) ordained Deacons; If by [regular Call]
he mean the Call to the exercise of his Function else where, then he
would make <hi>Calvin</hi> with the Independents, to put a <hi>New Ordination,</hi>
for a new <hi>Application of the Office.</hi> Thus the Maxim as here set down
appears impertinent to his Scope, impertinent as to a Discovery of
<hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment in this point, yea, and hardly reconcilable to sound
Sense.</p>

                        </gap> these his two <hi>Definitions</hi> made
it good, that this preheminence in Office, and proportioned prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
in Jurisdiction, which <hi>Calvin</hi> in the places therein cited, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
competent to the Apostles, and Evangelists, was in his Judgment,
neither.</p>
                     <p>First, a fixed Preheminence and Jurisdiction, nor 2. <hi>Ordinary,</hi> or
such as is of a moral standing Nature, of constant use and necessity, in
Church-Government; But that in <hi>Calvins</hi> Judgment, it was such as
did expire, with the persons of these extraordinary New-Testament
Officers;
And that 3. That this Preheminence in Office and jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103487:26"/>
while these expired Offices did exist, is by <hi>Calvin</hi> asserted to be

this their standing essential Interest, and Power in Government;
which in <hi>Calvins</hi> sense, necessarily continues their fixed Priviledge to
the end.</p>
                     <p>So that in a word, if he should apply this general Maxim, to these
necessary Officers, which <hi>Calvin</hi> holds to be of perpetual use, <hi>viz.</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
Elders, Deacons, it shall be easily admitted, but without the

                  <p>The Divine Right is manifest in that Ecclesiastick Government,

nearly concerned. This is proved by <hi>Calvin instit. lib. 4. cap. 6. Sect.</hi>
1. His words are, (We have not before touched upon the Primacy of
the <hi>Roman See,</hi> whence the <hi>Papists</hi> strive to prove, that the Catholick
Church is only with them: Because it hath not taken its original from
Christs Institution, nor the custome of the Ancient Church, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Offices have done, (<hi>viz.</hi> Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons, <hi>Cap.

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Answer.</head>
                     <p>This Maxim needs not a very long animadversion, since the scope
he drives at, is not in the least reached by it, nor our cause prejudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
restricting it unto, and confining it within the limits of that place
of <hi>Calvin</hi> here cited, <hi>viz. That the Church Government by the Officers
mentioned in the close of this citation, has its original from Christs Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi>
was continued in the Apostolick, and Primitive Church, for
moral standing ends.</p>

                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:103487:27"/>
But 2. Comparing it as here worded, and understood by him,
with his first Corollarie, wherein we have the knack of his Project,
and improvement thereof, we must a little further animadvert, and
observe here; That,</p>
                     <p>First it exceeds the limits of this Citation of <hi>Calvin,</hi> in that clause
of [approbation from Heaven by revelation] which in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Corollarie, he understands of an express, and formal delineati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the Epistles to the 7. Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> upon his supposition, or
rather distortion of <hi>Bezas</hi> meaning, anent the Office and Authority of
the Angel written unto; for either he must understand it, (as it's evident
he doth in that Corollarie) of an approbation, Thus specifially distinct
from both the preceeding Clauses, and so the assertion is none of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi>
in this place, or else if it be the same, with what is said of
Christs Institution and continuation by his Apostles, and the Primitive
Churches Retention, this Clause is pitifully redoundant, and a meer
Battollogy, which this Pretender to such exact concisness should be
ashamed to be guilty of.</p>
                     <p>2. We said already, that <hi>Calvin</hi> holds, that the Primitive Church,
did in several things degenerat, from Apostolick purity, and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions,
in point of Government; so that in his Sense, the Primitive
Churches practice, simply considered, will not make a compleat and
just Square for Government. If we compare what he sayes, <hi>chap.</hi> 3.
and 4. <hi>initio,</hi> This will be evident, for he tells us in the place last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
that hitherto he has spoken, of Church-Government, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
as purely institute by God in his Word; insinuating, that the
ancient Church, had quickly her additions, so that <hi>Calvin</hi> makes not
the Ancient Churches Retention, any part of the Rule simply, but
makes it Regulable by the Divine Warrand and Institution. I may
add, that as <hi>Calvins</hi> citation makes no mention, of the end of this Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
whatever may be gathered from it, so it is certain, that in all
reason, and in <hi>Calvins</hi> Principles, the Church-Government,
which has an entire Divine Right, must be commensurat, not to <hi>any</hi>
only, but to <hi>all the ends,</hi> wherein the well being of Christians is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>

mean, a moral standing Right, as Church-Officers of perpetual ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity)
and such as have it not, but are founded upon the Churches
custom, which <hi>Calvin</hi> distinguishes, from this Right, when <hi>I</hi> say,
speaking of the first, he referrs us only to these mentioned, it is certain,
he excluds this mans supposed Successors of Apostles and Evangelists,
in a standing preheminent presidency, over ordinary Pastors; and
consequently holds, that the immediat end, grounding a necessity of
Apostles and Evangelists, their Institution, being temporary, and
passing off with that exigence of the Churches infant state, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
consequently of these Officers, and of their formal Official Power,

                  <p>The want of that Government in the Church, which is of Divine
Right, is pernicious to the Gospel, and Christian Religion. This is
proved by <hi>Calvin (Instit. lib. 4. cap. 8. Sect.</hi> 2.) The words cited

Official Presidency, in Ordination and Jurisdiction over Pastors, of

Church, as the Pastoral Office it self; We say, he offers violence to

a full account of <hi>Calvins</hi> mind thus: <hi>In libro quarto, capite quarto,</hi> In
the 1. 2, and 3. <hi>Sect.</hi> He speaks of the end, use and necessity of a
Gospel-Ministry in the general, of Christs giving to men a Vicarious

reasons, <hi>viz.</hi> To shew his condescendency to our weakness. 2. To

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The first Proposition he undertakes to Demonstrat from his Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
above-examined, is,</head>
                  <p>That the 12 Apostles were president Bishops, over the 70 Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Answer.</head>
                     <p>In general, I may again animadvert here, that if by being <hi>Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Bishops,</hi> be understood the Apostles univeral directive Authority
and Inspection necessarly connected with, and sounded upon their insal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,
as being so many living Oracles, from whom the mind of
Christ was infallibly to be sought, both by Ministers and People, as
to every point of their respective duties, such a Presidency will be
easily admitted; but in this respect he doth foolishly restrict, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
that <hi>Calvin</hi> &amp; <hi>Beza,</hi> doth this restrict their Presidency or Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
to the 70 Disciples, for thus they were president Bishops, over
the universal Church, both Ministers and People, and that while
they lived; In the same respect, and upon the same ground, upon
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103487:30"/>
which they had this presidency over the 70 Disciples, they had it
universally over all, both in the judgement of <hi>Calvin</hi> (as is above e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced)
and of all sound Divines. And in whatever respect he can
alle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dge <hi>Calvin,</hi> to hold their Presidency, to be universal, over the
70 Disciples, it's easie to prove that he holds this Presidency, to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
over all Churches and Ministers; and therefore if he will from
hence infer, successors to them in <hi>Calvins</hi> judgment, he would make
him hold twelve moral standing Primats, and universal Patriarchs or
Popes, with infallible directive power over the whole Catholick
Church.</p>
                     <p>2 I observe, that by asserting the Apostles, to be mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> President
Bishops, he would make men believe that he pleads only for a moral
standing fixed Presidency; But (as I did above touch) he pleads
by this first Proposition and Assumption, for a standing moral Prelatick
Dominion, over Church Judicatories serued up to the highest Peg.

                     <p>This Proposition, as here worded, we did above dis-prove, and
did shew, that according to his design in this Citation of <hi>Calvin,</hi> he
must add both <hi>a sole power,</hi> and likewise an <hi>ordinary power;</hi> that
this place of <hi>Galvin</hi> will neither prove his holding it fixed, nor an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

disown in several places above-cited. Besides the above-evinced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency

the 70 Disciples and <hi>Calvin</hi>'s silence as to <hi>Mathias</hi> in both the places

fixed preheminence, the <hi>Axiom</hi> itself asserts the regular Call of any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister

did shew the impertinency of <hi>Calvins</hi> citation to prove this, and that he
neither simply asserts this matter of fact, as he sets it down, nor gives
his approbation of it, so that this <hi>Axiom</hi> is none of <hi>Calvins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. For his inference from it, that the 12 had a fixed Preheminency
over the 70, who sees not its remotness? Behold, the visage of this
Reason, <hi>Calvin</hi> says, that the Church sometimes choosed Presbyters,
out of Deacons, <hi>ergo</hi> he ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rts that the 12 Apostles had a fixed Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
over the 70 Disciples.</p>
                     <p>3. If by [Fixed] he mean a preheminence <hi>ordinary,</hi> and to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,</hi>
we have proved that <hi>Calvin</hi> denyes and disowns this, in the
places above cited, and asserts as evidently as man can speak, that the
Apostolick Official Preheminence, as such, was neither Fixed, Limited,
nor Ordinary; that they were invested with a power of Ordination
regulat by Canons, he tells us is proved by <hi>Postulatum</hi> 1. and <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
1.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Postulatum</hi> says, that the 70 Disciples were in the holy Order of
the Ministry, and how he has proved this from <hi>Calvin,</hi> we have above
seen, especially with relation to <hi>Mathias;</hi> Where we told him that
<hi>Calvins</hi> assertion of the <hi>Sameness of the pastoral Function</hi> in all ordinary
Pastors, <hi>and the extraordinary expired Nature</hi> of the Apostolick Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Authority, cutts off his inference of such a standing Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
among Pastors, as he imagins him to hold.</p>
                     <p>Next, what a Rope of Sand is this, the 70 were inferiour to the 12
Apostles, <hi>ergo</hi> they had a fixed ordinary power of Ordination over
them; and (forsooth) regulated by Canons.</p>
                     <p>He next proves this by <hi>Definition</hi> 1. Which asserts that the power of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103487:31"/>
Ordination, is the Right of Governours of the Church to separate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
duely qualified to the Ministry; This <hi>Calvin</hi> asserts, is proper on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Pastors, which we proved, doth infer clearly against this mans
Design, <hi>Calvins</hi> asserting the Pastor to be the highest ordinary Officer,
and the expired extraordinary Nature of the Apostolick and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listick
Offices, together with the equal Function of all Pastors, which
Assertions of <hi>Calvin</hi> doth render this Inference, <hi>Ergo the Apostles were
invested with an ordinary power of Ordination and Iurisdiction over Pastors,
to be transmitted to the Church,</hi> (which is this mans Scope and Conclusion
upon the premised general Assertion of <hi>Calvin,</hi> anent the right of
Church-Governours) to be a meer <hi>non sequitur,</hi> and an <hi>ergo, baculus

                     <p>The Apostles Preheminency in jurisdiction ballanced by assisting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
he proves by <hi>Axiom</hi> 2. which he refers to <hi>Definition</hi> 2 and 3.

this supposed Apostolick Preheminency is with <hi>Calvin</hi> neither <hi>Fixed,</hi> nor

which is to continue to the end; besides the inconsistency wherein we

2. Since he will not say that <hi>Calvin</hi> will disowne the Apostles Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Presidency over <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> as over the 70 Disciples, who
with <hi>Calvin</hi> might be Evangelists, he should rather have ascribed to the
Apostles, a moral standing Arch-Episcopacy or Patriarchat; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a president Bishop, over such a great President Bishop as <hi>Timothy</hi>
and <hi>Titus,</hi> merits that Name.</p>
                     <p>The first Proposition of his Demonstration, is thus.</p>
                     <p>These are president Bishops who are from their Office preheminent
unto other Ministers, invested with a fixed power of Ordination, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by Canons, and of Jurisdiction, ballanced by assisting Ministers.

                        </gap>lists, and holds that such
fixed Presidents, as the Church did after set up, did not infringe the
collegiat power and Authority of Pastors, but were subject to them;
And that <hi>Calvin</hi> disowns an official preheminency in any Pastor over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and expresly a peculiar Designation of <hi>Bishop,</hi> as an <hi>abuse of
Scripture language,</hi> and contrair to the <hi>Divine Institution.</hi> So that the
Major of his Demonstration, and this Definition whereupon (as the
preceeding) it is grounded, appears to be a rotten Fabrick, and a
bowing Wall, and tottering Fence.</p>
                     <p>I cannot but further observe, that he makes this goodly Proposition,
containing his Definition of the president Bishop, serve both <hi>Paul,</hi> and
the other Apostlesturn, for proof of his Episcopal Presidency, and
likewise <hi>Timothy</hi> with the inferiour sort of Bishops, thus equi-parating
them, and shaping their Episcopacy with one and the same Standard
and Measure; The place of <hi>Calvin</hi> which speaks of <hi>Paul</hi>'s sole Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Hands upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> whereby he would fortifie this part of the
Definition, relating to Ordination, serves also with him for <hi>Timothy</hi>'s
like Episcopacy, giving thus to them both a sole power in Ordination;
And how consistent this is with <hi>Calvins</hi> Sense of the power of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles

                     <p>For evincing the Falshood of this Assumption, I do refer to what is
answered on that Postulatum; wherein we have made it appear, that
with <hi>Calvin</hi> the Official power and preheminency of both Apostles and
Evangelists, being expired, and dying with their persons, our Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleters
Inference of <hi>Calvins</hi> asserting a moral standing Official Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency
among Pastors, is most absurd. That with <hi>Calvin</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
and Evangelistick Preheminency being neither <hi>fixed nor ordinary,</hi>
his Inference <hi>of a fixed and ordinary Preheminency,</hi> upon what <hi>Calvin
asserts of the power of Apostles</hi> and Evangelists, is obviously imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and groundless; We did also offer some Topicks and Arguments,
from <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrines and Principles, as to Apostles and Evangelists,
which do clearly demonstrat the absurdity of his Collection, in this
Postulatum from the words of <hi>Calvin</hi> annexed thereunto; as that with
<hi>Calvin,</hi> the Official Power of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and his Inspection, was in extent
Correspondent to that of Apostles, that it did suppose the Churches <hi>in
fieri,</hi> as to their Organick Mold and Constitution; As likeways the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of the Apostolick Office, that <hi>Calvin</hi> expresly distinguishes,
the official Presidency or Preheminency exercised by <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi>
as being extraordinary, from the ordinary and perpetual necessary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Power of Pastors; Likeways that with <hi>Calvin,</hi> neither <hi>Timothy</hi>
nor <hi>Titus</hi> were fixed to any certain particular and determinat Station;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103487:33"/>
and are in this distinguished from ordinary and perpetually necessary
Church-Officers. We did also shew that the place of <hi>Calvin,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he would fortifie his Postulatum, doth palpably overthrow it, both
in his asserting <hi>Timothy</hi> to be the <hi>Apostles Depute,</hi> sustaining his room,
and none of the <hi>ordinary Ministry,</hi> and likeways in his express asserting
his Power to be <hi>beyond the limits of the ordinary power of Pastors.</hi> So
that the Assumption of this Demonstration, is also false, as the Major
Proposition, and none of them <hi>Calvins,</hi> but a couple of phantastick
Chymeraes of his own brain. The Conclusion.</p>

these Fathers were, in <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Bezas</hi> judgement, sure he will not

from his simple narration <hi>of the matter of fact, and practice of the Church.</hi>
I did also shew, that if he make <hi>Calvin</hi> allow meerly of a constant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,

that in his 3 Definition, he sayes nothing to his purpose and scope,
unless he qualifie the Power of this supposed President Bishop, not
only with the property, and adjunct of [fixed] but also with that
of (<hi>Ordinary</hi>) both which that <hi>Calvin</hi> disowns in the Apostles and
Evangelists, we proved from clear places, both of his Commentaries
and Institutions.</p>
                     <p>And for his other proof of that Definition, taken from <hi>Calvins</hi> equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating,
the power of this President. Bishop, with that of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul;
We did disprove it, not only from <hi>Calvins</hi> explication, that it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only the gathering of the Votes, and seeing the Sentence execute;
but likewise, from his plain and positive assertion, that this Proestos
or President was subject to his Colleagues, whence by inevitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
it follows, that he had no such Official Preheminence over
them, as this man alledges <hi>Calvin</hi> doth hold.</p>
                     <p>3. Again, whereas the fixing of this Power in the President Bishop,
is, as the other branch of his Assumption, proved by Definition 3.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103487:35"/>
What we have said to disapprove his scope in this 3 Definition, doth
sufficiently evert this Branch, of the Assumption grounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon</p>
                     <p>4. Finally, upon <hi>Axiom</hi> 2. referring to both these his Definitions,
we have evinced, that this Preheminence in Office, and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-preheminence in Jurisdiction, which <hi>Calvin</hi> in the places therein
cited, supposes competent to the Apostles and Evangelists, was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Offices; and that <hi>3ly.</hi> During the existence of this extraordinary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence,

<hi>cumulative unto,</hi> not <hi>privative of,</hi> the <hi>ordinary collegiat authority of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi>
in Ordination and Jurisdiction; So that, that <hi>Axiom,</hi> as understood
by this man, of a supposed moral standing preheminent president Bishop
over Pastors, we have fully proved, in the places above-cited, that
<hi>Calvin</hi> doth disown it, and consequently, the Assumption of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
as none of his. The Conclusion is,</p>

anent the president Angel, expressly adding this <hi>Proviso</hi> &amp; Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to guard against any mis-application, of what he sayes anent the

and practice of the Official compleat parity among Pastors, our Lords

                     <p>1. For the first Branch, proved by Proposition 1. wherein it's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
the Apostles were president Bishops, over the 70. Disciples;
we have above everted this Proposition, and his pretended Proofs, and
discovered its absurdity, and that he doth most impertinently restrict
the Apostles Presidency, as Apostles to the 70, and imagins <hi>Calvin</hi> to
hold this, that the Apostles presidency; respecting the whole Church,
Ministers, and Flocks, he will thus in the <hi>Sequel</hi> and <hi>Series</hi> of his Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
make <hi>Calvin</hi> to assert twelve moral standing Primates or Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs
over the universal Church, with infallible directive Power over
the same. We have also in opposition to his Proposition, demonstrat
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103487:40"/>
that the Apostles were not fixed ordinary president Bishops, over the
70 in <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment; so that this main point of the proof of his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
appears nought. I cannot but again observe, that with
this man, the president Episcopacy, which he imagins <hi>Calvin</hi> to hold,
as of a perpetual necessity, is <hi>Pauls</hi> sole Apostolick power in ordination
and Jurisdiction, and consequently his primitive Fathers, must be of that
same Shape and Mold succeeding in, and thus continuing this formal
apostolick official Power, and how absurdly any man imputs this to
<hi>Calvin</hi> or <hi>Beza,</hi> as their Judgment, and how hypocritically under
the simple notion of a <hi>President Bishop</hi> (which <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> do
acknowledge creeped early into the Church) is above evinced.</p>

<hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Crete;</hi> This Proposition together with the pretended
proofs thereof, we have above examined and everted, and proven that

over these Churches, was (as that of Apostles) neither fixed nor ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,

died with their persons, and have herein consequently discovered the

Officers extraordinary and temporary) in their official Power. In

                     <p>Upon this <hi>Axiom,</hi> I have told him, that as of it self, it's found and
consonant to the Principles of <hi>Calvin,</hi> and all found Divines, so taking
it as restricted to his scope expressed, in his citation of <hi>Calvin, (instit.
lib. 4. cap. 8. Sect. 2.)</hi> anent the necessity of the Apostolick and
Ministerial Office, for the Churches Preservation, wherein he supposes
him to assert, an Apostolick standing preheminency, and Official Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidency
in Ordination and Jurisdiction, to be of equal perpetual ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
with the Pastoral Office it self, we have in Answer to this
told him, that as he has mistaken the place of <hi>Calvin;</hi> which we have
put in its right room; so these words may be soundly understood of
the Ministerial Office, as continued in that of the <hi>Apostolick Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and Eminenter,</hi> from which a Ministerial Authority, and Office
of perpetual necessity is derived. In which sense, our Lord's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
presence with his Apostles, to the end of the World, is
to be understood; We have also demonstrate this, and this only,
to be <hi>Calvins</hi> sense, by a large account of the series and contexture
of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s discourse, in the Chapter where this passage stands, so
that <hi>Calvin</hi> doth palpably contradict this mans sense, of the president
Bishop. <hi>Calvin</hi> asserting the temporary expired state, and nature
of the Apostolick Office, as above that of the Pastor, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
(in the citation of this Pamphleter immediately preceeding)
that Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons, are the only Officers, that
have a Divine standing Right, of perpetual necessity; That as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
makes the Bishop and Presybters Office one and the same, so he
makes it in this distinct from the Apostolick and Evangelistick, that
the one is ordinary and perpetual, the other not, the one imports

a fixed Charge over a definite Flock, the other not, the one is suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>The want of that Government, which in the sense of <hi>Calvin</hi> and
<hi>Beza,</hi> has no Divine Right, or Warrand, is not according to them

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103487:42"/>
the adequat ground, rendering this want pernicious, then the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Divine Right, must have the contrary effect, and in
sound methods of reasoning, bear the contrary Conclusion, by the
Rule of Opposits. I subsume.</p>

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Assumption.</head>
                     <p>But the President Episcopacy pleaded for by this man, is a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church, which has no Divine Right, in the sense of
these Divines. This I proved in his own mould, as he refers, for proof
of this Divine Right, to the preceeding Corollary; I refer (for
evincing this negative) to the confutation of his Positive or Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,
and the discovery of its falshood, immediately premised.
Whereupon I draw out a contradictory conclusion to his; therefore
the want of the President Episcopacy, pleaded for by him, is not in
the sense of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> prejudicial to the cause of Christ, or the
Christian Religion, which was to be proved; or if he will listen to
another Demonstration, he may have it thus.</p>

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Demonstration, Major.</head>
                     <p>If the Churches having the President Episcopacy pleaded for by
him, being the sense of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> prejudical to the cause of
Christ, then the Churches want of it, cannot be thus prejudicial.</p>
                     <p>This Major I am hopeful, common reason and learning will not
suffer him to deny, Since the denyal thereof, would cause so many
clear Rules, of even natural, far more this Gentlemans acquired and

                     <p>But so it is, that the existence of that President Episcopacy,
(which he pleads for) in the Church, is, in the sense of these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
prejudicial to the cause of Christ. This I prove thus; That

But the President Episcopacy which he pleads for, is in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

in their Judgement the Churches prejudice, to have been burthened
with this Government. The Minor is above fully proved, First as to
<hi>Calvin,</hi> in that as he clearly asserts, all Pastors to have one and the
same Function, so the encroachment of one under the peculiar title
of Bishop, upon this their equal Authority, we heard him expresly
condemn upon <hi>Phil,</hi> 1. And next for <hi>Beza,</hi> we heard him clearly
assert, that the <hi>Episcopus humanus,</hi> and the begun encroachments
thereof, upon the Collegiat Authority of Pastors, in Churches Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
gave the rise to the Oligarchical and Antichristian ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,

over Pastors, as this man has shappen out, be not of this mould in <hi>Beza</hi>'s

the whole, that therefore the existence of this President Bishop in the
Church, (to which our Pamphleter has endeavoured to draw the
Patrociny of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> in these distorted places, above examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
is by them condemned as an Idol of jealousy, prejudicial to the
