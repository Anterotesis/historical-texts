         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
LETTER
TO A
GENTLEMAN
CONCERNING
ALKALI and ACID.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE have a <hi>ſmall Champion</hi> lately come
forth for the <hi>Acid Cauſe;</hi> he conceals
his Name, but he ſaith he is <hi>a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
hoping, I ſuppoſe, to find the better Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
But he profeſſeth his <hi>Averſion</hi> to ſuch an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
but that he is at length, and <hi>at laſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by Zeal for the Service</hi> of his Acid Phyſician.
And he ſaith that at <hi>his firſt reading my Dialogue, he
diſcover'd ſo much unbecoming Language, that had not
Requeſts, as forcible as Commands, chang'd his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
he had never been condemn'd to a ſecond read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
much leſs to the Task of writing Remarks upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, the Gentleman is to be excus'd, becauſe he
did it unwillingly; and I readily confeſs, there is
indeed much unbecoming Language even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61509:3"/>
in the firſt eighteen Pages; and truly had it not
been too nauſeous, the Reader might have had a
great deal more on't; but what he has, was but juſt
enough to ſhew a Specimen of the immodeſt Self-applauſe,
ſhameful Contempt, and abuſe of all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
wherewith the Pretender to a new Acid Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis
abounds, and what ſort of Anſwer ſuch
Language deſerveth. At which the Gentleman was
ſo uneaſie, that he leap'd over two Pages more
where there is none; but the ground of Mr. <hi>Acid</hi>'s
Hypotheſis examin'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He tells us, pag. 4.</hi> That undecent perſonal Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are no marks of Probity and Virtue, but are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the cognizance of a generous Mind; <hi>and tells us
in</hi> Greek <hi>too,</hi> that it is Blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, if it be Blaſphemy to reflect upon the
Follies and Confidence of a raw Empirick, boaſting
himſelf the only Doctor in the World; I think
it is but juſt to be ſuch a Blaſphemer. And ſince
there is nothing ſo fooliſhly ſaid by ſuch men, but
catches Patients now-a-days, when ſo few under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
Nature or good Senſe, and they are ſo often
caught to the damage of their Lives and Healths;
I think it is not only the part of a good and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Mind, and a Virtue, but a Duty to expoſe
them, and that ſometimes in the way <hi>Solomon</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<hi>Pro. 26. 5.</hi> But I think no body hath expos'd
Mr. <hi>Colebatch</hi> ſo much as he has expos'd himſelf, to
the thinking part of thoſe that read him.</p>
            <p>The Gent. <hi>is amaz'd,</hi> he ſays, <hi>to ſee the ingenious
Author of the Hypotheſis of Acids treated with the utmoſt
Contempt and Scorn.</hi> But I am as much amaz'd to
ſee any Gentleman admire the Wit in his Writings,
or Phyſician take him for the Author of any thing
but the abuſe of Acids; and that his Friend ſhould
ſay, <hi>that not one Author has examin'd his Hypotheſis by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61509:3"/>
Reaſon and Experience,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="2+ words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊…〉</desc>
               </gap>th read my Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
more than once, and confeſſes <hi>it becomes Men
of Letters, Gentlemen and Philoſophers, (as Phyſicians
are) to weigh and conſider the force of every Man's
reaſoning.</hi> I think it will be confeſs'd by thoſe that
are Judges, I have weigh'd Mr. <hi>Colebatch</hi>'s Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and found it very light; and I am now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to put that of the Gentleman, his Champion,
alſo into the Scale, and ſee how much it comes to.
I am glad the Gent. acknowledges Phyſicians to be
Gentlemen and Philoſophers; but I begin to doubt
whether he be a Philoſopher and a Phyſician; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he altogether blames Jeſting, when it is well
known to ſuch Men, that ſome Diſeaſes are cured
thereby, and that Satyr is often preſcrib'd againſt
ſome Maladies endangering the Life and Health of
Men, that have their root in the Mind; ſuch as
<hi>Pride, Ignorance, Confidence, Covetouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. in
a Practioner, which the Dialogue was compos'd as
a Medicine to cure Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> of, if not incurable.</p>
            <p>The Gent. ſays farther, <hi>that Poetry is a very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thing; but agrees with his Doctor, that the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of a Satyriſt and a Phyſician are vaſtly different.</hi>
I am of the ſame Mind; but I find the Gent. does
not love a Satyr, the <hi>Panegyrick to the unknown Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi>
Colebatch would reliſh well enough with him;
but he is not a <hi>thorough Proſelyte</hi> to Acids yet; for a
<hi>Sarcaſtical Couplet</hi> is too ſharp for his Stomach, and
he thinks <hi>it ſhould not be preſs'd againſt its will to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
a Profeſſor of Phyſick.</hi> And I think it was not,
in the caſe he means, but came only againſt a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
and Abuſer of Acids. But <hi>Sarcaſms</hi> I'le
maintain are Acids, or they are not <hi>Sarcaſms;</hi>
and Acid with Acid methinks ſhould well agree:
But perhaps theſe are Acids out of his Practice. But
I'll ſay one thing more for them, they need not be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61509:4"/>
preſs'd, but are apt enough to come Volunteers,
and muſter freely upon any proper Occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Gentlemen that value themſelves upon their
Wit, he eſteems the more genteel Mountebanks.</hi> 'Tis
well they are the more genteel ſort; and I ſhould
chuſe, I confeſs, if we muſt all be Mountebanks, to
be of that number. He allows <hi>they ſhew more Wit
and fine Language, in their ſarcaſtical Bills diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Bookſellers, than what breaks forth from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
merry</hi> Andrew'<hi>s</hi> Charcoal Whiskers, or wraps
up <hi>John Saffold</hi>'s Pills and Powder; <hi>but the Nature,
Deſign, and Effect of the Farce is the ſame.</hi> He's a
Conjurer! he can tell they all aim at Money with
common ſucceſs, and ſo does Mr. <hi>Colebatch.</hi> But
he that is bubbled on't, I think, had as good be
bubbled by a witty Conceit as a fooliſh one; and
if he has nothing elſe, have ſome Wit for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>But the Gent, ſays, <hi>he will never truſt his Life in
the hands of a Phyſician, who takes ſo much pains to
convince the World he is a rare Poet.</hi> I confeſs a Man
may be a rare Poet and not a Phyſician, and a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
and not a Poet: But I think a Man that has
Wit enough to be a Poet, may have enough to be
a Phyſician, if he apply himſelf to that Study: But
he that has not enough, I think is never the rather
to be truſted with ones Life, <hi>till by a Demonſtration
he proves, that tho' a correct Canto will not cure a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,</hi>
as the Gent. ſays, yet
<q>
                  <l>A dull Aſſertion that he can do more,</l>
                  <l>Than all the Doctors that have gone before,</l>
               </q>
will do the buſineſs. But for my part, I'll never
truſt my Life in a Man's hands that hath nothing
ſharp but Medicines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61509:4"/>
But what has Poetry to do with the pretended
new Hypotheſis of Acids, or the Dialogue between
<hi>Alkali</hi> and <hi>Acid?</hi> What unlucky Wag has thrown
a Diſtich at Mr. <hi>Colebatch,</hi> and hit a Gentleman al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo?
And why muſt I anſwer for it?</p>
            <p>But the Gent. comes to talk of Experiments,
pag. 5. He follows Mr. <hi>Acid</hi>'s method, firſt he plays
a little, and then he comes to work. And he ſays,
<hi>I have not given one Experiment, or laid down the
proceſs of any one Medicine I would recommend to the
World for the good of Mankind, or that might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the Hypotheſis of Acids.</hi> I anſwer, as for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
to overthrow the Hypotheſis of Acids,
I leave it to the Judgment of the intelligent Reader,
whether there are not enough to do it in my Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue;
tho' ſome of them I find the Hypothetick
knows not how to make, which is a ſhame, whilſt
he profeſſes himſelf a Philoſopher and a Chymiſt:
But he may have more before we have done. But
as for commending my Medicines or ſelf to the
World, in the manner ſome do, I count it but
Quacking, and like it not, nor have any neceſſity ſo
to do.</p>
            <p>The People are fond of <hi>Recipe</hi>'s, and the Doctor
knows 'tis not againſt his Intereſt to let them have
ſome, his Books will ſell the better; and if he does
not tell them they are to be had at reaſonable rates
of the Author, and preſcribe the making them a
more chargeable way than he himſelf makes them,
the indiſcreet adminiſtration ſome Dablers make of
them, does but breed buſineſs for the Doctor; but
the rich and cautious will have Advice, and who
ſo ſit to adviſe with, as that honeſt Gentleman who
is ſo kind as to let them know with what Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he does their buſineſs. I do not eſteem it
impolitick in Phyſicians to publiſh ſome Medicines
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61509:5"/>
to the World, or to permit Horſe-Doctors, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
other ignorant Fellows, ſince they ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
make work for one another. And I believe

Neither do I think the Learned will ſpend their time
in his trivial Books; nor ſhould I, had not Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy,

            <p>The Gent. ſays, pag. 5. <hi>He hath confirm'd his
Arguments for Mr.</hi> Colebatch'<hi>s Doctrine with variety
of Experiments, but he reſerves a far greater number
for his Service, if I, or any for me, think fit to anſwer.</hi>
'Tis well he has a Reſerve, for his variety is
ſmall, and not much to his purpoſe, as we ſhall ſee
by and by. But let us have them that are ready,
and I'll promiſe him I'll never requeſt any Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to anſwer for me, being old enough to ſpeak
for my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Well, but the Gent. comes firſt, pag. 6. <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
my Arguments, whereby,</hi> he ſays, <hi>I endeavour to
defend Alkali as not being the Cauſe of Diſeaſes, for th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
other Cauſes that are not Alkalies may be aſſign'd.</hi> But
I muſt tell the Gent. there is no ſuch Argument in
my Dialogue; and had there been ſuch, I ſhould
have been aſham'd of it, as he ought to be of ſaying
ſo. It would be but a poor Argument, that Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
cannot be the cauſe of Diſeaſes, becauſe other
Cauſes may be aſſign'd: But that Alkali cannot be
the cauſe of <hi>all Diſeaſes,</hi> when other Cauſes muſt be
aſſign'd, is that which I think I have demonſtrated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:61509:5"/>
The Gent. ſays, my <hi>Definition of the</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>tho' granted, no way militates againſt the Hypotheſis of
Acids. For when we ſpeak of the Cauſe of a Diſeaſe,
which Phyſicians are ſaid to diſcover and remove, we
always ſuppoſe the proximate Cauſe, which the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
can never be.</hi> But the Gent. almoſt perſwades me
here that he is more like to be a Gentleman than a
Phyſician, becauſe he ſays, <hi>we always ſuppoſe the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Cauſe;</hi> that is, we Gentlemen, when as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
know well that the Proximate Cauſe is not
the only Cauſe to be diſcover'd and remov'd: Of
which I need not give many inſtances. The vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Aporrhea</hi> of the Body, of themſelves innoxious
by undue retention, are often alter'd and become
hoſtile, which ill qualities are the Proximate Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of divers Diſeaſes; the alterations of which ill
Qualities are far from being the only things to be
done, nor is it enough for a Phyſician to endeavour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Ejection of the peccant Matter, but the faults
of the Inſtruments of Secretion are to be amended,
as the prime Cauſes of the Diſeaſes; ſo that if Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali
it ſelf unduly retain'd or abounding, were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
the Proximate Cauſe of ſome Diſeaſe, yet
there would be the Cauſe of that Retention or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding,
as the chief Cauſe to be known and taken
away by the Phyſician. But I fancy the Gent. if
not a Phyſician, is ſo much a Friend to the Practice,
he would willingly have the proximate Cauſes only
meddled with; have the Pump plyed, rather than
the Leak ſtop'd, leſt the Crew ſhould want Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
The Gent. lets the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> reſt here,
ſo that if we will ſee what he has farther to ſay that
it can't be the Proximate Cauſe of a Diſeaſe, and ſo
diſpatch the Subject all together, we muſt go to
the <hi>10th.</hi> page, where he falls on him again for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to have a ſhare with Alkali in the Cauſe of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61509:6"/>
Diſeaſes. He ſays, <hi>I ſhould have told them what
theſe exorbitant Deſires of the Will of Man were, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Deſire of Money, Women, Revenge, or popular
Applauſe: If I mean theſe,</hi> Tyburn <hi>gives proofs that
by them the Blood comes to be retarded, as well as the
ſubtile Liquors diſorder'd.</hi> And I am of the opinion,
that if the Deſire of theſe would produce or retain
ſuch malign Particles, as he believes Alkalies to be,
Mr. <hi>Acid</hi> had been mortally ſick of them e're now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and if ſimple Man-ſlaying were Death by the Law,
ſome Acid Practitioners might e're now have been
unable to ſecrete their own mortal Alkali, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the aſtringency of their Collars, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the ſourneſs of the Crab-tree.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Gent. ſays, pag. 11.</hi> he will not affirm the
production of Alkali by the Operation of the Mind; but
a diſappointment of the Mind he knows will of a ſudden
cauſe a Relaxation of the whole <hi>Syſtema Nervoſum,</hi>
whereby Perſpiration and all Secretions are obſtructed,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which often happens to Women: And by ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation
of the Nerves, and Conſtipation of the Pores,
there are frequently induced Convulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the
Diſappointment is but an antecedent Cauſe, which Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
meddles not with; but the <hi>Materia ex qua</hi> is Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali's
malign Particles, whoſe Secretion is thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
which retain'd is ſufficient to produce the moſt
diſmal Symptoms.</p>
            <p>Here the Gent. is profound! But I would know
of him, whether a Relaxation of the whole <hi>Syſtema
Nervoſum,</hi> which he ſays is caus'd by a ſudden
Paſſion, be not a Diſeaſe. But that a Relaxation
of the Nerves ſhould cauſe ſuch univerſal Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yea Conſtipations and Convulſions, muſt be
found out by ſome new light in Philoſophy, that
can demonſtrate, that looſing is binding and pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together: But if he had conſider'd that ſome
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61509:6"/>
ſudden Paſſions of the Mind have not only let go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Breeches that which ſhould have been depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
in ſome more convenient Receptacle, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
univerſal Sweats, he would hardly have been
of that Opinion.</p>
            <p>But the Gent. <hi>defies me to prove that Nature ever
ſecretes any thing in a ſtate of Health, that will come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the denomination of an Acid. A Morbid Body,</hi>
ſays he, <hi>when the Nerves are relax'd, will ſometimes
eject the moſt benign Juices,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as in Scrophulous,
Cancerous, Venereal, and Cachectical Bodies.</hi> Here
the Gent. has caught himſelf, as I will prove by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentum
ad hominem.</hi> Nature ſecretes common
Salt in the Urine plentifully, and <hi>Saliva</hi> in a ſtate of
Health, both which he has aſſerted to be Acids e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſince he has been a Proſelyte to the Doctrine;
therefore Nature in a ſtate of Health, according to
his own Opinion, ſecretes things that will come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the denomination of Acids. What's become of
his Defiance? But if he recants, and ſays theſe things
are not Acids, then he loſes as much another way,
and I'll ask him what he thinks of the <hi>Succus Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaticus,</hi>
which is ſecreted into the ſame place the
wicked Bile is unloaden. But he ſtumbles as bad in
what follows. The Relaxation of the Nerves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
caus'd Obſtructions, and retain'd the malign
Alkali; but now it ejects the moſt benign Juices,
and that in Scrophulous, Cancerous, Venereal, and
Cachectical Bodies, whoſe Recrements, according
to the Gentleman, are the moſt benign Juices: But
I believe theſe Patients, and ſuch as have been too
familiar with ſome of them, ſometimes have not
found them ſo friendly. But the Gent. takes no notice
that the too rapid motion of the Blood was aſſign'd
as another morbous effect of ſudden Paſſion of the
Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61509:7"/>
Now we muſt go back to the <hi>7th.</hi> Page, where
the Gent. gives his Opinion, <hi>That the undue Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the ſolid parts is no Diſeaſe;</hi> but to make
his Opinion good, he will ſuppoſe <hi>that they retain
their due Texture, and duly perform their Offices;</hi> he's
a cunning Man! <hi>he inſtances the Organs of Hearing,
Seeing, Smelling, and Taſting, being diſproportionate
as to ſize and ſhape, are not call'd Diſeaſes.</hi> But if
he had conſider'd a little, or askt ſome Phyſician,
methinks he might have underſtood, or been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
that an Eye, for inſtance, being unduely
form'd, too flat or too protuberant, the Humours
too much or too little, too thick or too thin, are
the Cauſes of divers Defects of Sight, a great Tongue
a hindrance to the Speech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He enquires <hi>whether a
cartilaginous</hi> Aorta, <hi>which,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is what Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
call the Bone of a Stag's Heart, did ever cauſe a
Diſtemper?</hi> He might as well have askt Phyſicians,
whether ever they heard the Stag complain of it.
But he is ill inform'd by thoſe that tell him that a
griſtly Artery is a bone in the Heart. And now I
am ſpeaking of the great Artery, it brings into my
Mind an Obſervation I have read, of divers Perſons
that died with very odd Symptoms, whoſe Diſeaſe
could not be found out or remedied, 'till by diſſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one, there was ſound a large Worm in the
great Artery near the Heart; which I think was
very unlikely to be produc'd by Alkali or Acid ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This caſe was very uncommon, but Worms
in ſome parts of the Body are very frequent, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
bad Effects, and very unlikely to be caus'd
by Acid or Alkali, both of which given are very
effectual to deſtroy them. He ſays, <hi>I cannot aſſert
that ever any Man was diſeaſed, or died, becauſe of
narrow Veins or ſmall Lungs.</hi> I anſwer, narrow
Veins muſt needs contain leſs Blood, and if diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61509:7"/>
to the Body, (otherwiſe I don't call them
narrow) little Blood muſt needs give little Heat
and Vigour, and ſmall Lungs muſt needs receive but
little Air, and drive on the Circulation of the Blood
more ſlowly, which enclines to divers Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The Gent. ſays farther, <hi>he hath often obſerved in
diſſecting Bodies who have had one Kidney obſtructed by
Stones, Gravels,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that the ſound Kidney hath been
enlarg'd conſiderably, and hath perform'd the Office pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to both; and to prove the diſtemper'd Kidney
caus'd by an Alkali in ſuch caſes, he would have the
Stones, Gravel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>examin'd, which will give the
Phoenomena of the moſt fixt Alkali.</hi> Here the Gent.
aſſerts himſelf an Anatomiſt, and to have often made
Diſſections, where one of the Kidneys hath been
uſeleſs; whereby he would ſeem ſomething beſides
a Gentleman. 'Tis no very common thing to find
one Kidney uſeleſs: not one Diſſection perhaps in
a hundred gives ſuch a Caſe, yet he has often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
it: I confeſs I never diſſected ſuch a Body
but once, and the other Kidney was no larger than
ordinary, but that affected was nothing but a Bag
of Stones, and Matter, of which Stones would have
been generated, which was white and ſoft like a
Pap or thin Mortar, full of Stones and Grit, not
Alkali Salt. But how one Kidney ſhould perform
the Office peculiar to both, I don't underſtand; or
how an Alkali ſhould be the Cauſe of a Kidney: I
rather gueſs it peculiar to the Gentleman to talk ſo.
I am ſure the examination of the Stones will no more
prove an Alkali the Efficient either of the Kidney,
or Stones in it, than the Pyrotechnical Analyſis
of Bones will demonſtrate that any one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
made them. The <hi>Calculus</hi> will not give the
<hi>Phoenomena</hi> of the moſt ſixt Alkalies, as he ſays,
but yielding a volatile Salt and Oyl, leaves a <hi>Caput
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61509:8"/>
Mort.</hi> inſipid, having no ſigns of a fix'd ſaline Body
in it. Nor have we ſuch a thing as a ſixt Alkali in
Animal or Vegetable Subſtances, but it is produced
by burning thoſe things that contain the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
of it, nor are Alkalies coagulable into Stones,
without meeting with larger quantities of other
Matter, which with more reaſon may be ſaid to be
the Cauſe of the unhappy Concrete.</p>
            <p>Our Gent. tells us, pag. 8. <hi>That a large Liver is
no more a Diſeaſe than a large Noſe, but of excellent
uſe to ſecrete the Bile, that moſt pernicious Excrement
of the Body; and the larger the Liver, the more Bile it
will ſecrete, and ſo much the more we are benefitted.
But a large morbid Liver he would have granted to be
caus'd by a ſuperabundance of Gall.</hi> The Gent. is
reſolved the Gall ſhall be an Excrement, and the
moſt pernicious one, forgetting <hi>Alkali it ſelf,</hi> while
the Gall is but a compound. But methinks, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
conſiders the place into which it is diſcharged,
muſt be of another Opinion, or believe the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Oeconomy very ill contriv'd. If this Liquor
had no uſe, but were to be rejected as a mere and
pernicious Excrement, one would have thought it
in vain ſeparated out of the Blood, to be poured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the nutritious Juice before it enters the lacteal
Veins; and the more on't the better would be very
ſtrange. One would have thought a Gentleman's
Noſe might have been large enough to ſmell out
ſome uſe for the Bile, better than to make a large
Liver; and for a large Liver, better than to make a
great deal of Bile.</p>
            <p>But pag. 9. he ſhews admirable Senſe, for he tells
us, <hi>It is from Particles of Matter admitted into the
Blood, that is both the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe, and of the
thickneſs or thinneſs of the Blood;</hi> and the reaſon he
gives is, <hi>If there were not a retention of ſome Particles
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61509:8"/>
which ought to be carried off, or admiſſion of others that
ſhould be prevented, the Blood would be neither too thick
nor too thin, but always the ſame.</hi> The thickneſs and
thinneſs of the Blood then are both from Particles
admitted into it, becauſe it would be neither too
thick nor too thin, were there not a Retention of
ſome that ſhould be carried off, or an Admiſſion of
ſome that ſhould be prevented. But what's this to
prove Alkali the Cauſe of all Diſeaſes, any more
than to good ſenſe? But what comes after is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found,
that <hi>in Phyſick it may paſs for a Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that if you find the Blood of one that has the Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm,
Scurvey, or Gout, to abound with Alkali, and
be viſcous, and when he is cur'd by the uſe of Acids, you
find it yield leſs Alkali, and be florid, and of a good
Conſiſtence, it is to him a Demonſtration, the Diſeaſes
came not from Acids but from Alkalies.</hi> That is, if
the Blood have indeed too much Alkali, and thence
be viſcous, and the Perſon be cured by Acids driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out and diminiſhing the Alkali, and reducing
the Blood to its due Conſiſtence, the Diſeaſe was
caus'd by Alkali, and cur'd by Acids. That is,
If the Diſeaſe was caus'd by Alkalies and cur'd by
Acids, it was caus'd by Alkalies and cur'd by Acids;
a Wit! But there's an <hi>If</hi> in the caſe, which makes
the Argument worth nothing: For if this cannot be
found (as I am ſure it has not yet by any certain
Experiments the Acidiſts have given us) we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the better for the Suppoſition. But he ſays, <hi>it
will appear that this is matter of Fact to any that will
make the Experiments. And he dares affirm, that I
can't produce one inſtance of a Perſon cured of thoſe
Diſtempers by Alkalies.</hi> But I ſay he ſhould not be
ſo confident that it will appear ſo to any Man, unleſs
it had appear'd to ſome one that hath try'd it. And
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61509:9"/>
as for his daring Affirmation, I dare affirm the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>The Gent. ſays again, pag. 12. <hi>That I ſuppoſe
there ſhould be 10 or 20 parts of Alkali to one of Acid,
and from either of theſe exceeding their Proportion, the
Acid or the Alkali may be ſaid to abound, but while they
keep to that Standard, neither can be ſuppos'd the Cauſe
of a Diſeaſe.</hi> I ſay ſtill, that whatever the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are, either may exceed and cauſe a Diſeaſe,
the one as well as the other, if there be any ſuch
thing as their exceeding; but when in due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
neither can be thought ſo to do while duely
mix'd, but if ſeparated and lodged apart in ſome
place, tho' there is no more than there was in the
whole Body, yet the Part where the ſeparated Acid
or Alkali is lodged, may ſoon ſuffer their bad Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
But if there may be ſuppos'd 20 parts of
Alkali to one of Acid in a Man in a ſtate of Health,
(tho' I believe there is a greater difference) yet it
may well be thought that the Proportion differs in
divers Perſons, though all in Health, yea in
the ſame Perſon at divers times, though he be well;
wherefore his Inferences that theſe Proportions are
conſtantly to be found is not natural, nor does he
imagine how hard it will prove to find them, if he
ſhould attempt it. But he ſays, <hi>he has been in Health
for ſome Years, and ſo his Blood muſt, on this Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
have abounded with ſuch like Proportions of Acid
and Alkali.</hi> That is, ſuppoſe in a ſtate of Health a
Man's Blood ſhould have 20 parts of Alkali to one
of Acid, the Gentleman being in a ſtate of Health
muſt have his Blood abound with Acid and Alkali;
he abounds in Acid Diſcourſe! and ſuppoſes they
are in due proportion, yet he ſays it follows they
abound, yea and both at the ſame time. <hi>He ought,</hi>
he ſays, <hi>therefore to have a care that what he eats and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61509:9"/>
drinks ſhould have but one part of Acid, to 10 or 20
of Alkali, but he has taken other Meaſures, for he has
drank within this Year one quart of Crab Verjuice in
24 hours, which was ſufficient to impregnate his Blood
with ſix times the quantity.</hi> He's a crabbed Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
I believe; but I ſuppoſe he would not be
thought to drink a quart every Day for this twelve
Months, but in ſome one Day within the time;
however we don't know, but that he may have a
very large Liver, from whence he may abound
with the pernicious Alkalous Excrement Gall, and
that muſt meet with his Verjuice before it get
into the Blood, unleſs it has diſcover'd a way
through the <hi>undiſcover'd paſſages at the bottom of the
Stomach;</hi> or his Blood may abound with Alkali, and
ſo he may bear more ſharp Doſes than ſome Folks
can. Beſides, if he will believe what Dr. <hi>John</hi> his
Maſter hath taught him, <hi>viz. That the Blood can't
ever abound with Acids, either in a morbid or healthy
State; for the Stomach will reject whatever is too
much, but is often defective in conveying in enough,
and that there is never any Acid in the Blood but in
a ſtate of perfect Health.</hi> I ſay, if he believes this as
he ought to do, all the ſtore at the <hi>Verjuice Coffee-Houſe</hi>
will neither hurt him, nor help him. But on
the contrary to what he aſſerts, I my ſelf, and
many others are as healthy as he, <hi>as vegete and
ſprightly,</hi> and yet eat moſtly things abounding with
Alkalies, as freſh Meat, Fowls, Fiſh, Milk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
neither love nor want ſour Sauces to help the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
and find nothing ſo hurtful as Acids. But the
Gentleman I am perſwaded commends Acids ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the Wealth they bring the Doctor, than
the Health they bring the Patient; for the Doctor
ſeldom takes Phyſick. <hi>But he ſays, he could give a
multitude of Inſtances, where Gentlemen have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of their Diſeaſes being exaſperated by taking
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61509:10"/>
Medicines, Phiſicians call Alkalies, but ſoon wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
reliev'd by Acids, the truth of which a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Apothecaries in this City will inform you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gentleman I find is a fellow Citizen with
his Phyſician, and needs not much Epiſtolary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with him. And we cannot but think he
would now be thought ſome man of great Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
though he was ſhy at firſt, and call'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a Gentleman, when a multitude of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
make their complaints to him. But he would,
I ſuppoſe, have Gentlemen-Patients, to whom
there is little odds whether he ſpeak ſenſe or no;
if he be but confident, and ſo profeſſes himſelf a
Gentleman. But thoſe Medicines, he ſays, they
complain of, tho' Phyſicians call them Alkalies,
poſſibly Gentlemen may call Acids, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
do Cures with them, and relieve the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents:
For I believe, I ſhall find the Gentleman
but an ill judge before I have done. But we are
to be inform'd of the truth of the Gentleman's
Aſſertion, by a multitude of Apothecaries. I
confeſs, I never thought it worth while to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
but I never heard any one ſuch ſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by an Apothecary, or his Boy, tho' I have
been in Town ever ſince the wonders of Acids have
been talk'd of; but I have been told of divers mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Cures ſoon done by the Acid method, even in
Diſeaſes that ſeldom uſe to kill, and in ſuch Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
as have often been recover'd by Alkalies.</p>
            <p>The Gent. ſays, pag. 13. <hi>That I aſſert there may
be Acid enough in the Blood to cauſe a Diſeaſe, tho'
it will not turn the Syrup of Violets green, but have
not proved it.</hi> No truly, I have not proved it,
nor ever was ſuch a Fool as to aſſert that Acid
would turn the Syrup of Violets green. But if he
will try, I'll warrant him he may inject Acid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
into the Blood to cauſe a Diſeaſe, and kill,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61509:10"/>
and yet he ſhall not find the Serum of the diſeaſed
Blood turn Syrup of Violets red.</p>
            <p>The Gent. ſaith, pag. 14. <hi>That from the 24 page
of my Dialogue to the 29, there's nothing but ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility,
and quotations out of</hi> Etmuller, Hoſſman,
Helmont <hi>and</hi> Hypocrates, <hi>ſo that the ſtrength of my
Arguments depend altogether upon an</hi> ipſe dixit. As
for what he calls Scurrility, I ſhall not excuſe it,
the recitation of <hi>John</hi>'s panegyrical abuſe of the
College, and dull praiſe of his own admired ſelf,
muſt needs bring ſome ill Language into the pages;
nor did I, without the adviſe of the wiſeſt Man, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
a Fool according to his folly, leſt he be
wiſe in his own Eyes. But the Gent. ſeeing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
he did not like, or care any more to ſtir in,
makes too much haſt over the 5 pages, or elſe he
might have ſeen ſome notable Quotations out of
<hi>Colbatch de Aſsheadis,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Blood has never
any Acid in it, but in a ſtate of perfect Health. That
all Perſons have ſome degree of Sickneſs. That over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
fatneſs, if it may be call'd a Diſeaſe, is caus'd by
Acids.</hi> Yet that Acids <hi>(tho' never in the Blood, but
in perfect Health)</hi> mortifie and expel the Luxuriant
Alkalous Particles, <hi>make the thick Blood thin, and
the thin Blood thick: But that he that can ſhew how
this is done, muſt be as wiſe as the wiſeſt Man that
ever was, or ſhall be; but yet he tells us how Acids do
theſe things, by being differently ſpecified with other
things.</hi> Therefore the Gentleman has not done
genteely by me, in ſaying, there was nothing in
the 5 pages but ſcurrility, and quotations out of
<hi>Helmont, Hoffman, Hypocrates,</hi> and <hi>Etmuller,</hi>
whoſe <hi>ipſe dixit's</hi> I hope are yet as good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with the Phyſical World, as <hi>Colbatch</hi>'s, or
any ſmall Author's of greater Confidence, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time, and Practice. <hi>He ſays alſo that I have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61509:11"/>
falaciouſly taught a wrong way of experimenting, whether
Acids will thicken and coagulate the Blood; for he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
that I made my Experiments on Blood that
had ſtood, when the grumous part was coagulated, which
is a very irrational way.</hi> I anſwer, his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is too ſhort, I did not make a few Experiments
on Blood, or a few ways; I have not only tryed
Blood when cold, or in a Porringer, but let it run
out of the Vein unto Acid, and other Liquors, and
that diluted, and with warm Water. If the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
be much it will make a great alteration; if lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
proportionally; but tho' it be ſo little as to
make no alteration ſenſible to the Eye, yet the
Acid particles may pin together ſome of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bules
of the Blood, ſo as to make a Figure, and
ſize, that will not paſs ſome ſmall Veſſel or other,
and that ſtop more, and that ſtagnated Blood may
corrupt, and get a peregrine ferment, and either
produce ſome topical Maladie, or excite ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
fermentation in the Blood that preſſes
upon it. But as to the Gentleman's queſtion, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Acids diluted and taken inwardly will coagulate
the Blood when its warm, fluid, and perpetually cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating
through it's Channels, and a due commixture
made of all its parts with whatever is ingeſted?</hi> I
anſwer, This Queſtion amounts to this, whether
the Blood will be coagulated by Acids while it
retains its due Motion and Conſiſtence; that is, in
ſhort, whether the Blood will be coagulated while
it is uncoagulated? A wiſe Queſtion!</p>
            <p>But he tells us, <hi>to convince us, that Acids will not
coagulate the Blood when judiciouſly uſed, (judiciouſly,</hi>
that is I ſuppoſe by the preſcription of an Acid,
Dr. or elſe they may.) <hi>We may take 4 or 5 drops of
Oyl of Vitriol, or Sp. of Niter in 3 or 4 ſpoonfuls of
Water;</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Such a proportion of Acid is as much, or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61509:11"/>
more than can be admitted into the Blood at any time,
when taken inwardly.</hi> But how does the Gentleman
know that no more can be admitted? Why he ſays
ſo, and he'd have us believe him. Well we will for
once; but then ſay I, I doubt Acids will do no
wonders in caſting out the Devil Alkali: For
ſuppoſe a Man ſhould have 12 Ounces of Alkali in
him (which is a ſmall quantity to what may well be
ſuppoſed,) but by ſome error in Diet, or by ſome
other means he has 13 or 14 Ounces; 4 or 5
drops of Oyl of Vitriol, or Sp. of Niter will do
very little towards expelling, or mortifying an
Ounce or 2 of Alkali, as any one may ſee by mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch Quantities; nor can the Gentleman en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
that ſmall Cargo of Acid to arrive ſafe into the
deſigned port, but ten to one ſome part of it may
be loſt by the way, ſplitting on ſome Alkalous
Rock in the Stomach, or be pyrated by the Gall,
and ſo carried another way out of the body. But
tho' there is great doubt what may become of it
if given inwardly, yet it is certain it may be mixt
in what quantity one pleaſes in a Porringer; but
then whether the Porringer would not borrow a
little of it, or lend it ſome Matter to make <hi>Sacch.
Saturni</hi> of, I ſuppoſe the Gent. never enquired,
or whether the Gooſe Quill he ſtirs it with, and
the Water does not do more to hinder its Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
than the Acids did to hinder or promote it.
But we come to the Gentleman's Experiments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He tells us,</hi> the way to make <hi>Experiments on
Blood is,</hi> having open'd a Vein, begin to drop your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
mixture into the Porringer, and agitate it with a
Gooſe Quill till the Blood is cold. <hi>And</hi> by this method,
be ſays, he has with Oyl of Vitriol, and Sp. of Niter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
preſerved Blood fluid, and alſo free from Putrefaction,
the laſt of which, is what neither Volatil, nor ſixt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61509:12"/>
Alkalies will do, as may be ſeen by the following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.</p>

               <head>EXPERIMENT 1.</head>
               <p>He mix'd with 5 or 6 Ounces of Blood, 6 Drops of
🝆 of 🜖 diluted in 2 Ounces of Water, and it preſerved
the Blood fluid, gave it a better colour and conſiſtency
than ſome of the ſame he mix'd nothing with, he kept it
in a Viol 18 Days, and it was equally free from any
ſmell, or ſigns of Putrefaction, as when it ſtream'd
from the Vein.</p>
               <p>In Anſwer to which I ſay, he is not ſure that the
2 Ounces of Water would not do more towards
keeping the Blood fluid, thin, and of a bright co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
than the 6 Drops of 🝆 of 🜖 could do one way
or other.</p>
               <p>But to do the Gent. all right, and to Anſwer
fairly to his Experiments, I try'd them more nicely
than he did: For I took the ſame Proportion of 🝆
of 🜖 and Water that he did, and having made it juſt
blood-warm in the Viol, I let the Blood of a healthy
young Man run from the Vein into it, till I had
that juſt quantity by weight in proportion to the
🝆 of 🜖 and Water, and ſhaking them well together,
and ſtoping the Viol with a Cork, I ſet it by: It
ſoon look'd of a muddy black Colour, and being
open'd at 14 Days it began to ſtink.</p>

my bare word for it.</hi> I ſay my Word is as good as
anothers; but I could give Obſervations not only
of my own, but of divers famous Phyſicians: But
no Authorities, but thoſe of Acid Doctors, are
any thing to the Acid Gentleman; who farther
ſays, <hi>ſhould he undertake effectually to prove that Acids
are the only Medicines which cure thoſe Diſeaſes I
have named, it muſt be by enumerating obſervations
of Cures perform'd by them, which would make his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
too long.</hi> Here the Gentleman ſpeaks well;
for if he ſhould prove that Acids, are the only
Medicines that cure theſe Diſeaſes, he muſt not
only enumerate all the Acid Doctors Cures, (who
I am well inform'd often Cure <hi>ſine recidiva)</hi> but
he muſt enumerate all the Cures that have been
done in the World of theſe Diſeaſes, and aſcertain
us that all of them were done by Acids, which
would indeed be too long for a Letter to a Man of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61509:13"/>
buſineſs. But I believe he would in his own Practice
hardly be able to give us many inſtances of Ulcers
cur'd with nothing but Acids, or be willing to be
dreſs'd with nothing elſe himſelf. But to ſave the
vaſt labour, he gives us a Catalogue of ſome of the
moſt <hi>celebrated Medicines uſed in curing thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers,
as ſteel in its beſt Preparations, all the Acid
Spirits and Elixirs,</hi> Crem. Tart. Tart. Vitriolat.
Sal. Succini, <hi>&amp;c. and refers to Dr.</hi> Colbatch <hi>his
Authority.</hi> But I muſt tell the Gentleman, Dr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>
his Authority, and his reaſoning, are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one than the other. Steel, Acid Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
he ſays are the moſt celebrated Medicines in uſe,
in the cure of the foremention'd Diſeaſes. <hi>Ergo,</hi>
thoſe Diſeaſes are cur'd by nothing elſe: And would
that be good Logick, yet the Medicines enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
are not all Acids, or cure as ſuch, as we may
have occaſion to ſhew before we have done.</p>
               <p>But our Gent. ſays, pag. 18. <hi>He won't believe me
that an Acid can be got from Blood or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine, of either
healthy, or diſeaſed Perſons, becauſe I have not told
him the proceſs.</hi> Anſwer, I thought I had told it
plain enough to any one that underſtands a little
Chymiſtry: And I can make him believe it very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily,
but that I don't write to teach Gentlemen
Chymiſtry, but to ſhew them the Ignorance,
and groundleſs Confidence and danger of Acid
Quacks. But he complains farther, <hi>that I will not
teach him the Legerdemain of mixing Alk. and Acid,
ſo that no Acid, but an Alka<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<hi>theſe tricks are Legerdemain,</hi> and till he underſtands
a little Chymical Legerdemain, he will never

comprehend them, and I beg his excuſe for not
teaching them, there is ſomething more than
ordinary in them, and they muſt not be profaned.

Reaſon for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman alſo ſays, <hi>The natural or artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Conjunction of an Acid and an Alkali, which I ſay
will make a Salſum, he calls an Acid, becauſe the
Acid is moſt predominant, and does operate as ſuch; for
Tartar Vitriolat. which I call a Salſum, diſſolved
in Water, will work upon Steel as manifeſtly as Sp. of 🜖,
which is allow'd to be an Acid.</hi> I anſwer, he may
call it an Aſs-head, if he will; but I ſay, where the
Aſs-head is predominant, there is not the true Salt
ſavour; and Tartar Vitriolat. if it be a Salſum as
it ſhould, be has neither the Ac. nor Al. predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate;
nor does its working on Steel prove it to
be an Acid, or to Operate as ſuch; as the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
himſelf, being better inform'd, and forgetting
what he had ſaid, aſſerts, pag. 43. <hi>Iron,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>will be diſſolv'd by Acid, Alkali, or Sal nutrum,</hi> and

Tartar Vitriolat.</hi> and <hi>Com. Salt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Gent. aſſerts farther, pag. 19. <hi>That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salt, by often diſſolving and cryſtalizing, will be
ſo deprived of its Bittern, as to act as an Acid by
diſſolving Steel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But if you would do it at once,
you muſt put an Ounce of Sp of</hi> 🜖 <hi>into 2 Quarts of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of Salt, and then evaporate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and you will
have the Salt much more wholeſome, and uſeful in all
Caſes; and pag. 20. having thus proved Sea Salt to
be an Acid, he cannot imagine how it ſhould be the
cauſe of the Scurvy, when there's ſcarce a better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61509:14"/>
known for its Cure than Sp. of</hi> 🜖. I anſwer, the
Gentleman having quitted his Opinion, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaid) pag. 43. that the ſolution of Steel is an
Argument of the diſſolvents being an Acid, I hope
he will alter his Opinion in other things where he
is miſtaken, or at leaſt ſee he hath contradicted
himſelf, as his Maſter Acid uſed to do. But if he
adds <hi>Sp.</hi> of 🜖 to his <hi>Com.</hi> 🜖, I confeſs that may
work as an Acid in it, and do what the Salt would
not do, but it will not be more wholeſome or
better in all Caſes; for Bittern it ſelf is good for
ſomething, tho' the Gentleman's Maſter <hi>Colbatch</hi>
hath Damn'd it.</p>
               <p>So if Sp. of Salt were a Medicine, good for the
Scurvy, it does not follow that common Salt too
much eaten may not cauſe it. And as to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
Aſſertion, that there's ſcarce a better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
known for the Scurvy than Sp. of Salt, I ſay
he talks as old Wives uſe to do; whatever they
have heard commended, they will ſay is the beſt
thing in the World. But let it be good; yet, if I
thought he would not be angry, becauſe I don't tell
what, I would affirm, I know 2 or 3 better Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
for the Scurvy. But he adds, <hi>The Scurvy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Symptom of a Putrefaction of the Juices of our
Bodies, it will ſtill look more like a Paradox, that Salt
which is the known preſervative of dead Fleſh, ſhould
be the cauſe of Putrefaction in that which is alive.</hi> I
anſwer, a Putrefaction in the Juices of living Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
except in Sores and Ulcers, has not I think
been ſhewn: But it is certain, that which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
dead Bodies, would kill living ones; as drying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for inſtance: and I believe even an Acid Doctor,
if he were Sous'd, or hang'd up in a Chimney a
little while with Bacon, (tho' he were very well
ſalted firſt) would ſoon be of this Opinion. So
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61509:15"/>
Sp. of Wine, tho' it preſerves Fleſh, being drunk
in too large a quantity will make corrupt Work, in
the vital oeconomy; yea, I don't queſtion but 🝆 of 🜖
Crab Verjuice, or Lemons, and Oranges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
may be taken in quantities large enough to
kill a Man, as I believe ſome Perſons have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.
Nor is the Gentleman's reaſoning more
ſharp, in ſaying, <hi>Nor will the want of the ſpiritual
Parts of Fleſh, and Fiſh, appear to be the cauſe of any
Diſeaſe, when Phyſicians preſcribe to venerial Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
Fleſh roaſted or boyled to drineſs, and ſuch other
food as yields the leaſt of ſpirituous, and volatile Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalous
Parts; as Water-gruel, Bisket,</hi> &amp;c. Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
(whether they do wiſely or no 'tis no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
preſcribe things that yield the leaſt volatile
alkalous, and ſpiritual Parts in the Pox, <hi>Ergo</hi> the
want of ſpirituous and volatile parts in our Meat,
can't be the cauſe of any Diſeaſe. But I believe
the Gentleman's Phyſician never preſcrib'd him
Fleſh boyl'd to dryneſs. But he rejoyns as ſharply,
that <hi>if he did not deſign brevity, he could bring inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to prove that Acids are not the cauſe of the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
but the only ſalubrious Medicines in uſe againſt
that Diſtemper.</hi> I anſwer, it is good to be brief;
but I don't know that I ever ſaid Acids are the
cauſe of the Scurvy, and therefore he ſays nothing
againſt me. But to prove they are the only ſalubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Medicines in uſe for this Diſeaſe, he muſt know
all the Medicines that are in uſe, and their ſucceſs.
But inſtead of this, he gives us only a Story that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
worthy <hi>Gentleman told him, that having been
long troubl'd with the Scurvy, by reading Doctor</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch'<hi>s
Tracts, he was prevail'd upon to eat Lemons
ſtoutly, by which method he recover'd, after the ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
uſe of the Preſcripts of the Phyſicians of the beſt
repute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61509:15"/>
This is what the Gent. has to ſay, to perſwade
us that Acids are not the Cauſe, but the only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
in the Cure of the Scurvy. One Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
told another; but were Gentlemen infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in connecting Cauſes, and Effects (as Phyſicians
are not) yet the ſingle matter of Fact comes to us
but upon the word of an unknown Gentleman,
who 'tis ſaid was ſo lucky as to meet with Mr.
<hi>Colbatch</hi> his Tracts, whereby (not to omit the beſt
of the Story) he became ſuch a <hi>prodigious Lemon
Eater,</hi> as that he ſoon arriv'd to the perfection of

never attain'd, 'tis pity he conceals his Name,

Joy,</hi> or the great Cock-eater.</p>
               <p>The Gent. ſhews, pag. 21. that he has miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
me, for I never ſaid as he would make
me; <hi>That we loſe more in weight, ſitting ſtill in a
froſty Morning, than if we were in the Bagnio, or
that the coldneſs and moiſture of the Air opens the
Pores to promote Perſpiration.</hi> But I ſay ſtill, there
is certainly more matter carried off by inſenſible
Perſpiration, than by ſweating, taking one time
with another; and that a freſh air promotes Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
is not only proved by Seamens eating more,
and voiding leſs other Excrements than thoſe at
Land, but is reaſonably concluded from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the diſſolving Power of the Air, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
any tenacious Matter in the ſurface of the Body
ſtopping the Pores is removed; and perhaps this
is a chief Reaſon that a clear Air is ſo beneficial to
divers ſick Perſons; and tho' the Air at Sea may be
ſuppos'd more moiſt than the Air at Land, yet the
Sea certainly ſends up fewer clammy Effluvia than
the Land, that abounds with ſo many ſulphurous
Matters.</p>

Again he ſays, pag. 22. That <hi>I confeſs I can't
ſee how an Acid can be ſeparated from Sea Salt when
in the Blood, and yet I affirm in the next page, that
Acids are found ſeparated in farther receſſes than the
Stomach and Guts.</hi> I anſwer, I did not then only
confeſs, but do profeſs ſtill, I don't ſee how an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
can be diſtill'd from Sea Salt in the Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Yet I affirm that Acids have been found in farther
receſſes than the Stomach and Guts; as the Gent.
alſo does, pag. 33. inſtancing the Pancreatick Juice.
But I did not ſay from Sea Salt; for there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other things eaten and drank, that are indeed
Acid, or capable of being made ſo, without the
help of a ſtrong Fire. And I affirm (as all Phyſicians
that conſider will acknowledge) contrary to the
inconſiderate Aſſertion of the Gentleman, that
there are other ſeparations to be made of our Food,
(tho' not of Sea Salt, which is ejected as it went in)
requiſite beſides a diſſolution of their Texture, or
elſe the various Juices of our Bodies could not be
maintained and repaired.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman, pag. 23. talks of the relation
I gave of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s Death, by taſting an Acid
Liquor in a Ciſtus of a cancerous Breaſt, more like
a Gentleman than a Phyſician. For he ſaith, <hi>a Man
that is poiſoned is commonly delirious on his death-bed,
and 'tis not unuſual to hear ſuch accuſe the moſt
proper Medicine as the cauſe of their Death.</hi> If he
had been a little inform'd of the nature of Poiſon,
he would have learnt that Poiſon is a general name
common to many different and oppoſite things,
that kill in ſmall quantity with various and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
Symptoms, and does not always make Men
delirious, neither can he ſuppoſe this Cancerous
Liquor was given Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> as a Medicine. <hi>But
ſuppoſing Mr.</hi> Smith <hi>was poiſon'd,</hi> (adds he) <hi>it will
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61509:16"/>
follow according to my Aſſertion, it was not done by an
Acid, becauſe I could not ſee how an Acid Spirit can
be ſeparated from any thing while in the Blood.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
I don't know where I ſaid an Acid could
not be ſeparated from any thing in the Blood, but
that Sp. of Salt could not be diſtill'd there; but
had I ſaid ſo, it will not follow that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> was
not poiſon'd by that Liquor, or that it was not an
Acid; for that Liquor doubtleſs was produced in
the part by a preternatural Fermentation, after
whatever was the matter of it was ſeparated from
the Blood. <hi>But he adds, granting it a ſtrong Acid,
how will you account for its not making way throw the
Breaſt before amputation?</hi> I anſwer, very eaſily; no
diſſolvent tho' ever ſo ſtrong acts in an inſtant,
but muſt have time; that had not time enough to
do it. I will hold <hi>Aq. Fortis,</hi> or a ſtronger Liquor
in my Hand without diſſolving it. But he ſays
farther, <hi>if it had been an Acid it could not fail of
raiſing an Eſcar on Mr.</hi> Smith'<hi>s Tongue, and that
would have fill'd his Mouth with a ſtink, far ſurpaſſing
that of any Acid Liquor.</hi> Here the Gent. forgets
himſelf, and contradicts what he endeavour'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That Acids preſerve from
Corruption and Stink; but he ſhews himſelf but a
<hi>Small Surgeon,</hi> and little acquainted with Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Liquors. For an Eſcar does not ſtink ſo
ſoon, tho' made with Acids, nor do the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Acids make them ſo haſtily: I will taſte <hi>Aq.
Fortis,</hi> or any common Acid at any time without
hurting my Tongue, but I can ſhew him an Acid
Liquor that ſtinks, worſe than any mortified Fleſh
he ever ſaw. But he preſumes <hi>that the Phyſician
who told me this Story had the care of Mr.</hi> Smith,
<hi>and fail'd not in giving the moſt celebrated Alkalies,
which, it appears did him no Service, wherefore he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61509:17"/>
the Liquor be taſted did not kill him, without
other help.</hi> But to ſhew that all this is indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
I will bring the Gentleman to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
if he pleaſes, before whom I am perſwaded
he will not ſo preſume.</p>
               <p>But the Gent. ſays, pag. 24. <hi>That my ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that if the Blood in the ſmall Pox, Scurvy, and
Gout, yields more Alkali, it is hence that the Acid is
precipitated and fix'd in the extremities by meeting
Alkalies, is overthrown by analyzing the Chalkey ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in the Gout, which exhibits the Phenomena of
Alkalies.</hi> I rejoyn, I hope the Gent. will not any
more urge that the Chalkey ſubſtance in the Gout,
yielding the Phenomena of Alkalies, overthrows
what I ſaid in the ſmall Pox, and Scurvy; nor
does it, ſay I, neceſſarily diſprove my Aſſertion
even in the Gout; for I have told him that an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
and an Alkali joyn'd, will ſometimes yield no
Acid in diſtillation, but an Alkali, as I can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
at any time, tho' I have not yet thought ſit
to teach proud Empyricks, or all ſorts of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
the Art of Chymical Legerdemain, whereby I
can demonſtrate that all the Experiments the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
builds upon are fallacious. <hi>He ſays alſo that
he knows 'tis difficult to give judgment to a grain in
the diſtillation of Blood, yet the difference is ſo manifeſt
between morbid and ſound Blood, that 60 or more
grains may be allow'd for Perſpiration, deficiency of
fire, or waſte in large Glaſſes,</hi> &amp;c. But I tell him,
neither he nor his Doctor have made Experiments
enough, or nice enough, to find a certain Difference.
But if we ſhould ſuppoſe that the Blood does in
ſome Diſeaſes yield by diſtillation more Alkali
than in Health, it will not follow that the Diſeaſe
was caus'd by Alkali, but the Alkali may rather
be ſuppos'd the effect of the Diſeaſe; for it is well
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61509:17"/>
known, that even Bodies that will yield large quantities
of Acid in Diſtillation and no Alkali, will by a fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Heat be ſo alter'd, as to yield a great deal of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali
and no Acid; and in like manner the preternatural
Ferment in ſome Diſeaſes may ſo alter the Liquors of
our Bodies, as that they may yield more Alkali, and
leſs or no Acid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Gentleman ſays, pap. 25.</hi> My Experiment
of the Saliva's turning the Syrup of Violets green, does
not prove that it is not impregnated with a manifeſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid,
which is what Dr. <hi>Colebatch</hi> aſſerts; for there are
a multitude of other Bodies which will turn the Syrup
green, yet have in them a manifeſt Acid, as Oyls and
vinous Spirits, which tho' they have a manifeſt Acid,
yet its ſo ſheath'd in the other parts of the fluid, that it
cannot be unlock'd or ſet at liberty, to exert it ſelf by ſo
dammy a Body as Syr. of Violets, yet they operate on other
Bodies by vertue of their Acid, as Oyl of Turpentine will
diſſolve Copper, the Acid in Sulphur, Turpentine, Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
makes Quickſilver eaſily embody with them; <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I ſay,</hi> its from the Turpentine's conſiſting of ramous
and flexible parts, he thinks it is the ſame with ſaying,
they conſiſt of nothing at all; for 'till I ſhew him thoſe
ramous and flexible parts, he muſt belive it is from the
Acid that they embody with Mercury.</p>
               <p>What the Gentleman ſays now is much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
I hope he will help to bring the Acidiſts to ſenſe.
For if the Saliva's turning the Syrup green, does not
prove that it is not impregnated with, and does not act
as a manifeſt Acid, then the Serum of Blood's turning
Syrup of Violets green, does not prove that to abound
with an Alkali, and not to be an Acid; and ſo what
Mr. <hi>Colebatch</hi> aſſerts is a Miſtake, and his Criterion
fallible, and ſo the ground of his Hypotheſis is gone,
and the Gentleman muſt take his Doctrine merely upon
his Word. <hi>And if there are a multitude of other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61509:18"/>
which turn Syr. of Violets green, that are to be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
Acids from their quality, of which if they were
diveſted, they would fail of their Intenſion which they
perform with it,</hi> as he ſays, pag. 26. Then Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
can be no more Judges of his Maſter <hi>Colebatch</hi>'s
Hypotheſis. But how the Gentleman ſhould aſſert that
vinous Spirits and Oyl of Turpentine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
Acids, I can't tell, unleſs the conſtant uſe of Crab
Verjuce makes all things reliſh ſo with him, for I am
ſure he never made it manifeſt to any that was not an
Acidiſt; and that Oyl of Turpentine's Acid can't be
unlockt by the clammy Body of Syr. of Violets, and
yet that it works upon the much more tough body of
Copper, is very ſtrange if true; but it's ſtranger that
things conſiſting of ramous parts ſhould be conſiſting of
nothing, or that whatever is not done by Particles a
Gentleman can ſee muſt be done by Acid; <hi>but the
Gentleman muſt believe it,</hi> and who can help it? <hi>But
he profeſſes he will not believe me, that inſipid Calxes
will kill Quicſiklver, till I tell him more of it, for he
knows none that will hold it ſo long as Saline or Acid
Bodies.</hi> Well, becauſe he is now a Gentleman, I will
tell him more of it than I did before. I did not ſay
that Calxes indifferently will hold Quickſilver ſo long
as any ſaline or Acid Bodies, what the Calxes of Gold
and Silver may do, I will leave to them <hi>that have made
all the enquiry into the nature of Metals Human Induſtry
is capable of.</hi> I know it will <hi>amalgam</hi> with Metals
that deſtroy Acids, but if you take almoſt any Calx,
or Earth not too dry, you may rub Mercury in it ſo as
to loſe ſight of it, and ſo as you ſhall not be able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
it but by Fire: Yea Mercury is ſo ready to be
concern'd with things that are no Acids, that it will
become inviſibly embodied with common Water, and
the Parts and Humours of a Man's Body, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his Alkalies in Sickneſs and in Health.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61509:18"/>
The Gentleman ſays, <hi>the Trials I made on Saliva
being of that taken from ſound Perſons often eating and
drinking Acids, he underſtands Acids did not impair
their Health.</hi> I anſwer, he does underſtand no ſuch
thing, for Acid did often ſo much towards impairing,
that had they not uſed alkalous things to over balance
them, they would not have been ſound long. And
tho' in the diſtillation, as he minds me, <hi>I</hi> found a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum
in the <hi>Cap. Mort.</hi> from which an Acid might be
got, yet that Salſum <hi>I</hi> take to be nothing but Sea Salt,
which would not be turned into an Acid otherwiſe than
by a ſtrong Fire.</p>
               <p>Our Gentleman remarks alſo, that I ſay, <hi>Saliva
when evaporated yielded a grateful Smell: But his Dr.
knows that Nutmegs, Cinnamon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and all odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Vegetables abound with Acid and Sulphur, from
whence proceed their grateful Smells; It is not then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to conclude, that that pleaſant Smell in the Saliva
came from Acid and Sulphur?</hi> I reply, the Dr. knows
no ſuch thing, he never ſaw Sulphur in, or got from
aromatick or odoriferous Plants, nor does their Smell
proceed from Sulphur and Acid, but from pure Oyls;
the ſmell of Sulphur every body knows is not pleaſant,
but mixed with Oyls both become abominable Stinkers.
But he gives a reaſon, ſuch as it is, <hi>for all animal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
when tending to Corruption, emitting a noxious
Smell, and from them in that ſtate he cannot find a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum
as I did from Saliva.</hi> But I ſay, That from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
Subſtances in a ſtate of Corruption I can find a
Salſum, as from Blood, Urine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho' he can't.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman in Anſwer to what <hi>I</hi> ſaid of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
that there's no need of an Acid there, and that
my Stomach is beſt when there's not ſo much as to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Milk; replies, <hi>that there may be an Acid in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
tho' not ſo much as to curdle Milk; for a ſmall
quantity of Wine, nay Vinegar diluted in Water, pour'd
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61509:19"/>
ſlowly into Milk will not curdle it, and Wines have in
them a manifeſt Acid; and Vegetables, in whom Acid
abounds, decocted in Milk will not coagulate it.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
A ſmall quantity of Acid, tho' not enough to
coagulate Milk pour'd into it ſlowly, will yet do it if
digeſted in a heat like that of the Stomach; but Wines
are not manifeſtly Acid, unleſs they taſte four; and
the Vegetables he talks of are nameleſs.</p>
               <p>He ſays farther, pag. 27. <hi>to convince me that the
Saliva acts as an Acid, he will enquire what Juices
are brought into the Stomach to cauſe Hunger, and he
can find none but the Saliva; therefore he concludes
Hunger is caus'd by the Juice ſtrain'd from the ſalival
glands, and in Fevers, when that Moiſture is defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
there is no deſire of Food; and alſo that Lemons and
Oranges cauſe Hunger; and if Hunger is caus'd only by
Acids, he would have me prove what Juice is brought
into the Stomach from any other Part that yields more
Acid.</hi> The Gentleman is ſo profound at Reaſoning,
one muſt ſometimes have a long Line to fiſh for his
Arguments. Come on then, let us try to catch this.
The Saliva acts as an Acid; and why? becauſe he can
find no other Juice brought into the Stomach to cauſe
Hunger; and if Hunger is caus'd only by Acids, I muſt
prove ſome other Juice brought in from ſome other
Part that yields more. Well, but if Hunger is not
caus<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d by Acids, or by Juices, and he has prov'd nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then the Argument is gone. Yes, but Lemons
and Oranges cauſe Hunger; then, I ſay, the Saliva
may be excus'd from that Office, ſince Acid Doctors
are ſo ready to convey them in. I wiſh they don't
breed a Famine. But in Fevers, when the Saliva is
wanting, there's no Appetite. But 'tis no matter,
ſince Lemons and Oranges are more ſharp than the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liva
it ſelf, for the very thoughts of them, will put a
Man's Mouth in diſorder. But if one may ſpeak freely
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61509:19"/>
to a Gentle man, I muſt tell him, a Clown would have
given a better Reaſon of Hunger, that it is caus'd moſt
commonly by want of Victuals, and not by ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ones Spittle, or eating Lemons and Oranges; for
if one do neither, yet Faſting will bring that ſenſe;
and if one can get neither Lemons nor Oranges, the
want of a Breakfaſt or two, will make one have a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
to ones Dinner.</p>
               <p>But the Gentleman comes to prove Mr. <hi>Colebatch</hi>'s
Opinion, <hi>that there are ſome Veſſels paſſing from the
bottom of the Stomach to the Kidneys; and he confeſſes
he could never find them in all the Bodies he hath diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</hi>
I believe ſo. Gentlemen don't uſe to diſſect Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
very oft; but yet to <hi>prove theſe undiſcover'd Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nula's,</hi>
he gives us the Authority of ſeveral Stories; <hi>one
of a Man that voided by Urine great quantities of
Herbs, and two Pills. Of another that voided a leaden
Bullet the ſame way. And of a third, that piſſed the
Stones of Raiſins. Of others that piſs'd Needles, Alke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kengi,
and Melon-Seeds,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>beſides he has obſerved the
Urine has been perfum'd in 10 or 12 Minutes, by eating
Aſparagus, or taking Oyl of Turpentine.</hi> Now, ſay I,
if we admit theſe Stories to be true as to matter of fact,
it does not prove theſe undiſcover'd Paſſages, unleſs the
Gentleman could prove that theſe things could paſs no
other way; but as for thoſe things that may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to paſs through very ſmall Paſſages, there are
ſuch diſcover'd, thro' which they are more like to paſs,
than thro' theſe that are ſo very ſmall, if any, that no
Body could ever ſee them. But perhaps there is ſome
Law in Nature, that thoſe Paſſengers that are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to go the ſhort way to the Kidneys, muſt ſhut the
Door after them.</p>
               <p>The Gent. is not pleas'd, pag 30, and 31. that I
aſſign a conſiderable uſe to the Gall; but he has either
not conſiderately read, or miſ-repreſented what I ſaid
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61509:20"/>
of it. He ſays, <hi>that the Dung affording a fixt Salt</hi>
(as I told him) <hi>like that obtain'd from the Bile, and
the Chyle not appearing ting'd with Greenneſs, nor Milk
yielding any ſuch fixt Salt, are indications that the Gall is
carried down with the reſt of the Excrements, but not
mix'd with the Chyle; neither, thinks he, will the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs
of the</hi> Venae Lacteae <hi>admit ſo thick a Liquor as
the Gall.</hi> I anſwer, I did not ſay that the Gall was
carried into the <hi>Venae Lecteae,</hi> and mix'd with the
Chyle there, tho' it muſt be thought to receive its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that way; as all the reſt of Juices of the Body do.
But any one will confeſs (except he that thinks himſelf
bound to ſay any thing to defend a ſenſeleſs Error) that
the Gall cannot iſſue forth into the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> without
being mixed with the Chyle, where it may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably
ſeize the inimical Acid, and carry it out at the
Back-door of the Body.</p>
               <p>But the Gent. goes on to defame this notable Part
in the vital Machine, and if what he ſays of it were
true, one might think the Body might have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
better, than that ſuch an Enemy ſhould be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in ſo inward a Receſs, at liberty to diſgorge its Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom
into the nutritious Juice. And he poſſitively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
that <hi>the Gall<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s preſence in the Guts can be of no
uſe, but to be in a way of being ejected by Stool.</hi> If it
<hi>can be</hi> of no uſe we can<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t help it. But the Gent. hath
not proved it uſleſs. But he ſays, <hi>If it be detain'd in
the Guts, the conſequences are diſmal, yet if any quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
paſs downwards, a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diarrhea enſues,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
indeed, that whether it ſtay or go its morbous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
are inevitable. I thought he ſaid 'twas all to be
ejected by Stool, yet if it go that way we muſt have a
Flux. When the Bile is brought into the Stomach, I
agree with the Gentleman, it cauſes Diſorders; but
<hi>Viſcera,</hi> as he calls it, I think is a new name for the
Stomach. But he ſays, <hi>it may be known that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:61509:20"/>
Iliaca Paſſio, <hi>Diarrhea, are Symptoms produced
from that Juice by the Excrements being ting'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</hi>
But I ſay that is not a ſufficient Argument, but
theſe Symptoms may be caus'd by too much Acid,
wherewith it is loaded, and he ſhould have uſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Senſe beſide Seeing, to know whether the Gall
were too much in the mixture; I believe he would
hardly taſte it bitter.</p>
               <p>But the Gentleman goes on to accuſe the wickedneſs
of the Gall, pag. 32. in two inſtances, <hi>One of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
he help'd to diſſect, having many defects in him,
but particularly that the Gall-Bladder was empty. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
of a Child, who had the ſame Defects.</hi> But there
is nothing in the Relations, if true, that will prove that
thoſe Defects found in the Bodies were caus'd by too
much Gall, rather than that they were occaſion'd by
too little; ſo I ſhall paſs it, only taking notice of two
things remarkable. 1. That Gentlemen may diſſect
one another. 2. That if it be true as he ſays, <hi>that
thoſe Bodies ſtink ſooneſt, in whom the Gall Bladder is
found empty,</hi> then the Gall muſt needs be allow'd to be
at leaſt a preſervative againſt Corruption.</p>
               <p>But he comes to Arguments, <hi>to convince us that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids
are admitted into the Blood;</hi> and that he does, by
<hi>putting us in mind of the Pancreatick Juice, which,</hi>
he ſays, <hi>is manifeſtly acid to the taſt. And the Chyle
taken from the</hi> Venae Lactae <hi>of a Dog he taſted mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
Acid, when it has been kept ſome time; and from
Milk's turning ſour.</hi> But he had no need to prove that
againſt me, for I never ſaid the Gall kept out all the
Acid, but only hindred that ſo much, as otherwiſe
would, goes not in. But as for diſcerning the acidity of
the Pancreatick Juice, or of the Dog's Chyle, that, as
he ſays, had ſtood, (and turned ſour) by his Taſte;
it is no good evidence, becauſe he takes ſo many Acid
Draughts in a day, that his Mouth, I doubt, can hardly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61509:21"/>
ever be free from a ſour reliſh; and if we had not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reaſon than his Evidence, we ſhould doubt of the
Pancreatick Juices Acidity.</p>
               <p>The Gent. has a farther attempt, pag. 35. to take
off what I ſaid, as to Acids coagulating and corrupting
Blood, Fleſh, Skin, Tendons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he tells us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>my Experiments were tryed a fallacious way, for
the Oyl of Vitriol alone will coagulate Blood when it's
cold, and a ſeparation made of its grumous Parts from
the Serum, yet if it be diluted in a proper quantity of an
aqueous Vehicle, which is the method of giving ſuch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
it will preſerve the Blood fluid, and free from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction.</hi>
I anſwer, the Oyl of Vitriol will coagulate
the Blood, and alter its due Texture, before there is a
ſeparation made of the Serum, yea, while in the Veins,
if injected; and in all reaſon that which will coagulate
much in ſuch or ſuch a quantity, will do it a little in a
ſmall quantity. But Water will certainly dilute and
make thin the Blood; and perhaps two ounces of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will do more to thin the Blood, than two or three
drops of oyl of Vitriol to thicken it, if they always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
one another; and I do not think it poſſible
to give ſo much Oyl of Vitriol in at the Mouth as is
enough to coagulate the maſs of Blood in the Veins,
without killing by ſomething it will do before it comes
there; but Oyl of Vitriol, and ſuch like things, being
not ſubject to the ferments of our Bodies, and not ſo
eaſily carried off by our Heat as Water, if they come
into the Blood, muſt have their Being ſome where or
other, and if they ſix and adhere to any particular Part,
may cauſe a ſmall Coagulation there, or by thickning
the Blood retard its motion, or by retarding its motion
thicken it, and ſo give occaſion to ſome ſtoppage in
ſome ſmall Veins; and wherever the Blood ſtagnates
it will be coagulated and corrupted, tho' the thing that
caus'd the Stagnation were not the immediate cauſe of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61509:21"/>
the Coagulation and Corruption. But if Oyl of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol
and ſuch Acids be ſo excellent to thin the Blood,
and conſequently accellerate its Motions, I would
know what Gentlemen give it for in Feavers, and
ſuch like Diſtempers, rather than Sp. of Sal. Armon.
which will do ſo; if it cools, I ſhould think it is by
retarding the rapid Motion of the Blood, and if the
Blood run ſlow it is more apt to Coagulate. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Gentlemen Acidiſts give it not, becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards,
or accelerates the Blood, thickens it, or thins it,
cools it or heats it, but merely becauſe it is an Acid,
and will do every thing, and that becauſe Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>
ſays, Acids are the only Medicines that cure all
Diſeaſes, he is ſure of it, (tho' he does no more Cures,
except deadly ones, than others) and his little Satelites
muſt ſay ſo, tho' neither he nor they can tell how it
Operates, or why they give it.</p>
               <p>But the Gent. urges farther, <hi>that 2 Ounces of Sp. of
Niter in a convenient quantity of Water,</hi> (what that is
he wont tell us) <hi>preſerved an Embrio. And 'tis the
Acid of Salt preſerves Fleſh and Fiſh from Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
For if you diveſt the Salt of its Acid, what remains
will never do the buſineſs. Vinegar and Salt preſerve
Cucumbers, Capers,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, 2 Ounces of Sp.
of Sal. Armon or of a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ixivium, yea or Bittern,
that wicked thing, in a convenient quantity of Water,
will do as much, or more; but why? Not becauſe
they are call'd Acid or Alkali, but becauſe they are
ſaline Bodies, which in ſuch quantities hinder Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
So Sea Salt, not becauſe it is call'd an Acid,
or an Alkali, or a S<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſum, but becauſe it hinders
that inward motion of the particles of Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
would bring it to Corruption. But whether what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
will do the like, when Sea Salt is diveſted of
its Acid, Mr. <hi>Acid,</hi> nor his Gentleman ever tryed:
For I muſt tell them what I find they are ignorant of,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61509:22"/>
that Sea Salt will be diſtill'd all into Spirit, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
all into Sea Salt again, it is ſo homogeneous a
Body. But perhaps he means the Earth, with which
it is diſtill'd, will not do. It is from the ſame reaſon
that Salt and Vinegar preſerve Cucumbers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
yet I believe, if the Gentleman or his Phyſician either,
were kept a little while in ſuch pickle, he would find
it not very friendly to the vital Frame, tho' it might
keep them from ſtinking.</p>
               <p>Our Gentleman, pag. 36. tells us, that I ſaid, <hi>that
Animals that yield half their weight of Acid Liquor,
will putrefie ſooner than others, that abound with more
Alkali. But he can't conceive what Animals theſe
ſhould be.</hi> No wonder a Gentlemen is unacquainted
with the <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> that can't recite what I
ſaid: For I did not ſay ſooner than others, but as ſoon,
or ſooner than ſome others; not that abound with
more Alkali, but that abound with Alkali; for thoſe
Animals don't abound with Alkali, but with Acid.
But tho' he grants what I ſaid, it won't follow ſays he,
<hi>That their Putrefaction is caus'd by the great quantity
of Acids;</hi> true, I never argued ſo, for Acid is their
proper Nature; but notwithſtanding they are ſuch
ſour Fellows, they will corrupt, contrary to Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>
his Aſſertion, <hi>that it were impoſſible that Bodies
full of Acid ſhuld putrifie.</hi> But <hi>he thinks the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
putrified, becauſe of the deprivation of their Acid,
it going off in Effluvia.</hi> But he is miſtaken, for they
were croſe ſtopp'd in a Glaſs, and perſpire much more
when alive.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman goes on to make the ſame miſtakes,
aſſerting <hi>that I ſaid Vegetabl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s that yield moſt Acid, and
Oyl, will rot ſooner than others;</hi> when <hi>I</hi> ſaid as ſoon, or
ſooner than ſome others; <hi>and that Crabs, Oranges and
Lemons will rot ſooner than Apples, that are not ſo ſour;</hi>
when I ſaid ſooner than ſome Apples that are not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61509:22"/>
ſour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But he ſays, <hi>Experience informs us how falſe
this Aſſertion is; for Lemons are preſerved longer than
Apples, and will not putrifie but when bruiſed; and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-pill
will be preſerved many Years by drying.</hi> I
anſwer, Lemons are preſerved longer than ſome Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
but not than others; and thanks to their Peel,
which according to the Acid Doctors ſhould rot firſt,
being leſs Acid. He adds, that he hath kept a Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
2 Years in Water, acidulated with Sp. of Salt,
ſound and entire. I believe it may be true, if try'd
on ſome ſort of Vegetables. But he concludes, <hi>with
a defiance to ſhew him an Alkali, Volatile or fixt, that
will preſerve Animals, or Vegetables from Putrefaction,</hi>
tho' I gave him 2 or 3 in the ſame Leaf, and I would
give him another, if I thought he would ſtill believe
Bittern, that wicked thing, to be an Alkali.</p>
               <p>But he comes, pag. 37. at length to Alum, and he
is not contented, that I ſaid Alum is not an Acid, nor
has the effects of an Acid, becauſe it turns Syr. of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
green, and that Alum is us'd in making Leather,
on the account of its aſtringency. But the Gentleman
is of another Opinion, <hi>for he finds 'tis the Chalky ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in Alum turns the Syr. green:</hi> But his reaſon
is no better than this, <hi>that the Acid Sp. will turn the
Syr. red;</hi> very good; but I ſpake of the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
that it was not an Acid, becauſe it turns the
Syr. green, and the Gentleman ſays it is, becauſe one
part of the product turns it red. But I have Maſter <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch</hi>
on my ſide, who ſays, <hi>thoſe things that turn the
Syr. green are manifeſt Alkalies, or abound with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies.</hi>
But as for the Leather-dreſſing, he ſays, '<hi>tis
the Acid part in Alum, makes the Skins compact, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
if the Acid be ſeparated, the remaining part will
be of no ſuch uſe.</hi> I anſwer, if theſe parts be ſeparated,
neither will be of uſe, the <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and the Acid will ſpoil the Skins. I'll appeal to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61509:23"/>
our Country-man, Mr. <hi>Yardly,</hi> the Philoſophical Glover
whether ever he dreſs'd Leather with Spirit of Alum.</p>
               <p>He ſays, <hi>he can eaſily anſwer for the rotting of Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins,
when the Bones that abound with Alkali remain
firm; the rottenneſs is produced by the Alkalous Fleſh, and
Juices of the Cadaver, entring the Pores of the Wood,
but the hardneſs of the Cortex of the Bones, having
ſmaller Pores than Wood, will not ſo readily admit the
Alkalous Eſſluvia.</hi> But I anſwer, if Bones had any
thing call'd a Cortex, and that were ſo compact, and
there were not very large and numerous Pores in the
Bones, yet one would think the Alkali already in their
moſt intmate receſſes, and wherein they are digeſted
from without, ſhould rot them ſooner than the Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins
that have it on one ſide only, and are guarded
within and without, with the mighty preſerver Acid.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman replies to what I aſſerted, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids
are not the only things that will quench thirſt in
Diſeaſes, for Niter will ſooner do it. <hi>That he knows
by Experience if you take from Niter what is Acid, the
remaining ſubſtance will not quench Thirſt.</hi> I anſwer,
'tis true, the Earth with which Niter is diſtill<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d will
not quench Thirſt. If you take from Niter, what will
by diſtillation be made an Acid, you take all away;
for it will all come over in Spirit, but Niter given in
a proper Vehicle will quench Thirſt much better
than the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Pag. 39. The Gentleman has done ungenteelly by
me, as well as in ſeveral other places, for he ſays, that
I ſay, <hi>Oyl of Vitriol is a noble Medicine in Feavers,
and he agrees with me;</hi> when as I ſaid to Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch,</hi>
that I would grant that Oyl of Vitriol might
be, the beſt Medicine in continual Feavers he knew;
but I knew a better, and that an Alkali.</p>
               <p>He makes me agree with him, and then ſays
he agrees with me, Oyl of Vitriol is far from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61509:23"/>
a noble Medicine, ſo is Com. Oyl of Vitriol,
from what may be made of Vitriol. <hi>But he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the Medicine, I ſay I have that is better, is
an Acid; unleſs I will produce it.</hi> But truly I can't
help it if he will believe ſo; for I ſuppoſe good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
and Acid are Synonymous with him: and
whatever is proved to be good, is to him ſufficiently
proved to be an Acid. But my Medicine is already
produced, and if he or any other civil Gentleman will
come to me, he ſhall taſte it. The Gentleman ſays, in
the ſame Page, <hi>That the uſe of Acids in the ſmall Pox
is now ſo generally believed and practis'd, that he need-not
trouble us with Arguments from that Topick.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that it is a very poor Topick to prove the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a thing, that it is generally uſed, (but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he means by the Acid Doctors) and he might
have told us Whores are now generally uſed for the
great Pox, and have added, that it is ſeldom cured
without them. <hi>His ſtory which he ſubjoyns of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of Acids in the ſmall Pox,</hi> I ſhall believe to be as he
calls it, a <hi>Storys</hi> not queſtioning the veracity of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
or his skill, who never imagin'd that Acids
would cure a Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to my Aſſertion, That Alkalies, when in
Solution, are not coagulated alone, but by meeting
with Acids; and ſo that the Chalky Matter in the Gout
will not prove the Diſeaſe caus'd by Alkali, rather
than Acid; he replys, pag. 81. <hi>That alkalous Salts,
when inſolution are coagulated with what I call Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
for Volatile Alkalies will embody with Copper,
and make what is call'd Salt of Vitriol, if ſuffered to
ſtand in the cold for a Month.</hi> I anſwer, This inſtance
is not a thing whereof he informs us, only I was uſed
to think Copper diſſolved was not Salt of Vitriol, but
if he has found Copper enough in gouty Perſons to
coagulate the Alkali in their Blood; we will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61509:24"/>
he hath diſcover'd a Mine; but I am apt to
think he can find nothing in the Body of Man that is
an Alkali, that will coagulate the Spirit of his Blood.
But he ſays farther, <hi>That Sp. of Sal. Armon. being an
Alkali in ſolution, will in diſtillation ſo unite it ſelf with
Lime a fixt Alkali, that he ſhall never be able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
any Volatile Alkali Salt from it again. Indeed
it may have the ſmell of a Volatile Alkali, but no Salt
is to be got from it, as may be ſeen; for if it be 3 or 4
times diſtill'd from Lime, it ſhall be ſo far from what
we call an Alkali, that it ſhall make no ebullition with
a manifeſt Acid.</hi> I anſwer the Gentleman, that the
Volatile Alkali does not unite it ſelf with Lime; if it
did, it would either become a fixt, or the Lime a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile;
neither of which is done, but the Vol.
Alkali is ſo alter'd by the Lime, that it is better uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with its Phlegm that holds it, ſo that both riſe
together. But I will teach the Gentleman how to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
a dry Salt from them again, when ever he is
willing to practiſe Chymiſtry, and thinks it will do
him a kindneſs. But he gives an odd reaſon of this his
Opinion, that if 3 or 4. times diſtill'd from Lime, it
ſhall be ſo far from what we call an Alkali, as not to
make an ebullition with Acids. But I ſay, tho' it be
ſo far from what Acid Gentlemen, who don't believe
their Senſes call Alkali, yet others will call it Alkali,
who know that ebullition with Acids is not the only
thing that ſhews an Alkali, for that very Sp. will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
his Acids, and be deſtroy'd ſo far as to make a
Nuter, but will not be irrecoverably loſt.</p>
               <p>He ſays, pag. 42. <hi>that I groſly miſtake what</hi> Offa
alba <hi>is,</hi> becauſe I ſaid it is a precipitation of the
urinous Salt, not a Coagulation of the urinous
Spirit, whereas <hi>it is as much in a Coagulum at
the top, as at the bottom.</hi> I anſwer, the Gentleman, I
believe, takes the notion of Precipitation only from
the ſound of the Word. But a thing is ſaid to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61509:24"/>
when the Particles are inviſible in the Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
but precipitated when they coaleſce ſo as to be
ſeen, tho' being light they may not preſently fall to
the bottom. But a <hi>Coagulum</hi> of a vinous Sp. and uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Salt into one Body he never ſaw, or any ſuch U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
but what is ſeparable.</p>
               <p>But however, this <hi>Offa alba</hi> can't be made in the
Veins, to coagulate into Chalk in gouty Perſons, as
his Maſter teaches him. He asks <hi>what I'll think of
ſome he has ſeen drink high rectified Sp. of Wine?</hi> I'll
tell him, they are no ſtrange Fellows, nor more gouty
than others; I have often done it, and never had
the Gout. The Blood is not an Alkalous Spirit to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate
it, nor can it be carried in through the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
without being weakned too much to do the feat,
if there were ſuch a Spirit within.</p>
               <p>But he tells us a great Secret in Chymiſtry, <hi>viz.</hi>
That if the Alkalous Sp. be diſtill'd from teſtaceous
Pouders, it will be deſtroy'd. But I tell him he is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
he never ſaw the Alkalous Salt deſtroy'd in his
Life. But then he tells us, <hi>it will fix it ſelf;</hi> but I tell
him, if it be fixt it is not deſtroy'd; if deſtroy'd, it is
not fix'd; but I tell him he is miſtaken in both, and
never ſaw a volatil Alkali fixt, any more than a fixt one
volatilized.</p>
               <p>But the Gentleman comes, pag. 42. to ſomething
more weighty, a very grand point, and that is to do
what his Maſter <hi>Colebatch</hi> could never do, and yet it
muſt be done, or the Acidiſts muſt knock under board,
<hi>viz.</hi> to prove Iron an Acid. Iron they profeſſedly uſe,
and nothing can be a good Medicine but an Acid they
ſay, therefore they are caſt by their own Verdict, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Iron can be made an Acid; help Neighbours! a
Gentleman had need of commanding Requeſts to put
him on this difficulty. Well let's ſee what Efforts he
makes. <hi>Iron,</hi> ſays he, <hi>making an Efferveſcence with
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61509:25"/>
an Acid, is no more an argument that it is an Alkali,
than that Butter of Antimony (which is allow'd to be
a ſtrong Acid) is an Alkali, becauſe it makes an Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcence
with Sp. of Nitre or Vitriol, which are Acids.</hi>
I fancy the Gentleman has learnt Logick of Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch,</hi>
(altho' he would be thought to converſe with him
only in an epiſtolary way) he argues ſo like him. Let
us feel the ſtrength of this Argument. Butter of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
an allow'd Acid, making an Efferveſcence with
Sp. of Niter an Acid, don't prove it an Alkali, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Iron making an Efferveſcence with an Acid, don't
prove it an Alkali. But I ſay it don't follow, but the
Gentleman is to prove Iron an Acid, and its not being
an Alkali, if it were not, don't prove it an Acid, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
there were nothing but Alkali and Acid; and if its
Efferveſcence don't prove it an Alkali, much leſs does it
prove it an Acid; but I tell him Butter of Antimony
does not efferveſce with an Acid, becauſe of its Acidity,
but becauſe of the Antimony in it not wholly diſſolved;
the Butter is nothing but Sp. of Salt, and the body of
the more metalline part of Antimony, mixed by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Diſſolution; but when the Sp. of Nitre comes
and diſſolves it wholy, it makes an Efferveſcence in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
it, but with Sp. of Salt alone it will not do ſo.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Iron,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is not properly an abſorber of Acids,
but of Salts in general, for it will be diſſolved by Acid,
Alkali, or</hi> Sal nutrum. But I anſwer, this don't prove
it an Acid, if it be ſo. But he ſays, <hi>if you put upon
Filings of Iron a volatil Alkali, there will a gentle E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition
enſue.</hi> I ſay, it muſt be very gentle certainly,
for I could never ſee it, tho' I try'd it on purpoſe; but
perhaps 'twas an Ebullition caus'd by the Fire, upon
which Acid, Alkali, vinous, oleous, or watery Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
yea or metalline, will boyl. <hi>But to go a little
farther, in the matter,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and do ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
proving that Steel abounds with Acid and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61509:25"/>
Particles, which,</hi> he ſays, <hi>I deny, and not with
alkalous, and ſo conſequently ought to be call'd an Acid.</hi>
The Gentleman here confeſſes he hath done nothing to
it yet, but now he is reſolved to prove Iron abounds with
Acid, and ſulphureous Particles; but, I ſay, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
will not be that it is an Acid if it do, unleſs thoſe
Acid Particles are more than the reſt. Well, but firſt
<hi>he will ſhew that Iron is very much impregnated with
Sulphur; and then prove,</hi> contrary to my Aſſertion, <hi>that
there is a burning Brimſtome to be obtain'd from it.</hi> Well
this is a ſecret in Chymiſtry, I long to be at it; how is
it done? Why <hi>Filings of Steel flung through the Flame of
a Candle will take fire ſooner than Gunpowder, and as
ſoon as common Sulphur, and the violent motion of a Flint
and Steel will do the ſame.</hi> I anſwer, the Gentleman
has ſhewn his Ignorance ſufficiently here; theſe Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena
are not the firing of any thing combuſtible in the
Steel, but only the heating ſmall particles of the Mettal
red hot; the firſt by the flame of the Candle, the ſecond
by the rapid ſtroke of the Flint, ſtriking off a particle of
the Metal red hot, and ſometimes melted, as it may be
ſeen, if caught on a piece of white Paper, and viewed in
a Microſcope; but the Metal will be found unaltered;
which, if it were burnt, would be otherwiſe. But if the
Steel be ſoftned it will not do, the blow not meeting
with ſo much reſiſtance, the Flint will ſtrike off too
much to take the heat.</p>
               <p>But again he is pleas'd to ſay, <hi>that when the filings of
Iron are in diſſolution in Sp. of Salt, the Fumes that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
will take fire; and if done in a convenient Glaſs, and
a lighted Paper held to the Fumes, it will fulminate as
loud as a Muſquet; and he hopes I am ſatisfied by this
time, that there is ſuch a thing as common Brimſtone in
Iron.</hi> Truly Sir, I am not yet ſatisfied; I could never
ſee the Fumes of Sp. of Salt take fire, and if they did,
it could be nothing of the Iron, which won't riſe in
Fumes, as any one may ſee by diſtilling the matter. An
Exploſion, I know, may be, if the Mouth of the Glaſs
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61509:26"/>
be too ſmall, or ſtopt; and ſo there may be of any rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
Liquor. But if this won't do, he is ſo kind as to
give us a proceſs to make Brimſtone out of ron. Now
he comes to ſomething like a Tanſie, and I muſt write
it down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Recip.</hi> Sal Martis, <hi>diſſolve it in common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
add Oyl of Tartar more than will precipitate the Iron,
evaporate all to dryneſs, flux it with Carcoal, and you
will have a ſulphureous Salt, diſſolve in Water, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and with diſtill'd Vinegar, or Sp. of Salt, you may
precipitate a Sulphur that will burn and ſtink like common
Sulphur.</hi> I thank the Gentleman, but I muſt tell him,
this Sulphur comes not at all from the Iron. For firſt,
if his <hi>Sal Martis</hi> be that made with Spirit of Wine and
Oyl of Vitriol, they will yield Sulphur enough without
the Iron; the Oyl of Vitriol will coagulate the inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part of the Sp. of Wine into Brimſtone. If it comes
not hence, the Oyl of Tartar has a Sulphur in it, as all
fixt Alkalies have more or leſs. If this won't do, the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choal
has enough; and if he uſes Vinegar to precipitate
it, that can ſpare a little. But let him take Iron, and
work on it how he will without any thing that can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a combuſtible Body, I defy him, or a Horſe with a
bigger Head, to get me a grain of Sulphur. So in his
proceſs of Tartar Vitriolat. and filings of Iron, if true,
the Sulphur comes from the other things, not the Iron.
But he ſays, <hi>he has not mentioned the proportions of his
Ingredients, becauſe he is talking to a Chymiſt.</hi> It ſeems
he takes the Phyſician he writes to for a Chymiſt, but he
talks not like one; for proportions of things neceſſary in
order to divers reſulting Products in Chymiſtry, that a
Man has not tried and obſerved, are not hit eaſily by
any Rules in Chymiſtry, and in many Operations much
depends on proportion. <hi>But if theſe Experiments won't
prove a Sulphur in Iron,</hi> he ſays, <hi>he may chance to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
20 more, but theſe, he ſuppoſes, will ſatisfie the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</hi>
I anſwer, I ſuppoſe theſe were not his worſt,
and if he produces no better, 40 won't do to ſatisfie the
skilful, whatever the reaſonable may think. But he ſays,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61509:26"/>
                  <hi>he muſt conclude Steel to be rather an Acid than an Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li.</hi>
That's his Miſery, that he muſt conclude it an Acid,
tho' none ever got an Acid from it. <hi>But if he can get a
Sulphur from it, he hopes none will doubt but he may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
get an Acid in quantity.</hi> I anſwer, to conclude this
mighty point, if the Sulphur he ſuppoſes he gets from it,
were indeed from it, tis ſo little, that it would not deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
Steel a Sulphur, and that Acid in the Sulphur
is much leſs, and would much leſs give Iron the title of
an Acid. But let an honeſt Country man (Mr. <hi>Yardly</hi>
if you pleaſe) taſte filings of Steel, not knowing what it
is, or any thing indeed produced from it, and if he ſays
it taſtes ſour, I'll be an Aſsheadiſt.</p>
               <p>I thought I had done with Steel for this bout, becauſe
ſomething elſe comes next, but I find there's another
touch upon Steel afterwards, ſo I'll go to that, that we

               <p>
                  <hi>The Gentleman tells us, pag. 46.</hi> I ſay the Doctor's
Preparation of Steel with Sal Armon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not made with
an Acid, and he thinks it is; and to prove it, <hi>ſays he,</hi>
if you make it in a Retort and a ſtrong Fire, nothing but
an Alkali will riſe, and the Acid will remain with the
Steel; for if you take the <hi>Cap. Mort.</hi> and diſtill, you
ſhall have nothing come over but a pure Acid, of great
uſe in Phyſick.</p>
               <p>I am at a little loſs to know who he means by <hi>the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi>
it muſt be ſome body ſure that is a Doctor <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was known formerly by the name of
the Philoſopher; but the Gentleman being one that loves
Verjuice well, I gueſs he means Mr. <hi>Colebatch;</hi> but I'd
faign know what made him a Doctor, whether Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Confidence, or a Licence to kill, or all together.
But now I think on't, <hi>Doctor</hi> is a Teacher, and he
teaches the abuſe of Crabs, Oranges, and Lemons,
therefore he is a Doctor. But the Doctor's Preparation
of Steel muſt be with an Acid. If it be, I ſay, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Doctor is an Acid; for Sal Armon is not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a compound of com. Salt and Vol Salt of Urin,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61509:27"/>
neither of which is an Acid; and tho com. Salt may be
diſtill'd into an Acid, yet 'tis not an Acid before Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat
on, any more than Lead, for inſtance, is Glaſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it may be turn'd into Glaſs. But when Salt is
turn'd into an Acid Liquor, it then ceaſes to be a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,
tho' it may be brought back again very eaſily into
its old and natural Form; as the Glaſs of Lead may
likewiſe ſoon be reduced into Lead again. And the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
Preparation is made with it before diſtill'd. But
the Gentleman adds, <hi>if we diſſolve Filings of Steel in Sp.
of Salt, and diſtill as before, we ſhall find the</hi> Cap. Mort.
<hi>the ſame as that made with Sal Armon. And farther,</hi>
ſays he, '<hi>tis not the com. Salt, but the Acid Spirit of it,
that is one part of the compound of Sal Armon. and Vol.
Alkali the other; for a mixture of Sp. of Salt and Vol.
Alkali will produce good Sal Armon.</hi> Right, but theſe
Alkalous Bodies change the acidity of the Sp. of Salt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a body not Acid, but a Salſum, its natural old Form;
and in that form it works, not in that it has not when ſo
changed.</p>
               <p>But not to let go what the Gentleman ſays, pag. 46.
without a Remark; he there tells us, <hi>he is ſure a Diſeaſe
caus'd by Acids may be cured by Acids.</hi> But here he
unwittingly gives away the Cauſe, by confeſſing a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
may be caus'd by Acids, which is the very thing I
would prove; and there are divers kinds of Acids ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
different Effects, therefore Acids may cauſe divers
Diſeaſes. But ſtill he holds faſt to one part of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
that all Diſeaſes, even thoſe caus'd by Acids, may
be cured (he ſhould have ſaid muſt) by Acids. And
how proves he this? <hi>Why Acids operate upon, or alter
the texture of one another; and if the texture be alter'd
its qualities muſt be alter'd; and it muſt act differently
from what it did.</hi> I anſwer, whatever change Acids
make on one another, they do not change one another
from being Acids; and the Diſeaſe being caus'd by the
Acid, as Acid, the change of the Acid will but change
the Diſeaſe, not cure it; that muſt be done, by taking away
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61509:27"/>
its Acidity, or expelling the Acid; and if Acid could be
ſuppoſed to expel Acid, 'twould be but one Devil entring
to caſt out the other, this being as troubleſome a Gueſt as
that diſpoſs'd; and the Experiment the Gentleman brings
to confirm his Opinion, is nothing pertaining to Medicine
or Man's Body: <hi>For Sp. of Nitre, or</hi> Aq. fort. ſays he, <hi>diſſolves
Silver, but Sp. of Salt mixed with them, makes it it
ſhall never diſſolve Silver as it did.</hi> But our Bowels are
not Silver, to be diſſolved in Sp. of Nitre, that Sp.
of Salt ſhould be a Medicine to render ineffectual.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſays, pag 47. <hi>that I am very angry
with Doctor</hi> Colebath <hi>for ſaying Cinnabar is an Acid,
but have not proved, or ſaid it is an Alkali.</hi> To which
I tell him, I was never angry with Doctor <hi>Colebatch</hi> in
my Life, nor with his Gentleman, but I think I ſaid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to prove that Cinnabar is not an Acid, much leſs
running Mercury 13 ſixteenths of it. But the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>refers to all the World, whether running Mercury
will act as Cinnabar does; if not, then Cinnabar does all
by vertue of the Sulphur embodied with it.</hi> But I'll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it even to the Acidiſts, by the ſame Argument, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
common Sulphur will act as Cinnabar does; if not,
then Cinnabar does all by vertue of the Mercury embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
with it; and if the Argument be good, it is 13 to
3 on my ſide. But I tell the Gentleman, to leave theſe
Logical Depths for Experience, Cinnabar acts as Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar,
and not as Mercury, or as Sulphur, otherwiſe
we need not be at the trouble to compound them. And
the Gentleman goes on with his Argument, <hi>Sulphur is
an Acid;</hi> why? <hi>Becauſe I allow it to be compounded of
an Acid and an Oyl, but not of an Acid and an Alkali.</hi>
The Argument runs thus in the whole latitude of it. Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pur
is an Acid, becauſe it is compounded of a little Acid
and an Oyl; and Cinnabar is an Acid, becauſe it has a
little of that that has a little Acid in it. By the ſame
Logick I may prove the Gentleman is a Calf, becauſe he
dined upon Veal, and has a little of a Calf in him.
But the Gentleman talks on, ſhewing more Ignorance,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61509:28"/>
ſaying, <hi>he believes Mercury an abſorber of all kind of Salts,
Alkalies or Acids, rather than of Acids.</hi> But I muſt tell
him, it is not an Abſorber of Alkalies, for they revive
it, and diſengage it from Acids which it hath abſorb'd.
But he ſays, <hi>it will diſſolve Mettals, which is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I often uſe to prove the Acidity of a Body.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
it will not truly diſſolve Metals, it only pulve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes
them. But he continues to abuſe me, ſo as a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
can't be thought to do; for I never, that I know
of, much leſs often, made it an Argument to prove the
Acidity of a Body, that it will diſſolve a Mettal; tho'
he would be contented it ſhould be took for one. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that if he ſhould be convinc'd that Sp. of Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
is a good Medicine, he would prove it an Acid by
its diſſolving Copper. But he ſays, <hi>Mercury will fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with Gold if well managed, and make a heat not
to be endured by the Hand.</hi> But this is no Argument
that Mercury is an Acid; and tho this ſtory he has heard
be true, he knows not what the well managing of the
Mercury is, or the cauſe of the Heat. He ſays, <hi>he has
often met with two Acids that will ferment with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;</hi>
but he has given no inſtance, but what he is
miſtaken in.</p>
               <p>But the Gentleman, pag 48. <hi>wiſhes I had told them
how to make the Quinteſſence of Wine an Alkali, (which I
ſaid I would oppoſe to all the Acids in the World) that it
might be us'd, and judged whether it be ſo noble an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali
or not.</hi> I anſwer, this Alkali has been us'd, and is
us'd, and judg'd, and found to be a noble Alkali; and
I have cured conſiderable Diſeaſes with one ſmall Doſe
of it; and have had a Patient ſick in bed, and fear of
Death one day, and up, and pretty well on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
by the uſe of this Alkali. But I did not ſay, I
would oppoſe it to all the Acids in the World, but to
Mr. <hi>Colebatch</hi>'s Acids; for there are better Acids than he
is aware of, uſeful in ſome, tho not in all Caſes. But
if the Gentleman has a mind to ſee the effects of this
Medicine, I ſay ſtill, let there be a number of Patients, ſick
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61509:28"/>
of ſuch Diſeaſes wherein I think it uſeful, divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Mr. <hi>Colebath</hi> and I, or any other Acidiſt, and I
will uſe the Quinteſcence, and he ſhall uſe what Acid he
pleaſes, and if I don't recover more than he, I'll be an
Acidiſt.</p>
               <p>But the Gentleman <hi>can gueſs what this Quinteſcence
of Wine is;</hi> and he ſuppoſes <hi>it is the fineſt rectified Sp. of
Wine, talk<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d of by ſome, that is ſo ſubtile a Drop will not
fall to the Ground. Such an Eſſence of Wine he has ſeen,
and can make at any time; but he affirms it will come
under the denomination of an Acid.</hi> I anſwer, I confeſs
ſuch an Eſſence of Wine will come under the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an Acid, if Mr. <hi>Colebatch</hi> ſays 'tis an Acid, (as
he muſt do if he ſhould uſe it) or if it be found in the
ingenious Mr. <hi>Stringer</hi>'s Catalogue of Acids; but there
is no better Argement for its Acidity. But to ſatisfie
the Gentleman, I tell him this Alkali is as much an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kali,
as any thing he ever ſaw; and 'tis not his ſuppoſed
Eſſence of Wine, or any other Eſſence, but a Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
if he knows what that means. But yet to ſatisfie
him ſufficiently, (if he be <hi>a Philoſopher as well as a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
as,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Phyſicians are)</hi> I'll tell him why this
is call'd a Quinteſcence, and what it is. The Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
is the fifth ſtate or being of Wine. The firſt is in
the <hi>Muſt</hi> or Juice of Grapes. The ſecond, in the
Wine when fermented and brought to its perfection, as
an inflamable Spirit; (and in this ſtate the Gentleman's
Eſſence is found.) The third, when this ſecond inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Spirit is turn'd into an incombuſtible Salt The
fourth, when this Salt is mortified and ſeemingly deſtroy'd.
The fifth is its change and reſurrection into a noble Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalous
and green Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Gent ſays, pag. 49. <hi>Sp. of Salt diluted in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
quantity of an aqueous Vehicle, is better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
Fleſh than com Salt; and com Salt, by an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a proper quantity of Sp. of Salt, will be more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in all reſpects.</hi> I anſwer, if he had told us his conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
and proper quantities, the Tryal of the matter
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61509:29"/>
might ſoon have been made. But if you take a piece of
Meat ſeaſon'd as the Gentleman preſcribes, and another
after the ordinary way, I'll engage, on Tryal, the laſt
ſhall eat beſt; and Mr. <hi>Colebatch</hi> himſelf would ſay ſo,
if he knew nothing of their ſeaſoning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Gentleman adds,</hi> that in Oppoſition to Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch,</hi>
I affirm that Bittern is not an Alkali but an Acid,
becauſe Sp. of Salt is to be obtain'd from it in Diſtillation;
but I have not told in what quantity, for I knew the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
is inconſiderale to what remains after Diſtillation,
there being at leaſt four parts of Alkali in Bittern to one of
Acid, which turns Syr. Viol. green, and anſwers the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of a ſtrong Alkali; and he has known Soap made
of it, which is not done without a great quantity of Alkali:
And tho' Sp. of Salt may be obtain'd from Bittern, yet
this will not prove it an Acid, or that the Sp. is any part of
the Bittern, for it is but ſome remains of the Acid part
of the Salt; for the Bittern, after Diſtillation, will cauſe
Thirſt more than it did before, and the Spirit will allay
Thirſt if judiciouſly uſed.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, the Gentleman has ſo often, unbecoming
a Gentleman, made me ſay what I never ſaid, that I
now can hardly believe he is indeed a Gentleman, but
rather ſome little Medicaſter, or very ſmall Surgeon.
I never ſaid Bittern was an Acid, becauſe Spirit of Salt
may be diſtill'd from it, but I ſaid Bittern in its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
form is but a Salſum; and by skill in Chymiſtry
Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> his damn'd <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ixt Alkali (as he call'd it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a bleſſed Volatil Acid. But the Gentleman can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive the Chymical Metamorphoſis of Bodies,
his Pyrotechny is only ſeparatory. I told the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Phyſician alſo, that Bittern would riſe in the Fire,
and come over (I did not ſay yeild) good Spirit of Salt.
And the Gent. is much miſtaken in ſuppoſing the Spirit is
inconſiderable to what remains, or that Bittern has 4 parts
of Alkali to one of Acid. For, as I ſaid, it leaves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
behind but an inſipid white Earth, and that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
to what comes over, if it be skilfully diſtill'd;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61509:29"/>
nor will that Earth cauſe thirſt ſo much, as Sait in which
there is no Bittern. I do not believe he ever ſaw Soap
made of Bittern, as he ſays, but I know Soap may
be made with a very little Alkali.</p>
               <p>But the Gent. concludes, <hi>he is of the Opinion that I
cannot produce a Catalogue of Medicines equaly efficacious
in the Cure of Diſeaſes with Mercur. dule. Turpeth. Min.
Red precip. Cinnabar. Sal Succini. Sal Martis En. Veneris.
Oyl of Vitriol, Sp. of Nitre, Oyl of Sulphur, and Dr.</hi> Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batch'<hi>s
Elixir Vitrioli; all which operate by vertue of their
Acids: for if they be diveſted of their Acid Particles they
will never produce thoſe effects. And if the uſe of Alkalies
cannot be thus demonſtrated, he ſhall remain a Proſelyte to
the Doctrine of Acids. And thus,</hi> ſays he, <hi>he has given his
Thoughts in anſwer to thoſe Objections that ſeem moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
in the Dialogue, but has omitted to take notice of what
has not a relation to Acids and Alkalies, being the Cauſe or
Cure of Diſeaſes, and in ſo doing, hopes he has anſwer'd the
Doctor's Requeſt.</hi> I anſwer, I can produce the ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue,
and a better. But the Medicines named are not the
invention of any Acid Doctor, but were common to all
Phyſicians, before any ſuch ſharp Fancy had turn'd the
Brains of any Pretenders to Phyſick; nor are they all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cids,
nor do any of them, except the Spirits, operate by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of their Acids. But I might ſay, if I could allow my ſelf
to reaſon as the Gentleman does, by vertue of their Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
for if you take away ☿, ♀, and ♂, the Acids now join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them, will never produce the Effects alone. But I
know better, they operate by vertue of their Texture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
from their Conjuction; even as Gun-powder does
not operate by vertue of Sulphur, or either of its Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
but by Nitre, Sulphur, and Charcoal all together. And
if the uſe of Acids (or Alkalies either) cannot be better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
than the Gentleman, or his Maſter <hi>Colebatch,</hi>
have demonſtrated their pretended Hypotheſis of Acids,
I ſhall not be a Proſelyte to either,</p>
               <p>The Gentleman has at laſt anſwer'd his Doctors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
and pick'd out here, and there an expreſſion in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61509:30"/>
my Dialogue, which he thought he could ſay ſome
thing to, but how well he has anſwered what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Material, and how much he has Omitted, I muſt
yet leave to the judicious Reader of my Dialogue,
wherein I think ſtands unanſwer'd enough to ſhew <hi>the
groundleſsneſs and danger of the pretended new Hypotheſis
of Acid and Alkali; as well as the immodeſt ſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
ſhameful contempt, and abuſe of all Phyſicians,
groſs miſtakes, and great ignorance of the Pretender:</hi>
Which want of Learning and Vertue the Gentleman in
his Letter, has not ſo much as excus'd; wherefore I hope
his Maſter is alſo Conſcious thereof, and will amend. And
the Gentleman perhaps in a little time may ſee, that he
is a Proſelyte to ſo very ſenſleſs, and mean a Sect, he
may be aſham'd on't, or he may be blown with ſome
leſs biting or dangerous Maggot, or become fond of
ſome newer Fancy; ſince Gentlemen are inclinable it
ſeems, to be as well pleas'd with their Phyſicians for
impoſing new Faſhion'd ſufferings upon them, as with
their Taylors for putting them into new faſhion'd
Cloaths: And for ſuch Gentlemens ſakes I have a good
mind, before I Conclude, to ſtart a yet newer Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
that may ſerve them, when that of Acids is out of
Faſhion, which when it ſhall be ſtrongly aſſerted by
ſome Man of Confidence, I don't queſtion but it will
take, pleaſe as well, be more effectual, and le<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
than the practice of Acids.</p>
               <p>I have been inform'd by a Perſon of Credit, that a
certain Doctor in <hi>France,</hi> who was fam<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d for his Cures,
gave nothing to his Patients but Brick-duſt. And I
have heard of another of conſiderable repute in another
Place, who, as a Panacea, gave all that came to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
quantities of common Water. Theſe Doctors
wanting a more generous Principle, both diſguiſed their
Medicines; they ſeem to have acted contrary, but which
appear'd to have the better ſucceſs, I was not well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd;
but ſome of the Patients of both no doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
and ſome of them died, thoſe that lived would
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61509:30"/>
ſwear the Doctor heald them, but thoſe that pack'd off
were left out of the Catalogue of his Cures. But let it
be how it will, the hint gives me ground enough to
build a new Hypotheſis upon, now that of Acids grows
old. Brick-duſt and Water then ſhall be two Principals,
into which bodies may be reſolved. Diſtillation and
Tranſmutation reduces all into them. Whatever is
Liquid comes over either in the form of Water, the one
principle required, or in the form of Oyl, or of a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
Spirit. The Oyl's Unctuoſity and Inflamableneſs
may ſoon be changed, and the ſapor of the Salts be
deſtroyed; the <hi>Vita Media</hi> of both may be ſoon took
away, and the Liquor reduced into common inſipid
Water. But whatever is ſolid may be by the Fire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
either to a Liquid, to be wrought on as before ſaid,
or by burning will be reduced to a <hi>Caput Mort.</hi> which
expos'd to the action of the Air, will be rotted and
turn'd into common Earth, which then by art may be
made into Brick, and then eaſily pulveriſed (if you will
follow the French Man) fine enough for the Stoma<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h of
a Lady. How theſe two Principles are concern'd in
the Life and Death of all things in the Macrocoſm, I
could readily teach, if an exact Phyſiology were thought
neceſſary to a Doctor.</p>
               <p>Now let theſe two Principles be taken, inſtead of Acid
and Alkali, for the Life and Death of things, and for
the Cauſe and Cure of Diſeaſes, (it ſhall be all one to
me, which is the Killer, and which is the Curer) and I will
make out the Aitiologie of all Deſeaſes, and their Cures
from them. But foraſmuch as Gentlemen now-a-days are
generally great lovers of the Bottle, and will rather
cauſe a doſe from the Glaſs, than from the Trowel, and
a Phyſicians buſineſs is to humour them, Brick-duſt ſhall
be the cauſe, and Water the cure of all Diſeaſes. But
becauſe we will recommend our ſelves by talking learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
as Phyſicians ought, that is ſo as our Grand-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may not readily underſtand us, we will call them
Arid, and Humid, and ſay Arid is the Cauſe, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid
the Cure of all Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:61509:31"/>
Let us begin at the Mouth, as Phyſicians commonly
do, at which death is ſo often let in, in this our luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and Pharmacutick Age. It is apparent that no
Food, if it abound with Arid, can agree well with us;
therefore nature has placed certain Cataracts under the
Tongue pouring out their Humid Saliva, which tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
the Arid and carries it along; without which even
deglutition cannot be performed, without ſoon termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
our Life by choaking. This Humid accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
our Food down into the Stomach, there digeſts
our Food, and that not by its Acid, or Alkali, bitterneſs
or ſweetneſs, or any other affected reliſh, but by vertue
of its ſelf, as Humid. The truth of which any Man
may be ſatisfied with, if he but conſiders how Water is
neceſſary for the macerating of all things fermentable,
in order to a ſeparation of their parts, the Humid from
the Arid, the profitable from the unprofitable. Now
when a due quantity of Humid is adminiſter'd by the
Salivia, which carries our Food down, mixes and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
it, and Drink being added in a convenient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
(the more watry the better) farther to dilute it,
and to ſupply Matter for more Saliva, the mixture paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
the Pylorus, and in the ſmall Guts is farther altered;
whence the Humid Chyle, with a little fine Arid to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
or ſupply the defects of the ſolid parts, is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Lacteals; but moſt of the Arid inviſcated by the
Gall and Pancreatick Juice, (which make a tough ſlimy
Matter,) is carried down as noxious through the Guts,
and turn'd out at the back Door. Now if for want of
a ſufficient quantity of Humid in the Stomach, there is
not a due natural Fermentation, ſo as that the Particles
in the compound have not liberty to move without
breaking their Figures againſt one another, or that they
ad-here and combine, and remain not enough ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they are not only unfit to ſupply the defect of the
Vital Juices, but lying heavy in the Ventricle they don't
work up, and paſs out of the Pylorus as they ought;
whence proceed lothings, pains in the Stomach, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61509:31"/>
Spontaneous Vomitings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To remedy which, ſome
large draughts of Humid being given, the indigeſted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is eaſily ejected, the Stomach waſhed clean, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
fit for its office again, till it be again over-charg'd
with Arid, or defrauded of its due quantity of Humid.
But if the abounding Arid, be not ſo much as totally to
hinder the fermentation in the Stomach, but yet the
Humid be not ſuch as is ſufficient for the due perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
thereof, then a groſs Chyle, wherein Arid does
abound, is retain'd, inſeparable from it in the <hi>Duode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi>
The groſſer part of which being not able to enter
the Lacteals, is carried downwards; which being too
tough and clammy adheres to the ſides of the Colon,
and lies too long in its Cells, cauſing the Cholick, dry
Gripes, and divers miſchiefs of that nature, till by the
Irritation and Excoriation of the Latera of the Guts, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
pours forth the Lymphatick Juice, and ſo there are
produced Fluxes, more or leſs, according to the greater
or leſs diſorder and irritation of the rough Arid Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
But that part, which being not ſo groſs, is carried
into the Lacteal Veins, ſometimes adheres there, in the
ſmall ramifications of thoſe Veſſels, cauſing Obſtructions;
whence the nutricious Juice being not plentifully carried
into the Blood, a Tabes or Aridura muſt needs follow.
But by the due and timely adminiſtration of Humid,
theſe Arid Particles are waſhed out into the Blood, and
ſeparated thence by Urine, and the Chyle again freely
diſtributed to the recovery and health of the Body.</p>
               <p>But if theſe Arid particles are too abundant in the
Blood, and not duely ſeparated by Urine, they do not
only render the Blood too thick, and ſo retar'd its due
Motion, but after ſticking in the capillary Arteries and
Veins, hinder its Motion in divers particular Places,
whence the Blood ſtagnating there, a preternatual Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is excited, and the Blood put into an inteſtine
Motion, and thence come Feavers of all ſorts, differing
according to the different Circumſtances of places ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
and of more or leſs Arid Matter. But by a
proper adhibition of the friendly Humid, theſe rough
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61509:32"/>
Arid particles are made flow, and carried off by Urine or
Sweat, and the heat alay'd, and ſo the Patient recovers.</p>
               <p>But ſometimes when thoſe abounding Arid particles,
are not carried off by a ſufficient quantity of the Humid,
either by Urine or inſenſible Perſpiration, then they
fix in the Limbs and outward parts from whence there
follow Gouts, Rhumatiſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which by a large
adminiſtration of Humid, (if the Diſeaſe be not too
ſtubbornly fixt) are carried off, or their rough Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
attemper'd, and ſo the Patient enjoys Eaſe and
Health. And I challenge all the Acid Doctors in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
even <hi>Alkins</hi> himſelf, could we have him again from
the lower World, with all the Lemons and Oranges in
<hi>Spain,</hi> or Oyl of Vitriol, in <hi>Europe,</hi> to cure half the
Patients I will cure of the Gout, by a regular courſe of
pure Humid. But if I ſhould go from the Blood to the
<hi>ſuccus Nervoſus,</hi> I could abundantly ſhew what diſmal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
the abounding pernicious Arid does, in thickning and
in ſtoping the animal Spirits, and ſo cauſing Apoplexies,
Palſeys, Megrims, Deliriums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea I could ſhew
you how theſe rough Arid particles fixing in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,
and other parts that are tenſe, cauſe Pains;
but that this ſpecimen would ſwell into a large Book:
and I could give ſo rational an account of the matter
that moſt Gentleman that love new Diſcoveries might
readily believe it the very truth, and be fond on't, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſome one or other that ſhould chance to have a
Dropſie, ſhould object againſt my new Doctrine, and
ſay, what, will this fellow pretend his Aridum is the
cauſe of that, where it is Water which apparently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds?
I anſwer, let the Gent. have a little Patience,
if I make out this Point, I hope he will believe I am
able to account for all the reſt that may be explain'd on
the ſame Hypotheſis, and I need not proceed any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this Specimen. The Dropſie it ſelf, ſay I, is
caus'd by the Pernicious abounding Arid, and cured by
the due adminiſtration of the friendly Humid. For
the demonſtration of which let it be conſider'd, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the Humid's unequal and undue diſtribution and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61509:32"/>
is a Diſeaſe; even as in the Body politick the
ſetling or ſtagnation of the Vital-blood-mony in any of
the members, and chiefly in the Head, is not without ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many bad effects. So when the Humid ſtagnates in
the Legs, Head, Cods, Abdomen, or habit of the Body,
it gives names to divers ſorts of Dropſies; for I will not
ſay of the bleſſedeſt Humid, as Mr. <hi>Colebatch</hi> does of
his Acid, there can never be to much of it. But never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
Arid, with his rough and harſh particles, I affirm
is the cauſe of the Humids abounding, wherever it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duely
diſtributed; for if a Man Perſpire well, and Piſs
well, he will never have a Dropſie. But when the Arid
particles abound, and obſtruct the natural Courſe of the
Humid, which is ordain'd to dilute, ſeparate, and waft
them off, the Humid it ſelf by its preſſure breaks ſome
Veſſels, or paſſes through outlets corroded by the Arid,
and ſo falls into the cavity of the Abdomen, or is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſated
into ſome other part of the Body, which effect
we call a Dropſy. But now for the Cure of it, by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid
you'll ſay it is impoſſible, this is not adding Oyl
to the Fire, but as bad, Water to a deluge. Have a
little patience Gent. and I'll warrant you I'll demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
it, better than Mr. <hi>Colebatch</hi> did the cure of
four Stomachs by Oyl of Vitriol.</p>
               <p>Let it therefore be conſider'd. That the extravaſated
Humid cannot be diſcharg'd the way it came, not only
becauſe the paſſages it ſhould have went are ſtop't for
want of its due Courſe in the Veſſels, but becauſe it
has loſt its Motion, and ſo lying long ſoaking the
more fleſhy parts, diſſolves ſomewhat of them, and ſo
becomes clammy: Now the obſtructing Arid muſt be
carried off, which cannot be done but by a Humid,
thinning the blood which is in Motion, and tho the
ſtagnated Humid may be ſomewhat increas'd by the
addition of more Humid, yet it will be render'd more
thin, and apt to flow when the obſtructing and
corroding, Arid is waſhed away, and there will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to hinder Nature: but by the Motion of the Parts,
the Humid is preſs'd out into the Veſſels, and carried off
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61509:33"/>
again And now I think I have ſufficiently ſhewn how the
hardeſt part of this new Doctrine may be accounted for;
but yet I muſt needs, as a Friend to the Faculty, inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
ſomething of the neceſſity, or at leaſt, conveniency
of the direction of a Phyſician to order proper Times,
Quantities, Diet, Wine, Exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this eaſie
Courſe of Phyſick; for tho' I don't queſtion, but by a
little diſcretion a Man may cure or prevent moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
by this new method, chiefly by waſhing the Pot,
<hi>viz</hi> the Stomach clean when ever it is foul; yet I
muſt warn my Readers (which let be a caution to
Drunkards, who may think they can't hurt themſelves
at all with humid) that ſome humids, as ſophiſticated
Wines, and unripe Mault Drinks, have a groſs and
noxious Arid ſwimming in them, which is very apt to
Precipitate, and cauſe divers ill effects in the Body:
And that any Man may do himſelf a miſchief, even
by the moſt wholſome and innocent things indiſcreetly
uſed, as well as the Phyſician by ſlighting his advice,
which he is always ready to give on advantagious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
I could alſo confirm this Hypotheſis by a large
account of Caſes in Practice, but I ſhall forbear at
preſent, only offering one Conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That
all the real benefit received by Drinking the Waters,
comes merely by the large quantities of Water taken,
waſhing the Bowels and diluting the Blood and other
humours of the Body, and not by the naſty Minerals
they are impregnated with, which Nature abhorring
rejects with diſturbance; and I would adviſe Perſons
hereafter to repair to ſome pure Spring, and there
Drink as at the uſually frequented places, and if they
don't receive more than uſual benefit, I will recant
and turn an Aridiſt, and be as ready to aſſiſt <hi>John,</hi> or
any other Hypothetick in the Doctine of Arid, as I am
now farther to demonſtrate that of Humid, as that
which I think will be the moſt ſafe, and likely to do
my Friends a kindneſs, now the dangerous Doctrine of
Acids begins to go out of Faſhion.</p>
