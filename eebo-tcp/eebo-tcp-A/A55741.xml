         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may be said of your famous City, as sometimes of <hi>Tyre.</hi>
She is the Crowning City, <hi>whose Merchants are Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
whose Traffiquers are the honourable of the
Earth,</hi> Isa. 23. 8. But what became of <hi>Tyre,</hi> that noble
and ennobling City? her Crown was laid in the dust, and
her Honourable in the streets. And why? They were haughty and
knew not the Lord, neither regarded they the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> They did
not know; in their affairs they eyed not the Crown of Righteousness,
neither were Traffiquers with Heaven, therefore they perished from off
the Earth.</p>
            <p>Your City, as a stately Princess, wears a goodly rich Crowns on her
head, Crowns her Merchants and inhabitants with wealth and honour;
and you confess that it is not for your Righteousness that the Lord hath
spared you, but that <hi>It is of the Lords mercies, that ye are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
because his compassions fail not.</hi> Lam. 3. 22. I will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
you for Pride and haughtiness, for trampling under foot the glory
of <hi>England,</hi> the Preaching of the Gosple of Righteousness, nor for
Blasphemy, Heresie, Apostasie, Oppression, self-love, and self-seeking,
serving your selves upon <hi>Christ</hi> and upon his Gosple, for I have often
heard you, upon your publick fasting-daies and daies of humiliation, to
accuse and condemn your selves for these and the like City sins, onely
I grieve to see these Rebels and Traitors against God to get a Reprieve,
and I heartily wish that the day of their Execution were come: for,
the putting of these to death will be your life. For the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi>
tells you how you shall be still renowned, the Crowned and the Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
City. <hi>To do justly, to love mercy, and to humble thy self to walk
<pb facs="tcp:55690:3"/>
with thy God,</hi> Micah 6. 8. You must meet God every day upon the
Royal Exchange. Here you must barter Nature for Grace, Error for
Truth, your own Righteousness for <hi>Christ;</hi> (and who will not part
with dross for Gold, Pibbles for Pearls, Rags for Robes? <hi>you must
put off</hi> (saith the blessed Apostle) <hi>concerning the former conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Old Man, corrupt through the deceitfull lusts, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
in the spirit of your minde: and put on the New Man,
which after God is created in Righteousness and true holiness.</hi> Ephes.
5. 22, 23, 24. Your main case must be for your religious Factorage,
and to keep up your noble Trade with Heaven. Your Merchandize
must be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently, and
for durable cloathing. <hi>Isa.</hi> 23. 18. Let Prayer continually go forth with
your loaden vessels, and the Spirit of God will Pilot ye. Then shall ye
have good Markets indeed: and Oh, the rich returns that will flow
in unto you! Blessed are the Merchants, that walk and talk with
God daily upon the Exchange. When God and the Soul are Partners,
Oh, the sweetness and fullness of that Communion and entercourse!</p>
            <p>See how our Saviour loveth such a soul as is busied in heavenly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations,
when he likens the Kingdom of Heaven to such <hi>a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
who seeking goodly Pearls, when he had found one Pearl of
great Price, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.</hi> Matth.
13. 45, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The true Christian is this Merchant; a Merchant adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
he ventures riches, honours, pleasures; life and all, he trades for
Pearls, that is, he seeks (with labour, cost, and danger) for heavenly
knowledge, the Pearl of great Price, or the peerless Pearl is Christ
Iesus. A Pearl is bred of a caelestial humour or dew in shell-fishes:
Christ by heavenly Influence was formed in the womb of the Virgin.
<hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with us, or God-man is this Pearl. The value and worth
of this Pearl no Arithmetician can sum up, it is infinite, of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
virtue, most precious, A Pearl that makes Pearls, it makes vile
sinners to be Pearls and costly <hi>Jewels, Malac.</hi> 3. 17. and turns every
evil thing into <hi>Good for us, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. as the Philosophers stone
turns every thing it toucheth into Gold. This Pearl, Christ Iesus with
all his gifts, graces, virtues, merits, and Priveledges is derived to
us by the means of his ordinances. These are the Cabinets and Caskets
of this Pearl. God offers Christ in his word, he is willing to barter with
us. <hi>Come buy.</hi> Isa. 55. 1. <hi>I Counsel thee to buy.</hi> Rev. 3. 18. In it
<pb facs="tcp:55690:3"/>
God desires us to be good to our own souls, to receive the soul-saving,
soul-enriching Pearl, thus offered (as these Texts, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 20. Deut.
5. 29. Luke</hi> 13. 34. do testifie.)</p>
            <p>As there the Merchant went and sold all, so doth the true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
sell all. That is first, he parts with the estimation of all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of Christ. Secondly, he hath a heart prepared actually to part
with all, if he cannot enjoy it and Christ too. Thirdly, and especially,
he parts with his sins all, not reserving a <hi>Zoar</hi> or a <hi>Rimmon,</hi> not
keeping any one beloved lust or forbidden pleasure. Yea, Fourthly, he
parts with his Affections, with all their Branches and Objects, if
they will not stand with Christ. Whatsoever comes into competition with
Christ, whether honours, riches, pleasures, yea his own life, he decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
it, and looseth all for Christs sake. And the gain of this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,
no tongue is able to express.</p>
            <p>Thus do wise Merchants traffique whilst they live here on earth, a
Countrey that is not theirs, venting their Commodities and transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all they can into Heaven, their own Countrey, against their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
and Receit there, with joyfull acclamations of Saints and Angels,
and most rich and most honourable dwelling with their blessed Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
soul-solacing, and hearts-satisfying friends, in perfect joy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
comfort, and fullness of all good things for evermore.</p>
            <p>The Lord remove and take out of the way, whatsoever letteth you
in this blessed Merchandize, <hi>which is better than the Merchandize
of Silver, and the gain thereof than fine Gold,</hi> Prov. 3. 14. Let your
Merchandize be <hi>HOLINESS TO THE LORD</hi> Isa. 23. 18. here:
so in the ballancing of your Accompt at the last day, you shall be clear
out of debt with your heavenly Creditor, and receive a full and final
discharge, together with a full remuneration of eternal happiness to
you, and all carefull Accomptants with him, wayters and Preparers
for him.</p>
            <p>Which negotiation and traffiquing with Heaven (O sedulous and
rich Merchant) is set forth under many other Notions in Scripture.
Amongst which is that of Watching for the Masters coming. What
it is; How this watch is to be set and kept, Motives to it, and the
Reward of it, is as laid forth in the ensuing Sermon, in which your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious
friend (being dead) yet speaketh.</p>
            <p>Many be the Epistles, (which whilst he lived) he wrote to you by my
<pb facs="tcp:55690:4"/>
hand. Accept I beseech you of my appearing his <hi>Amanuenlis</hi> once more.
And keep this by you. First, as a Remembrance of him that honoured
you, and was faithfull and diligent to serve you in your employments
in our Countrey. And Second, as a Funeral Ribband for your soul to
wear, which may daily minde you of your mortal condition, and stir
you up to get such necessaries and preparatives to go hence, that when)
you shall be no more seen on earth, you may enjoy the beatifical vision
of our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in Heaven. So prayeth;</p>

may say every one of them, I am a Citizen of no mean City. I am
a <hi>King</hi> of no mean Kingdom. I am a servant of the great God of
heaven. He will not set us to gather stubble as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to work of
our selves, but he will enable us to work; where we fail, he will
pardon; and when we do his works by his own help, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
Crown his own works in us; and when our enemies oppress<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

God so highly honoureth his people? <hi>Seemeth it a small thing</hi>

it to you a small thing to be the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sauls</hi> Sons by grace, to be

               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> It is the office of every Christian, constantly to watch and
wait for the Lords coming. All wakers are not watchers. There is a
natural waking, and there is a spiritual waking, and so there is of
watching. Waking natural is when the obstructions of the spirits
being dissolved, the spirits return into the senses (for sleep is the
binding up of the senses) when upon the discessation of vapours
(that stopped the senses before) there is a return of the spirit into
the senses; which may be done by some call, some motion, some
stirring up of the body: or by some great shining light.</p>
               <p>In a spiritual sense. Worldly thoughts, and fleshly thoughts, as
foggy vapours, do obstruct the workings of Gods spirit, and cause
the soul to sleep in sin. God calleth by his word, stirs up good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his spirit, sends a proclamation by his messengers, scatters,
a light, either the light, the delightsome light of his mercies, or the
startling terrifying light of his judgements, or the light of divine
truth, and awakens these sleepers. And this waking is a preparative
to waching, as watching is a I reparation for the Masters Advent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Watching natural:</hi> is when upon waking we have our senses exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and are intent and carefully look about us to prevent some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
or inconvenience, which careless security would let in upon us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spiritual watching</hi> (of which in the Text) is when upon our
waking, our souls are exercised, the faculties and powers bent and
intent in the work which God hath set us to do, when we do quicken,
actuate and raise up our graces, avoiding of evil, preparing for God,
to prevent that hurt and dammage which a sleepy State brings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
men: Here 'tis spoken of the vigils of the soul, yet the body
may so far be taken in, as it is an Instrument of the soul in the
action.</p>
               <p>In the Primitive times they had their vigils, because of present
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55690:6"/>
persecution, or when they had some great business in hand, to seek
the Lord for direction or for preparation to the Sacrament. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of time it fell into superstition, and the Papists rise up to their
blinde devotions at certain hours of the night, which they call ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
hours. But how are we fallen from the zeal and piety of
the primitive times?—<hi>O quantum mutatus ab illo</hi>—<hi>Pectore.</hi>
O where is the heart, and life, and spirit, the vivacity, the
constancy and continuance in the service of God? Sathans watch
and play is more used than our <hi>Saviours</hi> watch and pray? But to the
doctrine.</p>
               <p>It is the office of every Christian to keep a constant and continual
watch over his soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because we are in danger of sin, and in danger by sin.
In danger of sin, besides many other sins; of that deadness and
drowsiness and heaviness of spirit which hangs upon the best. In
danger by sin, more than I can express, offending of God, the good
Angels, giving advantage to Sathan, exposing our selves to his
darts, grieve the good spirit of God, and put a sting into all other
troubles, yea, sin makes the Blessings of God to be no blessings,
birdlimes, or clips the wings of our prayers, hinders us from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
God for his blessings. Sin is the continual make-bate between
God and us, it separates all good from us, it withdraws our good
God from us. It cankers our gold, blasts our good, embitters our
comforts. It is cunning and will steal into our hears, unless we keep
a Guard and set a diligent watch.</p>
               <p>What is it but the powerfull command of sin (which like the
Devil in the man possessed) casts us sometimes into the fire, where
we burn and boyl with lust; sometimes into the water, where either
we swim with vain delights; or are drowned with the drunken plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of this flattering world? sometimes it blows us up into the
air, with a giddy desire to hunt and hawk after the honours and
preferments of the world, and anon throws us down groveling
on the ground, nailing our affections to this earth with the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
desires of worldly goods. Sin lies daily and hourly at our
doors, at our beds, at our boards, in solitariness, in company, in
the house, in the field, watching to surprize us, therefore we ought
constantly to keep our watch, because of the danger.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because the life of man is a Pilgrimage, and we travel
through our enemies Countrey. This is Sathans Empire, we had need
to watch, when we are in the midst of our enemies, and a traitor,
a bosom-enemy within us. Alas our precious <hi>Iewel</hi> is in a fraile pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
therefore keep thy heart with all diligence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23. In the
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 39. A disguised Prophet cries to the <hi>King,</hi> and said.
<hi>Thy servant went out into the midst of the Battel, and behold a man
turned a side, and brought a man unto me, and said keep this man: if by
any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else you shall
pay a Talent of Silver:</hi> to our purpose, thus. As thou camest into
the midst of the Army, the militant Church, God gave thee a soul
to make thee a man, with this charge, Keep this soul safe, if it be
missing when I come, about the business of the world, or sin, or
Sathan, look to it, thy soul goes for it, and thou hast in all the
world but one soul, if unprepared and unappointed, the Lord will
cashier it, and cast it into hell, whence thou shalt not come forth
till thou hast paid the utmost farthing. It will be in vain for thee to
say as the man of his prisoner <hi>vers. 40. As thy servant was busie here
and there, he was gone:</hi> Lord I had much to do in the world, many
businesses, much to look after, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So my soul was missing when
thou calledst. The Lord will say as the <hi>King</hi> to the delinquent there,
<hi>So shall thy judgement be, thy self hast decided it.</hi>

eternal Glory. According as the price is above all other: so in our
running we should be more quick, more yarr and circumspect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. We are in a Warfare, and souldiers can never promise
to themselves security without a strong and diligent watch; 'tis

waking and watching to take advantage, <hi>&amp; Simon dormis tu?</hi>

their Lord was in an Agony, but <hi>Iudas</hi> slept not: Ah! our husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

have left <hi>Christ</hi> alone to his own cause, saying, as sometimes the

and works shall be weighed in the impartiall scales of the Judge of
heaven and earth, and if they be found thoughts of the Flesh,
words of the world, and works of the Devil, we shall be sent away
from the presence of God. With a <hi>Go ye cursed &amp;c.</hi> Hell will be
our Prison, eternity our shackles, fire and brimstone our Torment,

               <p>Reas. 6. <hi>The daughter of Improvidence, notably set forth,</hi> Luk.
12. 45, 46. If the servant say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his
coming, and shall begin to beat the men-servants and maydens, and to
eat and drink, and to be be drunken. The Lord of that servant will
come in a day he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,
and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with
unbelievers. <hi>Swift destruction is at the heels of promisers to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Peace and Safetie. Yea, then is the time of pouring down
divine vengeance, when men are dissolved to a secure negligence.</hi>
When they shall say Peace and Safetie, then sudden Destruction cometh
upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not
escape, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
               <p>Lastly, we are perpetually under Observation; 1 <hi>Conscience</hi> is an
Observer of us. 2 <hi>Sathan</hi> observes what we speak or do, that he
may accuse us to God and witness against us. 3 <hi>God</hi> observes us,
his eyes behold, <hi>his eye-lids trie the children of men,</hi> Psal. 11. 4. he
knoweth our thoughts, he writes it down in his book, and the
faults can never be blotted out without Repentance. If Conscience
fail (as for a time she may) and lye asleep at the door of our heart,
and neither bark or bite) she will awake at last and tear thee. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
thy self, God will not fail to set thy sins in order before thee,
if now thou do not examin and set them in order before thy face,
judge and condemn them. The case being such, we had need to
keep a perpetual Watch and Ward over our souls.</p>
               <p>These Reasons are so many Motives to this necessarie dutie of a
Christian watchfulness. I shall now give you a few Directions <hi>For,</hi>
and <hi>In</hi> Watching.</p>
               <p>First, Labour to have waking <hi>Considerations.</hi> Consideration is a
help to Watchfulness. 1 Know and believe that there is a God that
eyeth thee, an enemie that observeth thee, and a Conscience that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55690:8"/>
will do his office first or last, that Death is coming, and Judgement
draweth nigh.</p>
               <p>2. Consider the end of this coming into the world, and living
here. What dost thou here <hi>Eliah?</hi> O baptized Christian, what
dost thou sullying thy self amongst the flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> lading
thy self with thick clay, how long? <hi>Hab. 2. 6. how long, O ye sons of
men will ye turn my glory into shame, how long will ye love vanitie
and seek after leasing, Psal.</hi> 4. 2. How long will ye be busied like
Ants about a mole-hill, carrying and recarrying in and out a little
worldly trash, when you think to finish your earthly Fabrick, death
(as a wild Beast) with one dash of his foot spoils all, and disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
it and you. <hi>The time past may suffice us to have wrought the
will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of
wine, Revellings, banquetings, and abominable Idolatries. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 3.
It is enough, I, too too much, that you have revelled out the third
of your life to waste, hitherto; Oh spend and end the little remnant
of time wholy and holy in Gods service, working out your salvation
with fear and trembling. Were your Heaven-born souls given you
to stop to this earths drudgery? Your eagle minds to resort to the
carrion of this world? was your golden time given you to gather
dross? your noble affections to run in the dirty channels of this
world? Rather was not your chief end to glorifie God and enjoy
him? How sutable have been your Actions to this chief end? have
they been for your good and the salvation of your souls? consider
this seriously.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Have this waking consideration. Is not God present?</hi> Doth not
he observe all my ways and count all my steps? if I have walked with
vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit <hi>Job.</hi> 31. 4. 5. will not God
finde it out? saies <hi>Joseph,</hi> how can I do this great wickedness, and
sin against God, in whose presence I am, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 9. The eyes of the
Lord run to and fro through the whole Earth, to shew himself strong
in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect towards him 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 9.
He neither slumbereth nor sleepeth, His eyes see into the dark thoughts
of our heart, all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with
whom we have to do <hi>Heb. 4. 13. This should make us watch over
our secret sins. What if thou hadst no body to accuse thee? Thou
hast a conscience, and a God that sees thee. When thou art in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55690:9"/>
think thou art in the presence of God, who is a judge. S.</hi> Paul
<hi>was kept in a watchfull condition upon this consideration.</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the terrours of the Lord, we perswade men. 2 Cor. 5. 11. <hi>It will
be a terrible day. And when</hi> Solomon <hi>would startle young men,
he minds them of the day of Judgement.</hi> But know that for all these
things thou must come to judgement, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 9.</p>
               <p>4. The fearfull condition to be found in an estare wherein we
are not fit to dye. Take heed of promising thy self pleasure, or jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
tomorrow; It may be the day that God will strike thee. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias</hi>
and <hi>Saphira</hi> were stricken suddenly; and he who hath stricken
thy neighbour (as many now are smitten by death suddenly) what
if he smite thee? It may befall thee when thou goest about sinfull and
unwarrantable courses (take heed) it may be the time when God calls
for thy soul. Add hereunto that our l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fe is short and uncertain, and
that which at any time may, why not now? And if we wait all our
daies, and every hour, it will not be long, and it is for eternity. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
depends upon this moment of time.</p>
               <p>5. Labor for such inward dispositions as may dispose us to watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness.
Two affections, when they are raised, will much help us,
<hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Love. 1. Fear.</hi> When <hi>Iacob</hi> was afraid of his Brother
<hi>Esau,</hi> he spent the night before in prayer. <hi>Blessed is the man that
feareth always,</hi> Prov. 28. 14. Blessed is the man that standeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
in aw of God, and is afraid to offend him at any time. So
Prov. 23. 17. <hi>Be thou in the fear of God all the day long.</hi> What fear
is that? of <hi>Iealousie</hi> and <hi>Reverence.</hi> There is great use of this fear,
It is the souls best Scout-master, and will give report to the soul of
her enemies Approches. Fear stirs up care, care rowseth duty, and
performance of duty keeps us from surprizal. It is the Athiesm of
the times to stand in aw of nothing: but he who hath the fear of
<hi>Iealousie</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> is fit for all things.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Love,</hi> It is a sweet affection, and keeps the soul watchfull over
any thing that may displease the person whom we love. It is also
full of Invention to give content to the person loved, we never sin
till the soul is betraied and drawn away from these two, <hi>Fear</hi> and
<hi>Love:</hi> and we have the soul never in better tune than when thus
qualified. These are Royal supports of a Christians <hi>Arms.</hi> His <hi>Field</hi>
is <hi>sincerity,</hi> charged with the deeds of <hi>Piety,</hi> shall be accomplished
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55690:9"/>
with a <hi>Crest of Glory.</hi> The supporters are <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> with this
Motto, <hi>My soul watcheth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wind up the strings of your affections every day, else they will
be down, wind them up with waking considerations, else they
will down to these present things. Finde out what sin thou art na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
prone to. Be wise and foresee. Know your selves both in
good and evil, wherein thou art prone to be overtaken, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and what hath done thee good and use it again. No creature
will be taken in a snare, if he see it, and the Medicine that cured the
sick one, he will use it again.</p>
               <p>Take all advantages to do good, slip no opportunity, no
Sabbaoth, no Sermon, for why, thou seest some alive and well to
day are dead to morrow. When we have advantages to any thing,
study to improve them and turn them to Gods glory. This
is a special exercise of watching. It will grieve you one day, when
you shall see, that at such a time, ye lost such an opportunity, and
at such a time, omitted such a duty. Consider this is your seed-time.
<hi>If ye sow to the flesh, ye shall of the flesh reap corruption, but he that
soweth to the Spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting,</hi> Gal. 6. 8.
will ye have a harvest of Glory and no seed-time of graces. Every
company you keep, make them better, or your self better by
them: gain some spiritual encrease by them, or they by you. Labor
to know how to judge every thing in its due worth, and so as it
deserves affect it, least you put good for evil, and evil for good.</p>
               <p>To know God in his greatness, <hi>Christ</hi> in his goodness, virtue
in its dignity, sin in its dangers, death in its certainty, yet times
uncertainty, will be a means to stir thee up to watchfullness. Let
the joyes of Heaven ravish thee, the Torments of hell scare thee,
the sound of the last trumpet (<hi>Arise ye dead and come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>)
sound and resound always in thine ears.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Mors tua, Mors Christi, fraus Munda Gloria coeli</l>

               </q>
               <p>Labour to finde out what hinders from doing good, whether
too much business and pudder about the things of this world (as
if we were born to live here everlastingly.) The Scripture sets
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55690:10"/>
Bounds &amp; limits to us: as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31. use this world as not abusing it,
not doting upon these passable and perishable things, as our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Luke 21. 34. Warn us to take heed that we be not overcharged,
as not with surfetting and drunkenness, so not with the cares of this
life.</hi> There is an overcharging of the soul with cares, as the body
with meats or drinks. As the glutton and drunkard are unweildy
to work: so cares eat up the power of the soul, so that they loose
many opportunities to do good and to receive good. Cares choke
the word. But more particularly.</p>
               <p>First in the Morning, begin to wake with God, and give thy
soul a Mornings-draught steept in the Meditation of God his mercy
and preservation, before the World or the Flesh thrust in. Bethink
of all that may befall thee that day, of all the dangers, of all the
troubles, what Armor to encounter, surely ye have need to buckle
on your Armor with Patience, to go up and down (amongst men,
shall I say?) hissing Serpents of envy, poisonous Adders of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness,
and fiery flying Scorpions of slandering their neighbours,
and we must fight (as S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>with Beasts after the manner of men:</hi>
You cannot go safe amongst these malevolent spirits without your
coat of Male, girded on about you by prayer. Where the enemy
once entered, barracado up that passage more stronngly as souldiers
do, where the enemy hath broken in, or the wall is weak. Take
Provisions for thy journey or undertakings, that ye may be able to
encounter whatsoever Accidents befall you. Let God have the first
fruits of the day, the firstlings of your hearts. Begin the day with
prayers, and it will sweeten all your actions of the day with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and all occurrences thus: <hi>I commended my self</hi> to God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and have set upon the day with this Resolution, to do nothing
that may offend God or a good conscience, regarding no Iniquity
in my heart but to pass the day in the works of my calling under
the shadow of the Almighty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards, in the day let us do nothing wherein we conceive God

it. If men would do so, what would become of their lying, swearing, &amp;
forswearing cheating, couzning, and underminings? drinkings, lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and vanities for why? can they pray to God for a Blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these courses? In the day-time, carry a heavenly minde in earthly
business. No Occurrent fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

heart will draw out something of it for religious use. A good
Christian is an Excellent Chimist, and extracts heavenly things,
and things for heavenly uses out of earthly minerals and materials.
The present Harvest puts him in minde of the day of Judgement,
and the Reapers, of the Angels. When he plows the ground he
thinks upon the fallow ground of his heart how it needs turning
and ripping up; when he weaves, or sees the Weavers shuttle, he
meditates upon the shortness of mans life, now at this end, but
presently at an end, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus he reasons with himself, God hath
set me in this place for a little time, and here I must work in this

10. 1. So distracted thoughts, worldly mindedness, and earthly
talke and business upon the Lords day, will cause all thy prayers
and services to stink in the nostrils of God. And if thou steal away
of his time, to use it about thine own occasions, thou art a Thief
also to thy self, and to thine own profit. For therefore God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
thee to keep the Sabbaoth that he might bless thee, that by
thy holy observation of the day, and carefull performance of the
duties of the day, he might convay over to thee his blessings, for
such a servant he blesseth, and he shall be blessed, which is the third

               <p>My Auditours are of three sorts, either Morners of our deceased
Brother, or Rejoycers at his death, or men indifferent, neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with grief or joy at all at his sudden fall, a word to each of
these.</p>
               <p>First, for you Mourners; Wise lamenting the death of her carefull
Husband; Children bemoaning the death of their carefull Father;
Labourers and servants Mourning for the loss of a work-contriving;
labour-rewarding Master; Friends for the lack of their discreet,
advising Friend. To you I say no more but this, look up to your
Husband, Father, Friend, Lord and Master in Heaven. It is the Lord
hath done it, as it is marvellous, so let it be well pleasing in your
eyes. His will is done, subject your wills to his; <hi>We are the Clay,
he is the Potter,</hi> Psal. 64. 8. <hi>shall not the Potter do with his clay as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55690:12"/>
he pleaseth</hi> Rom. 9. 21. We read <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. that the waters of
<hi>Marah</hi> were so bitter, that the people could not drink of them,
then <hi>Moses,</hi> at Gods commandment, cast into them a tree, and
the waters were made sweet. In the bitterness of soul upon the death
of our Brother, God shews you a tree that will turn your bitter
Waters of affliction into sweetness. This tree is <hi>Christ,</hi> Take up
this blessed tree in your hands by Faith (who willingly presents
himself unto you in this your Agony) cast him into your bitter
waters, or cast your self upon him; hide your self in the boughes
and branches of this blessed Tree, till the Lords indignation be past.
For, his anger endureth but a moment, in his favour is life. Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning, <hi>Psal.</hi>
30. 5. you will faint, unless you <hi>believe to see the goodness of the Lord
in the Land of the Living,</hi> Psal. 27. 13.</p>
               <p>To the second sort, that rejoyce because now death hath shut
him up in his Cave, the spirit of God directly meets with you, <hi>Prov.
24. 17, 18. Rejoyce not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thy heart
be glad when he stumbleth. Let the Lord see it, and it displease him, and
he turn away his wrath from him</hi> upon thee. Why shouldest thou run
from thine own watch to fault finde his now? Death found him
not from his calling all the day; at Mid-night, when he pierc'd him
at the heart, dost thou know his Vigils, his Preparations, his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
what they were? If death had come to thee that same
hour, at the second watch, should he have found thee better prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than he was? what art thou that judgest another mans servant,
he standeth or falleth to his own Master. He hath past his day,
thine is to come, If the Lord finde thee in thy swearing, sabbath-breaking,
coveting, wandring out of his ways, not guiding thy life
by his Law unprepared, unappointed, thy doom is set down <hi>Luk. 12.
45.</hi> to <hi>vers.</hi> 48. see the place.</p>
               <p>If there be a third sort of Hearers, Indifferent men, without
affection of the one side or other, nor caring whether he had lived
or dyed, neither partake with the Mourners here, nor with such
as are well pleased at his death; are nothing toutcht or smitten
with this stroak: Besides that they proclaim stupidity, do they not
walk contrary to the command, <hi>weep with them that weep. Be of the
same affection one towards another,</hi> Rom. 12. 15, 16. And shew
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55690:13"/>
themselves Athiestical? It is the Athiesm of these times to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
dread or fear. When God gives one of his houshold-servants
a blow, the rest should fear. This use should every one of us make of
it. If God had so smitten me, in what case had I been? how had
it been with my poor soul? surely I was not prepared as I ought,
ought not I to accept of this acceptable time, this day of salvation,
and to act and exercise my self in all these duties that tend to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
(that is) to watch? <hi>Blessed are those servants,</hi> &amp;c. When
our <hi>Saviour</hi> said to his Disciples, <hi>One of you shall betray me;</hi> Every
one of them (suspicious of himself) questioned him again, <hi>Master
is it I?</hi> so whilst I say one of you (Beloved) shall be the next
that shall dye, it behoves every one of you to question with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<hi>Is it I? Is it I?</hi> what if it should be I? am I prepared to meet
the Lord? is my soul in a watchfull frame and posture? do I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
my sentinel-charge till I be relieved? do <hi>I wait all the days
of mine appointed time untill my chang come?</hi> Job. 14. 14. the same
shall be blessed. For <hi>Blessed are these servants whom the Lord when
he cometh shall finde watching.</hi> Amen.</p>
