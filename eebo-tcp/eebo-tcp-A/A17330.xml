            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT VVORSHIPFVLL, RODVLPH WARCVP ESQVIRE, AND ONE OF THE IVSTICES FOR THE PEACE IN OX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire, W. B. wisheth all prosperity in this life, and true felicity in the life to come.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>IGHT worshipfull, musing with my selfe, where to find a fit patron for these poore Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, you comming to my mind, I resolued to go no further for that matter, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed where to better my selfe. For things spirituall I know you to be of holy <hi>Isaaks</hi> diet, who longed not so much for curious and dainty meate, as for sauory meate. In regard of humane variety, and carnall curiosity, you shall not find them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dainty or rare: yet in regard of the spirituall simplicity, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which I haue endeuoured to shew therein, I hope they will not be altogether vnsauory and distastfull. The doctrines therein handled I presume you will grant to be most necessary for these times. For first, though through the abundant light of the Gospell, many are both al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured and enforced to speake &amp; do more good things, then they could do in the times of darknesse &amp; ignorance: yet considering the subtilty of Sathan, &amp; the corruption of our nature, we haue need to stand vpon our gard: for when he cannot make vs desist from holy actions, yet he will then vse all his art and skill to poyson our affections with the staine of vaineglory. And such is the pronenesse of our corrupt nature to be tainted therewith, that neither touch-wood, or gun-powder are more capable of fire, then our nature is of that poyson of vaineglory &amp; hypocrisie. Againe, sincerity and plaine dealing be had in so little
<pb facs="tcp:25201:3"/>
regard, that of most they be despised, no lesse then the high way to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery and misery: and on the otherside, that <hi>Machiuilean</hi> principle we know is too well maintained, <hi>Qui nescit dissiumulare nescit vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere,</hi> no dissembling no trading. And further, most men, yea euen the better sort, are as vntoward to good workes, as they that do all with the left hand, consulting still with flesh and bloud, and calling their worst affections to counsell. Now seeing these things are so, what could I propound more necessary, then this preseruatiue against the foresayd poyson? and what more needfull to be set foorth, then the commendations of sincerity, taken from her beauty, from her riches, and inestimable reward? And knowing you to be so sincere a friend to sincerity it selfe, and so vnfained an enemy to fained hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, and glosing vaineglory, as you are, what could I present vnto your Worship, more suting with your so Christian and sanctified af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, then these poore Treatises of sincerity and hypocrisie?</p>
            <p>As for the second part of this booke, it containeth (as the title sheweth) An anatomy of the man of <hi>Belial,</hi> and vaine man, who liuing only (as the saying goeth) by the finenesse of their wits) are more vnprofitable then the smoke, and (for any religion or goodnesse to Godward) scarce worth the ground they tread vpon. Yet the onely men with most men now adayes, who being very witty and expert to exalt vanity, are very highly exalted themselues: but it is onely of such as are as vaine as themselues. Here you shall see <hi>Belial</hi> set forth by his names, by his gestures, by his speeches, by his imaginations and by his contentions. By his names you shall at first see his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: By his gestures you shall perceiue his dexterity in teaching, and his facility in learning of euill: By his euill imaginations, and lewd affections, you shall see that his hart is not so secret but it may be and wilbe discouered well inough. But by his delight in contentions, and his maner of contending, you shall easily discerne his turbulent spirite, and soone iudge of what house he commeth: And by his feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doome that is awarded him, it will be no hard matter to perceiue how well he may be spared, and how ill the Church of Christ will thriue where the lawlesse libertine is suffered to harbour. But by all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, who (but the wilfull blind) will not see and confesse, what a
<pb facs="tcp:25201:3"/>
monstrous monster the carnall gospeller, or libertine Protestant is? &amp; what dayes we are now fallen into, wherein so much liberty to euill is so freely on all sides both giuen and taken, to the great endangering of the whole body both of Church and common-wealth? To you these Treatises I do offer in a double respect. First, to testifie my thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mind for so many Christian kindnesses, and religious fauours, which to my great comfort, and encouragement in my poore Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery I haue receiued from your hands. And next, for that by reason of that place which in your countrey you hold, you haue right good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of these things. For you that are to iudge (as long you haue, &amp; daily you do) betweene party and party, betweene plea and plea, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but be acquainted with all sorts of men: who in their turnes haue all of them played and do daily play their parts before you: yet as <hi>Salamon</hi> (by the wisedome of God which was with him that he might gouerne well) could discerne the true mother from the false: so can you by the same wisedome easily discerne a counterfeit from one of a sincere and simple hart, though with <hi>Ieroboams</hi> wife he disguise himselfe neuer so much. And as all men did then feare and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uerence that renowned king, because they saw the Lord with him to do iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and iudgement: so I know nothing that hath so much aduanced, your name and credite in your countrey, and caused the sweete sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour thereof to spread it selfe like a precious ointment, both farre and neare, and round about you, but that all men do euidently see (besides your loue of learning, and trauell for the same) that God is with you to do iustice and iudgement, to releeue the poore and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed, to encourage the vertuous and well disposed: but especially to heale the breaches of the common-wealth, and to bind those fast together with the bond of godly vnity, which by vnkind iarres and contentions haue bene likely for euer to haue bene disioyned, distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and dismembred in mind and affection the one from the other. <hi>Blessed are the peace makers,</hi> saith our blessed Sauior &amp; Prince of peace. And who doth not see how abundantly God hath blessed you? whose heart he hath enclined, and whose trauels he hath imployed, and still doth employ (for the greatest part of your time) in so blessed a worke? Without all suspition of flattery be it spoken, vnto the praise
<pb facs="tcp:25201:4"/>
of God, and the comfort of your soule in the day of the Lord: your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse to do good vnto all, your Zeale in religion, your felicity in composing of controuersies, in planting of peace, and in quenching of strifes, and that to the contentment of all parties, doth not a little reioyce the harts of all that are round about you, and shall minister no small occasion to their posterity that is to come, to commend the same to the euerlasting praise of God, and your neuer dying fame. It was <hi>Pauls</hi> reioycing, that the care of all the Churches being layd v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, yet he through Gods power fainted not vnder his burthen. And surely you may well say, the care both of Church and common-wealth about you lyeth vpon you: but yet God doth enable you to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo that care. Yea, from what parts almost do they not repaire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you (as vnto the common Phisition of the common-wealthes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, and the stay of the countrey, and most blessed instrument of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans peace and welfare, when any of their matters are otherwise like to languish and fall to the ground? When it was first reported that you should be employed in Embassage for her Maiesty into <hi>France,</hi> although it could not be denied but that your employment that way might, yea and in all likelihoods would (through the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God) haue proued very beneficiall to the Church of God in both nations, yet it grew very disputable among some, whether your presence there or at home in your owne countrey, had bene the more necessarie. And so fast hath God vnited vnto you the harts &amp; affections of the poore commons about you: yea and of all sorts, that as vnwillingly they would haue parted with you, if the choyce had bene in them, as the young infant forbeareth the presence of the kind and tender mother. I speake not this to the preiudice of any: neither is there any such cause, for thankes be to God you cannot in this respect say (as sometime <hi>Eliah</hi> sayd of himselfe) that the Lord hath left you alone: but I speake it to your comfort and encouragement, wheresoeuer you shall be employed, whether in forren businesse or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall affaires. For though you cannot want your crosses more then other of Gods deare children, who both abroad and at home, do by daily experience find that <hi>virtutis est inuidia comes,</hi> and that they
<pb facs="tcp:25201:4"/>
are enuied of the malignant no lesse for their vertues, then <hi>Iacob</hi> was hated of <hi>Esaw</hi> because of the blessing, yet cannot that gracious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Gods louing countenance, &amp; fauourable blessing, which haue hitherto continually seconded al your godly indeuours, but be <hi>tanqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> arrha,</hi> as an vndoubted pledge and testimony vnto you, that whither soeuer you shall be lawfully called foorth, to do him seruice in seruing your Prince and countrey, he will not leaue you to your selfe, nor to the malice of the enuious: but will on the contrary stand by you and hedge you in with grace and mercy, wherewith you shall be defended as with a shield. And as he hath promised to honour those that honor him, so shall you assuredly find for euer, as you haue hitherto done, the truth of that promise in due time performed vnto you. Therefore go on still like your selfe, as a faithfull friend to truth and sincerity, and an vnfained enemy to the man of <hi>Belial,</hi> and vaine man, whose counterfeit dealings shall vanish as the smoke against the wind: and the God of heauen prosper you in your goings. And now, no whit doubting of your willingnesse to peruse these Treatises, nor of your readinesse to construe all things in the best part, and to make your best vse of them, to the glory of God, the good of his Church, the comfort of your soule, and benefit of your countrey: I humbly commend both your selfe, and them to the blessing of God. From my study this 8. of February.</p>

In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer he confuteth the doctrine of the Scribes and Pharisees, and in these two he noteth and condemneth their life and hypocrisie. From which obseruation two things are to be noted. First, that aboue all things the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Church must be purged from false doctrine. For if the doctrine be not whole and sound, it cannot be that the life should be ordered aright, for the doctrine of the Church is the rule of mens liues, if the rule be crooked, then must mens liues be crooked also. Secondly, if the doctrine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be refined and throughly purged, yet is it not sufficient to the true study of righteousnesse, vnlesse also the life be rightly instituted, and purged too, and especially from hypocrisie. For if the Carpenter haue neuer so straight a rule, yet if he weare it alwayes at his backe, and do not thereby square out his worke, the building wil go but crookedly forward. And in like manner, if Christian builders haue neuer so good Preachers amongst them, and the doctrine that is taught by them neuer so sound, yet if they cast the word behind them, and hate to be reformed by the same, what else are they like vnto, but vnto the foolish Carpenter, that put his rule at
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:25201:6"/>
his backe, and worketh altogether at aduenture, to the spoiling of the whole building, and vndoing of himselfe, with shame inough of all that behold him?</p>
                  <q>Take heede, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>The partes of this admonition are two, negatiue, and affirmatiue. In the first part we are admonished what to auoide in giuing of our almes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the second part we are shewed what to do. Concerning the thing that is to be auoided note we three things. First what it is. Secondly, how to auoide it. Thirdly, the reason why it must be auoided. For the first, the thing that is to be shunned in giuing of almes is vaineglory, and that hath two parts. First, inward desire of the same. Next an outward shew of it. The first is the roote, the second is the leaues and the branches. The first is the mother, the second is the daughter. The first is the poyson, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the signe thereof, or the breaking out: The first is the fountaine, the second is the streame. The first is the coale, the second is the flame. The first is the cause, the second is the effect of the same. The first is the theefe, the second is his accessary. The first robbeth God of his honour, the second doth publish it. Therefore both the first and the second be damnable: neither the first nor the second are sinnes veniall, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists say, but both the first and the second, the mother and the daughter, without faith and repentance are sinnes eternally mortall. And therefore our Sauiour Christ saith here. <hi>Take heede of them:</hi> as if they were some dangerous enemies to the soule.</p>
                  <p>The first thing therefore to be taken heed of, is all inward desire of vaineglory, or worldly praise, and that is forbidden in the first verse, where our Sauiour saith, <hi>Giue not to be seene of men,</hi> that is: with an intent, purpose, or desire that men should see thee and commend thee for it.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16.</note> Publicke giuing is not forbidden, for Christ saith, <hi>Let your lights shine before men, that they may see, &amp;c.</hi> But vaineglorious giuing in publicke is forbidden, and therefore he doth not simply say, <hi>Do not your almes before men,</hi> but addeth, <hi>to be seene of them,</hi> condemning that end, which is first in heart though last in act. So in Math. 5.16. he saith not, <hi>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie you,</hi> but <hi>that they seeing your good workes may glorifie God, your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father,</hi> who worketh both the will and the deed. So then we see that it is not simply euill to do good workes in the view of men, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is good so to do, to glorifie God, and encourage others. God is much glorified, when his children walke like their father, being mercifull as their heauenly father is mercifull, though not in that degree of mercie, yet in mercy of the like nature, heauenly, bountifull, free, and harmelesse.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:25201:6"/>
By the death of Christ he was knowne to be the naturall sonne of God, and by the good life of Christians aswell as by their death, it may be knowne that they are the adopted sonnes of God. For when Christ died there was a strange alteration of nature, the earth did shake, the powers of heauen lost their power, the graues opened, the dead arose; there was darknesse vpon the face of the earth, as if day had bene turne into night, which when men saw they confessed: yea the very enemies of Christ himselfe confessed to the glorie of the diuine power, saying, doubtlesse this was the sonne of God. So when Christians dye to the world and liue vnto God, when they by the power of Gods spirit, do crucifie sinne and quicken righteousnesse, there is also a great alteration in nature, their nature is refined by grace, their night is turned into day, and their day into night, their present shame is their glorie, and their former glory is their shame, their dead affections are raised vp, the deuowring graues of their hard harts being opened, and now they speake, and do, and studie otherwise then they did, and not like other men. In a word as Christs death was not like other mens death, so Christians liues are not like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens liues. Christs funerals were solemnized by the Sunne and the Moone, by the powers of heauen, by the graues and the dead, by the earth and the stones, and all the insensible creatures, whereof in their kind some blushed, some trembled, some fainted, and all mourned for the death of their Lord, and feared (seeing such things happen to their Soueraigne) an vtter dissolution of themselues and all nature. These things were not looked for in the world, nor regarded at worldly mens funerals, yea such as beseeme not the Princes of the nations: so Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans liues and deaths too are solemnized and graced with the ornaments of the spirit, and the ioy of heauenly Angels, with the fruites of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, &amp; the applause of the godly, things not regarded of the wicked, nor beseeming the helhounds of this world: But doubtlesse when men see these lights, they must needes glorifie God, and say God hath done great things for them, and when the wicked themselues see such an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in them as they may stand a farre off, and wonder at, but neuer attaine vnto, they must be enforced spite of their hearts to giue God the glorie, as <hi>Achan</hi> did, saying, this is the truth, and so it was, and as the Iewes did, doubtlesse these were good men, the sonnes and daughters of God. A man may by their behauiour know of whose bringing vp they were, by their habite and spirituall attire, a man may discerne them to be the Citizens of the heauenly Ierusalem. Blessed be God, in so much as they must go a little farther with the wicked in the book of Wisedome: and say, we are fooles and they are wise, howsoeuer we counted their life
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:25201:7"/>
madnesse before: we are they that played the madmen, and haue wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried our selues in the wayes of vnrighteousnesse. And with <hi>Balam: Oh that we might dye the death of the righteous, and that our last end might be like vnto theirs.</hi> And thus we see how for the glorifying of God in this life, it is necessary for Christians to exercise workes of mercy, as giuing of almes, and other good workes appointed of God in his word, <hi>euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As it is necessary for the glory of God, so also is it as necessary for the encouragement of the godly. And first of the painefull Pastor, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the word, and then of other Christians. To the godly Minister it is no small comfort, and encouragement, when he shall see the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnder his charge, fruitfull in good workes aswell as in good words. For then shall he see the fruite of his labours, when after his labour he seeth them fruitfull in all maner of good workes: and on the other side, when they receiue the word in vaine, he may feare that he hath laboured in vaine, in vaine I say as touching their conuersion, though not simply in vaine otherwise, for the word of God is neuer preached in vaine, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men beleeue it or no, heare it or no, being euer either a sauour of life to life, or of death vnto death: and comming as the raine which neuer returneth in vaine, but either watereth the earth, or drowneth it: and maketh the ground to bring forth either corne or cockle, sweet flowers or stinking weedes, whereof the one shall be preserued, and the other rooted vp, and cast out vpon the dunghill. The husbandman is encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to follow his husbandry when his vines are fruitfull, and his har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uests plentiful, growing timely, ripening kindly, &amp; yeelding abundantly: and no lesse is Gods husbandman the minister of the word encouraged by the timely growing, kindly ripening, and plentifull yeelding of his charge the Lords husbandrie, after he hath taken paines amongst them. The shepheard loueth not only to heare his flocke bleate like sheepe, and go to the greene pastures, but also when time commeth he expecteth their fleece for his gaine, and their yong for the increase of his flocke. So the shepheards of our soules loue more to see the flocke of Christ yeeld their loue, to the encouragement of their shepheards, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of good workes, for the enlarging of the flocke of Christ, then only to heare them speake and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alke like Christians. It was an incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Paule to trauell in birth among the Galathians, when he was in hope to bring them foorth vnto Christ, or to beger Christ in their hearts. What had that blessed Apostle to boast of when he came at Macedonia, but of the zeale of the Corinthians? and when he came at Achaia, what ioy was it vnto him to report of the forwardnesse and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25201:7"/>
of the Macedonian Christians?<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.</note> Euen so, no lesse comfort is it to godly Ministers still in places abroad to commend the zeale, and loue, and knowledge, and patience, and godlinesse, and charity of their people at home: and the contrarie to all these is as great a crosse and discouragement, as the former is ioyfull, comfortable and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</p>
                  <p>As the minister of Christ is encouraged by the lights, that is, the good workes of Christians shining before men, so are other Christians also no lesse confirmed, and drawne forward to do the like. So the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1, 2.</note> was a spur to the Macedonians, and Achaians, yea their zeale (saith the Apostle) prouoked many to be zealous. <hi>Iron sharpneth yron</hi> (sayth <hi>Salomon</hi>) so the face of a friend sharpneth a friend,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 27.17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> that is, one man quickneth another. One peece of wood being set on fire, and layed to another, doth also kindle the other: so one zealous Christian maketh other zealous, which were cold before. Examples are very forcible either to good or euill, for in the affections of men there is a certaine vnity and vnited league, so that when one is moued, another by the same is moued: like a chaine of many linkes one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in another, draw one and draw all: or like a clocke which hath many wheeles, which all stand still, vntill one be set a worke; but if one be set a going, that will moue his fellow, and his fellow will moue his next fellow, and so one will moue another, the greater the lesser, and the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser in some place the greater, the lower the higher, vntill at the last the clocke sound, and tell all the world thereof. And this spirituall mouing of affection by the like affection, and drawing on of one acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by another like, which the same affection embraceth, is effected by vertue of the communion of Saints, which we rather beleeue then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse. Thus <hi>Nathaniel</hi> is drawne by <hi>Philip</hi> to see Christ, and <hi>Philip</hi> is drawne by <hi>Simon Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.43.</note> and <hi>Simon</hi> by his brother <hi>Andrew.</hi> Thus the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> being moued by Christ, moueth the best of her neighbours to come out and see Christ. And herein appeareth the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Spirit, which the Apostle speaketh of Ephes. 4.3. and willeth Christians to hold and maintaine with the bond of peace: for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is alwayes one and the same, in all men, in all ages, and at all times; and looke what it commendeth to one, it commeth to another, and what it perswadeth one vnto, vnto the same it perswadeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that one man being moued by Gods Spirit to shew workes of mercy, he doth it, his affection liking the same, commendeth them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, that mans affections also being ruled by the same Spirite, cannot chuse but affect and entertaine the same things, and so they go
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:25201:8"/>
from one to another, and all being moued by one and the same spirit. And yet euery one is moued by meanes, and in his seuerall degree and measure, whether it be of faith, or charity, or patience, &amp;c. <hi>Dauid</hi> was a meane to make many zealous with him, in fetching home the Arke, and in other religious actions no doubt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 116 10.</note> but how? he first heareth the word, then he beleeueth, then he speaketh, then others heare him speaking, then they beleeue that which they heare from him, and then they affect that which they beleeue, and then they practise that which they affect, as all men do, whose harts are where their treasure is, and their tongues are occupied about that which their harts are set vpon. To conclude therefore this point, seeing as the doing of good workes before men, maketh much for the glorifying of God, and the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging and drawing on of others, both the godly Minister in his place, seeing some fruite of his labours, and also of other Christians, by the example of their brethren, and by vertue of the spirite, which vniteth their affections, let no man condemne the giuing of almes, or exercise of other workes of charitie before men, but do them rather, but alwaies, <hi>take heede</hi> (as our Sauiour willeth) <hi>that ye giue not your almes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men to be seene of men,</hi> that is, with a desire of praise, and vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie.</p>
                  <p>It is the affection that maketh or marreth all our actions, and is the thing that is more respected with the Lord, then the outward action it selfe be it neuer so good:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Salomon</hi> is witnesse, for he saith: <hi>The Lord pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the spirits,</hi> that is: he considereth with what affections things be done.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor</hi> 9.7.</note> And the Lord loueth not a giuer but a cheerefull giuer. Now the gift is in the hand, but cheerefulnesse lodgeth in the heart, and appeareth in the countenance, which the Lord doth more respect then the gift. No one thing doth so soone, and so much poison all our actions as vaineglory doth, a sinne indeed that waiteth on the best, as it did vpon <hi>S. Paule,</hi> who therefore had a messenger of Sathan sent to buffet him, that is: he had a part vnregenerate to humble him, lest he should be exalted aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, by reason of those reuelations which he had giuen him,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</note> to shew that the best men are giuen to thinke well of themselues.</p>
                  <p>How many do giue and forgiue to be seene of men? How many haue Sermons and Dole at their burials only to be praised of men? How many heare the word, and daily frequent the exercises of religion, onely to be seene of men? How many do lend and giue their word vainegloriously, to be praised of men? How many do build aloft like <hi>Nimrods,</hi> euen till <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> (that is to say, confusion) fall vpon their heads, and onely to get a name amongst men? How many haue euen confessed their faultes and

wept for their sinnes too, euen to be seene of men? How many comming through Cathedrall churches, kneele downe by a pillar as though they prayed, onely to be seene of men? And might not <hi>Osorius</hi> the Papist him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe be as vaineglorious as another, when he wrote a booke, <hi>de contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenda gloria,</hi> in contempt of vaineglorie? As many rufflers in the Church make most glorious Sermons in praise of mortification, and sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when themselues are most vaine. This humour waiteth vpon vs all, and maketh all that we do fruitlesse before God: and therefore in all our actions ought carefully to be prayed against, as we are taught by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour himselfe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 115.</note> saying: <hi>hallowed be thy name Lord</hi>: and with <hi>Dauid: Not vnto vs ô Lord, not vnto vs, but to thy name let the praise be giuen:</hi> for to vs belongeth nothing but shame of faces.</p>
                  <p>This humor of vaineglorie doth steale craftily vpon vs, and doth sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly beguile vs: therefore take heede of it saith Christ. It lurketh in the heart, as dregges in their vessell; if great heede be not taken it will rise vp and marre the wine. It is like a faire spoken theefe at the doore, who if thou take not heed of him, will get in and spoile thee before thou be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. It is like a heard of Players, who with their varietie of bewitching vanities, do cause men willingly to be robbed of them. It is like a moth, that if thou take not heede of it, will breede in thy soules garment and spoile it. It is like leauen, a litle whereof will sower the whole lumpe of dough. It is like <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> who kill when they kisse, and stab when they embrace. In a word, it is a disease that maketh many to die euen laughing, and sometime depriueth them of their wits. Therefore take heede of it, saith Christ, it is a very daungerous euill: take heede you giue not before men to be seene of men.</p>
                  <q>Therefore when thou giuest thine almes, thou shalt not make a trumpet to be blowne before thee, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>As before our Sauiour Christ forbiddeth all inward affectation of worldly praise, so here he condemneth all outward shew of vaineglorie, and all ostentation of a vaineglorious mind in giuing of almes. According to which rule the Apostle saith:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.22.</note> 
                     <hi>Abstaine from all appearance of euill.</hi> Now this was in the Scribes and Pharisees very grosse hypocrisie and palpable.

And doubtlesse it could not be otherwise then an euident note of vaineglorie in them: for what needed they make any proclamation for the matter? had they not their Elders? had they not also their Deacons and ouerseers for the poore, that knew well who had neede of almes? might they not enquire of them? or could they not trust them with their contribution? or if they must needes make it knowne to all the world, when they would deale their dole, had they no other way to publish it by, but by sound of trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet? A bell might haue bene tolled, if they had any, or if they had none, a bill might haue bene set vp, or a messenger might haue bene sent to the houses of the poore: yet none of these waies would serue the turne but a trumpet must be blowne before them, whereby they might be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and admired after a mere stately and princely manner. Whereby likewise they did sufficiently bewray their ambitious humor: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in did they not a little forget themselues: for they knew by the lawe of <hi>Moses</hi> (which they had amongst them, and was read daily in their sina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues) that trumpets were not appointed to any such end or vse, as they put them vnto. For in the tenth of <hi>Numbers,</hi> from the second verse to the ninth, it is euident that trumpets were appointed onely for the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling of the congregation, and for the remouing of the campe: the manner of vsing them is more at large there set foorth, to which place I referre them that are desirous to know the same more fully. Againe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the Scripture, we shall see that they were vsed at the coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Princes, in managing of warre, and solemnizing of Princely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, or businesse of State, and not otherwise: as when <hi>Salomon</hi> was proclaimed King at <hi>Gihon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Kin.</hi> 1.39.</note> they blew the trumpet, and cried, God saue King <hi>Salomon.</hi> So likewise when <hi>Athaliah</hi> was deposed, and <hi>Ioash</hi> made King in her steade:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Ki.</hi> 11.14.</note> it is said, that the King stoode by a pillar in the house
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:25201:9"/>
of God, as the manner was, and all the Princes and trumpetters by the King. And the Apostle commending the vse of knowne tongues in the congregation, and condemning the contrarie, vseth a similitude of the trumpet in warre,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.8.</note> saying: that if the trumpet giue an vncertaine sound, who shall prepare himselfe to battell? By which both they might know, and we also may vnderstand, that the trumpet is an instrument of state, and therefore not to be made common to euery one, nor for euery thing. There be certaine ornaments and dignities, peculiarly belonging to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine persons, and in no wise to be made common vnto all: as Coronets, chaires of State, cloth of State, garters of Honour, Trumpetters, Pages, Chariots, &amp;c. Neither is it fit for euery obscure Gentleman, neither is it seemely for euery, or any base artificer, or man of trade and occupation, to ride in Coches, to haue Pages runne by their horse side, nor to solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the mariages of themselues, or their sons and daughters with sound of trumpet, as if they were some Princes, or persons of State and high calling. It is too intollerable pride, and too manifest a note of Pharisai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ambition: whereby they (which do so) make themselues odious and ridiculous before God and all wise men.

                     <hi>Is not this the Carpenter? and is not that the bramble, that hath so exalted himselfe aboue the trees of the forest?</hi> What would these persons do, and how would they be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, if their place, and authoritie, and birth, and wealth, did answer their humour? <hi>Nimrod</hi> neuer builded so high as they would build: <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salon</hi> had neuer so many men running before him as they would haue: <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> the King of pride, neuer strouted it so in his pallace, as they would strout it. <hi>Diues</hi> was neuer so daintie in his diet, not so costly in his habite, nor so hard-harted to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as they would be: <hi>Iezabel</hi> was neuer such a painted harlot, as some of them would be: <hi>Michol</hi> was neuer such a scoffer at the zeale of <hi>Dauid</hi> her Lord and husband, as they would be: <hi>Herods</hi> mincing minion, and dauncing damsell, did neuer so trip it as they would trippe it. If those daies should come, as they are not farre off, then it were good for <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to looke to his head, and for <hi>Naboth</hi> to his vineyard, and <hi>Dauid</hi> to his kingdome and life too. For who so cruell as the harlot, that is made a mother before her time? and who so loftie and lustie as the bramble, that is exalted beyond his desert? Wo to the children that haue such to their parents, and wo to the tenants
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:25201:10"/>
that should hold of such Landlords, and wo to the subiects where such should dominere, and wo to the sicke where such are Phisitions, whose teeth would teare as fast as their tongue would licke: whose Phisicke must be recompenced with the skinne of their patients. Wo to those souldiers that haue such to their captaines, and to those horses that haue such for their riders. And doubtlesse, great is the abuse on both sides in these degenerate daies, wherein all things are so growne out of order and kind. For as the ploughman in some places, can scarce be knowne from a Gentleman, nor a carter from a Courtier, nor a Gentleman from a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, nor a Milk-maid from a Ladie: so on the other side is it obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as a fault in persons of state and high degree, that they do so much abase themselues (what the cause is God knoweth) and obscure the light and glorie that God hath giuen them, that a man can hardly know them as they go or ride, from persons of farre meaner estate then they be of: <hi>vertitur hoc vitio, &amp;c.</hi> this is a vice which many take to be a vertue. They that weare silke, and costly apparell are in Kings Courts, saith Christ, to shew that Princes, and those which attend vpon Princes, should go otherwise then other men: that is, it is a lawfull for them to take and vse for difference sake, those ornaments and dignities, which God hath annexed vnto their places and degrees: alwaies prouided, that no man goeth beyond his calling and abilitie, but a degree vnder, rather then beyond: and that they take not that honour to themselues, as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> did, which should be giuen to God. Some are so high minded and phantasticall withall, that to be of euery fashion they will borrow of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man: and then they may go one degree further, then that Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher took, who said: <hi>Omnia mea mecum porto</hi>: I carrie all my goods with me: for these may say so: <hi>Omnia mea</hi>: I carrie all my goods about me: which they may easily do, when they haue metamorphosed or turned their great Okes into gay coates, and their farmes into farthings, and their fee simples into simple fees, and their rents into ruffes, and their lands into laces: for that indeede is the way to bring a castle into a capcase: and then they may well play the king and the begger too; the king abroad, and the beggar at home: and alwaies cry: <hi>Omnia nostra no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biscum portamus:</hi> and more too, may another answer. for <hi>Non solum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra sed aliena, non tua sed mea portas</hi>: not only their own but other mens goods too they weare. But when euery bird hath her owne feather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: <hi>monet cornicula risum</hi>: the naked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>hough becometh most ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, being stript of her borrowed colours. It was well with old Father <hi>Latimer</hi> that reuerend Father and religious Bishop, and constant Martyr of Christ, when he could answere the Courtiers in King <hi>Edwards</hi> daies,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:25201:10"/>
that made themselues merrie with his lether coate, and tell them to their faces, that his lether coate had one propertie, which many of their vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet coates had not: and what was that? forsooth it is payed for quoth he, and so are not many of yours, so that I may say I weare none but my owne, so cannot many of you do. Neuer a merchant, nor mercer in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don will pull me by the sleeue, and say: Sir, pay for your coate. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly me thinke such an answer should both comfort those that liue within compasse, and shame many a lustie gallant, and wanton braue Dame in these daies, who when they are gotten into a shoppe booke, are as safe as if they were in a castle: for they will neuer come out vntill they be rent out. Other some through enuie at other mens estate, cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their owne, and therefore play the toade, who thought by swelling to be as bigge as the oxe, but he burst himselfe with his swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling before he could be a quarter so bigge, and so doth the enuious man too.</p>
                  <p>Others are called to high place, and to beare rule with maiestie and authoritie, and of these two, many are content to forget all that, and to become haile fellow with euery base companion at cards, at tables, at dice, and quaffing, and so liue amongst men not like rulers, but like <hi>Aesops</hi> blocke, drowned in the bottome of carnall and base delights, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery frogge to leape vpon, and abuse at his pleasure. These men while they neglect and abuse those good meanes which God hath lent them, to grace and countenance them withall, do liue both in contempt, and in some daunger. For too much fond familiaritie breedeth contempt, as too much statelinesse and seueritie breedeth hatred and disdaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is feare without loue. So an vnarmed man many times em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldneth a theefe, and euen a valiant Gentleman being alone, doth not a litle encourage his enemie to set vpon him, or to lye in waite for him, because he knoweth, that although when he hath his men with him, he is like a threefold cable which cannot easily be broken, yet being alone, he is but as a single cable, or rather as one vntwisted that can easily be twitched in peeces. Therefore to conclude this point: let the abuse on both sides be taken away, and let persons of state vse their stately orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and instruments to the glory of God, and good of their countrie, and themselues. And seeing as such things are appointed to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the superiour and the inferiour, let not any presume to vse any noble or princely ceremonie, for the solemnizing of his meane and base affaires: but remember what our Sauiour saith here in my text: <hi>When thou giuest thine almes, cause not a trumpet to be blowne before thee.</hi> And so much for the first point, namely, the thing that is to be auoyded.</p>

Mariners are both warned of rockes and sandes, and directed rightly and safely into their desired hauen. And surely if we would well consider that we are alwayes in danger of enemies both visible and inuisible, and those not a few but many, not weake but mightie, not simple but subtile, and that our owne false hearts within vs are the readiest to betray vs, we we would easily confesse, that this is a friendly watchword, and no more then is needfull: <hi>Take heed vnto your affections, watch ouer your cogitations, and pray against tentations.</hi> The ground that we go vpon is slipperie as yee, our knees are weake, we are soone downe, and being downe do hardly recouer our selues, and therefore we had neede take heede. Sinne is subtill and impudent, it will easily deceiue vs with false colours, as Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers do with false lights, and it will not be said nay; but with often and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute resisting the Diuell is driuen away. I am manhood saith malice, and for thy credit: thou needest not feare me. I am good husbandry saith Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, and for thy profite, thou needest not feare me; I am good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship saith Prophanenesse and Filthinesse, and for thy pleasure: thou needest not feare me. I am handsome cleanelinesse saith Pride, and will make thee to be admired: thou needest not feare me, <hi>Gloria calcar habet</hi> saith Vaineglorie, glorie and praise is a spurre to encourage men in well doing: true saith another of the same humour, <hi>Virtus laudata crescit,</hi> and the maisters <hi>euge</hi> is the seruants <hi>auge</hi> in vertue and good seruice, the praise of vertue is the increase of vertue. And this is true, but now a friend with a friendly caueat were very necessarie, and <hi>Take heede</hi> will serue for all if they be wise. Take heede, ô man, that thy manhood be not malice, that thy good husbandry be not greedy couetousnesse, that thy goodfel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship be not beastlinesse, that thy vnitie be not conspiracie, that thy loue be not wanton lust, that thy cleanelinesse be not Sodomiticall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, that thy glorious spurres of vaineglorie and praise, be not poisoned by thy desiring of them. Oh master how shall we know these things, wilt thou say? I can giue thee no better counsell then God hath giuen thee, &amp; that is <hi>Take heede.</hi> But how shall I take heede? Surely by watching and praying. Alas sir, three things hinder my watching, and that is drowsines, and darknesse, and fearefulnesse: I would watch saith one, but sleepe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth me: and I would watch saith another, but darknesse troubleth me, that is, I am an ignorant simple man, not knowing the right way from the wrong, nor vice from vertue, nor a subiect from a rebell, nor truth from errour. And I would watch saith another, but I see the enemies so many and so terrible, that I dare not set my selfe against them, I will put out my light, that I may see no more such fearefull sights, and lay downe my weapon, and let them do as they will, and fall asleepe in my sinne, as

men do in their beds when it thundreth: but to be safe against all daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they will first blesse themselues, and say their Auie Marie, and so commit themselues to the weather. This is good plausible counsell to flesh and bloud, that sauoureth any thing, sauing the things of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: but how lothsome soeuer you take it to be, for certaine it is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wholesome: therefore my brethren let it alone, and take better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: and that is this. If you be in darknes and ignorance, get you lights both within you and without you, and that good store too. For the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie cannot abide the light, but will put out as many as he can come handsomely by: these lights that thou must set vp without thee, must be first the holy word of God diligently read, orderly preached, and duly frequented: that shall be a lanterne vnto thy feete, and a light vnto thy pathes: that shall descrie vnto thee the right way that thou must walke in: by that thou shalt discouer all false and counterfeit colours: and by that touchstone, thou shalt trie all drosse from gold. Hauing that as the great Sunne-light of the Church, neglect not to reade if thou canst, or at least to heare the good workes and writings of godly and learned men: especially haue conference with them, both soberly, and with a holy purpose to be reformed by them: for they are lights too, not to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted nor despised, no more then the Moone is, whose light is nothing in comparison of the Sunne light, and is altogether borrowed too of the Sunne: but it is borrowed for thy good. With these lights set vp also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy eyes, the good works and godly examples of humilitie, &amp; of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and of lowlinesse, and of zealousnesse, and of constancie, and of sinceritie, and of loue, and of charitie, and of true deuotion, which thou hast seene or heard of in the Saints and holy men, and women of God: for euen they are lights, and comfortable lights too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Christians meane to keepe Christs watch ouer their hearts and affections. But all these are to no purpose to thee, except thou haue one light within thee, as well as without thee. When God hath bestowed these outward lights vpon thee, then pray thou for the gift of the holy Ghost, that he being in thy heart, may open thy eyes of vnderstanding and iudgement, to see the wonderfull things of Gods lawe: as he opened the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> when <hi>Paule</hi> preached: and also to frame thy will and affections to take pleasure and delight in the Saints and their examples, who excelled in vertue vpon earth: and so much for thee that sittest in darknesse. Now to those that haue lights, that is, preaching inough, and good bookes i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and good knowledge inough, and can discourse of good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples inough, but are oppressed with sleepe, and a spirit of deadnesse and drowsinesse: that is, are carelesse of that they heare, and forgetfull of that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:25201:12"/>
they both heare and reade, and make no conscience of any thing lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then it is rung into their eares. I cannot tell well what to say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: to discourage them I am loath, and to incourage them, as they are I am afraid, but let vs see: is there no way to make them vigilant? that they may take heed of the enemy when he commeth? verily yes. First, they must desire their fellowes and neighbours to call vpon them by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and awaken them: as men do that meane to ride a iourney together: then if they fall asleepe againe, they must cause the watchmen of the streetes, that is their publicke teachers and pastours to smite them and pinch them, euen with speciall application of the doctrine vnto their owne hearts and consciences: then they must resolue to be patient and contented that they be often and loud so called vpon, as Christ did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten call vpon his Disciples when they were heauy: and therefore often and loud, because they were heauy. To which ende the congregation should not be pestred with an ignorant nor a cold teacher, nor a straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Sermon man, that either cannot or will not, or will but coldly, and seldomly rouze vp mens drowsie consciences, but such as shall be instant in season and out of season, that is: vppon all occasions, to lift vp their voices like trumpets, and to tell the Lords people of their sinnes, both in generall, and also in particular. And lastly, they must take heede of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking such things as are like sleepy and drowsie meates: that is, that they delight not in such carnall company, and fleshly pleasures, as will in time both breed a consumption of Gods graces in them, and also harden, and besot them so in their sins, that in time they may grow past all feeling, for <hi>consuetudo peccandi</hi> (saith <hi>Augustine</hi>) <hi>tollit sensum peccati:</hi> the custome of sinne taketh away the feeling of sinne.</p>
                  <p>Now for those that are discouraged through fearfulnesse of their owne abilitie, and affrighted with the fearfull sights of their enemies, like <hi>Elisha</hi> his seruant at the sight of the Aramites: there be of two sorts, which haue need of good instruction, and great incouragement. The first sort are dismayed at that which is past; the second is affraid of things to come. The first are such as haue bene in the battell, and haue beene foiled, and ouermatched with rebellious thoughts, and vnsanctified affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: and these like a weake porter at a gate, hauing opened the doore to some one whom he had a mind vnto, were not onely so troubled by that one sinne of theirs, whom they meant not to keepe alwayes, that they could not tell how to be rid of him any more; but also by that same one false and fained friend haue bene betrayed, in letting in a presse of many other sinnes, which they neuer thought of, to the spoiling of all that was within: which they thought to keepe out, but finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:25201:13"/>
ouermatched with the preasse without, and wanting strength within, haue euen in a kind of desperate manner sit downe, and let all alone, to come in and do what they will: wishing when it is too late as they imagine, that in time they had taken heede of that one false and deceitfull affection which they entertained. To these men a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, <hi>obstate principijs,</hi> withstand the beginnings: for that the fray is already begunne, and they almost, nay altogether put to the worse. But the best counsell for such a one is, <hi>redime te captum quam queas minimo,</hi> get out of their hands so soone as thou canst: and as Christ said to the woman taken in adulterie, go and sinne no more, least a worse thing happen vnto thee: that is, take better heede another time. But how shall I get out of their hands? wilt thou say: verily of thy selfe a thing impossible: thou must craue helpe of a stronger then thy selfe, or then the enemie that hath thee in possession, and that is Iesus Christ, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Lion of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> who hath alreadie dispossessed the strong man of his hold, and purchased the possession to thy vse: if thou sue to him by earnest prayer, and embrace him by a holy faith, thou shalt recouer thy hold againe. And without these two weapons, it is not possible for thee, by all thy heede taking to auoide the sleights of Sathan. And what though thou carrie a scarre, and weare some shakles of the vnregenerate part: yet be content, and thanke God for thy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie by Christ. <hi>Iacob</hi> could not get the blessing without wrestling, and in wrestling he was smitten, and being smitten, he halted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued lame euer after: and thus was it with Israel, that is he that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed with God. And so shall it be with euery true Israelite and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christ, while the world standeth. But what of all that? Gods power is made manifest in the weakenesse of his children: and so thou may in the end preuaile with God for his blessing, be content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue with the blessing of God many a blow, knowing that it is better to go lame and blind into heauen, then otherwise after all ease and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall pleasure to go into hell.</p>
                  <p>Now for those that are afraid to stand vpon their spirituall watch, for feare that they should be foiled and spoiled, they are to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and admonished. Great cause of encouragement they haue, for that if God once open their eyes they shal see more with them, then be against them, as the seruant of <hi>Elisha</hi> did. God himself hath an eye ouer the righteous, and an eare alwaies open to their prayer. Therefore let them watch and feare not, Gods Angels are charged to pitch their tents about them, therefore let them watch and feare not. With their hands they shall hold thee, that thou dash not thy foote against a stone:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:25201:13"/>
therefore watch and feare not. Christ himselfe both God and man, thy Mediator doth plead for thee, doth pray for thee, doth pay for thee, therefore watch and feare not. Christs Ministers without are readie to awaken thee with their siluer trumpets of knowledge and wholesome doctrine, if thou chaunce to fall asleepe, therefore watch and feare not. Gods spirit within thee as Lord deputie for Christ Iesus, is ready to do all his offices for thy sanctification and consolation here, and for thy saluation and glorification hereafter, therefore watch and feare not. As Lord priuie seale he is readie to set vpon thee the stampes of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and marks of mortification, as dying to sinne, liuing to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, with increase of faith, and charitie, and patience, and temperance, &amp;c. These are his markes, by which thou shalt know that thou art sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vp to the day of redemption. As Lord comforter of Gods elect, he shall speake peace vnto thy soule, when thou art cast downe vnder thy sinnes: and say, Sonne be of good comfort, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee. If thou receiue any wounds in thy inward man, whereby thy zeale, and faith, and repentance, &amp;c. may grow into a consumption, yet watch stil and feare not: for he with his quickening vertue, and soueraigne oyle of heauenly assurance shall restore vnto thee againe the ioy of thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, creating in thee still a cleane heart, and renewing a right spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within thee: and therefore keepe thy watch and feare not. And if thou dye, he shall chaunge thy death into life, and thy mortalitie into immortalitie: yea if the boisterous windes of persecution and trouble chaunce to arise, and driue thee either into prison, or to the stake, or to the gallowes, or to banishment, or to the vncomfortable coasts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, reproch, or any other crosse whatsoeuer, he can quench the fire, or stoppe the lions mouthes, or open the prison doores, or raise thee vp new friends, or take away thy hunger, or giue thee strength to beare all if he will, or else make all these as meanes to driue thee soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner into heauen then thou wouldest be: and therefore <hi>take heede, watch and feare not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now thou must take heede, that those things which are spoken for thy consolation and encouragement, do not make thee carelesse and remisse: but be admonished in standing vpon thy watch to take heede of two things. First, that thou post not off thy watching vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. Secondly, that thou driue it not off vnto another time. If thou post off this dutie to other men, thou deceiuest thy selfe: for thou hast no more priuiledge then other men haue, thou art in no lesse dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then other men are, thou art subiect to the same passions, the same corruptions, the same lawes, the same iudgements, that other men are
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:25201:14"/>
subiect vnto: and therefore if other men must take heede and watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their affections, thou must: if some must, all must: and therefore, lest any man should thinke he were more priuiledged then all men, Christ saith,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>That which I say vnto one, I say vnto all watch.</hi> It is a subtiltie of Sathan to make men beleeue that they are exempted, but others are not: that ministers had neede watch ouer their affections, and looke to their waies, but not other men; as in Poperie they say, that Friers, and Monkes, and Nunnes must be more holy, and more deuout then other men. And therefore we say as the disciples said, when they heard Christ say, one should betray him: Is it I? Is this to me? Doth this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine concerne me? Whom doth he meane? As though Christ had said here; but one of you must take heede and watch. And when we see, or heare of any other man that is come to reape the shame of his vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious and ambitious attempts, or of others their lasciuious or coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous attempts, what is our saying? Alas it is pittie, this was for want of heede taking: but yet we take no more heede then they, for we think it concernes vs not. But this is our great folly. Other men that haue fallen before vs, are like ships that are sunke before our eyes, and cry out vnto vs; looke you to your selues, and come not after vs, for if you do, you shall all likewise perish. Let other men be our warnings, and not our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties in these cases. For do man shall go to hell by his deputie, but euery man that hath bene carelesse in his watch, without repentance shall in his owne person die the death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, thou that art to beginne, if thou wilt keepe thy watch wel, post it not off vntill another time, for that is another of the diuels sleights: but remember what Christ saith in the Text: <hi>When thou doest thine alms, take heede.</hi> He doth not say, when thou hast done it: for then it commeth too late, because that action is past with a theeuish affection alreadie. Take heede after the euill is committed, is like, shut the doore when the horse is stolen If thou wilt take the theefe with the manner, thou must watch him euen at the very same instant, when thou art doing of thy good deeds; for then he commeth and doth his feate, and afterward he lurketh in a corner of thy heart, where thou canst not so well find him: and there he both watcheth his time for the like bootie another time, and in the meane time he doth as it were laugh thee to scorne, for that thou wert so foolish, as to let him rob both God of his honour, and thee of his fauour, while he tickled thee, and flattered thee with faire words. As <hi>Nehemiah</hi> that couragious magistrate dealt with the Sabbath-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, so must we deale with our vaineglorius thoughts. He watched them when the Sabbath day came, and then he found them, hauing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:25201:14"/>
found them, he shewed them the law: when that whould not serue, he threatned them: when threatening would not serue, he apprehended them and punished them, and then they came no more vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day. So let vs watch our thoughts and affections, when we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to do, or are in the doing of our good workes, and then we shall find those theeuish and peeuish thoughts, that go about to rob God of his honour: hauing found them, lay the law of God before them: if that will not serue, threaten them with the iudgements of God: if that will not serue, then lay hands (not vpon thy selfe) but vpon them, and take a more straight examination of thy heart where they are, euen before the Lord chiefe Iustice of heauen and earth: then imprison them by restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them of their libertie, and refraining of thy selfe from such obiects, and sights, and places, and company, as would animate them against thee. Hauing thus restrained them, feede them with fasting, as it were with the bread of affliction, and with weeping mingled among, as it were the water of affliction: and then with the spirit of feruent prayer, correct them zealously and continually, and spare them not: accuse them, arraigne them, endite them, and condemne them, and feare them not, but still pray: for prayer is <hi>flagellum diaboli,</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> calleth it, the whippe of the Diuell, which he more feareth, then all the coniurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Poperie, then all holy water, and crossings: yea more then the dog doth the whip: and as when the dogge heareth the bell at the whips end, he runneth out of the house: so when Sathan perceiueth a Christian ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse himselfe to prayer, though it be neuer so weakely and with great striuing: yet he then feareth the rebuke of God, and giueth place. Oh then let vs pray good brethren, euen then, then when we are about to giue almes, or to heare a Sermon, or to preach the word, or to reproue sinne boldly, or to handle doctrine soundly, or to deale roundly with the consciences of men, and in all other spirituall exercises: and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them, but also in our ciuill affaires, in buying and selling, if thou meanest to deale truly, and vse plaine and simple dealing, and to be at a word. Oh then pray also in inuiting thy friends and neighbours to thy house, when thou entertainest the preachers of Gods word at thy table, when thou art troubled in making prouision, and to haue all things cleane and handsome: oh then pray, when thou callest foorth thy children to shew their wit, their aptnesse and towardnes to learne, their profiting in learning, and such like: oh then pray too, when thou cariest thy friend to shew him thy house, and thy roomes, and thy ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and the workes of thine owne hands, and thy fine gardens and walkes, and thy fruitfull Orchards, and thy fatte cattell, and thy great
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:25201:15"/>
dealings, and thy daily expenses, &amp;c. Oh in all these go not without thy whippe of prayer to driue away Sathan, and all his theeuish sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, and vaineglorious cogitations: for euen then when thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest to do all for the best thou shalt be circumuented and deceiued of thy reward before thou be aware, if thou then (euen then I say) do not take heede.</p>
                  <p>Then shalt thou heare the whispering, &amp; feel the tickling of a number of spirituall and inuisible theeues in thy hart. Oh saith one to him that stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deith for a Sermon, when he readeth a trim discourse, or fine simile, that pleaseth himselfe, Oh this will do well to grace thy Sermon withall, oh men will commend thy wit, and thy inuention for this, and thy boldnesse for that, and thy iudgement in that, &amp;c. Oh here is a tickling theefe in the heart: driue him out by prayer: take heed of him: yeeld not vnto him: but pray then and say: Lord none of all these come of my selfe, thou art the giuer of them, they are thy mercies to me ô Lord, I am not able nor worthie my selfe, to carrie such treasures of thy Spirite to thy people: Lord be mercifull vnto me, and sanctifie my heart, that I may seeke thy glorie, and not my owne. Oh hallowed be thy name Lord, hallowed be thy name: not vnto vs, ô Lord, not vnto vs, but to thy name let the praise be giuen. Lord humble my swelling heart with the feeling of my sinne, and my speciall corruptions. Oh Lord driue out these proud though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, these vaine imaginations, these wicked and sacrilegious affections, which go about thus to rob thee of thy honour, both in me the speaker, and in others the hearers: let them not commend thy gifts in me, or in any man, but alwayes to thy praise and glorie. And thus must we be exercised con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, while we liue. In like sort when thou art about to shew thy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and discoursing veine, at the table: pray, for then a theefe within thee will be ready to tell thee that all the company will, and do admire thee for thy gift that way. Yea, or if thou sit still and be silent, and neuer speakest but when thou art required, and then very modestly too, yet then watch and take heede, for euen then commeth a spirituall theefe, &amp; perswadeth thee to thinke with thy selfe, surely men will commend me aswell for my silence and modestie, as such a one for his learning &amp; wit: but where is the Kings Atturney all this while to pleade for Gods right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I meane the spirite of sanctification, to perswade thy soule to giue the glorie to God, who gaue thee those gifts, and that grace with God and man: where is he? Oh therefore then when thou doest these things, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then I say take heede: watch and pray, Hallowed be thy name: Lord rebuke Sathan, quench these his fierie dartes: humble my proud heart: make it to affect thee and thy glorie, aboue all things, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:25201:15"/>
in all things. In like sort in doing the parts of a ciuill man, entertaining of preachers, or thy honest friends and neighbours, in shewing them thy faire houses, thy well contriued roomes, thy wealth, thy gaines, thy great expences, thy great reuenewes, thy toward children, &amp;c. doest thou not feele a theefe within thee, tickling and dallying with thy false heart, and telling thee, that thou shalt be highly commended for these things, and thy fame shall be spread farre and neare, and thou shalt be spoken of for it, and reuerenced, and admired? &amp;c. doest thou not feele such a theefe within thee speaking such things? And what is all in effect, but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade thee to rob him who hath enriched thee, to disgrace him who hath graced thee: and to wound him who hath healed thee? whereas thou oughtest then to say, I will shew these things, and tell what goodnesse I haue receiued of my mercifull God and heauenly father, that men may commend his goodnesse therein, and spread the fame of his name farre and neare, and may reuerence, and admire his wisedome and power, and mercifull workes towards mortall man, and may both feare and loue his Maiestie for the same. And to this end, let vs watch &amp; pray, that God in al things, and for all things, may haue his due praise and glorie. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when thou giuest thine almes, or buildest anie hospitall, or giuest any thing to the poore of such and such a parish, &amp;c. if thou doest not take great heed, and examine thy heart, and stand with prayer at the doore, then will Sathan be busie, and a spirituall theefe will stand vp in thy hart and say, Oh now this being knowne, how will the poore commend me? how will the world commend me? I shall now get a name that I am a good man to the poore, I hope to come into the Chronicles for my good deeds one day, &amp;c. Oh then scourge these corrupt and diuelish affections, &amp; chase them away by prayer, let them not dwel in thy heart, giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no entertainement, desire to giue all the glorie to God, and desire others to do the same for thee: for that he hath made thee both able, and willing to giue, and hath made thee his steward, and deputie to giue euery one his portion, that his fatherly goodnesse hath appointed them. The like is to be done of euery one that praieth in publike assemblies, and heareth the word diligently, and turne ouer their Bibles, and sing reuerently the holy Psalmes and praises of God, &amp; confer of that which they heard, and call their families to account for that which they haue heard at the Sermon, &amp;c. all most holy actions: but take heed now, when thou doest all these, or any of these, that the messenger of Sathan come not like a cunning companion and poison all these. Take heed I say euen then, when thou art about these seruices, for euen as cut-purses, and pilfering rogues watch their times till they see men busie in buying and selling, or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:25201:16"/>
come in a preasse: so do these vagrant affections watch our harts when we are about holy businesse, and in deuout conference with our God, to rob God of his honour, and to poison that which we offer him; and if it be poisoned he will none of it. A strange thing, and a hidden mysterie this is, that a man should then rob the Lord of his honour, when he is honoring and seruing him: that we should take from him that which we giue vnto him. Verily so we do, if we take not heed, and nothing is more common then that euil. Thou art deuout in thy prayer, in hearing, in sighing, in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, in eleuating eyes and hands to heauen: it is well done: but then take heede of the theefe with the poison that thou seest not: and that is, that affection that maketh thee to cast thy eye aside, perhaps to looke whether such a man seeth thee, or no: and that affection that tickleth thy heart, and saith, now I am a good man, I shall be counted a zealous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor for this, I shall be well esteemed for this, I shall by this meanes get familiaritie, and so commoditie with him &amp; her, and a thousand such odde conceits that come wharting and crossing of thy heart in the best things that thou canst do. All which if thou take not heede of them, euen then at that instant, and pray against them, they will get within thee, and plucke off the garment of puritie, and holinesse, which in Christ Iesus should commend thy action vnto God. And thus thou seest how God is robbed when he is serued: and therefore euen then without any further delay, or dallying take heed, and watch ouer thy heart: and pray against these vile and vaine affections, desiring God to reforme and correct them, that so thou maiest giue him his due, clad in such holy and pure affections as are desirous that all the glorie should be giuen vnto him, from whom, and for whom all things are, and shall be. And in so doing thou maiest safely shew, what God hath done for thee. Take for example in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Iacob,</hi> and in the new Testament the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Zacharie</hi> the father of <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Iacob</hi> he sheweth his brother how God had blessed him since his comming ouer <hi>Iordan,</hi> with onely a poore staffe in his hand: and now had giuen him troupes or bands of children and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: and blessed him with flockes of sheepe, beeues and camels: but in all these things his desire was that God might he glorified, and therefore he said, I am not worthy of the least of these mercies: that is, all that I haue set forth the great and vndeserued fauour of God vnto me. So farre was he from seeking thereby to be counted a great man, as the maner of the world is. So when <hi>Elizabeth</hi> reioyced with her cosin, for the great fauour and goodnesse of the most high, in chusing her to be the mother of the Lord Iesus: and sayd, <hi>Blessed art thou amongst women,</hi> she was not proud thereof,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke.</hi> 1.46.</note> but presently gaue the glorie vnto God, and sayd, <hi>My
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:25201:16"/>
soule doth magnifie the Lord, and my spirite reioyceth in God my Sauiour. I shall be magnified indeede, but he that is mightie hath magnified me, and holy is his name</hi>: and so made that whole song to set forth the glorious praises of God, in that singular worke which he had done to her. In like sort when <hi>Zachary</hi> knew that <hi>Iohn</hi> was borne, to be the forerunner of Christ, he presently gaue the glorie to God, saying, <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visited and redeemed his people, &amp;c. And thou ô child shalt be called the Prophet of the most high, for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare the way before him, to giue knowledge of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation vnto his people for the forgiuenesse of their sinnes.</hi> But then commeth forth the holy affection, wherein God is delighted and saith, <hi>Through the tender mercy of our God, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this shall we do if we take heed, and still watch ouer our hearts in euerie action, by secret prayer vnto God, that his name may be hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
                  <p>This wise course being taken, we shall be able by the grace of God, in a short time to discerne a false harted affection, from a true and a holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: a double heart from a single and sincere heart: for in euery man that is regenerate, there is a double motion, the one of the flesh, the other of the Spirite, the one of God, the other of Sathan, and in euerie action if he watch narrowly, he shall find and feele a striuing betweene them. Now here is wisedome, to discerne how much is of God, and how much of Sathan; that we may cherish the one: and crush the other in the head, before he grow to any strength. There will be two fires kindled, and both burning together in one heart, the one must be quenched, and not maintained: the other must not be que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched, but be maintained: for so saith the Scripture, quench and quench not, quench the firie darts of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, but quench not the Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed vp to the day of redemption. Now then seeing the glory of God is set vp for one marke to aime at, and the good of the Church of God for another: let vs learne by our leuelling and aiming at them, or besides them, to iudge of our affections and cogitations. If thy cogitations be studying and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing how to auoide vaineglorie, and how to get glorie to God, by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting about to make others to praise God in thy graces, and to loue and feare him for the same: then is that cogitation kindled by Gods Spirite, quench it not but cherish it. If thy affections be longing and desiring to bring the same to passe, which thy minde by Gods Spirite hath deuised, then is that a holy affection, &amp; of God: quench it not, but maintaine it, &amp; reioyce in God for it. But if one the contrarie, thy mind be deuising what to do, and what to say, and how to bring things to passe to please men,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:25201:17"/>
and not God, and to win credit and estimation amongst men, Gods glory being cast behind thy backe: know that those thoughts and affections are fierie darts of Sathans kindling, quench them, and cherish them not, take heede of them in time. In taking this timely heed, thou shalt by the grace of God be able easilie to espie the beginnings of thy speciall sinnes, and all the degrees of them, and the growth of them, and all the shifts and sleights of Sathan, and shalt euer get the victorie ouer them in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. And albeit thou be haunted, and molested, and buffeted with such messengers of Sathan, and pained, and humbled by such prickes and goades in thy flesh while thou liuest, yet here remaineth thy comfort, when death commeth, thou shalt be able to say with the Psalmist, <hi>By this I know ô Lord that thou louest me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 41.</note> 
                     <hi>because these my spirituall enemies haue not triumphed ouer me: blessed be the name of the Lord God for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But one other side, if thou be carelesse, and put off the matter still from time to time, thinking to repent, and leaue thy sinne when thou art olde, or a dying, as many do, thou doest miserably deceiue thy selfe: for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse any one sinne that is growne into a custome, will be too hard for thee, before age come, or sicknesse come. And for proofe of that I say, do but try thy strength with one of thy sinnes, which thou hast accustomed thy selfe vnto, and when thou wouldest leaue it, see how many shifts and delayes, and deuises, and excuses it hath, still pulling thee backe againe, when thy foote is in the stirrop, and thou ready as thou thinkest to ride away from it. Now if it be so with one sinne that thou hast bene familiar withall, what wilt thou do, when all thy sinnes are proued customes? Is it not an vsuall answer of most men, that haue vsed swearing, or lying, or prophane mirth, or sluggish seruing of God, &amp;c. It is my custome, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not leaue it. Those young men which were <hi>Ieroboams</hi> companions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his raigne, would be his Counsellors when he did raigne: so those sinnes which are thy companions now, will be thy Counsellors and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters too hereafter. Therefore say not, thou wilt take heed of them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: for hereafter thou art likely in all common sense and reason, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way more vnfit, and vntoward then thou art now; but when time and occasion serue, watch sinne, and thou take him, and destroy him, which else in time will ouerthrow thee.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue heard what it is that Christians must take heede of in doing of good deedes, and the manner how to take heed thereof. Now we are further to consider of the reasons which our Sauiour giueth, hereby to make men the more fearefull of that which he warneth them of, and more carefull to follow his counsell. And his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons containe two propositions, the one is negatiue, the other is affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. The first is these words: <hi>For else you shall haue no reward of your heauenly father.</hi> The other is in these words, <hi>Verily I say vnto you, they</hi> (that is hypocrites) <hi>haue their reward.</hi> The first reason is very soueraigne and auaileable against the inward euill, namely all inward desire and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of popular praise, and vaineglorie: and the other is as forcible to disswade from the outward euill, that is, ostentation and shew of vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie. The former telleth vs what we loose if we take not heed, and keepe not good watch ouer our hearts, against vaineglorious affections, and that is Gods reward: <hi>Our fathers blessing a heauenly reward,</hi> and in the second reason we are told what we shall get in stead thereof, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reward of hypocrites, and no more: and that is the praise of men, the wind of mens mouthes, the good opinion of mutable minds, then the which there is nothing more vaine, nor transitorie, nor friuolous, nor ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous: a miserable reward, indeede a punishment, and a torment to a godly mind.</p>
                  <p>Now we see, that by this bargaine, a man if he take not heede, may be a great looser, and by taking heed he may be a great gainer. Againe, we see that the vaineglorious Christian, that is to say: a plaine hypocrite, is a gainer by his hipocrisie; but his gaine is nothing to that which he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, and nothing comparable to his losse. These reasons are vsed by our Sauiour Christ in most high wisedome, as proceeding from one that best knoweth euery mans disease, and euery ones humour, and euery ones delight, and accordingly he fitteth both his medicines, and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues. Now seeing as all men are much moued with hope of rewards, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when for a small matter they are in hope to obtaine a great and a good reward, what could our Sauiour Christ propound of greater
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:25201:18"/>
force to moue men to embrace sinceritie in all their actions, then Gods reward, which is the greatest and the best? And because hypocrisie is of that bewitching nature, and besotting humour, that it maketh her suters &amp; attendants beleeue, that they shal be both honored here amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst men, and glorified hereafter amongst Angels in heauen: and so by feeding them with a vaine hope of a double reward for their double dealing, our Sauiour Christ here doth notably coole their courage, by abating no lesse of their wages, then heauen commeth to: assuring them, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they dreame of, it wil proue but a dreame. And least any man should thinke that it is otherwise, and God will be better to them then so, (as all hypocrites do) our Sauiour Christ bindeth vp the matter with an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest asseueration, or constant affirming the matter, and saith not, I feare me they haue their reward: I doubt they will loose their reward in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: I cannot tell, but I stand in great doubt of the matter: for then yet there were some little hope left, like a bone for the hypocritie to picke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon: but the goeth more directly to the point then so: saying, verily, and out of all question, build vpon it, know for a certaine what to trust vnto, if you take not heede of hypocrisie, you haue your reward here, there is nothing to be looked for hereafter at Gods hand, but the hypocrites por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that is hell fire with the diuell and his Angels for euer: for when men haue rewarded them, God will punish them. And thus you see the force of Christs reasons, and the drift of his words, wherein we haue two excellent points offered vs to consider of. First, the reward of sinceritie: secondly, the reward of hypocrisie.</p>
                  <p>The reward of sinceritie and vprightnesse of heart verily is great: for the Psalmist saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.11</note> that in keeping of the commandements of God there is great reward. Sinceritie is commaunded in the first commaundement of the first Table: and more largely in other places of Scripture, which bid vs to serue God with all our hearts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.</note> and with all our soules, and to praise him with all that is within vs. And therefore out of all doubt there is a great reward laid vp for those that are sincere harted Christians, and vpright professors of the Gospell of Christ.<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 3.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou hast shewed great mercy to Dauid,</hi> saith King <hi>Salomon, when he walked before thee in truth and vprightnesse of heart</hi>: to shew, that great mercies belong to vpright har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men. But what it is, or how great it is, or how good it is, few yet do know, fewer beleeue it, and fewest of all do so feele it, as to be moued therewith.</p>
                  <p>We know what we haue here, say some, we know not what we shall haue hereafter. Now, <hi>ignoti nulla cupido,</hi> of a thing vnknowne there is no desire: Therefore that men may desire it, it is fit they should know

                     <hi>Shew vs thy father,</hi> and it suffiseth: so say they, Shew vs the reward of sinceritie, and it suffiseth. Dreaming as the Disciples of Christ did awhile, of some earthly and temporall preferment. But as Christ sayd to <hi>Philip, He that hath seene me, hath seene my father:</hi> because the Sonne was in the Father, and the Father in the Sonne: so we say to them, he that hath seene sinceritie, hath seene the reward of sincerity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sincerity of it selfe is the gift of God, and Gods reward goeth with his owne gift, according to the saying of a learned father: <hi>Sua munera co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronat Deus in nobis:</hi> God doth crowne his owne gifts in vs. Other some there be which haue seene the reward of sincerity a good part of it, that is, haue knowne it, and beleeued such a thing, but haue bin no more moued therewith, to preserue themselues against the poison of vaineglorie, then they of the old world were moued with the report and sight of <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke, to prepare for them selues against the floud. Others there be that haue both seene it by faith, and tasted of it too, but afterward haue lothed the same, and lusted after vaineglorie: as the vnthankfull Israelites lothed Manna, which did nourish them when all other foode failed: and sell to lusting for the flesh pots of Egypt. It fareth with those that haue left their sinceritie, as it did with those that left Christ after they had heard him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while. When they heard Christ speake of eating his flesh:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.60.</note> they said, <hi>this is a hard saying, who can beare it?</hi> and so came no more. So the other hearing that sincerities men shall haue Gods reward, they like that well inough: but when we tell them, nay when Gods word telleth them, that they shall loose the worlds reward, and in stead of commendations, shall be condemned, and hated, and scorned: they say, this is a hard saying, and so giue ouer their sincere courses. But what saith our Sauiour Christ to the woman of <hi>Samaria?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

As when <hi>Dauid</hi> asked life,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But now all the enquiring will be, what this same gift of God should

be, and what reward they shall haue that giue entertainment to sincerity. Verily, as the Church saith of Christ her beloued: <hi>My beloued is white and ruddie,</hi>

The Sunne doth giue light to all the starres, and the Queene doth grace her Ladies of Honour with her presence: So sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or truth of heart doth beautifie and grace all other vertues: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that they are but naked and counterfeit. She goeth before them, and speaketh for them all, like a foreman of a Iurie, when all the rest (though they be her faire sisters) must hold their peace. Faith is seeble and weake, and loue her handmaid is lazie, and careth for none but her selfe: patience hath a scarre on her face giuen her by intemperancie: deuotions is so fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen with cold, that she can scarce go: humilitie is so tired with wrestling against pride, that she looketh very leane and bare: and as for repentance that is so trampled vpon with custome of sinne, that it is scarce to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned from hardnesse of heart. Now all these go from vs that haue abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them, into the Lords presence, as <hi>Thamar</hi> did from her brother <hi>Amnon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sa.</hi> 13.18, 19.</note> when he had enforced her: with their garments of diuerse co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours rent and torne: with ashes vpon her head in token of sorrow: and with great weeping, griefe and shame. For that they must come before their Lord and King their father so defaced, so ragged, so basely and so beastly as they are, as if they had lien all their life time, since they went from heauen, in some stinking ditches with vermine, or in vile stables a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst beastes, or in the woods and fieldes of wandring cogitations, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the euish conceipts of vaineglorie, and vnwholesome affections of anger, and wrath, and couetuousnesse, and vncleannesse: for so they haue indeed. But when they meet with ther sister sinceritie, and vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, oh how glad and ioyfull are they: for her sake they know they shall all fare the better. Oh sinceritie, sinceritie, where hast thou bene all this while, say they? vntill thou camest, we could haue no grace, nor fauour, no entrance into the Court gate of our heauenly Ierusalem, no our owne father would not know vs, but tooke vs for counterfeits, vntill we fetched thee: as <hi>Ioseph</hi> tooke his brethren for spies, vntill they fetched <hi>Beniamin</hi> whome he loued better then they. And now that we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:25201:19"/>
haue met with thee we are glad, our hearts are comforted: thou shalt be heard for vs all, being altogether in Christ Iesus our Mediator. But otherwise, though we said we are Christians, and haue professed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie, and offered to put in for our suretie no worse baile then the Kings owne naturall sonne Iesus Christ, all would not serue, we could not be heard, vntill we brought sinceritie with vs. For she, as res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth God more then all the world, and setteth more by his loue and anger, then by the loue and anger of all the world: so in Christ Iesus she is more respected, and honoured, and rewarded of God then all the world beside. Oh happie man and woman, that professing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie or faith in Christ, or repentance for sinne, or patience in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or contempt of the world, or zeale to Gods glorie, or deuotion in Gods worship, or liberalitie to the Saints, or mercie to the miserable, can in all these haue the company of sinceritie, and vprightnesse of heart: then may they say thus: nay our suretie the Lord Iesus wil pleade for vs in this manner: Father, despise not these little ones; they are my friends: and though their faith and repentance be weake and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and other graces of thy Spirit be but small and feeble: and for want of nourshing and good looking vnto, be not so well growne, nor so well ordered as they should haue bene: yet forasmuch, as they come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, and haue called vpon my name in sinceritie and truth, which thou louest, without counterfeiting, dissembling, and hypocrisie, which thou abhorrest, thou wilt not despise them. Their fruit though they be but little in quantitie, like a graine of musterd seed, yet it is right fruite of the Spirit, true faith, though little faith, true loue though litle and small loue: not like the fruites of hypocrites, which are like the apples of <hi>Sodome,</hi> faire in shew, and ashes in substance.</p>
                  <p>What hath soundly comforted all the Saines of God here on earth, but the testimonie of an vpright heart? And is not sound comfort a good reward? What hath encouraged and emboldned them to come before God in prayer, but the testimoniall of a sincere heart, and holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And is not boldnesse in Gods presence a good reward? What hath made the prayers of the faithfull auaileable with God for other, but the sinceritie and vpright affection of them that haue craued their prayers? and are not these sweet odours, that is, the prayers of the Saints a good reward? What made <hi>Iacob</hi> to be honoured with the new name of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> that is, preuailing with God for a blessing: but that his wrestling was not in shew, but in good earnest, in sinceritie and truth of heart, with a constant purpose of perseuering, till he had gotten that which he stroue for? And is not preuailing with God a good reward? All the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:25201:20"/>
daies of the afflicted are euill (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) that is, troublesome, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, and bitter to flesh and bloud,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 15.15.</note> but a good conscience is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall feast: that is, he that hath an vpright heart, and sincere affection before God, feeleth no want. Now such a feast, as it is continuall, so is it prouided by God himselfe, serued in with the Spirit of God, where the Angels do waite, and reioyce: and the worst dishes are the assurance of Gods loue, forgiuenesse of sinnes, peace of conscience, and ioy of the holy Ghost. There all the communication is secret and heauenly between Christ and the soule: the Musitians are the faithfull, and their musicke is praising of God, and their harmonie is the communion of Saints, and all are of one heart and mind: and is not such a feast a good reward? Nay more then this, if this be not inough, whosoeuer will earnestly hegge this gift of God by prayer, and louingly embrace and keepe her as his deare spouse, shall haue with her a large dowrie, a great reward in heauen, in heauen saith Christ. For such gifts come not without crauing, and of our selues we cannot haue it: for if a good wife be the gift of God; much more is a good heart, which God in creating doth giue, &amp; in giuing doth create:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.</note> therfore <hi>Dauid</hi> saith: <hi>Create in me ô Lord a cleane heart</hi>: to shew that we can no more make the hart sincere, then we can create a hart. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such a hart is created by God, he giueth thee a singular gift: &amp; a great portion belongeth vnto it. Part of it shall be payd thee in this life, but the greatest part in the life to come. In this life thou shalt be loued of Christs friends, and moned of good men when thou art wronged: &amp; the more thou dost seek to honor God, the more he will honor thee, as he told <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</hi> The more thou fliest the vainglorie of the world for sinceritie sake, the more wil true glorie follow thee, according to the Prouerb: <hi>Honos fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gientem sequitur, sequentem fugit:</hi> It followeth those that flye from her, like friends which enforce gifts and other curtesies vpon modest persons which refuse them, but flyeth them that follow her, as men do impudent beggers. But besides al this, when death comes, thy deare friend sincerity shall more comfort thee then all the Phisitions in the world. And after death thy name shall liue, and walke vp &amp; downe in the world, to warne some, to comfort some, to admonish some, and to shame some, and to condemne many. But yet here is not all, for then shalt thou first receiue commendation of God, whom thou hast serued, and secondly enter into full and euerlasting possession of thy maisters ioy, which is no lesse then a weightie crowne of glorie immortall, then a kingdome, and inheritance of eternall blessednesse with the Saints and Angels, and God himselfe: where all teares shall be wiped from thy eyes, and thou shalt reioyce for euermore. Where thou shalt enioy for euer and euer, such things as no
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:25201:20"/>
eye hath seene, no eare hath heard, nor heart to man can conceiue: and nothing shall euer obscure or eclipse the same, nor crosse, nor diminish the same.</p>
                  <p>And what is all this, or whatsoeuer else can be sayd of it, but scarce a shadow of sincerities reward? Alas, a drop taken out of the sea, and a moate out of the mountaines: like the hem of Christs garment, which did comfort the woman that touched it: but she found more comfort in him, then in the hem. So the description of sincerity is delightsome, &amp; the picture is pleasing: but whosoeuer hath sincerity it selfe, shall find at his left hand the fulnesse of ioy, and at his right hand pleasure for euermore.</p>
                  <p>Whosoeuer after this Sermon, shall find so much fauour with God, as to meete with sinceritie and vprightnesse of heart in all his actions, and such an affection that preferreth Gods glorie before his owne, and seeketh praise of God and not of man: shall say as the Queene of the South sayd when she came to King <hi>Salomon:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 10.</note> 
                     <hi>That which I heard of thee I did hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeue it, but now I perceiue that the report which went of thee, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing answerable to that which thou art indeed.</hi> And though no man deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth such a reward at Gods hand, no nor any reward at all, but shame and confusion, which is our due desert; yet both for his promise sake, as also for his honour sake he will so reward his children. If mortall men will keepe their promise one towards another, as all that haue but common ciuility and honestie will, them much more will Almightie God, who is all truth and righteousnesse it selfe, and can no more breake his promise, then he can denie himselfe, or cease to be God. The Prince promiseth to pardon a traytour, and he keepeth promise with him: this is of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces goodnesse, and not of the traytors desert. We are all traytors to God: he hath promised vppon our true repentance to pardon vs: it is of his goodnesse to make vs such a promise, and not of our desert: childish ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the Papists, who whensoeuer they reade of a reward comming from God, do straite way dreame of some desert or merite to proceede from man and fetch the same.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in that it pleaseth God so liberally and aboundantly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the poore trauels, and endeuours of his children, and so gloriously to crowne his owne gifts in them, when notwithstanding they are so stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and abused as they are, let no man maruell thercat: for that is done according to the worthinesse of his Maiesty, and the greatnesse of his owne honour, and not according to the basenesse of our persons. This did <hi>Alexander</hi> the great consider, when a poore souldier came vnto him to begge a reward for his seruice that he had done: What wouldest thou haue quoth he? A hundreth crownes quoth the souldier. Well quoth the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:25201:21"/>
King, though that be too much for thee to aske, and more then thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruest, yet is too little for me to giue that am thy Emperour: so we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the basenesse of our mindes and cogitations would begge of God, worldly preferment and credit in the world, gold and siluer, house and land, honour and worship. Well, content thy selfe saith our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, and heauenly father, that is too much for thee to aske, and too litle for me to giue, being Lord of heauen and earth, I will giue thee that that is fit for thee here: and a kingdome hereafter if thou serue me in sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and truth of hart, respecting more my glorie then thy owne glorie, or thy life either. For it standeth not with the honour of Gods Maiesty to recompence trauels of his seruants with trifles. God dealeth with his children that are most sincere harted in this world, as great men deale with their children in their minoritie, whom they intend to make their heires: they put them to schoole, and giue them correction, and allow them from hand to mouth, and abridge them of their libertie, and keepe them in awe: but when their fathers are dead, and they come to mens e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, they are then rewarded with no lesse then all their fathers lands; which if they should haue had before, they would haue spent riotously, and wantonly: so God keepeth his children here in this world vnder schooling, and nurturing them, correcting and crossing them: and giueth them their stint, and allowance of wealth, of health, of credit, of friends, &amp;c. But when they come to a perfectage, and are perfect men growne in Christ (which will not be vntill after tearme of this life) then loe they are made fellow heires of the kingdome of heauen, with the Lord Iesus himselfe, blessed be his name for euer.</p>
                  <p>Now by this time my good brethren, you haue (I hope) well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of the matter, and will not denie but that the reward of sinceritie is a great reward, like vnto him that giueth it: a fathers reward, yea a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly fathers reward, and a heauenly reward.</p>
                  <p>Consider well, you whose hearts yet long for the vaine praise and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation of men, like sucking weanlings, that cry still after the breast: can the world affoord you any such reward? Can your father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? can your friends an kindred? can Kings &amp; Princes? can al the world? Let vs see, sincerity is rewarded with sound comfort, as Christ sayd to the sicke man, <hi>Sonne be of good comfort.</hi> You that desire to be seene of men, you desire sound comfort, can the world giue it you when God denieth it you? Or can the world take it from you, if God doth giue it you? Sinceritie is rewarded with courage in prayer, and boldnesse before Gods throne of grace. You that desire to be seene of men, desire also to stand boldly before the face of God, but consider:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:25201:21"/>
can all the commendations of the world giue you that boldnesse and courage when God doth denie it you? or can al the condemnations and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill speeches of the world take it from you, if God doth giue it you? Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity preuaileth with God. You that desire to be seene of men, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire also to preuaile with God: but consider well, can all the praises of men make you preuaile with God, if God himselfe doth not like you? or can all the world by disgracing of sincere harted Christians, hinder their suite in the Lords Court, if God doth like of them? Sincerity is rewarded with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual feast, of the loue of God, of ioy in the holy Ghost, of peace of conscience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, of the merits of Christ. About whose dwelling places God hath charged his owne gard of Angels, to pitch their tents, that the man of earth may not make them affraid, nor the sonne of violence do them any harme. You that desire to be seene of men, you commend this feast, you also desire to be at such a feast: but consider well, can all the men, &amp; Princes in the world make you such a feast, when God will make you fast? or can all the world cause you to fast, or to want when the Lord hath prouided you such a feast? Sincerity shall be rewarded with a crowne of glorie, and inheritance immortall, the kingdome of heauen: for our heauenly father giueth heauenly rewards, and infinite like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Now you that desire to be seene of men, desire also such a reward, as the sonnes of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> did desire each of them a place in the kingdome of heauen: but consider well, when you haue won the commendations of all men, yet cannot all the men in the world giue you that reward: for Christ sayd <hi>it was not his to giue</hi>: if not his to giue as he was man, then much lesse is it the worlds to giue vnto men: neither can all the world, with the helpe of all the diuels in hell take it from you, nor molest you in it, when God hath giuen it vnto you.</p>
                  <p>But least any man should yet stand in doubt of that I say, let witnesses be examined: let their records be searched: aske <hi>Enoch,</hi> he walked with God, that is, he had his conuersation as in the sight of God, his care and study was to please God,<note place="margin">

Aske <hi>Ioseph,</hi> thy heart was vpright toward thy maister, as in the sight of God, insomuch that thy maister tooke no account of thee for anything: neither didst thou care for the loue of thy light mistresse, but in the feare of God didst chuse rather to please him then hir. It is true saith <hi>Ioseph,</hi> neither did I loose any thing by my vprightnesse, and sincerity: for though I was a while in trouble and disgrace for it, yet the Lord that gaue me the gift of sinceritie, he tooke my part, &amp; caused me to be set at liberty, and brought me with my great credit, &amp; her great shame to high preferment, and now am I free from all troubles, and liue like a

No no, sayth <hi>Paule,</hi> neuer tell me of these matters, I was crucified to the world, and the world to me: that is, I cared no more for the world, then the world did for me: the power of God did appeare in my weaknesses: when I was in prison I was at liberty: when I went from the whip to the dungeon, I sung Psalmes: yea, all this was an honour vnto me that I was not worthie of. From all my daungers the Lord deliuered me. And where I lost my life, there I found it againe: euen euerlasting life. In a word, <hi>I haue fought a good fight,</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue heard heretofore the excellent nature, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly reward of sinceritie; now brethren, that we may be as much out of loue with hypocrisie, as we are in loue (I hope) with sinceritie: let vs see the nature and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of hypocrisie: because contraries being layed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, do the better appeare. And first, of the nature of of hypocrisie, vpon these wordes: <hi>as the hypocrites do, &amp;c.</hi> Of the second branch when we come to the next words, <hi>Verily I say vnto you they haue their reward.</hi> At this time onely of these wordes: <hi>as hypocrites do:</hi> wherein our Sauior Christ doth giue vs to vnderstand two things First, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer professeth a shew of that which he is not, is an hypocrite: secondly, that the doings of hypocrites are to be made knowne, that euery one see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hypocrite laid out in his colours, with his reward that belongeth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:25201:23"/>
to him, may take heede, that he play not the hypocrite, or if he hath play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that part, to be ashamed thereof and repent, and follow the Lord euer after in sinceritie and truth of heart.</p>
                  <p>Now seeing as our Sauiour Christ would haue hypocrites knowne by their doings: I will endeuour my selfe at this time by Gods helpe, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case the hypocrite, who hath plaid his part so long, so impudently, and so vncontrolledly, carying away all the credit of the world, euen to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining of the house of God, &amp; endangering the whole estate of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion. And call this Sermon (if you list) the vncasing of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite: for I will (if God will) do my best endeuour to vncase him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in perhaps I shall not behaue my selfe so handsomly and finely to please all parties, as some could do: but yet I hope both soundly and plainly I shall go to worke. You know brethren, that plaine dealing is my profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, though it be counted a iewell for beggers: flattery, and curiositie, and hypocrisie I leaue to them that will dye rich men, and therefore I speed accordingly: and I must needes confesse, that I am wellinough ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, to be so well belaboured as I am with the strife of tongues. Well, if I could handle this matter more learnedly then I can; yet I would of purpose deceiue all such itching eares, as come rather to haue their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours fed, then their liues reformed. A peece of worke both thanklesse and dangerous, yea a most vnpleasant argument haue I taken in hand, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially as the case standeth now, when most men come to catch and to cauill, and <hi>quot homines tot sententiae,</hi> euery mans head swarming with as many odde conceits and vncharitable surmises, as there be heads to heare. But it is no matter my brethren, thinke and speake of me at your pleasure, so long as I haue the truth on my side, I care the lesse, words are but wind, and truth will preuaile in the end, and iudge them that now condemne it. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> telleth me, that I must passe through good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and bad report (and I thanke God so I haue doue meetly well:) and to the <hi>Galathians</hi> he saith thus,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Am I Paul become your enemy because I tel you the truth?</hi> to shew, that whosoeuer will speake the truth shall be counted an enemy. But what sayth the same Apostle? <hi>If I seeke to please men, I cannot please God, and therfore I am at a point.</hi> God gaue me an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart in his sight, and then, as for the fauour and disfauour of the world his will be done. But now to the matter in hand: <hi>Do not your almes,</hi> that is, your good deedes <hi>to be seene of men, as hypocrites do.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours purpose is to illustrate his precept by an example of counterfeits and players, who do all their feats of purpose to be seene of men: to which end, they haue a stage erected, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may see them, making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, that whosoeuer come to such a place, at such an houre, shal see
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:25201:23"/>
such a mans players, that is, such a mans hypocrites make a play, that is, play the hypocrites by counterfeiting and shewing diuerse mens actions and diuerse mens persons, which they are not, neither act they indeede. Therefore seeing that the nature and practise of players doth most fitly serue to set foorth the nature &amp; practise of such as do but counterfeit and dissemble in the profession and practise of religion, when they would be thought to be in good earnest: and seeing that (for their counterfeiting) plaiers were the first, that were termed amongst prophane writers hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: therefore I say the Scripture hath borrowed that name of them, &amp; translated it to all that play the dissemblers &amp; counterfeits in Gods bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse or otherwise. Of this iudgement is master <hi>Caluin,</hi> whose words are these,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cal. Har.</hi>
                     </note> in his Euangelicall Harmony, vpon this place: <hi>Nam quum hypocritae profanis scriptoribus dictifuerint histriones qui in scena &amp; ludis fictas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonas agebant, Scriptura hoc nomen ad homines duplices corde, &amp; simula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos transtulit</hi>: that is, seeing as players which in Enterludes and on stages did faine and counterfeit the persons of other men, were termed hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites by prophane writers, the Scripture hath translated that name vnto dissemblers and men of a double heart. And most fitly are they both called hypocrites, because they both counterfeit alike, and make a shew before men of that which they are not before God: yea so like are they one to another, as things cast both in a mould, or as those men are that for their likenesse in fauour and condition, or for their neerenesse in affinity or office, do call one another brothers.</p>
                  <p>Amongst Players, one counterfeiteth the King, and yet is no King, but a base fellow in comparison: another counterfeiteth a merchant, and yet is no merchant, but a beggarly companion: others come to fight, and yet do not fight, but dally one with another: others scold and brawle, and seeme to be at mortal enmitie one against another, like some kind of Lawyers at the barre for their Clients: but when they are gone, they are as good friends as euer they were, and laugh at them whom they haue made fooles. But indeed certaine persons amongst Players are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which are not counterfeited: for some play the fooles part, and are fooles indeed: some play the varlets part, and are varlets indeede: some play the rogues part, and are rogues indeede: some play the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siners part, and are cousiners indeed: some play the parts of lewd men, and lewde women, and are lewde indeede: so that these (I thinke) haue wrong done them to be tearmed hypocrites, because they do not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit the parts they play, but are the same indeed that they make shew of, except it be in regard of the persons which they represent, that they be called hypocrites: for those persons they are not indeede,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:25201:24"/>
though the qualitie of those persons they haue indeed. In like manner is it with men of a double heart in religion or otherwise. Some seeme to pray, when they do not pray, but babble with their lips, wordes which their minds thinke not of, and their hearts consent not vnto: and keepe a stir for thrise a weeke seruice, not caring for the Sabbath day; and come perhaps of contention too, rather then of any deuotion. These are in shew deuout, but in truth deuout hypocrites. Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend friendship, while with the lion they offer to lick poore men whole with a dinner at Christmas, or the loane of a little money, or the sale of some rotten commoditie, while with their teeth, that is, by cruell practises (ill neighbours to a smooth tongue) they meane to pray vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them: these are in shew friends, but in truth friendly hypocrites. Some make a shew of zeale to the glorie of God, when their zeale is nothing but bitter malice, and malicious bitternesse: a thing that too many in the ministerie are guiltie of: and wherewith many zealous and faithfull Preachers are vniustly charged by hypocrites. But our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, that God doth acquite vs, when the wicked do condemne vs; but they that are maliciously zealous, are zealous hypocrites. Some in their humble and courteous behauiour seeme altogether to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of humilitie, with kind speeches and friendly offers, as, yours to commaund: I owe you any seruice that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I can, (meaning indeed euer to owe it, and neuer to pay any) I haue the courtesie of the towne for you, and I maruell when you will come to our house, and I wote not what, when indeed they meane no such matter: these are humble and kind hypocrites. Some seeme very carefull for the poore, like <hi>Iudas,</hi> when they would oppresse the Church, and either disburden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or else enrich themselues with the spoiles of the Church: these are charitable &amp; benefacting hypocrites. Some make a shew of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conscience, and seeme desirous of resolution in their pretended doubts, when they purpose onely to entrappe the Preacher: these are afflicted hypocrites. Some seeme to harken to the Preacher very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely and deuoutly, when in their hearts they turne most of that they heare into a iest, because they like it not: these are attentiue hypocrits. Some make as though they desired nothing more, then the obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Princes lawes, when in the meane time they freely violate all lawes themselues: these are lawlesse hypocrites. Some crie God forbid, but that euery man should haue his due, and in the meane time pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise all the deuises that may be to defeat euery man: these are conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, or rather vnconscionable hypocrites. Some pretend the discharge of their office, when they meane thereby to play their parts against some
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:25201:24"/>
whom they owe a grudge vnto: now these you may call officious hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. Some seeme more forward then others in the outward profession of the Gospell, that vnder the colour thereof, they may the more freely giue them selues to their pleasures, and euery new-fangled fashion that is daily inuented: these you may call (if you will) hypocrites of the fashion. Some are as the companie they come vnto; and as Pedlers with their packes haue accesse to mens gates to get money: so these with their tales of euery man get accesse to most mens tables, where they buy and sell at their pleasures, they care not whome, and all for a meales meate: these you may call (if you will) pedling hypocrites, or Protestents for the pot and the spit. There be diuerse others, which (if time would tarrie) I wold decipher vnto you: as the daintie eared hypocrite, called <hi>Noli me tange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> who will professe Christ crucified, but cannot abide to haue Christ crucifie his sinnes; and the brazen-faced hypocrite, who in secret will say any thing, and in publike will deny the same againe. But here are enough and too many, to act a play that shall please the world, the flesh and the Diuell. Now what is the religion of all these I pray you? or (to speake the truth) of most men now adaies, but hypocrisie? that is to say, a very play, which euery one studieth to act as artificially as he can, vpon the tickle Stage of this vaine world, to winne thereby credite and commoditie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men, being before God nothing lesse, then that which they seem to be vnto men. Now all these hypocrites or players may be deuided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two sorts or companies. First, such as make a counterfeit profession of religion. Secondly, such as make a counterfeit practise of that which they professe. And both these companies of hypocrites, are either publike or priuate. Publike are those which play their parts in the Church, or in the Commonwealth, and they are also of two sorts: such as abuse their office and authoritie which are publike, or such as abuse the publike assemblies and exercises of religion, seeming there to be that which they are not. Priuate hypocrites are such as play the counterfets in housholds, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. In housholds and families there is much hypocrisie, that is: many a play plaied by diuerse actors, both comically nnd tragically, that is, in sport and in earnest. The actors in these plaies be sometime the husband, sometime the wife: sometime the maister, sometime the seruants: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the parents, sometime the children, and sometime all together, as hereafter more at large we shall see. As in housholds, so elsewhere is much priuate hypocrisie raigning, as in shoppes amongst buyers and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and elsewhere betweene partie and partie: making contracts and bargaines with great protestations of loue and kindnesse: and all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:25201:25"/>Some thinke none may be tearmed hypocrites, but such as haue bene forward and zealous professors of the Gospell in shew: but they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. Indeed whosoeuer is a professor of Christianitie, and denyeth the power thereof, is an hypocrite. But of professors there are two sortes: some are very forward, and some are not so forward: some are zealous and make a great shew, &amp; some are not so zealous, nor so much in shew, yet all professors of Christs Gospell. Whosoeuer hath giuen his name to Christ in baptisme, and is a partaker of the Lords table, is a professor of the name of Christ: but if in their liues they serue Sathan, they are but hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites. But it will be replied, that such as neuer made any shew of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion canot be counted hypocrites, because hypocrisie is a counterfetting or dissembling in religion. It is true indeed: but what count you religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? or what is it to make a shew of religion? Is it onely to be a diligent hearer of Sermons? or a daily frequenter of the temple? or to talk much of the Scripture? or to reason well in matters of Diuinitie? or to vse prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and singing of Psalmes, and catechizing in the familie? or to keepe company with godly persons? or to speake against vnlawfull swearing and prophaning the Sabbath? or to defie idolatrie and superstition, &amp;c. Surely he that doth all these, maketh a good shew of religion, and if he doth them not to God as well as to men, he is a grosse hypocrite. But what then? Is this all religion? Indeed many thinke so, and deceiue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. But whosoeuer maketh a shew of any religious duties, maketh a shew of religion. And we know that all the duties required in both the tables of the Commaundements, are religious duties being performed by way of obedience to God, as they ought to be. And if they be not so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, they are then done but to the halfes, that is, to men but not to God. Now that religion consisteth aswell in the duties of the second ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which concerne our neighbor, as in the duties of the first, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Gods worship: it is euident by the testimonie of S. <hi>Iames.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Pure reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and vndefiled before God:</hi> euen the father is to visite the fatherlesse and widowes in their aduersitie, and to keepe himselfe vnspotted of the world, that is, to helpe those that haue no meanes to helpe themselues. He doth not exclude the duties of the first table, which concerne the immediate worship of God, but sheweth that all that without the other is vaine, as he saith plainely in the verse before: <hi>If any man among you see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth religious, and refraineth not his toung,</hi> (meaning from backbiting, lying, slaundering, and maliciousnesse, and filthie talking, against which he inueigheth in the 21. verse) <hi>this mans religion is vaine.</hi> Now many ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill honest men being baptized and admitted to the Lords table, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at times appointed to the holy exercises of Gods worship, may in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:25201:25"/>
some good measure keepe the duties of the second table, and yet not be very forward obseruers of the first table, paying man his due, and being slacke inongh to giue God his due. Now these I say if they keepe the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table, that is, pay euery man his owne, honour their superiors, and liue chastly and orderly, and seeke to preserue life, and keepe hospitality for the poore, and helpe their neighbour to his right, and beare true wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they do also make a good shew of religion: but if they do these things but to be seene and commended of men, they are but hypocrites: that is, counterfeits before God. Againe, if they stand more precisely v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon one thing, that God hath commaunded, then vpon another: it is a signe that their hearts are not vpright with God: for if they were vpright, they would aswell regard his commaundement for one thing as for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or else they are hypocrites and dissemblers, to pretend obedience to Gods commaundements when they meane nothing lesse.</p>
                  <p>But it will be obiected againe, that the duties of the second table may be performed in some sort, euen by a meere ciuill or naturall man, that knoweth not God (as amongst the heathen be many such) nor make any shew of religion at all: or else where is the common distinction of ciuility and religion? Of ciuill actions and religious actions? The answer is easie, and to stand long vpon such a point, were but to trifle away the time. We speake now of Christians in name and profession at the least, and not of the heathen: and euery one that professeth himselfe a Christian, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth also the workes of Christianitie in shew at the least, which are (as hath bene shewed) the workes of the second table aswell as of the first: which selfe same works may be done both ciuilly and religiously too: and so one and the same man in one and the same action: may shew himselfe both a ciuill honest man, and a religious honest man. As for example: the law of the Prince commaundeth me to pay my debts, to helpe my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to releeue the poore, &amp;c. As a subiect owing obedience to my prince I do these things, and therein I do the part of a ciuill man, because I obey vnto ciuill authoritie. But if in doing of the same things, I haue an eye vnto God who commaundeth the same things, and do them in his feare, and of loue vnto his Maiestie: then do I the same things both reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously &amp; ciuilly too. As for the heathen or heathenish professors of the Gospell, if they do obey ciuill authoritie for feare or for vaineglorie, or for any other end then the loue of their neighbour, which also must flow out of the loue of God, as being the end of the law: they also play the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites because they seeme to loue their neighbour, when they onely loue themselues.</p>
                  <p>And to make all this more full and plaine which hath bene said
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:25201:26"/>
let vs heare what our Sauiour Christ saith to the matter, who is the best expositor of his owne mind. In the 23. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> he pronounceth wo eight or nine times against the Scribes and Pharisees for diuerse kinds of hypocrisie, or diuerse seuerall counterfeit parts which they played, all which were not in matters of religion, most were but not all. First, in the thirteenth verse he saith:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13.</note> 
                     <hi>Wo vnto you Scribes and Pharisees hypocrites, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause yee shut vp the kingdome of heauen before men: for ye your selues goe not in, neither suffer ye them that would enter to come in.</hi> There is one kind of hypocrisie: his meaning is, that they had one deuice or other still to keepe men from the hearing of Christs preaching, which was the verie kingdome of Gods grace, and the meane to bring them to the kingdom of glorie: and for that matter they had diuerse pretences: but because the thing they aymed at, was to keepe men from hearing of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell preached: therefore Christ calleth them hypocrites. When I consider well of that place of Scripture, it maketh me remember such Church offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as neuer go foorth to cause men to come to Church, but when the Sermon is readie to beginne, which they neither care perhaps to heare themselues, nor would by their goodwils that others should heare. Now because the preaching of the word, is the kingdome of Gods grace, and the meanes to bring men to the kingdome of glorie, let them take heede of Christs wo, because they shut vp the kingdome of heauen before men: for they themselues go not in, neither suffer they them to enter that wold come in, and all vnder pretence of executing their office in causing men to come to Church. Oh cunning diuell, that vnder pretence of bringing men to church, can keepe men from that, which should let them into the kingdome of heauen, that is, from hearing the word preached.</p>

Some abuse long pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, some short prayer, some read prayer, some weekely prayer, to couer their malice, and to make the world beleeue they are deuout persons.

And to sweare by the Altar was nothing, but to sweare by the offering vpon the Altar, that was a great sinne: Such hypocrites are they that make it no matter of offence to sweare at euerie word, by the holy and dreadfull name of God, so they sweare not by that precious bloud which he shed, or the wounds which he receiued, or some part of his most sacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And to sweare by the creatures of God, as by the light, by the fire, by their siluer, by the bread or other things which God made, as also by their faith and troth: is no sinne, so long as they sweare not by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. But marke what our Sauiour Christ saith vnto all such. In the 17.<note place="margin">

And whosoeuer sweareth by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein. And he that sweareth by heauen, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.</hi> And euen so by Christs reason, he that sweareth by the light or any other creature, sweareth by it and by him that made the same and ruleth the same: and he that sweareth by his faith or troth, sweareth by it and by God, from whom is faith and troth be deriued, and on whom they be grounded. But to proceed: In the 23.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 23.</note> verse the Lords Iesus taxeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for another kind of hypocrisie, &amp; that is this: <hi>They tithe mint and annise and cummin, and leaue the weightie matters of the law, as iudgement, mercy and fidelity.</hi> This he calleth <hi>straining of a gnat, and swallowing of a cammell.</hi> A disease that al hypocrites do labor of, to be verie busie and doubtfull in small and trifling matters, and to neglect altogether the weighty and principall duties of the law. <hi>Hic mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus omnibus fere saeculis &amp; apud omnes gentes regnauit</hi> (saith Maister <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin</hi>) <hi>vt maior pars hominum leuiculis obseruationibus Deum placare stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duerit.</hi> This is a disease (saith he) that hath raigned in all ages, amongst all men, that the greater part of men haue studied to please God with the lightest and triflingest obseruations that could be, and his reason is this,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:25201:27"/>
because (saith he) they cannot exempt themselues from all kind of dutie and seruice to God, therefore they flye vnto this as a second remedy, to redeeme most grieuous offences with satisfactions that are nothing worth. And for an instance, he bringeth in the Papists: who passing ouer the great and most substantiall commandements of God, do thinke to make him amends by sweating about cold and naked ceremonies. And such a thing is it that Christ reproues in the Scribes and Pharisees, who cast by the principall points of the law of God, and thought yet both to satisfie him, and to retaine also a name of righteous men, by paying of their tithes, and not of all things neither: but of mint and annife and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and such toyes, when notwithstanding in greater matters they vsed all the fraud and deceipt that could be, and left no cunning meanes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practised, to defeat the Church of her right in the chiefest things. After the manner of many now a daies, who (most hypocritically) will come to the Minister, and saie, you shall haue all your due, God forbid that we should keepe a farthing from the Church that is due. No Sir, you shall haue rather more then lesse of your due. Now these be good Pharisaicall speeches. But when it commeth to triall indeed, it shall be the tithe onely of mint and cummin, &amp;c. that is, of toyes and trifles to speake of, as it might be of the remnant of an apple tree, or if you will the tenth part of an apple. And because you shall not saie, but that they deale well with you and with a good conscience, you shall haue the paring and all, whereas when we come to the vncasing of the hypocrite, we shall find him iust of <hi>Ananias</hi> his religion,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 5. <hi>Ier.</hi> 43.</note> who told the Apostles that there was all, when there was but halfe, or of the Iewes religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in <hi>Ieremy</hi> 43. who sayd that they would heare the word of God from <hi>Ieremy</hi>: but when <hi>Ieremy</hi> spake, they sayd plainely, this is not the word of God, we know the word of God. So say minting hypocrites, we will pay our dues: yea, to the vttermost, but we will set downe ourselues what is due, and more then that you get not: like a good fellow on the way, that bad a man deliuer his purse, and when it was told him that it was against the kings lawes to rob and steale: his answer was; It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the kings lawes must be obeyed, but you must know that for this time I am king, &amp; my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement is that you deliuer your purse: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my Septer (quoth he) and shewed him his sword, euen so is it with those which say, all dues must be payed, but they will set downe what shall be due, &amp; their will shall go for a law: I speake not now of things in controuersie, but of things that be out of controuersie. What deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses? what shifts? what art and cunning? what craft and subtily, euen among the meanest aswell as the greatest (except here one and there
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:25201:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one, a few amongst many that deale truly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) and all to defeate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the Church of her right: and yet forsooth when they come to pay the tith of their mint and their annise, &amp; cummin, and stubble, and a halfe penny for a shilling: and a shilling for a pound, and a pound for ten, deuouring both fields and flockes, that is, the greatest matters of all, they will say, God forbid, but you should haue your due. And let a Christian Minister demaund, but what the Christian Magistrate hath allowed him: what exclamations shall you heare? what grieuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations of hard dealing? of cruell dealing? a couetous man, neuer content, and I know not wat will ensue? I speake it to warne you my brethren to take heed in time, of such grosse hypocrisie: and to repent of that which is past, and deale vprightly as in the sight of God, who will brooke no such dealing at your hands. It is a point that toucheth the state of our soules, and the hazard of our saluation very nearely: and therefore looke vnto it, as you will answer it vnto God. I doubt not but God will still prouide for his seruants, what his gracious will and pleasure is, as he did for his seruants the Apostles, in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 5.</note> when <hi>Ananias</hi> and his wife played their parts with them, lying vnto the holy Ghost, to saue part of their goods, &amp; to keepe a good opinion amongst men: but God tooke them with the manner, and smote them downe with present death, to shew how he can do with all such as play the like parts. And though he doth not strike all such presently as he did them: yet many of them may sensibly feele Gods hand vppon them, in their goods, or in their bodies, or in their cattell, or one way or other, or hardening their heats, or blinding their eyes, that they cannot repent of their wickednesse, because he reserueth for them (I feare) a more fearefull iudgement.</p>
                  <p>And what else (I pray you) do they but tithe mint, and annise, and cummin, and neglect the greater matters of the law, which in the Church or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth do so vehemently vrge matters of ceremony and circumstance, and in the meane time leaue the principall and most substantiall points of Gods worship vnlooked vnto? What a stirre do some keepe to haue euerie thing in order about the Church, to please the eye and the time withall, but haue no care to haue a learned prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher to instruct their soules in the wayes of life and saluation? What a coile do others keepe about sitting and kneeling at the Communion? and neuer regard the due examination of themselues aforehand, that they may come worthily vnto the same?</p>
                  <p>These and such like matters ought to be done, but the greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ought not to be left vndone. Or else (saith Christ) men are like
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:25201:28"/>
those that straine a gnat and swallow a cammell. Now what a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous iest is it, to see one mince and chew a smal crum of bread for feare of choaking, and yet swallow downe a whole loafe? or to straine the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour that hath a gnat in it, for feare of hurting their iawes, and make no bones of a cammell, which is a huge beast, that is, of a thing that is more then they are able to compasse, without manifest perill and destruction? Such ridiculous hypocrites are they that keepe a great stirre about trisles, and let foule abuses passe by, yea swallow them downe whole.</p>
                  <p>And because we are now entred into the bowels of hypocrisie: giue me leaue a little to cleare my selfe of one thing more, wherein (as in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse others) I haue bene not a little mistaken, and that is this. It is ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured abrode, that I would haue perswaded the Church-officers of this place to dispense with their oath, in not presenting those things which concerne my selfe in my ministerie: which is all one, as if I shold perswade them to be periured, by a witting and willing abusing of the most sacred name of God, whome they haue called to witnesse against their owne soules, if they do not present all things that they are sworn vnto. It is vntrue, and a wickednesse, that I trust God in his mercie wil preserue me from while I liue; but this indeed I said, that in their oath; as in all other oathes that are ministred iudicially, two things are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respected, if they be not expressed: the one is the glorie of God, the other is the good of the Church; which I told them they were in the execution of their office, and in al other presentments to haue a special regard of: aduising them to looke most to those things, that do make most for the aduancing of the glorie of God, and the reformation of the Church of God: as namely, the prophaning of the Lords day, by vnnecessarie working thereupon: by carying of wares vp and downe, and open gaming vpon the Lords day, together with blasphemers, drunkards and vsurers, and negligent commers to the church; al which be foule blots and spots in a Christian congregation: and therin shold God be greatly glorified: and not to let these alone, and stand altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prying into the Minister, for matters of ceremonie and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: as if they were in office for no other end, but to trouble Gods Minister, and to strengthen the hands of the wicked. But forasmuch as God is glorified also in presenting of euery thing that commeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in compasse of their oath, I would haue them answer truly vnto euerie article. And so I say still vnto you that be in office: deale so as God may be glorified, and Gods church may be edified. Leaue this partialitie in doing your office: haue the feare of God before your eyes: and feare
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:25201:28"/>
more to offend his Maiestie by abusing his holy name, then to offend your honest neighbours by winking at their sinnes. I tell you these things plainely, and in loue to your soules (whatsoeuer men iudge of me) I protest before God (if protestations will serue) your courses that you take be not good. God is dishonoured by you, and the Church of God vnreformed. It is seldome that you go abroad to visite mens hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: I meane those that are frozen in their dregges: and when you doe go, it is so vnseasonably, that it were better that you went not at all. You should go at the beginning of common Prayer, and compell men as much as in you lyeth, to come to the general confession and prayers of the Church, and reading of the Scripture, as well as to the Sermon but you tarry till the Sermon beginneth, and then draw out many with you, that would be gladder to heare the Sermon, perhaps then your selues are, and so you hinder both your selues and them too. And by this meanes you offend double, by bringing in an open contempt both of the Sermon and the common prayers of the Church. For what say many? we are a comming: all in good time: the Sermon is not begunne yet: and so you let them alone: as who say, if they come to the Sermon then all is well. Againe by this meanes, behold another inconuenience while men are left to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, to go &amp; come at their own pleasure, the poore are for the most part defrauded of their allowance, because (men comming not in due time) the collectors cannot haue it of them, vnles they would go as vnseasonablie about in the Sermon time, as you do.</p>
                  <p>Againe, when you do go, to whom do you go? or whose houses do you visite? Alas, none but a few poore base Alehouses, and the meaner sort: you dare not go to the richer sort, to the better sort: no, you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to displease them: you say it is not the custome: but they may, and their wiues may, and their seruants may come at their pleasure, and do what they list: and that see the poorer sort, and they thinke they should be suffered as well as the rich. Againe, when you haue visited some few places or persons; what do you? Do you present anie of them? Neuer. Do you take twelue pence apeece of them according to the Statute? Seldome. And there againe the poore are defrauded by your partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And to saie the truth, I do not see with what faces you can present the poore and meaner sort, except you also present the rich, for feare least either periurie or partialitie should flie in your faces. And what are your pretences? Forsooth for the poorer sort: alas they are poore, we haue giuen them warning, &amp;c. as though they haue not had war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning enough, or should from yeare to yeare still be warned, and neuer be spurred forward by the discipline of the Church. And for the richer
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:25201:29"/>
sort, why sir, we see them not, we know them not that do offend: do you know any? Can you tell vs of any? And what a stirre wold here be, if we should be so forward? What, would you haue vs noted aboue all men in the towne? and I know not what. A way with these figge leaues for shame, and looke to your oath sincerely. My brethren leaue this halting, and dissembling, and malicious dealing, and partiall dealing in Gods businesse. For all that deale so, do as hypocrites do: and you know that hypocrisie is detestable in the sight of God. It is no maruell (good brethren) that there be so many Schismaticks,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Schismatiks.</hi>
                     </note> that haue deuided them selues from our congregations, crying out against vs, that we haue no Church amongst vs for want of discipline and gouernement, although therein they be foully deceiued. For they thinke, that because in many places of the land, discipline is either not vsed at all; as where euerie man is let to do what he list: or else abused, as where onely good men are troubled for trifles, or some few of the most inferiour sort, which haue no money to pay, are called in question: that therefore we haue no discipline at all: but they are deceiued greatly. For euen as a rich man hath gold and siluer in his house, though he let it lye and rust, or else mispend it: and as there is a sword in the sheath, though it be not drawne foorth; and power also in the owner thereof to draw it foorth, though he exercise not that power at all, or not aright: euen so in this Church of England is a sword of discipline: that is, Church gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and power in the Ministers and officers of the Church to exercise the same, although in some places it is let rust in the sheath, &amp; in other places perhaps drawne foorth and vsed vnseasonably. But alas many that be ignorant and weake, and yet tender of conscience (howsoeuer most of that sort be caried with a spirit of furie and insolencie) do stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exceedingly at these things: and surely no great maruel, when those that be sworne to present so many things, let all alone, or else turne the edge of the sword against the Ministers of the word, taking, as it were, a pride and felicitie in disgracing and discrediting of them. For (to let passe the corruptions of many which are in place and authoritie to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish faults) surely this is a thing intollerable, for any that are sworne to bring disorders to light, to make no more conscience of their oath, then if the fearefull name of God were a matter of no regard, but to be plaied and dallied withall, or made a cloake for mischiefe and malice, as if God himselfe did either know nothing of your dealings, or had no will or abilitie to punish the same. Neither is it any maruell though the Minister of Christ be had in contempt, and be counted a contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and a troublesome fellow, when those which should second him
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:25201:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with the censurers of the Church are content to let the wicked do what they list, without controulment: nay are as readie to violate Gods orders as others, and assoone as any to misuse Gods Minister for doing of his dutie faithfully. And what will be the end of all this, but a fearefull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God vpon the land, to end the matter withall? As it fell out in the daies of <hi>Zedechiah</hi> king of <hi>Iudah,</hi> in whose daies both he and the Priests, and the people trespassed wonderfully, and heathenishly, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the house of the Lord, euen as in our daies the house of God is pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted and contemned. To redresse this geare, the Lord sent vnto them his messengers, rising early and sending: for he had compassion on his people,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15.16.17.</note> and on his habitation; but they did as we do: <hi>They mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his Prophets, vntill the wrath of the Lord arose against his people,</hi> &amp; till there was no remedy. For he brought vpon them the King of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> who slue their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuarie, and spared neither young man nor virgin, auncient nor aged: God gaue all into his hands. See the 2. of <hi>Chron.</hi> the 36. Chapter, and the 16. and 17. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: to shew vs that though God can beare with manie sinnes, yet he cannot beare with the contempt of his word and Ministers. And thus you see brethren, three foule and fearefull monsters brought forth by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and nursed by the negligence, and couered by the hypocrisie of Church officers: and that is, contempt of discipline and gouernment, Schisme and deuision in the Church, contempt of Gods message and messengers, and all attended vpon with the consuming wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God. If any man shall think that I haue vrged these things too neare, and too particularly applyed this doctrine: let them but seriously consider as before God, what dammage the Church sustaineth by the corrupt and partiall dealing of Church officers, and I hope they will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily confesse, that a Pastor (whome God hath made a watchman to see that none of Christs sheepe be lost or deuoured) by his pastorall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in his owne place, may and ought to say as much as I haue done, yea euen to the Church officers of this place, without offence to any. And I maruel (considering the great mischiefe that ensueth the negligence and counterfeit dealing of Ecclesiasticall officers, and how the fault (when Schismatikes are bred) is returned vpon the Ministers &amp; faithful teachers) that others are so sparing, or no more earnest against them then they are. For if men be ielous ouer their children, &amp; do with great indignation set the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues against those that are means whereby they are bereaued of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea of their cattell, which is lesse. And if the Church ought also to be as iealous ouer her children, (which through the painefull trauels of her
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:25201:30"/>
Ministers haue bene begotten vnto Christ) as men are of theirs: then why should not the Fathers, and nurses, I meane the Ministers of the Churches children, for the Lord Iesus open their mouths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea with great zeale and indignation against those, by whose meanes the members of the Church may and do miscarrie? For why should the Church of Christ be robbed of her children: as this very congregation or flocke hath bene of some since my coming hither, through your negligence that be in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and sworne to bring grosse and noisome abuses to light (the stinke whereof maketh many weake ones to loath their mothers house) and we sit still and hold our peace? But alas sir (will hypocrisie say) what would you haue vs to do? when we present faultes, nothing is reformed: as good let all alone, as get the ill will of our honest neighbours and do no good: money will buy of all, &amp;c. But this is too open a net to daunce in, when all the world shall see, that the least part of the hypocrites care, is to reforme grosse abuses, to do good indeed, and with a religious heart zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously to maintaine the glorie of God: but rather bend all their studie to serue the time, to please men, and to crosse the truth. Nay rather if mens hearts be vpright with God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iosh.</hi> 14.</note> they are of <hi>Iosuahs</hi> mind, who said, <hi>Though all Israel will not, yet I and my house shall serue the Lord</hi>: so, though no man else will make a conscience of their oath or office, yet we will: and so do I pray you. For if others will be remisse, and partiall, and corrupted when you haue presented faults, and will swallow those Cammels, that you bring out of their stables: that is their sinne, and they shall answere for it. But if you faile in your dutie, seeing and not seeing, straining gnats and swallowing of camels: that is your sinne, and you shall answere it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; for euery one shall beare his owne burden. And therefore in the feare of God, let vs looke euery one of vs better vnto in then we haue done: and repent of that which is past, that God in Christ Iesus may be mercifull vnto vs.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue hitherto heard, how vaineglorie, and hypocrisie do defile all our good actions before God: and how by taking heede, vaineglorie is to be auoyded. The reward likewise of sinceritie we haue seene, and in part the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of hypocrisie; according to the intent and purpose of our Sauiour Christ, who both describeth hypocrites vnto vs in their colours, and in so doing doth plainely tell vs, that he would haue the doings and qualities of hypocrites to be made known vnto the world. To which end it is necessary, that the hypocrite be vncased and viewed well in the light, that euery one espying his vgly visage, and taking good markes of him, may beware of him, auoide his conditions, and escape his punishment. And this worke (as you know good brethren) I called the vncasing of the hypocrite, wherein I shewed you first what is hypocrisie: namely, a counterfeiting of religion, or any religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or a doing of that which we do onely to be seene of men, and yet seeme to be such as would approue our waies in the sight of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing the loue and feare of God, when there is no such matter in vs. For which cause they are most fitly compared to players, who make a shew of doing that which they do not indeede, and represent those persons which they are not. Next, how many kinds of hypocrites there be, some being publike, some priuate, some religious, some ciuill. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we tooke a particular view of some speciall hypocrisies, described by our Sauiour Christ in the 23. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> from the 14. verse to the 23. whereof the last was of them, that seeme to make a conscience of trifles, and none of waightie matters, which Christ calleth straining of gnats, and swallowing of camels: all which for breuities sake I do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, because there are many mo yet behind to be vncased: whose acts and monuments are truely recorded: whose visages and pictures are plainely deciphered, and whose bowels and inward parts are deepely searched, and whose iuglings and dissemblings are all fully discouered by Christ the searcher of hearts, in the forenamed 23. chapter of <hi>Mathew,</hi> and diuerse other places beside. Wherein our Sauiour Christ we see is
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:25201:31"/>
not sparing but plentifull, not mild but seuere, not short but long, not negligent but painefull, and neuer hath done with them, but euer anone meeteth with them, remembreth them, and neuer lets them passe vntill he hath marked them with his blacke cole of deepe dislike and deadly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, and still warning his disciples to beware of hypocrits, and their leuin of hypocrisie, whereof but a little sowreth and spoileth the whole lumpe. Now seeing our Sauiour Christ bendeth all his force as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst hypocrisie, and the doings of hypocrites: I see no reason that any should be offended that I do so too. For hypocrisie in religion is like <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> amongst the disciples, a faire spoken theefe, but a cunning and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous traitor, readie still to betray both Christ and all Christianitie into the hands of their enemies: onely she saith, as <hi>Esau</hi> said: <hi>The dayes of mourning for my father will come shortly, and then I will kill my brother Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>: that is, I onely want and waite a time to do my feates in.</p>
                  <p>Besides those actes which our Sauiour Christ hath alreadie noted in the Scribes and Pharises to the 25. verse of the 23. of <hi>Mathew,</hi> we find in the verses following diuerse other parts of their hypocrisie, seuerely taxed, and liuely described by him, whereof some be <hi>in actu,</hi> some <hi>in potentia</hi>: that is, some be present, and some are to come. By the former he sheweth what is alwaies the present behauiour of hypocrites, euen when they are at the best: by the latter he prophecieth what they will be when time shal serue, and that he sheweth in the 34. verse: where he saith: that <hi>they</hi> (which now for the present do garnish the sepulchers of the righteous) <hi>shall one day both kill and crucifie, scourge and persecute both Prophets and wise men, in their sinagogues, and from citie to citie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for the present thus it is with them. First, they make cleane the outside of the cup and platter:<note place="margin">

Christs meaning is, that all hypocrites care is to approue themselues in the sight of men, by setting faire shewes vpon euery thing, but before God they are most wicked &amp; abominable: like the harlot, who to please straungers is very diligent and carefull, and towards others is very courteous, and sober, and kind, but towards her owne husband is most sauage, impudent and shamelesse.</p>
                  <p>In the next place Christ sheweth, what friends and welwillers hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are vnto the Prophets, that is, to the Preachers of Gods word: but you must note, that is to them that were dead: and that they are great

friends to them, appeareth two waies. First, by the cost that they are at in decking their Tombes. Secondly, by blaming of their forefathers, by whom the Prophets were persecuted and iniuried while they were aliue. And thus would they get a good opinion amongst men, by reuerencing the memorie of the Prophets and holy men of God. For while they did thus counterfeit a loue vnto their persons, they seemed to yeeld to their doctrine: and who would not take them now for most faithfull fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of their doctrine, and most zealous seruants and worshippers of God? It was a thing very plausible to decke the Tombes of the Prophets, and to erect monuments for them. For by this meanes, saith <hi>Caluin:</hi>

                     <hi>quasi ex tenebris eruebatur religio vt in suo honore staret</hi>: religion was as it were plucked out of darkenesse and set vp in her due honour. But indeede they meant nothing lesse then to restore the doctrine of the Prophets, which by their death might seeme to be put out. And yet being both straungers vnto the propheticall doctrine, and also most deadly enemies vnto the same, they wold bestow goodly Tombs vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being dead, as though that they and the Prophets had stood both for one and the same cause.</p>
                  <p>And this saith <hi>Caluin,</hi> is vsuall with hypocrites, to honour the holy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, &amp; pure teachers of the word after their death, whom they could not endure being aliue. And for this M. <hi>Caluin</hi> doth yeeld a very singular good reason. This cometh not only from the corrupt custom of the vulgar people, saith he: <hi>sed quia duris &amp; seueris correptionibus molesti, ampliùs non sunt mortui cineres, non agrè in illis colendis euanida<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religionis vmbram ostentant qui loquentiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vocibus ad insaniam aguntur.</hi> But because their dead dust and ashes are no longer troublesome vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with hard and sharpe reproofes: therfore it doth not grieue them to make shew of a vanishing shadow of religion, in reuerencing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being dead, who were driuen to madnes &amp; rage with their liuely voices. The world (because it durst not wholly despise God, or at least rise vp openly against him, as it were in armes) hath inuented this deuice to worship the shadow of God for God himself: &amp; in like maner doth reuerence the shadow of the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers &amp; Prophets for the doctrine it selfe. What need we go any further for an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of this play, then to the Popish church? who are not content with that lawfull and due reuerence that is giuen to the Apostles &amp; bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Martyrs of Christ: but will bestow most impiously vpon them that worship that is due to God: and professe that they cannot honour them inough: when in the meane time by their raging against the faithfull, (which follow their steppes and doctrine ) they do plainely shew howe they would vse the Apostles and Martyrs, if they were now aliue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and did performe that dutie which they did when they were on
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:25201:32"/>
earth. For why else do they with such rage burne and flame out against vs, but because we desire to haue that doctrine to be receiued, and to flourish, which the Apostles and Martyrs haue sealed with their bloud? Let them then a dorne the images of the Saints, with their frankensence, candels, flowers, and all kind of pompe as long as they list, saith <hi>Caluin</hi>: if <hi>Peter</hi> were now aliue they would surely pull him in peeces: if <hi>Paule</hi> were amongst them, they would certainely stone him: if Christ himselfe were aliue and amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they wold rost him to death with a softfire.</p>
                  <p>And do not diuerse Protestants play the same part? who will seeme to make much of some Preachers: and giue them good entertainment, as <hi>Herod</hi> did <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and yet persecute with might and maine their owne Pastors for teaching the same doctrine which they do? Or for the couering and cloking of their speciall and beloued sinnes, will seeme to the world to be religious, by hearing the preaching, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining of the persons of Preachers at their houses, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues then safe,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Verse</hi> 33.</note>In the 33. verse of the former 23. Chapter, Christ (being about to conclude his Sermon) doth more plainly vncase these hypocrites, and layeth them wide open to all the world, telling what they are, what they must looke for, and what his seruants must look for at their hands. What they are he sheweth, when he saith: <hi>O Serpents and generation of vipers!</hi> to shew, that they were not only enemies to the doctrine of the Prophets, but most pestilent enemies to the whole church of God, and like vipers will not sticke to eate out the very bowels of the Church their mother, to maintaine their owne state and pride. What they must trust vnto if they truly repent not, he sheweth, when he saith: <hi>how should ye escape the damnation of hell?</hi> As if it were a thing almost impossible for professed hypocrites to repent and be saued. So hypocrites we see by Christs example are to be handled, though they be the great mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>Israel</hi>: their vizards are to be plucked off, and they are to be laid open to the view of the world, and to be haled by force as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tribunall seate of Gods iudgement. What Gods seruants must looke for at hypocrites hands when time shall serue (howsoeuer they seeme now to heare them, and to entertaine them) our Sauiour Christ sheweth, when he saith, he will send Prophets and wise men, and Scribes among them, that is, men endued with all manner of learning,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:25201:32"/>
and qualified with aboundance of Gods graces: but they shal scourge them and persecute them from citie to citie:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse.</hi> 34.37.</note> yea euen in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Lords Prophets shall be killed, and the messengers of the most high shall be stoned to death. In times past their rage was such against the holy Prophets, that neither the holinesse of the Temple, nor reuerence of the Altar, whereupon the sacrifices were offered, could stay them from shedding of innocent bloud. As for example: the bloud of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> the sonne of <hi>Barachias,</hi> meaning indeede him, that was the son of <hi>Iehoiada</hi> the priest, whom Christ calleth <hi>Barachias,</hi> that is, the blessed of the Lord: of <hi>Barach</hi> and <hi>ias,</hi> which is, the blessed of the Lord, as M. <hi>Caluin</hi> noteth; because he had spent his whole life in the worship and seruice of God. And this is vsuall in Scripture, to giue vnto men besides their proper names, other names of speciall signification, either for their consolation, or for their humiliation. So <hi>Iacob</hi> was called <hi>Israel,</hi> that is, preuailing with God:<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.22.</note> and <hi>Salomon, Iedidah,</hi> that is beloued of the Lord: and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn, Boanerges,</hi> that is, sonnes of thunder: and <hi>Iehoiada, Barachias,</hi> that is, the blessed of the Lord. So <hi>terroris gratia,</hi> to terrifie him, <hi>Bashur</hi> that misused <hi>Ieremy,</hi> was called <hi>Magor Misabib,</hi> that is, feare on euery side. And <hi>Naoim</hi> in the bitternesse of her soule, would be called <hi>Marah,</hi> that is, bitternesse. But now to the matter of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iehoiada Barachias,</hi> the blessed of the Lord. Of whose mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome and the cause thereof, we may reade sufficiently in the second of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the 24. chapter, from the 17. verse vnto the 23. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in time to come they which now boasted of the Prophets Tombes amongst them: and of learned Preachers in their sinagogues, should through the iust vengeance of God, be giuen vp to such a reprobate mind, that they should shew all kind of raging crueltie against the same Prophets, whom they so much seemed to reuerence. God graunt this prophesie may neuer take place amongst vs, if it be his will: but surely it is much to be feared, that if time should turne, and religion alter (which our sinnes haue iustly deserued) it will proue too true. For hypocrites will play the hypocrites, and shew them selues in their colours when all is done: euen as the Blackmoore will be blacke, if all the water in the sea were spent in washing him. For they that are so forward now in colour of their office and pretence of lawe, to abuse Gods Ministers, as many be: what would they do, if they had Prince and Prelates, and lawe, and all to backe them? They that now in the publike and authorized profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Gospell, (and vnder the gouernment of so gracious and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian a Prince as we haue, who esteemeth of the true Ministers of Christ in the Church, as of the soule in the bodie, the Lord long preserue her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:25201:33"/>
vs) are not ashamed to contriue wicked plots, and diuellish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises, to call their Ministers names into question, by suggesting vnto great persons, most impudent lyes and shamefull slaunders, and that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of their office, and vpon the credite of their oath. They that now so abound in malice against their Minister, for speaking but the truth, that when they can find no matter against him at home, can send an hundred miles for matters obiected and answered, ended and finished ten yeares ago, and to reuiue matters whith haue bene dead and buried so long time, like those that in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time, digged vp <hi>Bucers</hi> bones out of the graue, to endite them and burne them: what cruell per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors would these become if time did serue? What would not these men do against the poore seruants of Christ if Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time shold come againe? except God did giue them repentance, and work a strange alteration. God deliuer me out of their handes, and giue them better minds if it be his will. It were a strange alteration to see some that now bring Bibles to the Church, and turne to places after the Preacher, one day to be instruments to burne so many Bibles as they can come by. It were strange to see such as are now most attentiue in hearing the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and most kind in giuing him entertainment, one day to throw a faggot at his head, or to be a witnesse against his doctrine, or to helpe to burne him? Well, such times haue bene, and such times may come again for our sinnes: and then shall the approued be knowne, as the Apostle speaketh, and hypocrites with their light and chaffie profession shall then be discouered, &amp; blowne away with the wind. Many now would answer as <hi>Hazael</hi> did to the Prophet,<note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 8.12.13.</note> if any should say to them as the Prophet said to him. <hi>I weepe,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>to remember what thou shalt do to the children of Israel when thou art king of Aram, how thou shalt burne their cities. and put their young men to the sword, and dash their infants in peeces, and rent their women with child. What?</hi> said <hi>Hazael, is thy seruant a dogge, that I should do this great thing?</hi> So would many answere now (no doubt:) Are we dogges, that we should so vse God seruants, &amp;c? No doubt of it, in King <hi>Edwards</hi> daies, he that should haue warned some persons of such things, that were hearers of those reuerend Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Bishops, <hi>Hooper, Latimer, Ridley, Cranmer,</hi> &amp; other faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters. D. <hi>Taylor, Bradford,</hi> and others, they would haue bene at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet for al that, they (when time serued) stood foorth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse these godly Fathers, &amp; to persecute them to death, that a man wold litle haue thought of be actors in such ttagedies. Wel, God blesse vs all my brethren, &amp; keep vs in his holy feare, and make vs vpright harted, &amp; constant in the profession of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for I do feare greatly else, that if euer
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:25201:33"/>
time should serue (which God for his mercies sake forbid, if it be his will) too too many would play <hi>Hazaels</hi> part, though they make a faire shew now, and stand at open defiance for such matters. Well, let no man bragge of his own strength, that he will do this, and he will not do that: for manie good men, euen sincere Christians, may promise and vowe a standing for the truth with <hi>Peter,</hi> and because they rely vppon their owne strength, may fall with <hi>Peter</hi>: but I trust God will giue them mercie and repentance to rise againe with <hi>Peter:</hi> but as for hypocrites and time-seruers, whose hearts are best knowne vnto God, out of question, they will then shew themselues in their colours. Let them now pretend with <hi>Iudas</hi> neuer so much care for the poore, or loue to Christ, they will one day proue theeues to the poore, and tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to Christ, as <hi>Iudas</hi> did: and if they once fall with <hi>Iudas,</hi> let them take heed that they hang not themselues with <hi>Iudas,</hi> for betraying and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting innocent bloud. For it is not the approbation of the Elders that will iustifie <hi>Iudas,</hi> nor his officious kisse that will couer him, nor the law of the land that will warrant him, nor the siluer bribe that will enrich him, nor the praise of men that wil comfort him, nor his forced restitution that wil restore him, nor his constrained confession that will conuert him, nor his faithlesse repentance that will saue him; when his money, &amp; his friends, &amp; his owne tongue, and heart, &amp; hand, &amp; conscience, as a thousand witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and God himselfe shall be against him, God grant that all counterfeits and hypocrites, and dissemblers in religion, may in time take heede by his example. There be many both honest and godly religious Christans, whose desire is, with all their harts to please God, by doing those things which his word requireth of them. And these for the loue that they beare vnto the truth, and their hatred that they carry against wickednesse, are by an odious name called Puritanes: and if they fall at any time through occasion, as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times they do through some infirmity against their wils, then are they condemned as hypocrites, but most vniustly. For though all our actions smell of hypocrisie, as maister <hi>Bradford</hi> well perceiued, when he desired the Lord to forgiue him all his hypocrisies, and confessed a little before his death, that all his prayers, and all his best ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of God were but hypocrisie, meaning in comparison of that since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie that is required of euerie Christian: yet notwithstanding are none to be tearmed hypocrites, which fall by occasion through infirmitie, and are onely stained with the dust of it, and infected with the contagion thereof, as men that draw in one and the same aire with hypocrites: but onely such are to be counted for hypocrites,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:25201:34"/>
which make a shew of that which they are not, nor meane to be, but with their tongues can hold men cunningly with a faire tale of religion and godlinesse, while their hearts are resolued to practise all kind of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe and iniquitie: of such I speake, and not of simple harted and well meaning Christians, who haue (no doubt) their faults as well as other men, though they make not an art of sinning as hypocrites do.</p>
                  <p>This secret hypocrisie of Gods children doth not a litle trouble ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, neither can many be perswaded but that all that they do is done in hypocrisie, as maister <hi>Bradford</hi> writing to one of his friends, in most of his letters condemneth himselfe for a painted hypocrite, and being thus troubled in their tender consciences, they are still afraide of that woe, that our Sauiour Christ pronounceth against hypocrites. But for the comforting of such tender consciences (whose feare is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that they shall not deale vprightly and sincerely inough in Gods sight) we are to distinguish of hypocrisie: for some hypocrisie respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth men onely, seeking only praise of men and not of God: and some hypocrie there is that respecteth God also, yea most of all, and that stealeth in this fort vpon vs. A Christian that feareth God goeth in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate by himselfe to call vpon God, by prayer. Now in his priuate prayer, somtime his mind is drawne away into a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of by-thoughts and wandering imaginations, insomuch as he oftentimes thinkes least of God, when he calleth vpon him, neither is throughly moued with an inward desire of obtaining those things that he prayeth for, nor with a hartie loathing of those sins that he prayeth against: then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Sathan and suggesteth thus: Surely thou art an hypocrite, for thou hast not prayed with all thy heart, nor with all thy soule, nor with all thy might. Againe, sometime the Christian soule prayeth earnestly, with great feeling and groning of spirite, and hath his mind wholy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and bent vpon God, that he is euen rauished, as it were in prayer, thinking of nothing but heauenly things, &amp; when he hath done goeth his way, thinking with himselfe that he hath done very well, and no doubt but God doth highly commend him for it: and flattereth and commendeth his own heart for so doing. The like corrupt thoughts &amp; motions, shall we feele in performing other holy duties of reading our task in the Bible, or meditating or giuing secret almes, &amp;c. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we bewaile these corruptions, yet stil we shal be readie to think wel of our selues for it: as one that wept bitterly for his secret hipocrisie, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was troubled because he thought he shold be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for that. In a word, whatsoeuer the Lord worketh in vs, or by vs, we are readie straightway to thinke well of our selues for it: euen this secret hypocrisie is a sinne
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:25201:34"/>
and a great staine, and is the last sinne that shall be subdued in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and needeth also great repentance, and must be washed away by faith in the merits of Christs bloud. I deny not, but that a Christian soul may reioyce and take comfort vnto himself in the performance of such holy duties in priuate, for that it is a liuely signe of the sanctifying grace of Gods spirit with him: but yet there is matter sufficient to humble him remaining, if he doth not still continually returne all the glory vnto God, and not thinke the better of himselfe in so doing neither. But this is not that grosse hypocrisie against which I deale all this while vpon this next, nor against which Christ crieth woe so often, for that is a domineering sinne in the wicked, who study to do al that they do to be seene of men: and thereunto (to blind the eyes of the world) bend all their wits: and yet for the most part do not so much as once thinke, neither will they be knowne to play the hypocrites: these make an art of sinne, and thinke they do well to liue thereby.</p>
                  <p>Now those that make an art of sinne, and put on profession of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion for their cloake, deale artificially indeed, for being giuen to lying and dissembling, they will inuey egerly against lying and dissembling, like the theefe who hauing found more money about the true man then he would be acknowne of, cried out, Good Lord what a world is this, whom can a man beleeue now a dayes? Art thou not ashamed to lye? diddest not thou tell me thou haddest no more? &amp;c. when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he was busie in committing of his robbery. Againe, they will extoll &amp; commend humility, &amp; condemne the proud to the pit of hel, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold think they were the meekest men in the world, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all the matter is to haue all submission and reuerence shewed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as an vsurer of <hi>Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> who willed the preacher to cry out against vsury, that all might come to him for money. Againe, they will not sticke to frequent Sermons, to commend honest men, to intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues into good company, &amp; all to make the world beleeue that they are such themselues, as they are whom they do commend, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse withall. If you bewaile the corruptions of the time, they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile them asmuch as you. If you condemne hypocrisie and dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they can do it as iudicially as you. If you speake of the Ministers duty, they can tell it as well as you. If you alledge Scripture for proofe of any matter, they can be as deepe in Scripture as you. If you will be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle or amongst the Apostles, they are for you: nay they will go a little beyond you and them too, they wil ease you al of your burden, and care: for none shall carry the bagge nor make the prouision but they, because they meane with their brother <hi>Iudas</hi> to play two parts in one, that is:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:25201:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the tray-God, and the theefe too.</p>
                  <p>Is this true will you say? how shall we then know hypocrites from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Christians? if we cannot know them, how then shall we auoide them?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 7.</note> Well inough: by their fuites you shall know them, sayth Christ, speaking of those that are sheep without and wolues within, as all hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites be, by their fruits you shal know them. To shew that we must wait a time for the matter, for fruite is not presently ripe so soone as it sowne, but it must haue a time to bud, and to blossome, and to harden, and to ripen: and then taste it, when it is ripe, and you shall then by it know what name to call the tree by. One of you is a diuell sayth Christ, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Iudas,</hi> and one of you shall betray me. Now when Christ sayd that <hi>Iudas</hi> was a diuell, the same <hi>Iudas</hi> was a grosse hypocrite, but it was not knowne vnto men vntill he had betraied his maister, and hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. There was a time for <hi>Iudas</hi> to conceiue diuellish purposes, and there was a time to bring forth the same. So hypocrites haue a time to conceiue mischiefe, which lyeth hidden in the heart, like the infant in the mothers belly, but when the fulnesse of time commeth, forth it must come, and cannot be dissembled any longer, no more then it is possible for a woman to keepe her infant within her, beyond the appointed time of nature. God knoweth them now, and men shall know them hereafter. God seeth when the seed is sowne, how it groweth, and how it ripeneth: yea he knoweth the thoughts of mens hearts long before they are.</p>

for the sauing of his credite before men, in performing of a wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, rashly made to a lewd wanton, he careth not to shed the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud of the man of God, whom before he seemed to reuerence: then is <hi>Herods</hi> fruite ripe, taste it now, and tell me if he was not an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite: and are not all they such hypocrites, as do to their power as he did, though not in that degree and measure of iniquitie? We are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours of the Gospell say some, and we like our Preachers doctrine well, but our honest neighbours please vs better, and our beloued va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities best of all. We liue by them, and we are sory that we cannot do for him as we would, for we haue passed our word against him: so was <hi>Herod</hi> sory too, for that he had passed his promise. And to keepe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite with those that haue pleased, and pleasured vs, we must not call backe our words: so sayd <hi>Herod</hi> too, but vncase the hypocrite a little, and view him well. First, if thou wilt be counted a true Christian, and a sincere professor of the truth, why doest thou lodge any one sinne with delight in thy heart? tell me that: If thou saiest there is no such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then tell me why doest thou frequent the companie, and take such excessiue pleasure in the bewitching vanities of such persons, as will snare thee, and deceiue thee? Then: why art thou so rash as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise thou knowest not what? Then: when thou seest that thou art in danger of committing wickednesse, who can compell thee to keepe such a wicked promise? Oh I must keepe my credite with men. Oh but hypocrite, first keepe credite with God, and remember thy former promise that thou madest and vowedst to him in thy Baptisme: if all this will not serue, then rush on like an hypocrite, vncased to thy owne destruction.</p>
                  <p>Many in the world are content they say, to heare the Preacher, so long as he preacheth Christ crucified, or else not: and surely no reason. But open this case, and see if a counterfeit may not be vnder it. For, many are content to sinne freely, and set all vpon Christs score: saying, he shall pay for all. If any man meaneth so when he biddeth the preacher preach Christ crucified, then there is an hypocrite vncased. Many are content to heare that Christ liued in pouertie to enrich them, that he was abased to aduance them, that he was punished to acquite them, that he was moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to grace them, that he was naked to clothe them, that he was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie to fill them, that he was cursed to blesse them, &amp; that he died to saue them: but to heare that they must be poore for his sake, and be abased for his sake, and to be mocked for his sake, and to be crucified for his sake, and crucifie their sinnes which crucified him, they cannot abide; this is not to preach Christ crucified. Christ crucified must dispense with some
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:25201:36"/>
sinnes of theirs, or else they haue done with him: nay if Christ come now to crucifie their beloued sinne, and their sweete sinne, and their profitable sinne, let Christ take heed that he be not crucified againe by them. What? is Christ crucified for vs? and must we haue our sinnes crucified too? nay we will none of that: we are content to take a place in his kingdom at his right hand and his left hand, but to baptized with his baptisme, and to drinke of his cup, we will not endure. We will do any thing he will haue vs to do, sauing that which goeth about to restraine vs of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: we will follow him, heare him, eate and drinke with him, giue him leaue to pay all, and to dye for vs, and commend him for his kindnesse, but to be so kind to him, as for his loue to part with one sinne, that we are in loue withall, to leaue following the fashions of the world, or to part with a locke of haire, is a hard saying: who can abide it? To forgiue our enemies, to lend freely, to releeue the poore cheerfully, to keepe the Sabbath wholy and entirely, to leaue our pleasures at his call, to heare his doctrine more then ordinarie, is a hard saying, who can abide it? To leaue our false weights, and false lights, and false oathes, and false friendship, and to deale simply, and plainely, without fraud and deceit, is a hard say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: who can abide it? To leaue our engrossing, our forestalling, our cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and dissembling, our back-biting and slandering, our rash iudging, and condemning of our brethren, is a hard saying, who can abide it? To forsake the filthy fellowship of profane persons, to cast off the company of scoffers, and deriders of religion, to embrace the truth sincerely, and to make much of those that feare God, be they neuer so poore or simple, is a hard saying, who can abide it? To be checked for our swearing and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of Gods name, to be called vppon for Catechizing our hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and to vse thanksgiuing at the table, and singing of Psalmes for our spirituall recreation, and to conferre soberly and friendly of the Sermon, is plaine Puritanisme (as they call it) who can abide it? No, no, Sir, we can no skill of this geare: preach Christ crucified, and we will heare you, otherwise not: we cannot away with this doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Well, but let the hypocrites know, that if Christ crucified be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched rightly, and applied truly to the conscience, he will make all the veines in the hypocrites heart to ake, he will suffer him to haue but small rest in his bed, and little list to his meate, and lesse pleasure in the world, and least of all in the word of God: for that in the end is the iudgement of God vpon hypocrites, to loath the word because it goeth about to make sinne loathsome vnto them. Christ crucified hath wrought a double worke, he hath both destroyed the Diuell, and also the worke of the Diuell. And so is Christ to be preached,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:25201:36"/>
both crucified and crucifying, crucified for our sinnes, and also by his vertue and Spirite crucifying sinne in vs, or else we cannot be saued.</p>

Such a one was <hi>Herod,</hi> who craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily sent for the wise men to enquire where Christ was borne, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a mind to worship him, when his purpose was to kill him. Such are all close Church-papists, and time-seruers, who to please men do as the most do: but in the meane time by all crafty deuises do vndermine the Church, the Preachers, and cause them to be troubled for toyes &amp; trifles in comparison, to stop the course of the Gospell &amp; in the meane time pretend a care of the obseruation of lawes, which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues break as freely as any other, and regard as much as the horse or mule, whose mouthes must be holden in with bit and bridle. Such also are those that come to the Sermon, in shew very deuoutly, and to be edified; but in deede only to watch and catch, at a word and a halfe, taking only what will serue their turne (like the diuell himselfe) to intangle thereby the preacher, if they like him not. You shal haue many of these come order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and marke attentiuely, as if they would latch euery word with their mouthes, but as it was with the Prophet <hi>Ezechiels</hi> auditors, so is it with them, their harts runne another way, and they meane not to follow any thing that is giuen in charge: and therefore when they are gone, with their mouthes they make iestes of the Sermon. And to the Minister of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:25201:37"/>
Christ commonly their answer is: you do well sir, to tell vs our dutie, and to tell euery man his owne: well fare your heart, you do well sir, you do well to discharge your conscience: and if we do not as you bid vs, that is our fault, we must answer for it: and though we do as our honest neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourt do, yet we hope God is a good God, &amp; will hold vs excused, he is not so hard as many would make men beleeue. The last sort of open hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites that are not yet vncased, are common cauillers, &amp; deprauers of the truth, and of those that teach the same. Some carpe and cauil at that which they vnderstand but like not, as the Lawyer in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.

                     </note> Doth he so? verily the greater is his sinne, if he doth so. But if those be Gods quarels which thou cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest his quarrels, and if that be spoken in the euidence of the Spirite, &amp; with plaine demonstration of the truth, which thou sayest is in malice against thee, then is it euident that thou hast played the grosse hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, so vncharitably to accuse, so rashly to iudge, and so wrongfully to condemne the Minister of the truth: and pretendest thou carest not what: and all to put by the blow of Gods sword, that so thy sinne might not be launced, and yet in the meane time be a professour of religion. And what art thou oh man (sayth the Scripture) that thou iudgest ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans seruant, whose heart is knowne to his God, and not to thee, and to God he either standeth or falleth, and not to thee? Alas this is an old obiection and slaunder of great antiquity, common to all the true Preachers of the word: and it hath euer bene the common practise of all hypocrites, which meant to liue and dye in their sinnes, when they knew not what to say for themselues, and fearing that the truth would choke them if they should swallow it, to cast it vp againe: saying, that it was spoken of malice and reuenge. So played king <hi>Achab,</hi> who had sold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to worke wickednesse: he could not deny but that <hi>Micaiah</hi> was a true Prophet, a plaine dealing man, but yet he could not away with him: and why so? forsooth because he doth not prophecie good but euill vnto me: that is, he speakes that that likes me not: so many cry now adaies, he hath not the good-wil of his hearers: and why? because he doth not seek to please them, he is too tart, he hath a bitter spirite, he doth not heale but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:25201:37"/>
wound: they do not complaine that he hath a flattering spirite, or a lying spirite, or a soothing spirite, or a fearefull spirite, or a pleasing spirite: for all this hypocrites can away withall well inough, because such a spirite is toothsome: but that he hath a quicke and sharpe spirite, and his reproofes are sensible and bitter, this is wholesome, but not tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and therefore not to be brooked of hypocrites. But now let vs consider my brethren whether this will go for currant payment in the day of the Lord or no: Why hast thou cast my word behind thy backe, will the Lord say? Our aunswer will be, because we did not loue him that deliuered it. But why did you hate him? Because he did not please vs. Not please you, why? did he preach errours and lyes? No, we could not find any fault with his doctrine, that is sound: but yet we cannot away with him, he was too plaine and round with vs. Too plaine? why that was for your good, if <hi>planè</hi> and <hi>sanè,</hi> if both plaine and sound. Oh but Lord we like not his life, he was couetous, and hard, and proud, and had no loue in him, he was not sociable, no good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, not one of his neighbours do loue him. Well shall the Lord say, thine own conscience thou hypocrite, shal giue euidence against thee, and conuict thee of false witnesse bearing against many of my seruants in these respects, &amp; if I now do acquite them, what are they the worse for thy bad constructions and hard words? And if thy conscience do now proue to thy face that all these allegations were but counterfeit deuises to couer thy sinne withall, what art thou the better though all thy neighbours take thy part, for thou knowest: and I know it much more, that many of my seruants haue sought peace at thy hands, and then hast thou prepared thy selfe to warre: they haue vsed all good meanes to procure thy loue and good liking in the truth, and thou hast then construed euery thing in the worst part against them that thou couldest imagine: to their faces thou hast spoken faire words, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backes thou hast vsed all lying &amp; slanderous speeches, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou hast made them odious in the world: &amp; when they would haue taken al paines to do thy soule good, thou hast complotted by al waies and meanes to discourage them, and to greeue and quench my spirite in them. So doe hypocrites which loue not the pure light of truth, and so hast thou done. And admit that all this were true which thou pretendest, yet so long as they came in my name vnto thee, &amp; with my message, reuealed in my word, which thou couldest not disproue, but carpe at, yet oughtest thou to haue heard them, &amp; to beleeue them, and to feare at my word comming out of their mouthes, &amp; in charity to haue iudged the best of their affections, or praied for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: knowing that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:25201:38"/>
I which am the searcher of the hart, would surely call them to reckning for their affections, if they were not vpright in my sight: but now in that thou hast deuised mischiefe of thine owne head, and put it before thee as a stumbling blocke of purpose to fall vpon, and to cause others to fall with thee: &amp; seeing as thou hast through my seruants sides, euen pierced my name, &amp; my glory, and not stayed there, but pearked vp <hi>Lucifer</hi>-like into my seate, to sit as a peremptory Iudge ouer the hearts &amp; affections of my seruants, when thou hadst no list to yeeld to the truth, to confesse thy faults, &amp; amend thy life, how canst thou deny but that thou art guilty of most saucy and insolent hypocrisie? Moreouer, when thou likedst not the plaine &amp; simple vtterance of my truth, &amp; the confirmation thereof by the sacred testimony of my seruants the Prophets &amp; Apostles, it hath pleased thee ô hipocrite to count my serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts no scholers, but vnlearned &amp; ignorant fooles, as though my booke contained nothing in it but ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous matter for thee to make thy selfe merry withall. So hath it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bin with all hypocrites since the world stood: my wisedom hath bin counted foolishnesse, &amp; mans folly high wisedome, but thou shalt know, that they were truly learned which had learned Christ aright, &amp; they were fooles who in the swelling words of mans wisedome haue sought onely to feede thy eares and not thy conscience. Furthermore, I forget not thy hypocriticall shew of maintaining false loue, and vnitie, and peace with the wicked, vnder pretence that the Preachers whom I haue sent vnto thee, haue bin condemned by thee and thy consort, for troublesom &amp; contentious persons, when they haue disquieted thy sin. But let not my seruants be discouraged in my businesse for all this, saith the Lord, <hi>For so did they vse my Prophets before them. Ieremy</hi> was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but a babler,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Oh but me thinks now the hypocrite being thus vncased, beginneth to pleade hard for himselfe, saying, that though he come not at those troublesome fellowes, &amp; vnlearned, yet he heareth others and maketh much of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too, so that he is wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gfully charged, if men say that he cares not for the word of God, that he is not religious, that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abide to haue his sins reproued, &amp;c.

Now as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to separate man &amp; wife, but fornication or adultery: so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to make the flocke leaue their Pastor, but false doctrine &amp; heresie, if he be a teacher. And surely there is no sincere harted Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but maketh a conscience of this duty: that is, they dare not leaue the Ministery of their owne ordinary Pastours, by whom they haue sound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profit or spirituall comfort: they dare not so much as yeeld to any such changes, for feare they should not onely be troubled with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall itch of the eare, a disease (where it once rooteth) altogether incure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but also discourage and make sad the Spirite of God in their faithfull teachers, whereby they may in time be giuen vp of God to flatterers and seducing teachers, fit for their humorous veine &amp; vaine humor.

vnto our Lord and Maister Christ Iesus. This humorous course of giddy braines and itching eares is both schismaticall, childish, and vnprofitable. Schismaticall, because they go about to make a rent in the Church of God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note> and to deuide Christ among them. This disease raigned in <hi>Paules</hi> time, and it raigneth in our time. I hold of <hi>Paul,</hi> saith one: I am of <hi>Apollos,</hi> saith another: and <hi>Cephas</hi> shall go for my money, sayth a third. But neuer a one of those hold of Christ soundly and substantially. But what is this but to deuide Christ? as the Apostle saith, <hi>is Christ deuided</hi>? as if he should say, you all would be counted Christs, and to hold of Christ: if you do so, why then do you not regard all his Ministers alike, and heare all alike? <hi>Paule</hi> as well as <hi>Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> as well as <hi>Cephas,</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> as well as either of the other: for euerie one of them preacheth Christ, though euery one after his seuerall gift and measure of knowledge, and vtterance, and eloquence. &amp;c. Though one be milder then another, and one sharper then another; yea though one mans gift please your humour better then anothers, yet euery one hath Christ for you. But now as if one had Christ and another not, ye will heare one and not another, and so you deuide Christ which is but one: this is not: well are you not carnall? nay are you not Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes?</p>
                  <p>As it is a carnall and schismaticall practise, so is it also childish: for so do children that go to schoole, being once held in to their bookes, and restrained of their libertie, they are weary of that Maister, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to go to another, or else no more to schoole: so hypocrites when they are required to take a setled course for their profiting in religion, and are restrained of their liberty, in sinne, in vanity, in riot, in pride; and are pressed with the doctrine of mortification and truth of heart, they are weary of such a teacher, and must go to another, or else come no more at schoole: so that it appeareth that they haue no more gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themselues, nor strength of the Spirite, nor stayednesse of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions then little children haue. As it is both schismaticall and so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, and childish and so ridiculous: so it is also vnprofitable. For they that leaue the ordinary and standing Ministery of their owne Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour (and none (certaine) gather here a peece and there a peece, but neuer lay any sound foundation, nor make any orderly building, as they do that tye themselues to one man, who keepeth an orderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, laying all the principles of religion one after another, and one by another, and euerie one in order till all be finished.</p>
                  <p>I deny not, but that vpon some special occasions a man may be som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time drawne away from his ordinarie teacher, as trauelling from home,

or being requested by our faithfull friends of another congregation, to answer for their children (as they call it) at their Baptizing, or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie some of our friends or our Magistrates departed out of this world, vnto their graue, and such like: if Christ be preached there, that we may follow him: otherwise I see no great necessitie to enforce a man to leaue his ordinarie teacher, to go to a bare reader for a ciuill dutie performing: but rather to remember what our Sauiour Christ answered to one that sayd he would follow Christ, but first he would go and burie his father:<note place="margin">

And further I hold it a thing very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient and fit, that there be sometimes also an entercourse of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters labours: that is, that other Ministers be sometimes admitted, yea procured also to exercise their gifts in their brothers charges; both for the confirmation of doctrine, as also for the quickening of the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie: for consent of teachers, is a great confirmation of the truth, in regard of our weakenesse and vnbeleefe, otherwise the truth is strong inough of it selfe, and will preuaile against all the world. And as variety of meates sometime doth make a man haue a better appetite to his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie diet, euen so is it not amisse that sometime our ordinarie auditours should haue change of teachers, that so they tasting that varietie of Gods gifts and graces which is in diuerse men, they may haue a better spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all appetite vnto the ministerie and doctrine of their ordinarie pastours and teachers. But to runne hither and thither, and commonly to leaue our ordinary teachers, onely either of a fanstasticall desire to heare new things, or of a loathing the plaine &amp; simple maner of deliuery of the truth, or of stomach, in contempt and way of disgracing, and discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging those that God hath set ouer vs, because they haue more sharply reproued their sinnes, or more neerely applied the doctrine to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences then others do: (a blessed fauor of God indeed, if men had grace so to take it) this is it that I say is both carnal, schismatical, childish, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnfruitfull: and further it is flatly repugnant to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ deliuered by his Apostle, in the 1. to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> the 5. Chapter,<note place="margin">1. <hi>The.</hi> 5.12.13.</note> and 12. verse, where he beseecheth the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> to know them that labour among them, and are ouer them in the Lord, and admonish them; and that they haue them in singular loue for their workes sake. And lastly is the practise of such as neuer professed the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:25201:40"/>
of Christ in sinceritie and vprightnesse of heart, with an humble spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and a holy desire to haue both their iudgement informed, and their liues reformed by the word of truth. But on the contrarie, in palpable and damnable hypocrisie, with shewes, shadowes, and flourishes, to be seene and well esteemed of men, as hypocrites do.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Priuate hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</note>Besides these publike and open hypocrisies, there be also many other lurking in priuate corners, which deserue to be vncased, as in housholds, where betweene man and wife many times much loue is counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, onely before men, and in heart much bitter malice and hatred maintained against each other, which betweene themselues breake out in open and bitter extremities, and behind each others back into foule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries, and cursed vndoing of the whole family: such an hypocrite is the harlot that <hi>Salomon</hi> vncaseth in the 7. of the Prouerbes.<note place="margin">

I say nothing of those that in shops and markets selling wares, will pretend great loue, saying; If it were not to you I would not sell it so: another should not haue it so, &amp;c. when for the most part all this is but meere cunning, and counterfeiting. I also let passe those that spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bargaine that they hope to reape a great benefit by, will earnestly protest and pretend vnto the partie with whom they meane to deale, great care that they haue of his good and his ease, rather then of their owne benefit: too many such there be in the world. Well, God will pull off their visour one day, and lay them open to the world. What should I say of those, that being to followe and further mens suites with great persons, or otherwise at law, haue still one tricke or other to delay the time withall? pretending great care to do their friendes businesse, and to followe their clients causes in the best manner that may be, and for their best aduantage, when all their doing is but a cunning kind of fishing for more money, like <hi>Felix</hi> who often sent for <hi>Paule</hi> before him, hoping that some bribe would haue bene giuen him to haue enlarged <hi>Paule.</hi> And a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand more such partes are played in the world, which men in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall practise, and conuersing one with another in Church and common-wealth, abroad and at home, shall haue occasion to meete withall.</p>

say, they could make good vse of it if it had come out of another mans mouth, hauing layed of purppse a heape of preiudicate conceipts and vnchristian surmises before them, as so many stumbling blockes, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a number of proud and disdainfull opinions, and euill constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of euery thing, as rampiers or bulwarks against the truth, because they meane not yet to forgo their sins, nor to part with their painted visor, I cannot tell what to say vnto them, but euen leaue them to the Lord, their hypocrisie I will not censure: it is like the darkenesse of Aegypt that might be felt: I am sorry to heare that any should haue the word of God in respect of persons, contrarie to the rule of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to regard it, if one man speake, and professing a contempt of the same, because another man hath spoken it whom they hate: as <hi>Achab</hi> did hate <hi>Micaiah</hi> for no other cause, but because he prophesied not good but euill vnto him, that is, he did not flatter him in his sinne, as others did, and therefore he hated him: these men shew with what good deuotion they come to the preaching of the word of God. If they might chaunge their Minister, they thinke that they should chaunge affections, but they are deceiued: for as the Poet could say, and that truly, so say I, <hi>Coelum non animum mutant qui transmare currunt,</hi> they change the aire and not their nature, which go beyond the sea: as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by those that haue separated themselues from our Church as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies in <hi>England:</hi> Schismatikes they were here, and so they are there. In like manner hypocrites which haue the word in respect of persons, <hi>Non mentem sed ministrum mutant,</hi> they may well change their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, but their mind they change not: their sinnes they leaue not: it is no part of their meaning, what shewes soeuer they make, except God of his great mercy worke a wonderfull alteration.</p>
                  <p>It seemeth that such persons are of that opinion that <hi>Diues</hi> was of in hell, who thought that his brethren which were aliue would repent, if <hi>Lazarus</hi> might haue bene sent vnto them from heauen, he was well acquainted with their humour, for belike when they were all liuing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on earth, neuer a one of them cared for their ordinary teachers, but (saith the holy Ghost) they haue <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets amongst them, if they wil not heare them, let them prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d what they list, neither would they repent though one should come from the dead vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Many will tell vs, that another man hath sayd as much, and more then such and such, whom the people mislike, and it is well taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such a one may say any thing (say they) and no offence will be taken against him: we maruell that they should take it so ill from one more then another: to these we answer.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 The cause why they do not so breake out against one man for the same doctrine, aswell as against another, is because his time is not yet come, as Christ sayd in Luke 22.53. <hi>When I was daily in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with you, you layed no hands on me, but this is your houre, and the very power of darkenesse.</hi> Euery man hath a time appointed him of God, a time to be promoted, and a time to be persecuted: a time to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and a time to be reiected: a time to be made much of, and a time to be set at naught: and when the date of the one is expired, then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taketh place.</p>
                  <p>Now to conclude: if any man thinke that I haue dealt too seuerely against hypocrites, or that I might haue caried a lighter hand toward them then I haue done: seeing as there is no man but is stained with some hypocrisie, much or little, in the sight of God at the least, or that in the applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any point of doctrine in the vncasing of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite I haue too particularly, and directly aimed at some, and namely at the partialities, and wilfull winking at grosse abuses, by Churchwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and other Ecclesiasticall officers with them, contrary to their oath and a good conscience, whereby God is dishonoured, and his worship is contemned, his Sabbaths are polluted, his Church vnrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and whereby the wicked are strengthened, and the godly despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: whereby his blessings are restrained, and his iudgements hastened vpon vs: then this is my answer. That in both (as I take it) I haue had my warrant from the word of God, which is a sufficient stay vnto my conscience, howsoeuer amongst the vnregenerate and wicked hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, it is a matter of least waight, and therefore with them of all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities least regarded. And for the first, haue I dealt more seuerely against hypocrites then the Scripture, and namely our Sauiour Christ? or haue I handled it worse then it deserueth? Hath the hypocrite any wrong, to haue no more but the truth sayd and proued against him? Or what? is his seruice so well pleasing to God, or the Church of God so much beholding vnto him for his shewes and shadowes, or rather his trecheries and cousinages, that he of all other may not be vncased? I speake not now of secret hypocrisie, whereof euen the regenerate &amp; faithfull are guilty in their best actions before God, and for which all of vs must desire mercy at Gods hand in the bloud of Christ: but of that hypocrisie which raigneth in the wicked, and of such hypocrites as are professed hypocrites, professed I meane in their owne hearts, whose
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:25201:41"/>
desire is nothing else but to be seene of men, and nothing lesse then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue themselues and their doings in the sight of God.</p>
                  <p>Euery one is stained with some lust: which is adulterie before God, &amp; with some malice, which is murther before God: and with some enuie, which is theft before God: and with some couetousnesse, which is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie before God: and yet euery one is not to be called an adulterer, nor a murtherer, nor a theefe, nor an idolater: because those grosse sinnes are not the studie, nor the profession of the regenerate; but they studying &amp; professing, and indeuouring to serue the Lord in sinceritie, truth and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse of heart, and to deale with men in all good conscience, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led sincere, and iust men, as <hi>Iob</hi> was:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.1.</note> and being in Christ Iesus, through his righteousnesse imputed vnto them, they are iust before God. Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie properly is a sinne against the third Commaundement: for none more then the hypocrite doth take the name of God in vaine, who still for the most part, maketh religion a cloke for all maner of iniquitie: which cloke of theirs, when it is once espied or taken from them, they cry out, and rage as men vtterly forlorne and vndone. For take away their clokes, their signes, and their shewes, and then are they naked, and ashamed both before God and man: and as sinceritie graceth the godly before God: so hypocrisie graceth the wicked before men: which is all that they desire or delight in. Giue me the substance of religion, saith sinceritie, and me the ceremonie, saith hypocrisie: giue me the bodie of Christianitie, saith sincerity, and me the shadow, saith hypocrisie: let me haue praise of God, saith sinceritie, and me the praise of men, saith hypocrisie: let not me lack the thing without which I cannot serue the Lord, saith sinceritie, and me to serue the time, and my owne turne, saith hypocrisie: giue me a good conscience before God saith sinceritie: tush, conscience was hanged long ago, giue me goods and worldly riches saith hypocrisie: giue me vertue and honestie saith sinceritie: and let me borrow their clokes to play my part in, and that shall serue my turne saith hypocrisie: giue me peace with God, saith sinceritie: and me with my honest neighbours, saith hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, as for God I shall do well inough with him. Handle the matter <hi>castè,</hi> that is purely, saith sinceritie: <hi>cautè,</hi> that is, warily, saith hypocrisie. Take heede, for God seeth thee, saith sinceritie: nay take heede that the world see thee not, and then good inough, saith hypocrisie. It is against the word of God saith sinceritie, therefore leaue it: tush so long as he can haue no vantage against me by law, I care not, saith hypocrisie. <hi>Qui va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit planè vadit sanè</hi>: that is, he that goeth plainely to worke, goeth safely to worke, saith sinceritie: <hi>Qui nescit dissimulare, nescit viuere</hi>: that is, he that cannot tell how to dissemble, cannot tell how to liue, saith hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:25201:42"/>
You see then the difference between the nature of sinceritie, and the nature of hypocrisie. The one you see is like a rich King in a beggars cote amongst men. Because as Christ our head said of himselfe, when he liued poorely and contemptibly vpon earth: <hi>My kingdome is not of this world, and I haue meate to eate that you know not of</hi>: so must Christs members say: we are poore and despised in this life, because our riches are not of this world, and we haue friends that the world know not of. The other is like a King in a play, who for the time maketh a braue shew, domineering ouer such counterfeits as himselfe is, hauing vpon him cloth of gold, and with the same perhaps are couered a number of scurfe and scabbes, lice, and vermine: and when the Play is done, the poore beggarly fellow must be faine to returne home his borrowed coat againe to the right owner, and pay well for the hire thereof. Now you haue heard the difference, consider the matter, consult, and giue sentence, whether this honest man the hypocrite hath so plaied his part before God or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he deserueth stil to go on without noting, and neuer to be vncased or no. And so much shall suffise for the vncasing of the hypocrite, and descrying of his nature. Now it remaineth that you see his reward: &amp; by that time I hope you wil not greatly desire to be an actor in his Play: but of that in the next Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Now as for those that thinke I haue too particularly applyed this doctrine: let them know that if <hi>Eliah</hi> did well in telling of <hi>Achab,</hi> that it was he that troubled <hi>Israel</hi>: and if <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did well in telling King <hi>Herod</hi> that he might not haue his brothers wife: and the Ministers of the Gospell haue the same authoritie that they had: then do we not amisse to make speciall application of our doctrine as they did. Againe, if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle said well, when he said, <hi>Those that sinne openly, rebuke openly, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may feare,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. then do not they well which find fault with vs, for following the Apostles rule. For whom haue I admonished or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, but publike persons by office, and publike abuses and scandals by them committed and giuen, to the great dishonour of God, and hurt of this Church? Lastly, if a Preacher may speak to the Prince when he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth before the Prince, and to the Iudges of Assizes, and to the Iurours, and to the Lawyers particularly, and to the Bishops, and to Iustices, all being publike persons, and charge them in Gods name to looke to their office, and amend that which is amisse, and that safely without daunger, yea boldly with good warrant: then do not I see but that any Pastour by his pastorall authoritie may in his owne congregation speake particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a Churchwarden, or a Sideman, and tell them what they ought to do: yea more, and charge them to do their office faithfully too: yea and more then that, if they haue bene admonished priuately and friendly, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:25201:42"/>
yet will not be admonished, but take vpon them still to dispense with their oath, and suffer Gods Church (as much as lyeth in them to go to wracke) then to reproue them both openly and roundly, that themselues may repent, if they belong to God, or others may feare as the Apostle saith. And vntill the Maior of a towne, and the Churchwardens and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther officers of a parish, can shew me by Scripture or common reason, that they be of greater state then Kings, Queenes and Princes be of, or then Noblemen, Iudges, and Bishops be of, or that they be more priuiledged and exempted from the reproofe and censure of the word, especially when their offences are publike and desperate, then others be whom I haue named before, and take to be farre aboue them: surely I must, and shall by Gods grace, both hold my former opinion, and as occasion shall serue, declare the same by practise: that is, by making of speciall applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the doctrine to the generall and publike offenders and offences of this congregation. Let him that hath an eare to heare, heare what I say: and let him that hath an heart sanctified consider well of it: and let him that hath grace from God, make a good vse of that that hath bene said. As for the rest, I say as <hi>Ioshua</hi> said: let them chuse what they will do, whether they will make a conscience of their dutie, or dispense with their oath as they haue done: I for my part will surely by Gods grace do that which belongeth to a true Pastor of Iesus Christ. And as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> said: he that is filthie let him be more filthie, and he that is froward let him be more froward, and he that will be obstinate let him be more obstinate, and he that will be an hypocrite let him be more hypocriticall, that their sinnes may be full ripe against the day of Gods vengeance. But so many as feare the Lord in truth of heart, and are truly humbled to endure the sifting and triall of the word of God, and are desirous vnfainedly to yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the holy will of God: let vs go on forward in our good courses without feare or fainting, and God our heauenly Father, in whom is our trust, will surely keepe vs from finall falling away, and in his rich mercie will pardon all our sinnes in the merite of Christ his bloudy passion: blessed be his name for euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the nature of hypocrisie, we haue heard sufficiently in the three former Sermons, and as sinceritie graceth all our good actions before God: so on the contrarie side, we haue seene that hypocrisie disgraceth and shameth vs, yea maketh euen our best deedes to stinke, as most loathsome filth before his heauenly Maiestie: yea and before men too, when once it breaketh out. And this might serue suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to perswade vs to take heed of hypocrisie, and counterfeiting in Gods religion, or any religious duties commaunded by God: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the hypocrite dreameth of some great reward, whereby he shall become some great man, both in this world, and in the world to come, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magining that as he is liked of men, so he cannot chuse but be loued of God: therefore our Sauiour Christ affirmeth most constantly and in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest manner, that hypocrites haue all the reward that they shall haue. For the praise of men haue they hunted for, and that they haue, &amp; more then that they shall not haue to reward them: but to punish them, a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they shall haue with the Diuell and his Angels in hell. The praise of men what is it? surely euen as men are themselues: &amp; as they are affected; men are but men when they are at the best, and at the highest. Whether it be in wisedome, or in authoritie, or in goodwill, or in abilitie, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer else: that is vaine, and vanishing, mutable and inconstant, blind and partiall. A simple reward then is the praise of men, euen fit for such vaine fooles as seeke for nothing else. The hypocrite taketh great paines for the obtaining (notwithstanding) of this vaine reward, as fooles which hunt after a fether blowne vp and down in the wind: they cannot get it vnlesse they will sweate, and almost runne themselues out of breath, and when they haue gotten it, it is but a fether, and nothing lighter. The praise of men what is it? surely but words proceeding from inconstant minds, false hearts, and from those whose hands cannot accomplish the deuises of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:25201:43"/>
their hearts. And what are such wordes but wind? and what is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant then the wind? He that obserueth the praises of men, is like him that obserueth the wind: and is fitly resembled to a Windmill, that whir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth about apace so long as the wind bloweth a main: but when the wind slacketh his gale, then he slacketh his pace: and as the Windmill is turned with the wind, so the hypocrite also turneth with the time. If he may be praised for well doing, then he will do well still: but if he be reproched, or threatned, or not highly esteemed; then he altereth his course, and is gone.</p>
                  <p>But here perhaps it will be obiected by some,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> that the Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth a good name in many places, and thereby admonisheth men to get a good name, and to keepe it being gotten. And what is that but to be praised of men? and to get the good opinion and estimation of men?<note place="margin">Answer.</note> Indeede this is true: a good report is to be sought for amongst men, and carefully to be kept too, when it is obtained. But this must be <hi>propter aliud non propter se</hi>: for some other end then simply for it selfe. But the meaning and drift of our Sauiour Christ here, is that we should not make that the end and scope of our well doing, as if that were our <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum,</hi> that is, our felicitie and happinesse, as hypocrites do, that looke no further, and desire no better thing then the praise of men.</p>
                  <p>To get and keepe a good name, there be many reasons to perswade vs: but to make the praise of men the end of our well doing; we haue no one reason to perswade vs, but diuerse to disswade vs: as we shall see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none. For the getting of a good report amongst men, we haue reason: for <hi>Salomon</hi> preferreth it before riches,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 22.1.</note> and before precious oyntment: that is, before all pleasures and profites whatsoeuer. Before riches he preferreth a good name, and saith, that it is better then riches: and that for three causes. For first, few riches are hardly obtained without much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> euill: a good name is not obtained without some good deedes. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> riches are meanes, by reason of our corruption to call vs from God. <hi>They that will be rich,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2.</note> A good name prouoketh vnto golinesse. <hi>Your zeale</hi> (saith <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) <hi>hath prouoked many.</hi> Meaning: that the good report which he made of them to others where he came, did through the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God prouoke many to the like zeale.

First, those that so they do well, care not what men say of them; but so farre as we can, we must with doing well keepe a good name, for the causes before allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Secondly, those that make no conscience of detracting a mans good name, being so excellent, but make a continuall practise of slaundering, and backbiting their brethren. And these are worse then theeues: for a theefe may make restitution of goods ill gotten, but he that hath robbed a man of his good name cannot make restitution of it againe. But what is it to haue a good name, or how may it be gotten? Is it so to liue as all men may speake well of vs? No, <hi>Wo be vnto you</hi> (saith our Sauiour Christ) <hi>when all men speake well of you</hi>:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk</hi> 6.</note> for he that handleth matters in such sort as shall please all men, must needes be a notorious wicked man, and a cunning deepe hypocrite.

But surely it is a hard matter for the wicked to commend the godly: and if they should commend thee being a good man, it will make good men to thinke that thou art leauing thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and enclining to them, whose humours thou now feedest. No: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer looke for a good name but amongst good men: for the wicked, saith

                     <hi>shal speak al maner of euil saying against you falsly for my name sake:</hi> that is: if you loue me and my truth, and because you will not runne with them vnto the same excesse of riot that they vse:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Pro.</hi> 28.3.</note> 
                     <hi>therefore they speake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of you,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Peter. They that forsake the law</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>praise the wicked</hi>: and that is because they are like themselues. And if at any time they condemne the euill or imperfections, which through oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion Gods children sometimes fall into, (as commonly the wicked do, which make themselues merrie with the slippes of good men) it is not for any hatred that they beare against sinne, but either to iustifie themselues in their riotous courses and outragious wickednesse: or else to disgrace and deface the beautie of that holy religion which we professe, or both. In a word then it must follow, that a good name is that commendation, which good men through the blessing and motion of the good spirit of God, do bestow vpon good men, for doing of good things, to good ends, and all to comfort and encourage them in their well doing, and that God the giuer and worker of all goodnesse may therein be praised and glorified.</p>
                  <p>And thus we haue heard both what a good name is, and for what cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it is to be procured and retained. But that we may not (for all that) make the praise of men, whether they be good or bad, the end of vertue and well doing, setting vp our rest when once we come to that; there be many reasons to perswade vs so to beleeue, and to disswade vs from so doing: and all may be drawne from the words of this Text: <hi>Verily I say vnto you they haue their reward</hi>: the summe whereof, for the matter is, that hypocrites haue all that they shall haue, as touching any matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for the paines that they take. And for the manner of the speech: that it is most certaine true, and not to be doubted of, but that they haue here in this world all the reward that they shal haue: and that is the praise of men if they haue that. Which words do shew most plainely, that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites who serue for the vaine praise of the world, are of all men the most vaine and the most miserable: and their reward (of all rewards) is the most vaine, and miserable reward that is.</p>
                  <p>The vanitie or madde folly rather, of those that make the praise and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimation of men, (yea, say they be their honest neighbours, or great states) the end of their good deedes, shall appeare, if we consider their reward. First, by the vncertaintie of it. Secondly, by the deceitfulnesse of it. Thirdly, by the breuitie of it. Fourthly, by the vnprofitablenesse of it. Lastly, by the daunger of it. The praise and hartie liking of men is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine reward, and so vncertaine, that nothing is more vncertaine then it, both in the winning, as also in the wearing. Such is the frowardnes,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:25201:45"/>
and vnto wardnesse of mans nature for the most part vnto goodnesse, and his weaknesse and wearinesse in the loue and liking of vertue, that it is no small matter to make him tast of vertues fruite, much more hard is it to keep him in a continuall liking of it. One thing the hypocrite is sure of, that he taketh great paines, and is at great cost, and vseth all his art to please this man, or that man, or all men: but whether he shall please them all, or any of them or no, that he is not sure of. It fareth with them as it did with <hi>Hester</hi> in some sort, though they want <hi>Hesters</hi> resolution: she was sure that she had a good deede in hand, when she should go into the Kings presence, to speake a good word for the liues of her people: but whether the King would like of her sure, or reach foorth his golden scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto her in token of fauour or no, she was not certaine: and therfore she willed them to pray for her. But because it was not so much the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the King,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hest.</hi> 4 16.</note> as the good of Gods people, and the glorie of God that she sought: yea to no other end did she desire the Kings fauour, but for the good of her people, and the discharge of a good conscience before God: therefore she put her life in a venture: saying, if I perish, I perish: which hypocrites will not do, because they haue not that hope of a better life, which <hi>Hester</hi> had.</p>
                  <p>When a man hath wonne the commendation and liking of men whom they go about to please: are they sure it shall continue? Surely no: mens minds are mutable. Oftentimes of a sudden they will commend a man for that, which vpon better consideration they will mislike: or for nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties sake they will praise a thing at the first, which within a while will grow stale, and out of request. Or some tale-bearer cometh in the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites way, and crosseth him with some false information, and so breedeth some sinister or wrong construction of a mans labour: and another exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuateth the gift, or good will, the worke or the paines: and when we thinke to find a friend as in times past, behold we meete with a hotefoe, or a cold friend. As <hi>Dauid</hi> who found a great friend of <hi>Saul</hi> one day, and the next day for no cause his mortall enemie. Tell me now, is there any thing more vncertaine then the good opinion of men?</p>

The hypocrite in seeking to please men onely, meeteth many times with as much an hypocrite as himselfe. One offereth much seruice, and dutie, presenteth him many and rare deuises, dedicateth new and learned Treatises vnto him, talketh very godly and religiously, and salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth most humbly, and perswadeth most pithily, &amp;c.

And if liking last, and all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof, that is kindnesse, friendship, heartie welcome, hope of preferment, or preferment it selfe; what is all this but a thing of no continuance? neither can a man leaue it to his heires after him.</p>

The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite that neuer aymeth at the glorie of God, or the good of others, but onely his owne vaine credite and estimation, shall haue faire words e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, but little else, except it be sorrow of heart, and vexation of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, for the losse of his time, and labour, and studie, and goods, and all for the wind of mens mouthes. Nay, if he do winne perhappes (as many flatterers and Parasites do sometime, which obserue great persons hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours) for some small counterfeit seruice, or odde trifle, or pleasant ieast, or wittie conceipt, some great benefite, some gainefull office, or great preferment, or high reuerence in the world; yet hath he made but a bad bargaine of it, if he hath no further purpose in all this but to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himselfe; giuing no honour to God, but all to himselfe: he hath his reward saith Christ:<note place="margin">

For many times a vaine glorious man being prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to his face, or hearing that his courses are well liked and commended of men, is thereby emboldened to go so farre, without all modestie or discretion, that he shameth himselfe: yea many times fondly presuming vpon them that haue soothed them vp, and made much of them, venture most foolishly and desperately, in pursuing of lewd attempts to their own vndoing.<note place="margin">

When <hi>Herod</hi> for his vaine Oration receiued the commendation of his flattering Courtiers and seruaunts, who cried, <hi>the voyce of God and not of a man</hi>; he felt a sweete and a pleasing wind that blew him vp beyond himselfe, that like one in a traunce (or dreame rather) forgot himselfe to be a mortall man,<note place="margin">

But it was the most daungerous wind that euer blew vpon him: for it both ripened his sinne, and hastened the vengeance of God immediatly vpon him. Many such daungerous windes and blastes, are Princes and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, and other persons of great calling subiect vnto: the more neede haue they to looke vnto themselues, and we to pray vnto God most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly for their standing. Seeing therefore that the praise of men is so vncertaine, so deceiptfull, of so short a continuance, so vnprofitable, and so daungerous, we may safely conclude, that of all rewardes it is most vaine, and that hypocrites in making of that the end of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, are most vaine men, or madde fooles: for, they haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>As it is a vaine thing to serue for the praise of men, that is to say, for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie it selfe,<note place="margin">The mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the hypocrite.</note> so is it a thing most miserable, and slauish. For first, though it be a most vaine shadow and fruitlesse vanitie of all vanities that man hunteth after, yet cannot he haue it without great paines taking. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before he can weare it, and enioy it freely, he must be censured of all. Thirdly, how often and commonly is he after all his paines and cost
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:25201:46"/>
that he hath bene at, deceiued of his expectation. For the paines that the hypocrite taketh to please men, he may truely say as <hi>Iacob</hi> said (though not with so good a conscience) <hi>I was in the day consumed with heate,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.40</note> 
                     <hi>and with frost in the night, and my sleepe departed from my eyes.</hi> Yea the feares, cares, and doubtes that he is turmoiled and tossed in, are vnspeakeable: one while he is vexed to know certainely the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and disposition of him whose praise he seeketh: then he careth how to fit his humour, with what wordes, with what gestures, with what by-matters, what tales and discourses, with what presents: then what companie to haue, and how to consort himselfe with them. And then what is the fittest time to find him both at leysure, and in a good moode. Then it is a world to see how the hypocrite acteth his part, and what paines he taketh: first, in marking the countenances, and gestures, &amp; speeches, &amp; commendations, and welcomes, and faire promises that are shewed him. Then in recounting of them, and descanting vpon them: first, to himselfe, and then to others, thinking and bragging how he was reputed and taken with such and such, and that he was so bold and so bold with him, and better entertained then his betters, and how glad such and such were of their companie, and I know not what: Did you note how attentiue he was (saith he) when I spake such a thing? Did you not marke how he smiled ar such a word? Did you see I pray you, how he tooke me by the hand, how courteously he entertained me, how he bad me sit downe: what commendations he gaue me: he said he neuer sawe a thing better done, nor heard a speech that better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him in all his life. All this while the foole is counting his chickens, as they say, before they be hatched. But if one come in his way, and seeme to take any manner of exception to anything, or to aduise him in such a point, or such a point, or that he be not so highly applauded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded for this and that action, or for this and that speech, or for this and that circumstance wherein he pleased himselfe: then his comb is cut, and a cloude is ouercast, his glorie is eclipsed, his market is marred, and he must cast about againe how to haue his cake better baked another time: for that time he cryeth as <hi>Caesars</hi> Parrot did: <hi>Operam &amp; oleum perdidi:</hi> I haue lost both labour and cost. Then he vexeth himselfe againe, in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and studying what should be the cause of so hard successe. I beleeue saith he, that some bodie hath angred him, he was so melancholike: or I may thanke such and such that had told some tales against me. And then is the poore foole beset and hemmed in with a number of odde surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and conceipts, and imaginations, whereof euery one doth haunt him, and pull him, like the furious spirite that haunted <hi>Saul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:25201:47"/>If all for the present runnne currant, and answere his desire, then he thinkes himselfe a iolly fellow: and who but he, with such and such that haue taken good liking of him; and there (as one come to his fooles para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise) he sets downe his rest.</p>
                  <p>But now beginneth a new peece of work, &amp; that is, how to keep this credite and commendation wholly to himselfe: and not be dispossessed. For what if the wind turne, and afterward by some mishappe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those parties that so magnified him before, will not vouchsafe so much perhaps as to salute him, or speake kindly vnto him, or to conuerse with him as in times past? or send for him as they were wont to doe? or giue him so much as a good countenance? as nothing is more vsuall in the world then such alterations in the mindes of men. So was it with <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Laban.</hi> When <hi>Iacob</hi> had taken exceeding great paines in his Vncle <hi>Labans</hi> seruice, and was still the same man that he was wont to be, carefull of his Vncles good, yet when <hi>Laban</hi> saw him to prosper and thriue well, he enuied him: and <hi>Iacob</hi> perceiued it well inough by his countenance:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.5.</note> for saith he to <hi>Rahel</hi> and <hi>Leah,</hi> I see your fathers counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that it is not toward me as it was wont. Nowe the godly can make vse of such things, as not to trust in men, nor to set their hearts on the world, but to walke wisely, &amp;c. But they are no whit dismayed at such alterations and chaunges: but knowing that the world is euer like it selfe, and is no chaungeling, except it be from euill to worse, they go on still in doing their dutie, making themselues merrie at the feast of a good conscience before God, whose glorie and fauour are the markes that they aime at, and in him onely they trust. But the hypocrite is then much vexed and troubled, and new feares and thoughts arise in his hart, casting about how to recouer that countenance, and commendations which he hath lost, that is: how to get the shadow that goeth from him.</p>
                  <p>To this end he resolueth with himselfe to make friends, to frame new deuices, to vse all the art and skill that his braine can affoord, practising, promising, and bestowing much against his nature: flattering here, and lying and dissembling there, much against his conscience: he must creepe to one, and crouch to another, and sooth vp all beyond all modestie and reason: backebiting this bodie, and accusing another bodie, and censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of euery one to feede mens humours, against all honestie and equity: for by honest and simple dealing it cannot be obtained.</p>
                  <p>And thus by this little you may see what paines, what charges, what cares, what feares, and doubts, and inconueniences a man must vndergo that will hunt for the praise of men: is not then the reward of hypocrisie
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:25201:47"/>
a miserable reward, and they miserable fooles, that take such paines and vexe themselues so, for the getting of that which is vainer then their own shadow?</p>
                  <p>The hypocrite before he hath his reward, must not onely take great paines, be at much cost, and vexe himselfe with many cares, feares, and foolish conceipts, which is a maruellous miserie: but also be subiect to the censures and iudgements of euery one: his name must be called in question vpon euery occasion that is offered to speake of him, his whole life ripped vp, and all his actions sifted and scanned at euery mans plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: some will commend him, some will condemne him, some will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire him, some will deride him, some will say he is a good man, some will say he is a bad man, and a deceiuer. And what a miserable thing is this, for a man to haue his name thus haled and pulled, like a bone among dogges, and to be like a tennise ball tossed vp and downe, and canuassed at euery mans pleasure: and all for a vaine sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which the more he followeth, the more it flieth from him? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle therefore in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.26. disswadeth vs from vaineglory in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>Let vs not be desirous of vaine glorie,</hi> (saith he) <hi>prouoking one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, enuying one another.</hi> To shew that the fruites of a vaineglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind are but prouocations to euill, and the reaping of enuie: which like a monstrous monster will spoile her selfe to hurt another. A mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reward then is that, which setteth the enuious man a worke, and prouoketh others also to sift vs, and to practise against vs.</p>

For in this life their lot is to be hated and scorned, molested and persecuted for their vertues sake. <hi>The world loueth his owne,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>but me it hateth: and you it shall persecute for my names sake: yea for my names sake they shall speake all manner of euill saying against you falsely.</hi> If the world will not loue vs, then it cannot like of vs, if it doth not like of vs, then it cannot commend vs, if it cannot commend vs, then it must condemne vs, if it cannot loue vs, then it must hate vs, and if it can neither like nor loue vs, what reward then must we looke for in the world? not promotion, but persecution: not life but death. Sometimes the wicked will seeme to commend and loue those that feare God and hate wickednesse: but then I would wish the godly to beware most of all, and to cast a double feare.<note place="margin">A double feare, when the wicked commend the godly.</note> First, least they haue put forth their hands vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some wickednesse: that is, done something that liketh the wicked, and offendeth God.

Yea if there be any paines or torments in hell greater then other, they shall surely fall to the hypocrites lot: yea, the hypocrites portion is so fearefull, that the wicked seruant that liueth most carelesly, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his maisters displeasure, nor once thinketh of his comming, but is found misusing of his fellowes at his maisters comming,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.51.</note> is threatned in the Gospell to be cut off, and to haue his portion with hypocrites, where shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth: to shew, that of all sinnes there is none more odious in Gods sight then the hypocrite is, neither shall any be more seuerely punished then he shall be.

                  <p>Now let vs see what good vse we may make of all that hath bene sayd. And first, seeing the great vanity and misery of the hypocrites reward in this life, and his wofull portion in the life to come, who can wonder sufficiently at the world, yea at himselfe, that is so bewitched and besotted with the loue of worldly praise (as a foole enamored of a cruell harlot) that notwithstanding all this, yet euery man almost ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

it his <hi>summum bonum,</hi> and chiefe study how to obtaine vnto it? Surely most men do know this to be true, euen by experience (the schoolemaister of fooles) but how few do rightly consider of it? It may be, that now and then, some being wearied with their hunting after it, and troubled with vexation of spirite, may fetch a sigh at the matter, and cry (as many do) fie vpon the world, and who would trust the world? and faire words make fooles faine: and I wil not trust mens faire speeches againe in hast, &amp;c. But yet for all that, as soone as the pang is a little past, all is forgotten, and a woing of this common painted harlot they go againe. How many in the world (especially followers of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Courts, and attendants vpon great persons) do go beyond them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, some in gorgeous building,<note place="margin">Building. Apparell. Dainty fare Great gifts. Play.</note> some in sumptuous apparell, some in delicate fare, some in great gifts, some in holding company at play: all which they wold not haue done but to be praised of men? If I should not do as others do, I should be counted a coward, saith one. If I should not keep a feast as others haue done before me (saith another) I shold be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a miser, or a beggar, though they begger themselues for it indeed. If I should not haue it something like on my table, and weare somewhat, and giue somewhat more then ordinary, how should I be accounted of? If I should not flatter a little, and please a little (sayth another) I should not be liked. If I should not be very eloquent, and garnish my Sermon with Doctors, Fathers, Poets, Philosophers, aswell as with the Scriptures, though there be no neede of them; and speake all languages, aswell vnknowne as knowne, I should be counted no scholer, nor to haue any learning. But if I do excel others in my building, in my feasting, in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, in my almes giuing, in my preaching, and shew of learning, in my courting, my aduenturing: (yea in swearing, and whoring, and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and riot, and reuelling, say some shamelesse and gracelesse persons) why then I shall be had in admiration, and euerie body will commend me: I shall leaue a name behind me, &amp;c. These things being thus resolued vpon, then commeth foorth the men of the world, their fellowes in folly, and deale their reward. Whose house is that (saith one?) as if he had som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to giue towards the building or repairing of it. Such a man built it saith another: now the reward. I assure you saith the inquisitor, it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faire house, and well contriued. Yea saith the third, all the smoke comes out at one chimney, or else is conueyed vnder the ground, &amp;c. and there is his reward: besides occasion ministred of an houres or two discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and descanting vpon his whole life. In like manner are those rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that iet in all kind of brauery, with pedlers shops about them: as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny women do? Who is that, sayth one? Such a one saith another. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

I cannot tell sayth one, by his long haire he should be a woman: by her bare head it should be a man sayth another: Yea, saith another, but God knoweth who payeth for all this. In like sort come from a feast, and see the reward of the world: We had great cheare sayth one: Yea, he may well inough sayth another, for he commeth easily inough by it. And then commeth a third: But I doubt me he must pinch a good while for this geare. And thus you see the worlds reward: are not men well rewarded now, that looke for no more then the praise of men?</p>
                  <p>Let those Ministers also consider well of this point, that euen against their owne consciences (as they are driuen sometime openly to confesse do bumbast their Sermons with all kind of humanity, besides the word of God, not because they thinke it then necessary, but as some haue freely confessed, in the most famous and publike places of the land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the eares of the people are troubled with such a kind of itch, that they must needes do it, or else their doctrine would be loathed for the plainesse and simplicity thereof. I speake not against the vse of humane authorities when case shall require, euen in the Pulpit: for I know there is a very good vse of them manie waies: both for confutation of errour, and also for confirmation of doctrine by way of consent, but against the vanitie and weakenesse of those that would not vse it but onely to please men: their vanity and weakenesse I say is to be pitied, and so is also theirs too, that study hard, and preach often, and deliuer sound doctrine, and abound with nothing but the Scriptures, if therein they respect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the praise of men: For marke I pray you; a Minister studieth hard, taketh great paines, he watcheth when others sleepe, &amp;c. and at length commeth like a woman to trauell, and bring forth the birth of his mind, which by meditation, and study, &amp; other good meanes he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, &amp;c. when he is deliuered of his burthen, the world vieweth it, &amp; rewardeth him for the same: but how? first perhaps they are away whom he did especially looke for, and desire to please, there is one griefe: then others perhaps fall asleepe, or tarry not to the ende: then there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother crosse: but for those that are most attentiue, perhaps some will inuite him to dinner of conscience or of custome: well, that he could haue had at home: then there is inquiry, what was he that preached to day? do you know him? No saith one: I know him sayth another. How like you the Sermon? He made a good Sermon, sayth one: a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per man saith another: he touched all degrees, and spared none sayth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: he had but a soft voyce, saith another, no vtterance, it is pitty,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:25201:53"/>
with a little practise he would do well: he was too long sayth another: he hath no learning sayth another? What Vniuersitie was he of? where dwels his friends? what liuing hath he? hath he no more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices then one? He sayd well sayth another, if he can follow it himselfe when he hath done, &amp;c. And afterward perhaps if he stay long amongst them, or chance to haue charge ouer them, they that before praised him to the skies, will be the first that shall picke quarrels against him for one thing or another, and all to remoue him. Is it not then a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour well bestowed, to set our selues onely to get praise of men? can there be a greater misery? were we not in a good case thinke you, if we had hope of no better reward then this? no maruell though. But blessed be God, our hope is, and our comfort is, that we (dealing faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and vprightly in Gods businesse) shall be rewarded of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in Christ his sonne, with another manner of reward then all the world can giue vs, or take from vs either. In a farre more miserable case me thinke is the hypocrite, then many a mans horse or beast is. The horse is rid hard,<note place="margin">The hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite is more to be pitied for his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, then the beast.</note> and trauelled sore all day, and at night is turned into a sorry stable, with a galled backe and spurred sides: but yet with his maisters reward, and that is a good baite, and a good word: Let him be well dressed, and well meated sayth the owner: he hath gone well to day: it is as good a horse as euer man put legge ouer. And if he chance to be stolen, or lost, or to dye, his maister maketh great enquirie, and searcheth for to find him againe, or great moane (besides high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of his beast) because he cannot be had againe. In like maner fareth it with the hypocrite in part, whom euery man rideth, and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth at his pleasure: as the spurre makes the horse to go, so vaine glorie and praise makes the hypocrite to go: and therefore it was well sayd in the Prouerbe: <hi>Gloria calcar habet</hi>: praise is a spurre, as if the vaineglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious foole were a iade that would not go without spurring. When the hypocrite hath ended his iourney, he is turned home againe with a gald conscience: well may he haue a good word: as, It was well done, &amp;c. but scarse many times the worth of an asses baite. And if he be missing, perhaps there is not so much enquiring after him, as after the strayed horse, except peraduenture as <hi>Laban</hi> sought after <hi>Iacob,</hi> to call him to account for the manner of his departure. And if he dye, some moane may perhaps be made for him, and a good word from a false heart may chance be cast after him: but it may be more moane will be made for a good seruiceable beast, and the one shall be as soone forgotten as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But when death comes, it were happy for hypocrites if then they were horses, or asses, or vile toades: for then should their miserie ende
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:25201:53"/>
with their liues: but they cannot haue that priuiledge, and therefore they are farre more miserable then the bruite beast which perisheth. Consider well of it my good brethren, and let vs not be any longer bewitch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d with this tickling humour, and most vaine vaine as I may call it, of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and caring, and studying and seeking how to please men against God, or to please men &amp; not God: but let vs labour by all good meanes, and call instantly vpon God by humble prayer, that we may be so go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by his holy Spirit and grace, that all our desire and study may be to do chose things, and that in such manner, as may get praise and commendation at his hand, and we may be approued in his sight.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, let his doctrine serue to worke patience in all those that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing deserued commendation, and loue, and good liking of those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom they haue laboured, cannot get the fame, or hauing once gotten it, through their faithfull and plaine dealing, or the inconstancie and frowardnesse of men lost the same. Euery man hath his time; as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, there is a time to reioyce, and a time to be sorry, so there is a time to be praised, and a time to be dispraised, a time to be lifted vp, and a time to be cast downe againe, least we should looke for our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon earth. And let it not greeue any man to be dispraised: nor great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puffe vp any to be commended, but rather be we grieued that we cannot studie to please God better then we do: and be we glad, that we haue the testimonie of a good conscience before God, that we haue deserued better of men, then we find at their hands: and shall find farre better of Gods hands then euer we desired, or deserued. And seeing as the praise and commendation of men is so vaine and miserable a reward, both for the vncertaintie of it, for the deceitfulnesse of it, for the breuitie of it, for the vnprofitablenesse of it, and for the danger of it: let vs neither straine with a good conscience: nor (keeping a good conscience accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods word) greatly regard it, when we haue lost it. For so do miserable hypocrites, who as Christ sayth here in our text, haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. If any body hath now put vppon him the Diuels armour of proofe, I meane vnbeleefe (as commonly all hypocrites do) that this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may not enter into his hart, let them but consider and weigh well, who hath sayd it, and how he affirmeth it, that hypocrites haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. He that hath said it, is the Lord Iesus himselfe, who being the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the father, knoweth what he sayth: and being truth it selfe cannot erre: let no man now suspend his iudgement for the matter, or stay his repentance, vntill he heare it confirmed by some Doctours, or Fathers, or Councels: for he hath spoken it, that cannot deceiue any, nor be deceiued by any: yea, vpon whose word and authoritie,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:25201:54"/>
all the Doctours and Councels in the world haue builded and must build whatsoeuer they teach, or else they build beside the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                  <p>As Christ hath sayd it (against whom I say, there is no gainesaying) so hath he affirmed it in most earnest and confident maner: <hi>Verily I say vnto you, they haue their reward:</hi> that is, in good earnest I speake it, and for a most vndoubted truth I affirme it. And all little inough: for such is the cunning of Sathan to beguile mens soules, that he will still feede them with some hope, that it is not so hard as the Preacher saith it is. Thou shalt dye the death saith God to <hi>Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m,</hi> if thou eatest of that tree: No sayth Sathan, ye shall not dye, that is, God doth not meane to deale so hardly with you as he sayth: he is mercifull, and that was but to make you afraid. So playeth the hypocrite still, Tush, tush, sayth he there is no such matter, they haue not their reward, we hope to go to heauen aswell as the best, and that we haue as good a faith to God as any body. What sir: we haue soules to saue as well as you, we would you should know it: Verily sayth Christ, they haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Verily no, sayth the hypocrite: now who shall be beleeued? Christ or <hi>Belial</hi>? God or the Diuell? Well, but we trust God be more mercifull vnto vs then so: Verily no, sayth Christ (meaning except they repent.) Yea, the hypocrite hath so good an opinion of himselfe, that he thinkes the Lord is as it were beholding vnto him for his play, or counterfeit seruice, and should do him great wrong if he should not receiue him into fauour aswell as others: For (saith Christ) when it shall be sayd vnto them definitiuely: <hi>God ye cursed into euerlasting fire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Diuell and his Angels: for when I was naked yee clad me not &amp;c.</hi> they will not take this for an absolute and iust decree of the Iudge; but as though they had wrong offered them, they reply againe: <hi>Why Lord when did we see thee naked,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</note> 
                     <hi>and did not clothe thee?</hi> &amp;c. If that will not serue, then they will put him in mind what they haue done for him: we haue cast out Diuels in thy name, and heard thee preach in our streetes: so will others plead for themselues: why Lord we haue sharply rebuked Sathan, and reproued sinne by thy word: we haue kept out Church orderly, and duly: we neuer missed a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, nor Seruice on weeke-dayes: we gaue as liberally to the poore as any man of our abilitie in the countrey. I haue payd my tithe mint and cummin, saith another, and I hope no body can charge me to haue bene a theefe, or a murtherer, or common whoremonger, &amp;c. and therefore I trust to be saued as well as another. And thus do many deceiue themselues, by imagining (as the Psalmist sayth) that the Lord
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:25201:54"/>
is like themselues::<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 56.</note> that is, not so good as his word: But my brethren be not deceiued, Christ hath sayd it, that is inough: If that be not inough, he hath confirmed it with an earnest asseueration most confidently, to put men out of doubt, and to assure men what to trust vnto, if they liue and dye in pypocrisie: If all that be not inough, then the Lord hath sworne in his wrath,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.</note> that they shall not enter into his rest.</p>
                  <p>Therefore cast away these vaine perswasions, and this false hope, take heed of that Diuell, and vile motion that goeth about to weaken the credit of Gods word with you. And from henceforth let vs so ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to please the Lord, that at his comming he may commend vs, and say, Well done, good and faithfull seruant, enter into thy masters ioy: which shall neuer be sayd to hypocrites: For verily (saith Christ) they haue their reward.</p>

But true Christians must not onely shunne popularity, and auoid worldly praise, but also they must beware of their owne priuate praise, and selfe-liking, and (not arrogating or conceiting to themselues any commendations, nor consulting with themselues how to be recompenced for the same) content themselues onely with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and allowance of their heauenly father, and comforting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the holy obedience of his most glorious will, as a singular fruite of his Spirit, &amp; of their faith, which is wrought in them by that Spirite,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:25201:55"/>
no whit doubting, but most stedfastly assuring themselues, that he to whom onely, and for whole loue onely, and at whose bidding onely, they haue done these things, though neuer so secretly (in respect of men) will one day reward them openly. Our Sauiour Christ in saying, <hi>Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth:</hi> vseth an hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, or excessiue kind of speech (as Rhetoricians call it) to shew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that with all possible care and diligence, the study of getting vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory must be auoided, and that we must neuer desire in doing good deedes to please the eares and eyes of men: except (as hath bene shewed before) to make them in loue with our good maners, &amp; good fashions, and so to haue them glorifie God with vs: but otherwise in doing of our good deedes to be as secret as may be: as if he should say; be so farre from seeking the applause of the common sort, when thou doest thy good deedes (as the Pharisees did, and all other hypocrites do, who giue not but sell their almes for the praise of men) that thy left hand though it be most neare conioyned vnto thy body, and a fellow worker of the deed with thy right hand: if it had any vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, may not know, what, or to whom, or how much, or when, or how often thou giuest, or doest good. His meaning is (to speake as plainely as I can) that thou which art a Christian, in doing the workes and duties of christianity, must be so farre from desiring to be looked vpon of man, that if it were possible thou thy selfe shouldest not know that which thou doest aright, but shouldest forget thy owne deed: and neither impute it to thy selfe that thou hast done well: nor stand in thy owne conceit, thinking the better of thy selfe for it, but onely reioyce inwardly that the poore and needie is refreshed, and that thy faith hath brought forth such fruite to the glory of God, and sealing vp of thy ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in thee.</p>
                  <p>What if men know not, yea what if he that is relieued, do not know him that hath relieued him? (saith <hi>Erasmus.</hi>) It is inough for thee to haue a witnes of the father, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whose eies nothing can be hid. He wil reward thee, although thou haue no thanke at all of man: yea though thou doest take no pleasure in it thy selfe, yea though thou doest vtterly condemne and mislike thy selfe, and iudgest thy selfe (as many do) altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of any fauour, yet thou shalt be rewarded at thy fathers hand. And this I take to be the simple and plaine meaning of these words.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs come to the doctrine that ariseth from the same. And first, from hence we haue to obserue, that in doing of our good works, all selfe-liking, or conceit of our selues, must be auoided: that we must neither attribute any part of the worke vnto our selues, as a thing done
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:25201:55"/>
by vs, as of our selues: nor yet thinke that we are euer the better for the same: but to be still as humble, and to carry as low a saile, and as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy an opinion of our selues for all that good we haue done, as if we had done nothing but euill: or else in doing of good we offend God, and hazard his heauenly reward, which in Christ is layed vp for vs.</p>
                  <p>The contrary to this,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.16.</note> is it as I take it, which the Prophet <hi>Habakuk</hi> condemneth in the wicked, when he sayth: <hi>They sacrifice vnto their net, and burne incense vnto their yarne, because by them their portion is fat, &amp; their meate plenteous:</hi> Meaning that they imputed all their wealth vnto their owne industry only, and to the meanes whereby they compassed the same. And surely it is neither good, nor safe, but very vngodly and dangerous in doing of good workes, to make our selues priuie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto (if we could chuse) or once to keepe account with our selues of the good that we do. I deny not but that a Christian soule truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the feeling of his owne vnworthinesse and inability, may with some comfort call to remembrance, what duties he hath performed the day or weeke that is past, through the grace and fauour of God, who hath wrought both in him, and by him: so that withall he be (as I say) truly humbled, and prepared thereunto, calling to mind withall, to that end, what graces he wanteth, what sinnes he hath committed, what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers he hath incurred, and with what weaknesse and imperfection the good hath bene performed, which is a rare thing. But surely otherwise it is very dangerous to keepe account vnto our selues, of any good deed that we do: For, by reason of our naturall corruption, which cleaueth too fast to euery one, and hangeth on (if not presseth downe) the very rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate themselues, we are so prone and apt to the study &amp; affectation of vainglory (which is indeed plaine robbing God of his glory) that it is a very hard matter to do good, and not to be proud of it.</p>
                  <p>It fareth with vs, as it doth with wanton women, who when they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how faire they are, casting away all modesty, waxe proud, like the Peacocke that alwayes strouteth it, when his taile is spred.

                        <hi>Luke.</hi> 18.11.12.</note> whose prayer was proud, boasting of his owne righteousnesse. First, he keepeth a note to himselfe of what grosse sinnes he was free, that other men were ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken withall: then he scoreth vp his good deedes, and namely his integrity and vprightnesse in tithing, and then his due and constant course of weekely fasting. And hauing thus made his left hand priuy to that which his right hand did, that is, recounting with a wrong affection to himselfe, what he had well done, he spreadeth his taile, and falleth to crowing ouer

his poore brother in this sort: <hi>I thanke God I am not as other men are, extortioners, vniust, adulterers, or as this Publican: I fast twise in the weeke, I giue tithe of all that I possesse:</hi> as if the proud Peacocke should haue sayd: behold my feathers are not of that colour that other birds are of, but his feete were: which he then remembred not.</p>
                  <p>In like manner do many keepe a score of their good deedes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister in their note-bookes what they bestow weekely, or monethly, or yearly vpon the poore, &amp;c. I warrant you say some, it costs me euery weeke so much, and so much ordinarily, besides that I spend extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily. It were good for them, and others the like, to regard the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of Christ here: <hi>Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.</hi> Do good, and make no bodie priuy vnto it, if thou canst: no, not thy owne soule: take no notice of any good thou doest thy selfe, least thou be proud of it.</p>
                  <p>It was the wisedome of God in creating of the woman, not to create her vntill he had first cast <hi>Adam</hi> into a sleepe, and while <hi>Adam</hi> slept, he tooke a rib out of his side, whereof he made woman, least if he had bene awake when this was done, he might haue thought that he had had a stroke in it, if it had bene no more but suffering, or consenting to haue one of his ribs taken from him; which yet had bene great folly in him so to haue done. So should it be the wisedome of Christians in doing of good deeds, to cast their carnall affections in a sleepe: least they (seeing and knowing what is done) should imagine that they had a stroke therein, and so should begin to filch and steale some glory to themselues which belonged not vnto them.</p>
                  <p>The horse doth employ his stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to carry &amp; draw, but yet he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not so much: if he did, peraduenture he would not be so subiect vnto man as he is. The sheepe doth yeeld vs her fleece to cloth vs, and her flesh to feede vs, and her lambe for increase, but yet she knoweth not so much: if she did, perhaps she would if she could vpbraid vs by her benefits, and not be so beneficial vnto vs as she is. The birds with their variety of notes do delight our eare, but God saw it not good that they should know so much, for if they should perhaps they would be as mute as nonresidents, scorning to affoord their musicke vnto such fantasticall and vaine mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters as they now do serue. The flowers with their varietie of orient and beautifull colours, and fragant, and pleasant smels, do delight our eyes, and refresh our spirits: but God saw it not good that they should know so much, for if they did, perhaps they would disdaine to be abused so much, and so little regarded to the praise of their maker as they are.</p>
                  <p>In like maner, if we could do good workes to the glorie of our God.

and profit of our brethren, and not let our left hand know thereof, that is, not consult with our carnall and crooked affections about them, we should not be so loth to go about them, nor so lazie in doing them, not so lustie when we haue done them, as we are. If the Peacocke were hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched blind: or could shut his eyes when he spreadeth his taile, surely his pride would abate, for it is not the hauing of such colours, but the knowing them, and viewing of them, that breedeth conceitednes, and causeth his nature to swell. So, if Christians, when they take any bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from Gods hand, or enioy the graces of Gods Spirite, or bring foorth the fruites of the same Spirite, had not their minds and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions so much bent vpon them, and set to vew the beauty of them: but could set them to looke narrowly downward vpon their blacke feete, that is, vppon their sinne, and sinfull affections, it would be a meanes greatly to humble them. Therefore the Apostle sayth:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.30.31.</note> 
                     <hi>Let them that weepe, be as though they wept not, and them that marry, be as though they maried not.</hi> So sayth the Scripture too: <hi>Let him that giueth almes, be as though he gaue not.</hi> And in another place he saith of himself &amp; his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.10.</note> 
                     <hi>We are as men sorrowing, but yet reioycing, and as men reioycing, &amp; yet sorrowing, as poore and yet making many rich, as dying, &amp; yet liuing, &amp;c.</hi> So on the other side, as making many rich, and yet as it were poore, &amp; giuing nothing. To shew what manner of men Christians must be.</p>
                  <p>But how can that be (will some say) that a man should giue almes, or do any other good deed, and not make himselfe priuy to the matter? and count it nothing which he doth? Surely very well, or else truly do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dissemble, and speake against their owne consciences: for come vnto them, and thanke them for such and such kindnesse bestowed, &amp;c. they will say: Alas sir, for nothing, I know no such matter: it is not so much worth, &amp;c. as if he should say, If I did any such thing, it is with me as if I did it not at al: I am to begin it againe: I keepe no reckning of it: my heart was not set vpon it when it went from me: I weigh it not, &amp;c. Againe, euery true Christian is in part regenerate, and in part vnregenerate: the one part is called in Scripture by the name of flesh, and the other by the name of spirite;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.</note> 
                     <hi>the flesh rebelleth against the spirite,</hi> that is, the part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate against the part vnregenerate: Now this part that is regenerate by the spirite of sanctification and grace, may well be called also the right hand of the soule, and the other part which is still fleshly, carnall, and sensuall, and not sauouring the things of God, may well be called the soules left hand, for the vntowardnesse therof to any goodnesse: in which sense it may truly be said, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou doest any good deed, let the spirite, that is, the part regenerate as the right hand of thy soule do it, but let not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:25201:57"/>
the other part (which is so vntoward and not regenerate, and fitted for it) haue any thing to do in the matter, more then if it knew nothing at all of it. We must do as men that trauell in company together, and are so earnest in talke that they forget the length of their iourney: and to such ten miles seeme but as one mile: but if a man go alone, and thinketh of nothing but his iourney, then his left foote shall know what paines his right foote taketh, and will keepe account of all his sleps as it were, and thinke his iourney long, and his paines exceeding great. So we in trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling towards heauen (which we must do so long as we liue, by walking in such good workes as God hath appointed for vs Ephes. 2.10.) must count all things but losse and dung, for the excellent knowledge sake of Christ Iesus our Lord, to win him, and to be found in him, not hauing our owne righteousnesse, but the righteousnesse which is of God by faith in Christ, forgetting that which is past, and endeuouring our selues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which is before, and follow hard toward the marke, for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Iesus. And no maruell though the Apostle made so light account of his owne workes, or righteousnesse: for, he knew they were too light to endure the triall of Gods iustice, &amp; too vncleane to appeare in his most pure presence. Our good deedes are like a faire garment with a filthy lining: or (as the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh) like a menstruous cloth,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Esa.</hi> 64.6.</note> 
                     <hi>The beauty and goodnesse of them is from God: the deformity and vncleannesse is of our selues.</hi> Shal the one part lift vs vp to any proud conceipt of our selues? No: it is of God, giue him all the glory: and let the other humble vs.</p>
                  <p>All the gifts and graces of God do beare some part of his image, and stampe, though giuen to diuerse persons, and in diuerse measure and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: like the Princes coine, which hath the Princes image and stampe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, to put the subiects in mind of their loyaltie and dutie which they owe to their Prince: that (as Christ said) when we see <hi>Caesars</hi> image and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perscription we should remember to giue vnto <hi>Caesar</hi> that that is <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars:</hi> so when we see any thing with Gods image vpon it, we may also giue to God that that is Gods. The Princes coine commeth out of the Mint faire and bright, but when it cometh into our hands it taketh soile, and looseth beautie. So the good graces of God come to vs with a most heauenly beautie, but we cannot returne them so againe: for with vs they take soile and loose their beautie. As euery peece of coine hath on the one side the Princes image, and title certaine: so haue all the graces of God, Gods image, and Christes title, to admonish vs of that holy dutie, and absolute praise which we must returne vnto him for the same.

                  <p>Further it is to be obserued, that Christ saith, the right hand must do the worke, and the left hand must not know of it. He appointeth the right hand to the worke, because that is readiest, and quickest, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somest in working. The left hand is not so fit, nor ready, but is rather a hinderance of the work then a furtherance of the same. Christs meaning is, that we must not only not arrogate any glorie to our selues, or liking of our selues: but when we do any good, we must do it with our best affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and not once to consult with our carnall, proude, and vntoward affections: for they are like the left hand, and haue many froward cauilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and odde reasons, and false perswasions to hinder the worke, like so many crooked fingers, which are good for nothing but to pull backe, and hinder, and are altogether vntoward to euery good worke.</p>
                  <p>Our affections are compared in <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5. to feet:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.5.</note>

off thy feete</hi> (saith the Lord to <hi>Moses:</hi>) that is, put away all carnall and fleshly cogitations, and earthly reasons from thy affections when thou commest before me, and come with holy affections. And in <hi>Eccles.</hi> 4.17 <hi>Looke vnto thy feet before thou goest into the house of God</hi>:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.17.</note> that is, examine with what affections thou goest. For, as the feete do carrie the bodie vp and down in the world: so do our affections carrie our minds and studies and hale vs both in soule and bodie to such things as they like.</p>
                  <p>Here they are compared (as I thinke) vnto hands, because they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary (when they are sanctified) to worke the wil of God, as hands to do externall duties, and as forcibly they effect things, or thrust men forward, or pull me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> backward as the hands do, vnto good or euill. Look what the bodie hath after a visible manner, the same hath the soule after an inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and spirituall manner. An eye of knowledge to see good from euill, and the right way from the wrong: a taster of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to discerne things that differ: as what is good, and what is better, &amp;c. legges of faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we stand without sinking vnder our burden, and go therwith to God. Shoulders of patience and long suffering, to beare iniuries &amp; crosses man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: hands and feete of affections and desires. Of all which there be two sorts: as there be belonging to the bodie, a right eye and a left eye, a right hand and a left hand, a right eare and a left eare, &amp;c. Now, some be in the seruice of God, and in all other good workes as it were left handed: hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with their left eare, that is, with a lazie desire to learne: vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with a grosse vnderstanding, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did vnderstand Christ, when he spake of being borne againe: and marking with a drowsie atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; taking all things with the left hand, that is, very frowardly, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly. But in worldly matters and vanities, which they loue and like well of, they are right handed, and right eyed, and right footed, and right eared: that is, they can worke apace, and see quickly, and go swiftly, and heare readily, &amp;c. Therefore let not thy left hand, that is, thy vntoward affections and sences haue ought to do when thou doest any good work: as we vse to say; tell not such a man of it, for he will hinder it as much as he can possibly. These lefthanded Christians will soone murmure and grudge at a little cost that is bestowed vpon Christ in his poore Church or members, like <hi>Iudas</hi> who was offended at the boxe of ointment that <hi>Mary</hi> bestowed vpon Christ: and cauill at euery thing that is spoken, like the cauilling Iewes, which set themselues to carp at euery thing that Christ spake, or his seruants the Prophets and Apostles. And if they once conceiue an hard opinion of the doctrine, or doctour, they will forsake that man, and in time giue ouer hearing the word, as the <hi>Capernaits</hi> did, and most vntowardly, and vnseemely will they performe whatsoeuer els
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:25201:58"/>
they go about in Church or commonwealth, if they haue no mind vnto it: and will soone be wearie of well doing, their shoulders of patience and courage being out of ioynt: and in learning and doing of the best things, are as men that altogether worke with their left hand, hauing no list to worke.</p>
                  <p>A man may easily perceiue a difference betweene those that do good deedes with good affections, and those that consult with flesh and bloud about the matter. Those that do worke with their right hand will shew it by their willingnesse, by their forwardnesse, by their zealousnesse, by their venturousnesse, by their bountifulnesse, by their chearefulnesse, and by their perseuerance. If they bestow any thing towards the building vp of Gods Church, by maintaining of religious exercises, they will giue as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did to the building of the tabernacle:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.</note> they brought till they were stayed by proclamation. If they bestow any thing on the poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of Christ, they say not as worldlings do: any thing is good inough for them: but they bestow the best they haue, like <hi>Mary</hi> who would not bestow any oyntment vpon Christ except it were costly and precious.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.</note> like <hi>Nehemiah</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he reformed the sabbath.

                  <p>And on the other side, those that make their left hand priuie to that which their right hand doth, doe consult with flesh and bloud about the matter, and being ruled, and perswaded altogether by carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and vaineglorious or gainefull inducements, do that good which they do vnwillingly, and niggardly, and cowardly, and sluggishly, and frowardly, and negligently, and are soone wearie of well doing: all which may well be called lefthanded Christians for their backeward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and vntowardnesse to any good thing.

In this case we may learne of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who caused euery mans money (of his brethren) to be secretly conueied into his sackes mouth with their

Some are secret inough, and too se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in giuing to the poore, for that which they giue is onely in conceipt, that it may be in secret, and knowne to no man: and most prophanely and scoffingly abusing this place, (as they do all other holy things and the whole body of religion) they will giue nothing at all, lest (as they like themselues most wretchedly pretend) that their left hand should know what their right hand doth:<note place="margin">Abusers of these words</note> as though the purpose of our Sauiour Christ had bene to disswade men from giuing any almes at all. These men are like the Frier, that would prouide well ouer night against the next day, by carrying with him the remainder of his supper, scoffingly alleadging, or rather blasphemously abusing the wordes of Christ in this chapter: <hi>Be not carefull for to morrow:</hi> and therefore I do it saith he, because I would haue no care for to morrow. These persons haue learned this lesson of Christ to the halfes: they haue learned to be secret, but not to giue almes in secret: as the Papists haue learned another lesson of Christ, so haue these men learned this: Christ saith: <hi>Pray for your enemies, blesse them that curse you: and if thy enemy hunger, giue him meate: if he be thirsty, giue him drinke, &amp;c. In so doing thou shalt heape coales of fire vpon his head.</hi> This latter part they haue learned well, namely to heape coales of fire vpon the heads of their enemies: yea of Gods deare Saints, and fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots too, and to burne them to ashes too: but the former part which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth workes of loue and charitie, is yet to learne, they can no skill of that. And if some of them be told of their hard dealing, they will not sticke to alleadge this Text, and say: why, doth not Christ say, we must heape coales of fire vpon our enemies heades? Such gibers, and scoffers at the word of God, I couple with <hi>Iulian</hi> and <hi>Lucian</hi> their predecessours, wishing them in time to take heed, and pray vnto God (if it be possible) that they may truly repent them of their blasphemous courses: their state is fearefull and daungerous: for that they go on plodding and scoffing at religion. Blessed is the man that commeth not into their way: for it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as directly as can be, and in time will bring men vnto the sin against the holy Ghost, which is vnpardonable.</p>
                  <p>Now for the consolation of those that do all their good workes as in the sight of God, debarring themselues from all vaineglorious applauses, and commendations in the world, and in themselues too, it is said further, that <hi>thy father which seeth thee in secret, will reward thee openly</hi> to shew, first, that we must indeuour to approue our selues vnto God, and not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world: like an honest wife, that will so attire her selfe, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:25201:60"/>
her selfe in all things, as she may please her owne husband, and not other men. And next, that the best way to weane our selues from these vaine desires of worldly praise is, to consider effectually, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber continually, that we are still, at all times, and in all places in the sight of our heauenly father, to whom we either stand or fall, and of whome we shall be abundantly rewarded openly (according to his gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise) for that which faithfully we haue done in secret. And lastly, to shew that those which seeke for open praise of men, or giue vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues any secret praise, to the impeachment of Gods glorie, cannot look for any open reward at Gods hand in the day of iudgement: but those that are perswaded of that, and moued effectually with that, do not care which way it goeth with them in the world, so that they may be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God their heauenly Father, and carry a good conscience vnto their graues. Here be three things attributed vnto God our heauenly Father: First, that he seeth those things that are done in secret. Secondly, that he will reward the good that we do in secret. Thirdly, that he will reward it openly. Fitly are these things propounded to the children of God, that they may accustome themselues to do whatsoeuer they do, as in the sight of God: and to approue themselues vnto their heauenly Father. And as fitly are these three opposed to the vanitie of the flesh, all which men do so hunt after.</p>
                  <p>For the first: that God seerh and knoweth all things that are done in secret, the Scriptures in many places do witnesse: <hi>Whither shall I go from thy presence?</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>If I go vp to heauen, thou art there, if I go downe to hel,</hi>

                     <hi>and trie the reines.</hi> A point this is very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to be vrged. For first, the wicked either beleeue it not, or they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it not. Many will confesse that there is a God, which yet are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to say with the wicked in the 10. Psalme: <hi>Tush the Lord seeth vs not</hi>; or if he seeth what we do, he doth not regard: and thereupon they make themselues bold to commit all wickednesse with greedinesse: for would so many so desperately else giue ouer themselues, some to theft, some to whoredome, some to drunkennesse, some to practising of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and some to the contriuing of treason: if they were perswaded that the Lord of heauen and earth did looke vpon them in secret: and take a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:25201:60"/>
note of that which they do in secret? and heape vp vengeance as they heape vp sinne? Would the foule mouthed blasphemer sweare againe, when he is reproued for his swearing, in despite of God (whose most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fearefull name he doth abuse) and of him that in the name of God doth reproue him: if he were perswaded that the Lord did heare him, &amp; marke how he doth abuse his name? would so many beate their braines, and studie so hard as they do in secret, to practise all kind of wrong and oppression, and how to couer it with flatterie and deceipt, if they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that God did see them or regard? In a word, would so many come to the Church, and make a shew of great deuotion, and play the hypocrits, hardening their hearts against the word of God, and imagining euill, and descanting vpon euery word at their pleasure, if they did beleeue that God did see them in secret? And what is this but plaine Atheisme? to say there is a God, and not to beleeue that this God seeth in secret? What is this but to make an idoll of the true God? If this be Atheisme (as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it is, though not in the highest degree) then how many Atheists are there which liue so, as if God did not see them in secret? for in secret they conceiue their wickednesse, and in publike they bring foorth vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for why, they thinke themselues cocke sure, so long as God (as they imagine) doth not see their secret deuises, or not regard them. They thinke that because they see not the Lord, therefore the Lord seeth not them:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Num.</hi> 23.</note> like <hi>Balaam</hi> who feared not the Angell because he saw not the Angell: but it is said, that his beast feared him, and stayed so soone as he saw him: to shew, that those which know that God doth see them, and yet go on still in their wickednesse, are worse then the beast: and that asse shall condemne them. This doctrine is also to be vrged in regard of the godly themselues, who though they know and confesse it to be most true, and can alleadge many Texts of the Scripture, to proue that God hath all knowledge, and seeth all things that are done in secret: yet they haue not so powerfull vse of this doctrine as they should. Then is it pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull vnto vs, when (by the Spirite of God) our hearts are kept in awe, and made afraid to do those things that will offend his Maiestie, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> who (knowing this point well) feared therefore to yeeld to the lewd motion of his light mistresse.</p>
                  <p>How many sinnes do of a sudden steale vpon vs, and slippe from vs, when we thinke not of this, that God seeth in secret? How many againe are arrested (as it were) and taken in the manner, yea and staid from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward, when once this meditation commeth to mind: God seeth in secret? We are alwaies conuersant in his eyesight, neither can we pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly do or conceiue any thing, be it neuer so secret, but that he seeth it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:25201:61"/>It is a signe of great rashnesse and impudent audacitie, if a sonne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of his fathers displeasure dareth do a fault in the sight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his father. Nay what strumpet so impudent that in her husbands sight dareth prostitute herselfe before another? yea would she not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed and afraid too, if but a little child were in presence? What then shall we thinke of our selues, that dare boldly without feare, confidently without doubting, impudently without blush ing, and continually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceassing, do those things in the sight of Almightie God our heauenly Father, which we feare and shame to doe in the presence of a mortall man, or a little child? The breath of man is in his nosthrils, but the least glimpse of Gods diuine, imperiall, and immortall Maiestie, is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and crush in peeces tenne thousand worlds at once. As God doth see his children in secret, so he doth looke vpon them as a heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not as a cruell enemie, or rigorous Iudge, when they do well: and being well pleased with Christ Iesus his naturall sonne, doth also take great delights in the indeuours of his adopted children which are in Christ Iesus: and therefore doth he delight in them, because they are in Christ Iesus, and else not. Therefore whatsoeuer deuotion or seruice we offer vnto God in secret or otherwise, it must be offered in and through Christ, for whose sake alone it is acceptable, or else it (being without Christ) is vnto God most abhominable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is said that our heauenly Father will reward his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that they giue in secret. And this is a good encouragement to the godly. For flesh and bloud (vnlesse it hath some hope of reward) thinks it altogether lost which is giuen to the poore. It is not lost saith Christ, it shall be rewarded of your heauenly Father. Therefore well saith a learned man: <hi>Eleemosina non est dispendium, sed negotiatio:</hi> Almes giuing is no losse or damage, but a kind of traffique or merchandise from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. For whatsoeuer we lay out here vpon Christs poore needie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, it shall be payed againe with aduantage.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Cast thy bread vpon the waters</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>for after many dayes thou shalt find it:</hi> that is, feare not to bestow thy liberalitie vpon the poore, which can giue thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againe, and though it seeme to be lost as that which is cast into the sea, <hi>yet after many daies,</hi> that is, when thou doest least looke for it, and thinkest that it is forgotten, and worne out with time, thou shalt find it againe, thy heauenly Father with whom a thousand yeares are but as one day will reward thee for it, if thou giue of faith in his sonne Christ.</p>
                  <p>Lastly: because we naturally affect popular praise, and desire to be famous, Christ saith, that our heauenly Father will not onely reward
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:25201:61"/>
vs, but it shall also be openly. This our Sauiour Christ plainly sheweth in <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.13.14,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.13.14.</note> 
                     <hi>When thou makest a feast call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy acquaintance, nor thy rich neighbours, least they also bid thee againe, and a recompence be made thee: but call the poore, the lame, the maymed, and the blind, and thou shalt be blessed, because they cannot recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thee, for thou shalt be recompenced at the resurrection of the iust:</hi> that is, if thou regardest a good reward indeed, then rather call the poore then the rich. What recompence this is that shall be giuen in behalfe of the poore Christ also sheweth in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.24.</note> where he sheweth that it shall be said to them on the right hand, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherite the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world: for I was a hungred, and ye gaue me meat, &amp;c. for in asmuch as ye haue done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye haue done it vnto me</hi>: that is, I take it as done vnto my selfe, which you haue done vnto these poore ones that beleeue in me, and for whom I haue died. What manner of reward is this?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.29.</note> We may well wonder at this reward: as <hi>Mary</hi> did at the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels salutation: for the Angell did not salute her as her neighbours v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to salute her: and God doth not reward his children in whom (for his beloued Sons sake) he taketh delight, as men reward their friends. Amongst men ye shall haue a dinner for a dinner, and one good turne for another: but here is a kingdom giuen for giuing a peece of bread, or cloth, or drinke, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable speeches, which they haue not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as owners therof, but as stewards put in trust from God. And what kingdome? No lesse then the kingdome of heauen. And how? not as a lease, or a farme, or a coppie hold for yeares: but as an inheritance of their Father for euer. And this shall be giuen them in possession with al the grace and glorie that can be, not in the presence of some few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, of this place, or that countrey, but before all the inhabitants of the whole world, at the sight and hearing wherof, the wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly hypocrites, who sold their good deedes for worldly praise and filthie lucre,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16.</note> as prophane <hi>Esau</hi> did his birthright for a messe of pottage, shall euen gnash with their teeth for griefe, and consume away like the smoke against the wind, through extremitie of feare, griefe, and shame: being withall at the same instant ouerwhelmed with the most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and intollerable sentence of Gods euerlasting curse, which in like manner is set downe alreadie: <hi>Depart from me ye cursed into euerlasting fire, which is prepared for the diuell and his Angels:</hi> from which the Lord for his rich mercies sake in Christ Iesus deliuer vs all. Now my brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this time I hope you be perswaded, that there is nothing lost by that which a man doth vnto God in secret, or vnto any of Gods Church
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:25201:62"/>
for the loue of God. For God that is loue it selfe, and infinite in loue, cannot but infinitely reward the loue of his children, which any way they haue shewed vnto his Maiestie, especially seeing as he crowneth not our gifts to him, but his owne gifts in vs, which we receiued first of him. And what can we desire more? Would we be seene when we do well? behold who seeth vs, euen God our heauenly Father, who is all in all, who cannot deceiue any, nor be deceiued by any. Wouldest thou be rewarded for that thou doest? and would we not loose our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a toy or a trifle, as many do? then behold our heauenly Father is readie, able and willing to reward vs with a kingdom of eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse: onely let vs be content with his reward, and tarrie his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous leisure. Would we be openly rewarded and graced by some great person, before many, and before our enemies, that they might be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and before our friends, that they might with vs reioyce and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer them: then behold, we haue our hearts desire: our heauenly Father will not onely most bountifully reward vs, but also in the open presence, view, and hearing of all the whole world will blesse vs: where all Kings, and Emperours, and Tyrants shall appeare and stand naked: and many of them shall shake and tremble for extreame feare and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of their owne conscience, and Gods vengeance.

                  </p>
                  <p>As we haue heard what is to be shunned, and what is chiefly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected in giuing of almes: so now it will not be amisse to speake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (though but briefly) of almes it selfe:<note place="margin">Of almes.</note> and therein to see, first, what this word almes doth signifie. Secondly, to what end, or for what cause God did ordaine that almes should be giuen and taken: or why he would haue any occasion thereof in the world. Thirdly, how men may be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or induced to giue almes. And lastly, to whom almes must be giuen. For the first: the word <hi>almes</hi> is deriued of the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which signifieth mercie. Therefore as that is called grace which is giuen of grace, so that is called mercie which is giuen of mercie. Almes then is some benefite that is bestowed freely vpon the poore and needie, onely of a mercifull and pitifull affection, and fellow feeling of his griefe and want. So the <hi>Samaritane</hi> is said to haue shewed compassion and mercie vpon the wounded man, when he powred oyle into his woundes, and holpe him vp to his beast, and laid out money for him at the Inne, and gaue his word for him: this was a right almes giuer, which gaue of pitie, and was moued by mercie: which is nothing else but a griefe and sicknes of the mind for anothers miserie, and makes a man readie to releeue the same. And of almes some is true, and some is false; that is true almes
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:25201:62"/>
which comes from them that giue of mercie, and compassion, or feeling of anothers miserie, who is sicke and troubled in his mind vntill his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers miserie be releeued. That is a false almes which comes from hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who giue not of any mercie, or compassion, but of some other straunge affections, seeking either to winne fame, or to auoid shame, or because they are compelled by law to giue something. For otherwise, if they should see their poore brother in neuer so great need alone, and no bodie by them to see them when they giue, or if there were not others to giue before them, and to wonder at them for their hardnesse of heart, or some law to compell them, they would go by him, and come by him too often inough, and let him die too for want, before they would part with any thing to saue him. That our almes may be true almes, or mercies gift indeed, it is not so materiall how honest, or dishonest, how good or how bad he be to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we giue, nor whether it be much or little that we giue, but with what mind we giue.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Musc.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Discriminat in hac causa non dati sed danti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um diuersitas,</hi> saith a learned Writer: It is not the diuersitie of gifts, but the diuersitie of giuers that make the difference in this cause:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.42.</note> 
                     <hi>The rich men of their aboundance cast much into the treasurie, and the poore widow cast in two mites which makes a farthing.</hi> Now (by the iudgement of Christ) she cast in more then the rich men did, because they of their superfluitie gaue some, but she gaue all that she had. And so it is we see by daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that many a meane man considering his abilitie, or rather his inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, doth giue more when he giueth a peny, then some rich man doth when he giueth a pound. And perhaps as he giueth all that he hath in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of some other, so he parteth from it with a better mind then some that giue more, and can better spare it then he. Diuerse do examine (in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of almes) whether he be a good man or no to whom they giue, as though it were of necessitie required to the truth of almes, that he must be a good man to whom almes is giuen, and not rather a good man that giueth it: <hi>Facile dignus est pauper, hoc ipso quod miser est &amp; egenus, vt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leemosynam accipiat</hi> (saith <hi>Musculus</hi>:) A poore man is capable inough of an almes, in that he is in miserie and want.</p>
                  <p>Some say, they would giue almes if they were able; but let them giue of that small abilitie that they haue, a little, and it shall be acceptable before God, being giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a pitiful mind. There is the alms of the hand, &amp; the almes of the tongue, and the almes of the eyes, &amp; the almes of the heart. The almes of the hand is some visible thing giuen, as gold, siluer, bread, cloth, &amp;c. The tongues almes is two fold: first, good counsell, and comfortable speeches, which oftentimes do more good then gold and siluer: such an almes did <hi>Peter</hi> bestow vpon the creeple, when he

Secondly, earnest prayer vnto God: such an almes did the Church bestow vpon <hi>Peter</hi> when he was in prison: and it releeued him more then mony: for it caused the prison doores to open alone, and <hi>Peter</hi> escaped. <hi>Act.</hi> 12. The eyes almes, are teares for the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of other, proceeding from a sorrowfull heart: such an almes did the women of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> bestow vpon our Sauiour Christ when he went to suffer death. And Christ noted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in gracious termes for it, saying: <hi>Weepe not for me daughters of Ierusalem: but weepe for your selues, &amp;c.</hi> The almes of the heart is a certaine griefe and sorrow arising from the feeling of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers miserie, and is the mother of all the rest, if abilitie serue: and of all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Some giue, but it is grudgingly, and angerly, and some in pollicie onely, to please vnruly persons, and stay a further mischiefe, for feare that else they should lose all: like those that cast bread to a dogge for feare of biting: these giue no good almes. No more do those that giue somewhat of that which they haue ill gotten, to the end they might keepe the rest in the better <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> securitie. Nor they that giue of a vainglorious affection, to seeme to be mercifull, when they be nothing lesse. We are not to iudge any mans hart: but euery man by this doctrine is to examine and iudge his owne heart.</p>
                  <p>Now we are to see why the Lord will haue almes to be giuen, that is: why it is his pleasure to haue poore men in the world, that shal stand in neede of the rich mans almes; for, it cannot be denied but that this is the Lords doing:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 22.2.</note> as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith: <hi>The rich and the poore meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the Lord is the maker of all:</hi> He could haue made many women for one man (saith the prophet) for he had abundance of spirit, meaning he had power inough to giue many wiues to one husband; but he made but one wife for one husband:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15.</note> and why but one? because he sought a godly seede. So he could haue made all rich, or those rich which he made poore, &amp; those poore which he made rich: for he had abundance and inough for euery one, if euery one had bene a world: and yet he would not do so: but would haue some to be rich &amp; some to be poore. And why so? Surely to giue thereby occasions of patience (as he doth vnto the poore by their pouertie) and of liberalitie, and doing of good, as he doth vnto the rich by placing of poore and needy amongst them. God could haue brought to passe, that sinne should neuer haue bene in the world, if it had so pleased him, but then how should his iustice haue appeared in punishing the vessels of his wrath: and the riches of his mercie bene manifested in pardoning his elect? Euen so, if he had
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:25201:63"/>
made all rich and none poore, what should then the rich haue had to exercise their liberalitie vpon? and wherwithall should the patience of the needy haue bene tried? Both rich and poore therfore hath he made for the manifesting of the singular worke of his Spirit to his own praise and glory in both. Let not therefore the rich contemne the poore: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue not their aboundance for themselues, but as stewards appointed of God to releeue therewith those which want. Neither let the poore enuie the rich, or impatiently beare their burden: because God hath prouided that their want should be supplied by the rich: but let both poore and rich glorifie God in their estate and calling, and know, that if they vse the same to that end that God hath ordained them for, they shall reape vnto themselues the most sweete fruits of the sanctifying spirit, vnto the sealing vp of their euerlasting election and adoption in Christ.</p>
                  <p>In the next place we are to consider, how men may be moued or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to giue almes willingly and chearefully. First, because almes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is nothing else but a worke of mercie, as almes it selfe is mercies gift, it can haue no better inforcer to worke then mercie it selfe: that is, a compassion or fellow feeling of another mans miserie, which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly should be in al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But because that is by natural corruption deaded in some, &amp; turned into a sottish kind of inhumanitie in others, &amp; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all: Therefore secondly, it is needfull that we be regenerated &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> made new men by the Spirite of God, who by his heauenly grace and effectuall working in vs, may restore that which is lost, and cause mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to appeare in her liuely hew and beautifull colour againe. Thirdly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> when we are borne againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is a motiue of no small force, to consider that Christ in his members is miserable, poore, and needie, and that, whosoeuer doth succour them, is iudged to haue succored Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: as appeareth by the testimonie of Christs owne mouth, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. verse 24. and so forward. Now if it be so that Christ is releeued whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers are releeued, what reason hath any hard harted <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> to be so close fisted as many are against poore Christians? conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what Christ hath done for them, for whose sake they ought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their hand, yea and euen to powre out their very hearts, with al the bowels of mercie and compassion that can be? Christ doth feede vs with heauenly bread, namely, with his owne flesh and bloud to eternal life, and shall not we againe feed him (when he is hungrie) with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread? Christ doth cloth vs with garments of immortalitie, and shal not we cloth him when he is naked, with garments which soone weare out and come to nought? Christ will receiue vs into his euerlasting
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:25201:64"/>
and heauenly habitations, and shall not we receiue him (comming as a poore pilgrime amongst vs) into our earthly mansions? Christ came downe from heauen to vs, not onely to visite vs, but also to cure vs; and shall not we visite him when he is sicke in his members? Christ was imprisoned to set vs at libertie, he was wrongfully condemned, to acquite vs, and miserably accursed to blesse vs, and deepely impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerished to enrich vs, and shamefully crucified to redeeme vs, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly tormented to ease vs: and shall not we vouchsafe to visite him in prison, and endure some paine for the ease of his poore members? Yes verily, and wo, yea ten thousand woes be to them that are ashamed of his bands? All this doth euery one professe that saith, <hi>I beleeue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints.</hi> Many do speake those words, but few shew the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er therof: most professe, but fewest practise the Communion of Saints: which sheweth plainely, that many moe professe the name of Christ, then do indeede belong vnto him. For none of his members be dead and sencelesse, but are all of them fellow and feeling members, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one with another, like the members of a mans bodie, and helping one another as they would be helped themselues. To conclude this point, let vs imagine there is some rich man of whom we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued more benefits then euer we are able to recompence. He hath no need of our reward, but onely commendeth vnto vs some poore friend of his, whom he specially loueth, &amp; would require at our hands in token of our thankefull mind, to bestow somewhat vpon that his poore frind: would not al the world cry shame of vs if we should refuse it? Christ himselfe is that rich man, vnto whom for infinite benefits we ow not only great thankfulnes, but euen our selues. And this one thing especially he requireth at our hands, that what we could find in our hearts to do vnto him, we would for his sake do it vnto the poore: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by speciall charge he hath committed to our care: for which cause he said (when <hi>Iudas</hi> grudged at the ointment which <hi>Mary</hi> bestowed on him:)<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.6.7</note>) <hi>Let her alone, why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good worke on me:</hi> to shew that those should not be hindred which are about to shew the fruits of loue to Christ; and addeth withall (as a reason why shee should not be hindered:) <hi>For ye haue the poore with you alwaies, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you will ye may do them good</hi>: to shew, that as he was once annoynted &amp; honoured in his owne person, so he lookes still to be annoynted and honoured in his members, which who soeuer refuseth, what loue can he imagine that he beareth vnto Christ? For if the loue of Christ were in him, he would count nothing too deare to bestow vpon Christ: nor yet too hard to suffer for Christ.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.20.</note> As it is said of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that <hi>he suffered
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:25201:64"/>
twice seuen yeares for Rahel, and they seemed vnto him but a few daies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he loued her</hi>: to shew, that such is the nature of loue, that it will make the most hard things become easie, and the most heauie things light for their sakes whom we loue. Lastly, it is requisite that the poore moue the rich vnto the workes of mercie by their good behauiour, shewing themselues thankefull and contented, for whatsoeuer is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them, and not to harden the harts of men against them, by shifting for themselues, or by pilfering and filching, nor by idle loytering, nor by impudent outfacing, nor by slaunderous backbiting, nor by busie tale-carying: nor by taking in ill part that which is giuen them, as too too many do. For, as many husbands which obey not the word, are wonne to loue their wiues without the word, while they behold the pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation of their wiues, coupled with feare. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1.2. euen so many rich men which are not yet moued by the word to loue the poore, may in time be wonne without the word, while they behold the honest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation of the poore, coupled with thankefull reuerence and faithfull diligence. Now in the last place it remaineth, onely that in a word wee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> consider to whom almes must be giuen,<note place="margin">To whom we must giue.</note> and that is generally to euery one that craueth the same, hauing need therof, according to Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: <hi>giue to euery one that asketh of thee.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.30.</note> Meaning if he hath need, and thou be able to supply his want: but more especially to those that are godly, and well disposed, according to the restraint that the Apostle hath made in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Let vs do good vnto al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but especially to those that are of the houshold of faith</hi>: but most especially vnto those faithfull ones that are of our own houshold, stock or kinred. As <hi>Ioseph</hi> gaue messes of meate vnto all his brethren,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.22, 23.</note> and change of raiment: but vnto <hi>Beniamin</hi> whom he loued better then the rest, he gaue three hundred peeces of siluer, and fiue suits of raiment, and vnto his father (who was dearer vnto him then his brother <hi>Beniamin</hi>) he sent tenne hee Asses laden with the best things of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and tenne she Asses laden with wheate, and bread, and meate, for his father by the way. And they are no men but monsters, that being able, suffer their parents and kindred to perish for want of releefe. And yet it is not meant that we must giue to euery one that shall aske of vs without exception, for then we shall in short space go a begging our selues; yea if we had the treasures of a King. This did a certaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour well consider, to whome on a time (as they say) a certaine bold faced companion came, and desired his Maiestie to bestow some reward vpon a poore kinseman of his: I am your kinseman, quoth he, both by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother: for we come all of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue.</hi> Indeede thou saiest true, quoth the Emperour: and with that drew foorth his purse and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:25201:65"/>
gaue him a peny. A penie (quoth the other) shall I haue no more but a penie? a simple reward from an Emperor. Hold thy selfe content, quoth the Emperour, if I should giue to euery one of my kinsemen a peny, I should soone become a poore Emperour. Euen so, if we should giue to euery one that would aske of vs, we should soone emptie our selues, and begge too. But it is meant that we must giue as we are able, hauing respect to time, and place, and occasion, and as we are appointed by order of law, and ciuill pollicie, &amp; yet still in compassion. As for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits &amp; idlepacks, they must be wisely looked vnto, and seuerely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished when they are found out:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ios.</hi> 9.</note> as <hi>Iosua</hi> did, who punished the <hi>Gibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites</hi> when they counterfeited themselues to be farre trauellers, when they were his next neighbours. Some become miserable through ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, tipling, &amp; carrowsing, through idlenesse and bad companie kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: to these belong a threefold almes: instruction, correction, and yet some contribution too, as is allowed vnto malefactours in prison, vntill by order of law, and sword of iustice, a riddance may be made of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if otherwise they will not be reformed: for by the rule of the word, he that will not labour, must not eate.</p>

And that so liuely, that if any man desire to see a liuely picture, and a true Anatomy of <hi>Belial</hi> indeede, let him with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence marke, and behold the hand of Gods Spirit, while <hi>Belial</hi> is a rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp: and he will say as the people sayd of another action of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ, <hi>we neuer saw such a thing.</hi> Mark. 2.12. But all is done, and must be done to this end, that we may know our selues. And this indeed is therefore made the Anatomies speech or poesie: <hi>Nosce teipsum,</hi> know thy selfe: as if he should say, why dost thou stand still gaping and gazing vpon my naked bones? or prying into my bowels &amp; entrails? or iudging of my heart? &amp;c. good leaue hast thou so to do, but learne by me then what thou art, and what thou shalt be thy selfe.</p>
                  <p>This Anatomie is altogether spiritual,<note place="margin">The parts of this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natmomy.</note> and hath in it two parts. First, the description of a wiked man: secondly, his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. He is described two waies: first, by his name: secondly, by his actions. His name setteth out his nature, and it is double: first, he is called in the Ebrew tongue, A man of <hi>Beliall</hi>: that is, a lawlesse person. Secondly, he is called in the same tongue, A man of vanitie: that is, a man altogether vnprofitable. As he is described by his names, so also is he knowne by his actions, and they be of two sorts, outward and inward: his outward actions are also two fold, his speeches, and his gestures. His speeches are set forth
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:25201:67"/>
by two adiuncts, or circumstances: first, of their quality, then of their quantitie: for their qualitie, they be very euill, for they be altogether fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: for their quantitie, they exceede, for <hi>he walketh with a froward mouth,</hi> that is, he is continually froward. His gestures are also obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the gestures of his eyes, of his fingers, and of his feete, and all of them are very significant, and tending to set forward sinne. The inward actions of his heart, are layed forth two wayes. First, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tearmes, saying: <hi>Lewd things are in his heart.</hi> Secondly, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or in particular obseruations, by noting two vile properties arising from a lewd hart. First, <hi>that he imagineth euill continually.</hi> Secondly, <hi>he raiseth vp contentions.</hi> After his description commeth his iudgement, and that is, to be destroyed: and this destruction is amplified further, by shewing the fearefull manner of the coming thereof: for it shall come speedily without delay, and suddenly without any warning, before he looketh for it. Secondly, the euerlasting continuance of it: for it shall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recouery.</p>

                     </note>In the Scripture we reade of a Leuite that cut his wife in peeces, when others has wickedly abused her to the death, and sent her quarters vnto the twelue tribes of Israel, with this motion and mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage: <hi>Consider the matter, consult, and giue sentence.</hi> But here the Lord hath cut <hi>Belial</hi> in peeces, who was the cause of his owne death, and hath hanged vp his quarters (as it were) in his word, which he hath sent into all parts of the world, that his people might consider the matter, consult, and confirme the sentence of the Lord: and also take example by him, least we come into the same case.</p>
                  <p>But before we come to the particular examination of <hi>Belials</hi> markes, it shall not be amisse to enquire of three very necessary points.<note place="margin">3. Points.</note> The first is, to what end this description is made. Secondly, whether we may by the same description take vpon vs to iudge who is a man of <hi>Belial.</hi> And thirdly, what may be learned from the coherence of this text, with the rest of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>For the first point: Machiuels and Atheistes thinke that all the Bible, and all preaching,<note place="margin">To what end this Anatomy tendeth. Not for pollicy.</note> and all religion, is but matter of pollicy, to keepe men in awe: and so consequently that this that is sayd of <hi>Belial</hi> is so too. For that diuell that told <hi>Adam</hi> that he should not dye, though he did trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse the commaundement of God: doth also tell these fellowes, that whatsoeuer the Scriptures say, or Preachers babble (as they say) yet they shall not dye the death. But what could <hi>Eue</hi> say at the last? <hi>The Serpent deceiued me.</hi> So will these cry one day: Sathan hath deceiued vs. Well, leaue them to the Lord, and let vs know for certaine truth, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:25201:67"/>
is written before hand in the Scripture is written for our learning, as the Apostle saith;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4.</note> and therefore this Scripture also is written for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as well as any other.</p>
                  <p>God hath not taken such paines (as I may say) in making and setting forth <hi>Belials</hi> picture,<note place="margin">Nor to gaze at,</note> in this liuely sort as you see, to that end that we should do nothing but stand and gaze at his picture, but that we should note him well,<note place="margin">
                        <p>But to know him &amp; auoide him.</p>
                        <p>Belial in like a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agate.</p>
                     </note> and learne to know him when we see him, and to auoide him when we know him. For, <hi>Belial</hi> is like a runagate, who hath done that which he is ashamed of, &amp; hauing stolne the cloke of vertue, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, is runne away with the same vpon his backe, seeking how to hide himselfe in the world. And for feare of being taken, he hath gotten him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into seruice with great me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, like <hi>Elimas</hi> with the Deputy. And hath so won their fauors,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 13.</note> that he walketh with them in the fields, &amp; strowteth it with them in the streetes: he feasteth with them at their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: he buyeth and selleth for them in their shops: he tradeth for them beyond the seas: he courteth with the most gallant in the court: He hath found a place in the Vniuersities amongst scholers: in Cities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst merchants:<note place="margin">What en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Belial hath in all places.</note> in Churches amongst Preachers: in iudgement hals amongst Lawyers: in Consistories amongst Doctours, and proctors: at Theaters amongst players: in housholds amongst seruants and children: in Gentlemens houses amongst seruingmen and their maisters. He hath learned to insinuate himselfe into the company of all states and degrees: and hath found the fauour to be shrowded amongst Captaines and souldiers, amongst Lords and Ladies, amongst Knights and Esquires, amongst yeomen and artificers, amongst prentises and iourny-men, and where not? And if need be, he can haue a licence to go beyond the seas amongst Italians &amp; Barbarians, and to come from all places of the world,<note place="margin">Vertue and godlinesse can neuer get good seruice nor good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> and be welcome at his good leasure and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: and all this can <hi>Belial</hi> do, and more then this too: for, he hath a great number of foule deformed vices, and monstrous vgly abuses, which are all begotten of his owne body, both male and female, which he can easily preferre into seruice. And so well are they brought vp by the double diligence of his brother <hi>Machiauell,</hi> that many become sutors vnto them, and glad is he that can match his son, or his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with one of them, when vertue and godlinesse may go through the world, and can harldy get a seruice, except in the iayle, or in some beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers cottage: much lesse can they get a good mariage: and if they do hit vpon a good mariage, it will not be long before they shall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced againe.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Belial</hi> with his cubs, because they are euery where, are thought
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:25201:68"/>
to be no where: but the Lord from whom they are run away, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them well inough. And here he hath made out a warrant,<note place="margin">Gods war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for the attaching of Belial.</note> you see, to attach them wheresoeuer they can be found, and to summon them to answer for themselues before Gods iudgement seate: which warrant is committed to all Magistrates, Ministers and other of his faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and subiects. And because many say they cannot know <hi>Belial,</hi> and they must take heede how they detect any by that name: therefore the Lord hath well prouided here for his people, and in this his attachment hath put downe such markes and notes, of his talke, of his name, of his gestures, &amp;c. that vnlesse men will be wilfully blind, they cannot chuse but know him, although he goeth neuer so disguisedly, and denieth his name neuer so stoutly.</p>
                  <p>And indeed let <hi>Belial</hi> be arrested at Gods sute for dishonouring him, or at Christs sute for crucifying him, or at the Churches sute for persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her, or at the Gospels sute, for slandering of it, or at Religions sute for contemning of it (as all these actions and many more will come against him one day) he will straight way deny his name,<note place="margin">What acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come against Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial, and at whose sute.</note> and say, You mistake me sir, I am not the man that you looke for, &amp;c. Then those men which want either will, or skill, or courage, or all (nor greatly regarding the words of their warrant) take his word for the matter, and so let him go for an honest man: but those that are wise in God, can easily discerne <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial</hi> from an honest man, as King <hi>Salomon</hi> could well descry the harlot from the true mother of the child, because the wisedome of God was with him.<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. <hi>vlt.</hi>
                     </note> And the godly wise haue learned to say to <hi>Belial</hi> as the damsell sayd once vnto <hi>Peter: Surely thou art one of them, for thy voice bewraieth thee</hi>: So, thou art one of the men of <hi>Belial:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How Belial is descried by the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise.</note> for thy filthy speeches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray thee, thy outragious oathes bewray thee, thy proud and profane gestures bewray thee, thy lewd and contentious behauiour bewray thee, therefore it is but a folly to denie thy name: for as the Asse is knowne by his braying, and the length of his eares, to be an Asse, though he iet it in a Lions skin: so, thou art knowne by thy conditions to be a man of <hi>Belial,</hi> although thou goest in the habite of an honest religious, or religious ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man.</p>
                  <p>When our Sauiour Christ said that one should betray him who was then in presence with him, there was looking one vpon another, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man was iealous ouer himself, saying: Is it I? Is it I? But what saith our Sauiour Christ? He that dippeth his finger with me in the dish, that is the man that shall betray me. He named no body: but that was inough, for thus might any one conclude vppon Christs words,<note place="margin">A strong argument.</note> He that dippeth his hand now with Christ in the dish, is the traytour: but <hi>Iudas</hi> dippeth his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:25201:68"/>
hand now with Christ in the dish, therefore <hi>Iudas</hi> is the traitor. In like maner, when God saith, there be wicked men of <hi>Belial,</hi> and vaine men, lawlesse persons, and vnprofitable, that must be destroyed speedily, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and without recouery: now euery man will put it off from him selfe, and say, that he is not that man of <hi>Belial,</hi> &amp;c. But what saith the Lord? he nameth none, but noteth them thus: <hi>The man of Belial and the vaine man, walketh with a froward mouth: he maketh a signe with his eyes,</hi> &amp;c. that is, he that walketh with a froward mouth, he that is lawlesse in his affections, he that is vnprofitable in his conuersation, he that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth euill at all times, and raiseth vp contentions, he is that man of <hi>Belial,</hi> that must be destroyed if he repent not: then may we conclude thus: But such a one walketh with a froward mouth, &amp;c. and hath all the markes of <hi>Belial,</hi> and therefore he is a man of <hi>Belial.</hi> And thus we se to what end this description of <hi>Belial</hi> is set forth, namely to that end that we might know him, when we meet him, and auoide him when we know him. And now let vs go to another point, and see whether it be lawful for Christians to iudge of another,<note place="margin">2 Point. A point of ingratitude and an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the truth. To take the notes that God hath giuen is not to iudge, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the iudgement of God. Christs wordes <hi>Iudge not,</hi> how they are abused by the wicked. The impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man.</note> by this description or no.</p>
                  <p>It is no small mercy of God so exactly to anatomize, or describe the wicked man: for by this meanes, one shall not be taken for another: and Christians knowing for certaine a wicked man by his picture, may more easily auoide him, more safely reproue him, and more freely giue Vertue her robes and her ornaments againe, when <hi>Belial</hi> that runagate is stript out of all, and turned out naked as he deserueth. But intollerable is the vnthankfulnesse of many, and by this doctrine to be reproued, that so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the mercy of God, as to outface the truth euen now in the day light of the Gospell, and glorious truth of the Lord. So shamelesse and impudent are the fauourites of <hi>Belial,</hi> that they will not sticke to say: How know you that he is a wicked man, or a wicked woman? Oh you may not iudge, you may not iudge, when we do but iudge the tree by the fruites, and pronounce that which God hath set downe. Now he that taketh the notes which God hath giuen him, doth not iudge, but onely pronounceth the iudgement of God.</p>
                  <p>Whatsoeuer the wicked do, yet when they daunce in this net, You must not iudge, &amp;c. they thinke themselues safe, like the foolish bird cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Ostrich, which putteth her head into a bush, and then thinketh that no body seeth her, though all her body be out of the bush. If a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man be reproued for couetousnesse, what is his defence but this: How know you that I am couetous? you may not iudge, when all his life fauoureth of nothing else but greedy couetousnesse, all his talke is of worldly matters, for heauenly things he can find no leisure, no time to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:25201:69"/>
heare the word, and yet how know you that he is couetous? He getteth al mens trades into his hands, to the spoile and decay of many that would liue by him: he will be a mercer, a grocer, a draper, a cutler, an armourer, a girdler, a malster, a brewer, a corne-bodger, a gamester, and what not? and so ouerdroopeth all occupations about him, and vnder him, that none can thriue but he: and yet how know you that he is a worldling?<note place="margin">Of the proud ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> In the like sort if the wicked <hi>Belial</hi> be reproued for pride, he will straight be at defiance with you, and for his defence, this shall be his plea: How know you that he is proud? you may not iudge, &amp;c. when all their whole life bewrayeth nothing else: euery day a new fashion: all the day little inough for their curling, and crisping, and frisling, and pluming, and setting &amp;c. Their gate must be counterfeit, their speech is counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, their beauty is counterfeit, their haire is counterfeit, and yet how know you that teyh be proud?<note place="margin">Of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continent person.</note> In like manner will the lasciuious and incontinent person pleade for himselfe: you may not iudge, when all his life doth stinke of his filthinesse, when he hunteth harlots houses: yea though the streetes swarme with his bastards, though he doth daily vomit out filthy, shamelesse, and ribaldry speeches: yet he may be an honest man,<note place="margin">The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are patrons one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</note> will some say: Oh it is hard to iudge. These are such as claime pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage one of another, claw me, &amp; I will claw thee. They will stand out with it at the barre with God himselfe, as in Math. 3.8. <hi>Your words haue bene stout against me</hi> (sayth the Lord:) But they aunswere: What haue we sayd? But they that make no conscience of iustifying wicked men, will make no conscience to iustifie wickednesse it selfe in time: as <hi>Salomon</hi> made no bones of idolatrie, when once he liked idolatrous women.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Howe Christs words in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1. are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9.</note>It is sayd indeede, <hi>Iudge not that ye be not iudged,</hi> Math. 7.1. But that place is to be vnderstood against rash iudgement, not iudgement sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, for other places do allow of iudging, but no place alloweth rash, hastie, and peremptorie iudging. The Apostle Saint <hi>Paule</hi> handling the doctrine of the Lords supper, sayth vnto his auditours the Corinths, <hi>Iudge ye what I say</hi>: to shew that Christians must be able to iudge of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And speaking of the preparation of Christians before they come to the Lords table, he saith: <hi>Iudge your selues</hi>: to shew that Christians must be able to iudge of their owne estate. In another place he prayeth that the Church of Christ may abound in all knowledge and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and giueth a reason, that they may be able to discerne things that differ.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi>
                     </note> In another place the Lord himself saith: <hi>Iudge righteous iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> All which places (besides infinite more to the like effect) do shew that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:25201:69"/>
our Sauior Christ for bad not all kind of iudgement: they may as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there must be no Iudges, nor iudgement seats: no courts, nor verdicts, no Assises, nor sessions, because Christ hath sayd: <hi>Iudge not</hi>: and so we should make a good peece of worke quickly. But harken now what common reason sayth to the matter. Shall not the Goldsmith iudge of mettals, because Christ hath sayd, <hi>Iudge not</hi>? Shall not the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition iudge of a sicke body, because Christ hath sayd, <hi>Iudge not</hi>? Shall not a iury of twelue men iudge of a fellon, because Christ hath sayd <hi>iudge not</hi>? Shall not the Iudge giue iudgement vpon a malefactour, because Christ hath sayd, <hi>Iudge not</hi>? Shall not the eare iudge of sounds, and the eye of colours, and the nose of smels, and the pallate of meates, because Christ hath sayd <hi>Iudge not?</hi> Yes: you will say all. Very well: And shall not a Christian also by the powers of his inward man discerne betweene a good man and a wicked man, because Christ hath sayd, <hi>Iudge not?</hi> Or doth all power of iudging, and ability of discerning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long onely to the outward man, and none to the inward man? or shall the inward man be able to iudge of euery thing, sauing of mens actions and behauiour?<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</note> That is very absurd. <hi>The naturall man percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not the things of God,</hi> sayth the Apostle, <hi>because they are spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and must be spiritually discerned: but the spirituall man iudgeth all things, and is iudged of none</hi>: that is, of no carnall man is he rightly iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, for the carnall man can no more iudge of the spirituall man and his actions, then a blind man can iudge of colours. Therefore, though Christ hath sayd, <hi>Iudge not,</hi> yet will no man loose his authority in place of iudgement,<note place="margin">They that cry out, you must not iudge, are most rash them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in iudging of others. The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue of the godly and of others is peruerse, &amp; peposte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> nor the priuiledge of his sight, nor of his hearing, nor of his tasting, nor the vse of naturall reason. Nay more, though Christ hath sayd, <hi>Iudge not,</hi> yet these fellowes will not sticke to be most swift iudges of others themselues: for do they see another man zealous in religion, deuout in prayer, a diligent hearer of the word of God, a painefull sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Scripture? a seuere reprouer of sinne, and a strict man in his life and conuersation? what is their verdict of such a one? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, such a one is an hypocrite, a Puritane, a Precisian; oh fie vppon him, none are worse then these professours, a busie fellow I warrant you, a dangerous man, an enemy to the state, &amp;c. But if a man will serue the time, and play the pot companion, and become an vnthrift, a gamster, a tauerne hunter, or a whore hunter, and blaspheme the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred name of God at euery word, and scoffe handsomely at religion: then their verdict is this, and their bolt is leuelled in this manner: Such a man is euen the honestest man that liueth, a notable good fellow,

and no mans foe but his owne. A preposterous iudgement they giue on both sides, like the Barbarians, with whom <hi>Paule</hi> was either a murtherer, or a God. But now heare the iudgement of the word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these swift iudges,<note place="margin">

Secondly, that those which rashly and vnaduisedly iudge of men at their owne pleasure, are the worst men that liue.

When God hath set vp a torch, and lighted it at noone day, and yet we blindfold our selues and will not see, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnesse most peeuish and intollerable, which calleth for a most seuere iudgement, euen depriuation <hi>ipso facto,</hi> of all spirituall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But here now groweth a question: whether may we iudge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates vnreuealed or no?<note place="margin">We may iudge who is (for the present) a wicked man, but not who is a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a Iury.</note> Verily that is a matter that belongeth not to vs, but to the high Iudge of heauen and earth: Neither doth it follow, that because I see such a one is a wicked man, therefore such a one is a reprobate, and a damned wretch: God forbid we should reason so: for though I see now what he is, yet what he shall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after I know not, neither do I know what God hath decreed of him from euerlasting. A Iurie of twelue sworne men do find (being led thereunto by their euidence, that such a one is a theefe, and guilty of felonie, but further they cannot go; to say for certaine that such a one shall dye for it they cannot: for the booke may saue him, or the Iudge may repriue him, or the Prince may pardon him, for any thing that they know: So a Christian by the euidence that Gods word giueth, may find such and such to be guiltie of wickednesse: and for the time may by his fruits pronounce, that he standeth in the state of reprobation, so long as he so continueth: but that he shall dye in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:25201:70"/>
that case, is more then he knoweth: for the booke of God may be a meane of his conuersion: and God the iudge of quicke and dead may repriue him to a further time of repentance: and in the end God for his mercies sake in Iesus Christ may pardon him all his sinnes, and so receiue him to mercy: but this is more then any man can assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of, if he continueth in his wickednesse: therefore let no man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to be a wicked man still in hope of mercy, for he may so deceiue himselfe.<note place="margin">Cases rare and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary.</note> The Church perceiued that <hi>Iulianus</hi> the Apostata, or backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding Emperour had sinned against the holy Ghost, and therefore was a reprobate that way: whereupon they made a decree, that all the Church should pray against him. <hi>Paule</hi> by a speciall spirite of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, discerned of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-smith to be a reprobate: and so did our Sauiour Christ discerne of <hi>Iudas</hi> to be a diuell incarnate,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.</note> and so a reprobate: but these are no presidents nor warrants for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate persons to hold by, while they giue finall sentence vpon any. And so much shall suffice for the second point, where we see how farre we may safely go in the iudging of other men by the description of <hi>Belial,</hi> and how farre not: and now let vs come to the third circumstance, and see what we may learne from the coherence or ioyning of this text with the rest of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>In this Chapter,<note place="margin">The third point: of the coherence of this text with the rest of the Chapter.</note> 
                     <hi>Salomon</hi> maketh a diuision of sinnes, and dealeth against diuerse kindes of sinne: as namely against rashnesse and vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie in suretiship, but not against suretiship it selfe, as more at large I haue shewed in my Caueat for sureties: and then he taxeth those that liue idlely for want of a lawfull calling, and negligently in their calling, and vnprofitably both, as before I haue declared (according to my poore measure) in my Rowsing of the sluggard (the greatest enemy I confesse one of them that euer I had to deale withall in my selfe.) And these sinnes he prosecuteth vnto the 12. verse. From those he ariseth, and encountreth with greater, and grosser sinnes, both of men and women vnto the ende of the Chapter:<note place="margin">Doct. Gods fanne doth find out all.</note> from whence we may note, that the fanne that God sifteth sinne withall shall find out all, and is like the net that bringeth all to the shore. Some thinke to go away with their sinnes as many theeues do with their pilfers, and not to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spied: but it cannot be: for if Gods word may haue free passage, it will find them out. How fondly then do they deceiue themselues, which will haue the word to be sincerely deliuered, and throughly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and yet thinke that they should be exempted from the censure and reproofe of the word,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.45.</note> and not be touched? Of such we reade in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:25201:71"/>
the Gospell:<note place="margin">Some look to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed with for their sins.</note> and namely of a certaine Lawyer, who hearing our Sauior Christ inueying against some great fault amongst that profession, step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth vp, and bestirreth himselfe as a fish that felt himselfe masked in the net, and sayth, Maister, in so saying thou puttest vs to rebuke also. Where we see, that there are some sinnes that can be contented to sit stil, &amp; see their fellows arrested, but being attached themselues, they storme, and startle at the very sight of the officer: yea at the very glimering of the light when it commeth to them, supposing themselues to be priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, by reason that they belong some to Princes, some to Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, some to Gentlemen, some to Lawyers, some to Bishops, and some to their officers, and all retaining to great men in the world, that they should be spared for their maisters sake:<note place="margin">Partiality is to be found in the world, but not in the word. No man can escape the power and censure of the word <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.3 The vse of this point. I. <hi>King.</hi> 18.</note> which partiall dealing may well befound in the world, but in the word it cannot be: for the word of God is of that largenesse that it compasseth all: of that brightnesse that it discouereth all: of that maiesty, that it astonisheth all: of that power, that it apprehendeth all: and of that authority that it commandeth all. Neither can any sinne, or sinnes, withall the shiftes and deuises in the world escape the power and censure of that word, which hath once spoken the word, and proclaimed it to all the world, that whatsoeuer is done in secret shall be preached on the house top, that is, shall be made knowne to all the world. Therefore, thinke it not strange good bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if you find your selues touched, and rifled too, when you heare a Sermon, for the word of the Lord being deuided aright, will do both. Say not as <hi>Achab</hi> sayd to <hi>Eliah: Hast thou found me ô my enemy?</hi> when your secret and deare sinnes are by the power of the word rightly handled, and applied by your Pastour, or whosoeuer else: for God hath found you out, as he did find out <hi>Adam</hi> hidden amongst the trees of the garden, or else we should haue lost our selues for euer: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs be thankfull to his Maiesty for so great a mercy,<note place="margin">The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster doth but hold forth the glasse that sheweth vs our spots, <hi>Ier.</hi> 43.3. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. Great sins and small sinnes are knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> for it is great indeed: and not be angry with his ministers, who do but hold vs the glasse while we see therein our spots. Neither say you as the proud Iewes did to <hi>Ieremy: This is not the word of the Lord which Ieremy speaketh, but he speaketh as Baruch the sonne of Neriah prouoketh him.</hi> For it is the nature of the word to tell you all that you haue done, as Christ told the woman of Samaria.</p>
                  <p>Againe, here we may further obserue, how great sins and small sins are knit together, as great theeues and little theeues lye all in one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, go all in one line, stand all at one barre, and haue all one maner of triall: where we are to note, that Gods Spirit is not so carefull to sift out the lesser offences of men: but the greater also. For, as he is the Iudge of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:25201:71"/>
all men, so he dealeth vprightly in equity with all men: and not as the Scribes and Pharisees, nor as their Apes the Papistes, who straine gnattes and swallow camels, while they vrge the tithing of mint, and cummin, and rew, and let the weightier matters of the law go by: who make the breaking of a Popish ceremony, or dirty traditions of men a mortall sinne, but neuer vrge matters of substaunce, either in matters of faith,<note place="margin">The lawes of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish church are like the Spiders web.</note> or manners. Neither are Gods lawes like the Spiders webbe, that catcheth onely little flies, but like the net that taketh the Lion as well as the Hare, which straightnesse and vprightnesse bewrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the crookednes of men. For first, how contrarie to Gods course is the practise of Antichrist, and Papists? For how precise are they in the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of toyes and trifles, ceremoniall and circumstantiall things, and punishing men for the omission of them? But for the profaning of the Sabboth, for the insufficiency of vnpreaching Ministers, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods word, and such like things, they are not so precise; nay scarse do they account of them as of sinnes.<note place="margin">Many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours are zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler offences in others, and dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with foule abuses in themselues! Our force is to be bent against the least sinnes aswell as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test.</note> This also reproueth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny professours of the Gospell, which will seeme to make a conscience of many matters of lesse moment in others, and dispence with very foule abuses, as of swearing, gaming, &amp;c. both in themselues, and in their families. Whereby all of vs are to be admonished to take that course that Gods Spirite taketh here, and that is, to be as zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst one sinne as against another, and to bend our force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the greatest as well as against the least: and to pull out as well the beames as the motes, out of our owne eyes, as well, as out of other mens. And so much for the doctrine that ariseth of the cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or ioyning of this text with the rest of the Chapter.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The vse of this doctrine is twofold:<note place="margin">A double vse of the former doctrine. 1. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraieth a Popish slaunder.</note> first, it bewrayeth the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous slaunder of Poperie, that chargeth vs with preaching libertie to sinne, because we preach iustification by faith in Christ onely. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we are so farre from that slaunder, that we affirme cleane contrarie, that no Libertine Protestant, or dissolute professor of the Gospell hath fellowship with Christ more then the Diuell hath. But indeede they know not what faith is, except the diuels faith: for the diuels do know and beleeue that Christ dyed for sinners: and they beleeue all the articles of the Creede,<note place="margin">Papists are men of Belial.</note> and tremble thereat, but yet are they Diuels still. Looke to their liues which liue vnder the Popes yoke, and we shall see that they are the children of <hi>Belial</hi>: for what sinne is there that they are not sold vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, like <hi>Achab?</hi> And what sinne can be named almost, that is not bought and sold in the market of the Romish church? And the Pope may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all as they say, for a thousand yeares, yea (if they will pay well for his pardon) for euer. And what are their Popes themselues, who beare
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:25201:74"/>
the glorious title of holy Fathers?<note place="margin">Of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked liues of their Popes.</note> Haue not some of them bene Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancers, sorcerers, and coniurers? and some of them Sodomits, &amp; bugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: and most of them common whoremongerers? Was not one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a harlot? did she not trauell of a child in going their Procession? And is it not recorded by <hi>Platina</hi> and other Writers of their owne, to their euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting shame? What should be thought of those sixe thousand skulles of children, which were found in another Popes Mote? What need they care what they do,<note place="margin">Popish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine fit to make men of Belial.</note> so they may be forgiuen for giuing of a litle Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call gold? They are not ashamed nor afraid when they take a solemne oth to murder Princes, yea Christian Princes, yea their owne most Christian Soueraignes: for they are pardoned aforehand, as he was that poisoned King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>: and that cursed Frier that treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously stabbed the late French King: and therefore they are <hi>Belials</hi> and not we: their religion giueth libertie to sinne, and not ours: they may do what they list, and not they which are iustified by faith in Christ onely.</p>
                  <p>The second vse of this doctrine, is to teach those that are entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bodie of Christs Church,<note place="margin">The 2. vse, to teach Christians mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29.</note> and are called by that excellent glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name of Christians, to put on the yoke of Christ, and neuer while they liue to put it off againe: for though Christ saith, <hi>Come vnto me and ye shall haue ease</hi>; yet it is vpon this condition, that we labour and feele our selues heauie laden: yea though he promiseth to refresh vs, yet it is vpon condition that we put his yoke vpon vs and beare his burden. Whosoeuer then will haue ease by Christ, must not be (like the man of <hi>Belial</hi>) without the yoke of Christ, but must put on his yoke and carie his burden, that is to say, he must submit himselfe to the censures of Christ his Church, and to the doctrine of the Gospell, and to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of the word: and in all things yeeld obedience vnto the truth: yea he must labour by all good meanes to mortifie all carnall lustes, &amp; to ouerrule all his vnruly affections. But this is as hard a saying to flesh and bloud as can be; yea who can endure it? The mother of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> children thought for the asking she might haue a place in Christes kingdome for her children:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.20.</note> but Christ told her of two hard things which she dreamed not of, and that was drinking of his cup, and to be baptized with his baptisme, before they could come into heauen: so we thinke (many of vs) to haue heauen for the asking:<note place="margin">Many think to haue heauen for the asking: without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more adoe.</note> but there belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth more to the matter then so. And as the Papistes thinke to earne heauen with a <hi>Kerelyson,</hi> a <hi>Pater noster,</hi> and a <hi>Creede</hi>: so many Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants thinke that a sigh, and a little lip-labour and eare-seruice will bring them to heauen. But when they heare of mortifying their belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued sinnes, which bring them in pleasure, and profite; and of yeelding
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:25201:74"/>
obedience vnto the Gospell,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.22.</note> it fareth with them as it did with that young man, who went away from Christ with a heauie heart and a sorrowfull countenance. He would follow Christ, but he would not part from his goods: so many will heare Christ preached, and looke to be saued by him too, but they will not leaue their sinnes. If they may be Gospellers and vsurers too, and gamesters too, and adulterers too, and swearers too, then so it is: otherwise Christ shall go alone for al them. These are yet but men of <hi>Belial,</hi> and without the yoke: content they are to trauell toward <hi>Canaan,</hi> so they may meete with the commodities of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the way. Manna without the fleshpots of <hi>Egypt</hi> was lothsome to the <hi>Israelites</hi>: so the Gospell without goodfellowship and carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights is irkesome to the man of <hi>Belial. Lots</hi> wife was content to leaue <hi>Sodome</hi> and go to <hi>Zoar</hi> as she was bidden, but yet she must looke backe, though she were forbidden: so many are content to leaue Poperie and embrace the Gospell, yet not without some looking backe, like those which once openly gaue account of their profiting in religion with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and commendation, but now because their backsliding friends like it not, and prophane persons scorne them for it, they will shew their faces no more in that conflict. The carnall <hi>Capernaits</hi> would heare Christ, till he spake of eating his flesh, and drinking his bloud, and then because they vnderstood it not, they said, that saying was a hard saying, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king offence thereat came no more. So many now a dayes as carnally minded as they, will heare the Preacher, till they heare something that doth offend them, either for want of good vnderstanding or good affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and then they say, that either the preacher found not that in his text, or it might haue bene spared: or in such a thing he went too farre: all which in effect is no lesse then (as the <hi>Capernaits</hi> said) <hi>this is a hard saying,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 3. Of such as keepe the sabbath to the halfes. They are like, 1. The har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot that wold haue the child deuided. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 18. 2. The idol Baal, that could not heare.</note> 
                     <hi>who can abide it?</hi> And so like bleare-eyed men which are offended at the brightnesse of the Sunne, will walke no more by the light thereof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be once a moneth, or vpon a sabbath day, for feare of law, or for shame of the world. And many that do keepe the sabbath day, do vse it as the vnnaturall harlot would haue vsed the child for which there was such pleading before <hi>Salomon</hi>: Let it be neither hers nor mine, but let it be deuided. So they deuide the Sabbath: in the forenoone they are at the Temple, in the afternoone at home. The one halfe shall be giuen to God and after the homeliest fashion too: without any holy reuerence or due preparation: the other halfe to the world, or the flesh, or the diuell, or al, and that with all deuotion and earnestnesse of affection. These may well be likened to the idoll of <hi>Achab,</hi> to whom <hi>Baals</hi> Priests cryed, <hi>O Baal heare vs.</hi> But what said <hi>Elias: Crie lowder, for it may be that your God slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:25201:75"/>
or pursueth his enemies, or else he talketh with some bodie, or is in his iourney.</hi> So if the Minister of Christ would haue <hi>Belial</hi> to heare him, he must crye lowder: O <hi>Belial</hi> heare vs, for it may be that the men of <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> are a sleepe, and must be awaked, or pursuing their enemies, or setting their rackes, or casting ouer their vsurie bookes, or selling their wares, or viewing their grounds, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did his pallace, or running after their bowles, or playing at cardes, or pursuing of their vanities. And that see others of the inferiour sort, and they become as deafe too as their betters. If a man cry neuer so lowd to these <hi>Belials,</hi> it will not boote: for they are as deafe as <hi>Baal</hi>: and if there be no lawe to compell them to sanctifie the sabbath in better sort, we do but loose our labour. <hi>Herod</hi> would heare <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> so <hi>Iohn</hi> would let him alone with his brothers wife: so would many also now be hearers of the word, and reuerence as much the Preacher as euer <hi>Herod</hi> did <hi>Iohn,</hi> so they may haue a dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for some speciall sinne of theirs, which doth yeeld them some filthy gaine or beastly pleasure. But <hi>Herod</hi> was a man of <hi>Belial</hi> for all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout hearing of <hi>Iohn:</hi> and so are these kind of hearers too: for he cast off the yoke of mortification, and so do they.</p>

                     <note place="margin">What it is to put on the yoke of Christ.</note>Well, if we will be Christians indeede as well as in name, we must put on the yoke of obedience to Christs lawes. What he saith we must beleeue: what he commaundeth we must obey: what he promiseth we must desire: what he threatneth we must feare: what he suffereth we must partake: what we vnderstand not we must reuerence: what we like not we must (at the least) affect it: what we brooke not we must yet hunger after:<note place="margin">It is a great honour to pledge Christ in his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. Christs lawes.</note> and what cup he hath drunke to vs in, we must desire to pledge him in the same with all our heart, and count ourselues not worthie of such an honour, when we haue obtained of God so great a fauour. We must then deny our selues willingly, and for his sake take vp the crosse chearefully, for this is Christs lawe, we must heare his voice and follow him: for this is Christs lawe: we must often remember him by worthie receiuing his holy supper, for this is Christs lawe: we must do to the poore what we would do to him, for this is Christs lawe: we must loue one another as he hath loued vs, for this is Christs law: we must suffer reproches and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes for his sake, for this is Christs lawe: we must learne to forgiue our enemies as he hath forgiuen vs, for this is Christs law. In a word, we must mortifie all our euill lusts and affections, and make our members wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of righteousnesse, for this also is the law of Christ. For this cause the word is called a candle to light vs in darkenesse, a sharpe sword to cut and deuide vs, a hard hammer to driue and breake vs, and a burning fire to purge &amp; consume vs: by ruling our liues wherby, both yong in yeres

                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.9.</note> And the obedience of a Christian is nothing else, but a following of that light: a suffering of that sword to hew and cut him: of that hammer to breake and batter him: of that fire to purge and consume him: of that fanne to winnow and cleanse him: and of that plough to breake and till him: and all this with patience, gladnesse and thankfulnesse. A dutie this is very painefull for flesh and bloud to performe: and therefore is called in the scriptures, a cutting off the hand, &amp; a pulling out of the eie. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.29.30.<note place="margin">

First, they are vnprofitable, pursuing (as it were) the wind and the smoke: secondly, they are practisers of mischiefe and wrong.<note place="margin">What is prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> This is profanenesse, from which the Apostle dehorteth vs, in the twelfth to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> and 16. verse: where <hi>Esau</hi> is propounded as a most liuely image of such prophane persons as preferre earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heauen, the world before the word, gold before godlinesse, the bodie before the soule, and the shadow before the bodie: as <hi>Esau</hi> did a messe of pottage before his birthright; and as the <hi>Israelites</hi> preferred onions before Manna: and as the <hi>Iewes</hi> did <hi>Barrabas</hi> before Christ. Such were they that said in <hi>Ier.</hi> 43. <hi>It was well with vs when we made cakes for the Queene of heauen</hi>: as many say now adaies: It was neuer merry world since we had so much preaching: it was a good world when we could go to the Abbeys and other religious houses, and haue our bellies full of good cheare for nothing. <hi>Ieremie</hi> is a babler (said they) and preaching is babling, say these. But what were they and these too? Surely but <hi>Ishima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> prophane persons.<note place="margin">Profane va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and wickednes is called now adaies finenesse of wit.</note> This vaine profanenesse and prophane vanitie, is called finenesse of wit now adaies, whereby many prophane and vaine persons get their liuing, which is nothing else but plaine and lewd shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. This is a matter that men make no reckening of: but such a one is viler then the earth. Yet the custome of the wicked is to commend such, saying: such a one is a good honest man, and doth no bodie any harme, which is vntrue. For <hi>Ish-auen,</hi> the vaine man is also a wicked man, that is hurtful vnto others.<note place="margin">One may be a bad man that doth hurt no bodie.</note> And if it were granted that he did no man harme, yet is he no good man, but a prophane beast and most wicked to Godward. An honest man they say he is, but of what religion is he? what religious exercise doth he frequent? How doth he serue God with his familie? what striuing hath he against his imperfections? When doth he enter into

Examples we haue in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of all these. The Barbarians in <hi>Miletum</hi> were ciuill honest men, whose ciuill courtesie and courteous ciuility appeared in that kind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment which they gaue, and that abundance of necessaries which they ministred vnto <hi>Paul</hi> and his weather beaten company.<note place="margin">Religious honest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue God his due.</note> But religious ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men they were not: that is to say, such as giue God his due: for they had not so much as the knowledge of the true God amongst them, as doth appeare by those extremities that they ran into at the sight of <hi>Paul.</hi> For one while they rashly iudged him to be a murderer,<note place="margin">

In the first of <hi>Kings,</hi> the 14. chapter, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse, it is said of <hi>Abijah</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> that when he dyed all <hi>Israel</hi> mourned for him, because there was found in him some good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse toward the Lord God of <hi>Israel</hi>: that is, he was a man carefull to giue vnto God his right, as well as vnto men: and therefore he was a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ciuill honest man. Some seeme to be religious without ciuilitie: as the harlot whom <hi>Salomon</hi> describeth in the 7. of the <hi>Prou.</hi> who prateth of her peace offerings, and paying her vowes, while notwithstanding in her hushands absence, like a dishonest filth freely violateth her mariage vowe (made vnto him) by prostituting her bodie vnto others: and as <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel</hi> religiously proclaimeth a fast, while most vnciuilly, and with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous crueltie she depriueth innocent <hi>Naboth</hi> both of his life and liuing: and as those do that deuide the spoiles of the Church among them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring (as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith) the sanctified things, &amp; then enquire after the vowes:<note place="margin">

But they that haue neither ciuilitie nor religion in them, are like <hi>Esau,</hi> who hated his brother <hi>Iacob,</hi> because God blessed him: and like <hi>Hanun</hi> the <hi>Ammonite,</hi> who misused <hi>Dauids</hi> messengers which were sent of good will to see him: and like <hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Edomite,</hi> who laid handes vpon the Priestes of the Lord and slue them, when euery bodie else refused to touch them.

                  <p>And further here is to be obserued a difference betweene <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Ish</hi>:<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam &amp; Ish.</note> both do signifie man: but the first noteth the matter of which man was made, that is, red earth: or as <hi>Tremelius</hi> hath translated it, the dust of the earth, which is the worst of all the earth, and good for nothing. Earth is good for something, and clay is good for something, and sand is good for something, and marle is good for something, and dung is good for something: but dust is good for nothing, except it be to put out ones eyes, and of that was man made which is good for nothing. The confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof may greatly humble vs, when we beginne to thinke well of our selues, to waxe proud of Gods gifts, and to despise our brethren. But the man of <hi>Belial</hi> is so called,<note place="margin">Vaine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial is viler then the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth.</note> to shew, that such a one is the vilest ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that liueth, yea viler then the earth: and according to his name, so is his nature: for of a word that signifies the vilest earth is his name deriued: &amp; accordingly, all his studies, cares, and communications are earthly and prophane. All which the Apostle noteth in one word, when he saith: <hi>they mind earthly things: Phil.</hi> 3.19. A God they haue, but it is their belly: a glorie they haue, but it is their shame: enemies they are, but it is to the crosse of Christ: and an end they haue, but it is damnation, saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ish</hi> also is a man, but it noteth a man of strength, and signifieth strength: of the Latines it is translated <hi>vir, à virtute</hi>: that is, a man of manhood, or strong of strength, or vertuous of vertue: because if man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, strength and vertue be not found in man, where should they be looked for? And <hi>Adam</hi> is translated <hi>homo de humo</hi>: that is, taken out of the ground, because of all that God made nothing was made of the earth but man. And in our English toung we say of one that is valiant, vertuous
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:25201:78"/>
and actiue, that is a man indeed. And the Philosopher could say by the light of nature: <hi>non vestis sed virtus facit hominem</hi>: Not vestures, but ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues make a man: which is quite mistaken in these daies, and that saying wholly inuerted: for most men hold, and by their practise do vphold, that <hi>non virtus sed vestis,</hi> not vertue but brauery makes a man. But why is <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial</hi> called <hi>Ish,</hi> which is a word of strength, vertue and perfection? What vertue, excellencie, or perfection is in earthly vaine <hi>Belial</hi>? Surely no goodnesse is in him, and yet is he <hi>Ish,</hi> he is <hi>vir,</hi> a man indeede; but a man whose strength is wholly applyed to vanitie.<note place="margin">The strength of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked is wholy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied in euill.</note> He doth excell, but it is in contriuing of mischiefe: he is quicke witted, but it is in disgracing of truth and her friends: <hi>They are wise</hi> (saith <hi>Ieremie</hi>) <hi>but it is to do euill: They are expert</hi> (saith <hi>Esay</hi>) <hi>but it is to drinke wine and strong drinke: They can take no rest</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>but it is onely till they haue made some to fall.</hi> Such were they that watched all night to take Christ: they were <hi>Ishim,</hi> men indeed. They ranne to fetch him vineger with gall to drinke, which wold not go nor creep for a drop of cold water to haue done him good. Such are all those lawlesse and dissolute persons, that can beate their braines, and breake their sleepe, and go late to bed, and rise early in the morning, and trauell hard all day, yea day and night, by sea and by land, farre and neare, refusing no paines, neither sparing for any cost, nor fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any colours, but most audaciously put forth themselues to speake, &amp; to practise what mischiefe they can against godlinesse and vertue, against honest men and good causes, and standing as stoutly in defence of vanity and wickednesse. These haue a kind of felicitie and dexteritie in gracing of the bad, and in disgracing of the good, and do very often strongly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile in wicked enterprises. And this must teach vs, first, not to be dismai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when iniquitie doth preuaile: for the very names that are giuen to wicked men do shew no lesse, but they shall preuaile for a time, which is to verifie the Prophesie of our Sauiour Christ, who foretold that before the end of the world, wickednesse should preuaile, and iniquitie get the vpper hand. Secondly, it doth admonish the children of God, who are haters of wickednesse, to be <hi>Ishim,</hi> that is, strong, and wise, and valiant, for God and good causes: as <hi>Ish-auen,</hi> the vaine man is for the Diuell and wicked enterprises.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.13</note> And this is not mine but Gods counsel by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, with whose words for this time I will end: <hi>My brethren watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, and be strong.</hi>

Now it remaineth that we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his actions: whereby he is also described aswell as by his names. And first of those which set foorth his outward behauiour; where, the first member to be ripped vp, is his mouth: which for the qualitie is very euill: for it is froward: and for the quantitie is exceeding great: for it is full of frowardnes, as that which is accustomed to speak froward things. <hi>He walketh with a froward mouth</hi>: or as <hi>Tremelius</hi> translateth it, <hi>ore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerso,</hi> with a wry mouth, or a mouth drawne out of fashion.</p>

And therfore,<note place="margin">A man is that which he is for the most part.</note> because of his vsual maner of frowardnes, he is said to walk, not with a wise mouth, nor with a courteous mouth, &amp;c. but with a froward mouth: for <hi>denominatio fit â maiori partè,</hi> the denomination of any thing (say Logitians) is taken from the greatest part: as the Blackmore is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led blacke, though his teeth be white, because all his bodie is blacke.</p>
                  <p>That a froward mouth is a note of a wicked man, shall easily appeare, if we consider two things.</p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:25201:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the true difference betweene the wicked and the godly in the vse and abuse of the tongue. Of the first he may be instructed in diuerse places of the Scripture: but especially three. One is in the old Testament, the other two are in the new: that in the old Testament is the 45. Psalme, where in the beginning of the Psalme, the Psalmist calleth his toung, <hi>the pen of a readie writer.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.1.</note> But what is it that he will write? that is, what will he declare or set foorth? He sheweth in the first verse in generall tearmes: first, that it shall be of a good matter: to shew, that the tongue was made to set foorth none but good matters:<note place="margin">The toung was giuen to set forth none but good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> but what matters doth he meane? He saith, that he will intreat or discourse of the King, meaning <hi>Salomon</hi>: his Maiestie, his beautie, his riches, his power, his wisedome, his vertues, his ornaments, his honorable mariage with the Queen of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all these he meaneth to shadow out the vnspeakeable Maiestie of Christ, and the excellent dignities and prerogatiues of Christ his church. For otherwise he might seeme onely to set his mind to commend men, and to flatter Princes,<note place="margin">Iob.</note> which is a thing condemned by <hi>Iob,</hi> when he saith: <hi>Shall not my maker confound me, if I giue titles vnto men?</hi> But fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this place of the Psalme we may learne, that our toungs are giuen vs, chiefly to set foorth the glorie of God,<note place="margin">And chiefly the glorie of God. The toung compared to a penne for three causes.</note> and those things that may tend to the extolling of Christ and his kingdome, and to the alluring of others vnto the loue of Christ. But why doth he compare the tongue vnto a pen? Surely, for three causes. First, because as the pen sheweth what the mind thought, so the tongue should expresse the zeale of the heart. Secondly, as the penne doth his message without blushing, so the tongue must speake nothing that a man may be ashamed of, but should boldly iustifie the same. And thirdly, to shew that there must be that consent between the tongue &amp; the heart,<note place="margin">And to the pen of a swift wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> that is betweene the pen and the mind of the writer. As the toung is compared to a pen; so also, to the pen of a swift writer: and that for three causes. First, to shew, that as swift writing is a signe of one that is well practised in writing: so the toung should not be slow, but swift, and well practised in the praises of God. Secondly, to shew, that it must dispatch much in a short time, and not a little in a long time, as the hand of a swift writer doth.<note place="margin">1.</note> Thirdly to shew, that the tongue must euer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and corrected as the pen of a swift writer that writeth much,<note place="margin">2.</note> must be stil renewed and corrected.<note place="margin">3.</note> And so much for this place of the Psalme. The vse of the toung may further be learned out of two other places in the new Testament: whereof the first is of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other is of S. <hi>Iames</hi>:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

For as the benefite of the one is great both to our selues and to others, so is the hurt also as great of the other, both to others, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to our selues. To others corrupt speeches are very hurtfull: for if on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good speeches,<note place="margin">The hurt that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by corrupt speeches.</note> and words of grace serue for the vse of edifying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in grace and goodnesse, as they do (witnesse the Apostle in the forenamed place:) then corrupt speeches can serue to no other vse but to destroy and pull downe men from goodnesse, and to infect them with euill:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15</note> 
                     <hi>Be not deceiued</hi> (saith the Apostle in another place: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) <hi>euill words corrupt good manners</hi>: to shew, that some thinke other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but they are deceiued. There be two sorts of people that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with a wrong opinion as touching euill words.

Of the same mind also are they that find eares to heare, and memorie to beare away all such filthie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, (yea they can remember such things better then words of grace) but they are deceiued (saith the Apostle) <hi>for euill words do cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt good manners.</hi> And as they do corrupt good manners,<note place="margin">The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is the generation of euil ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> so do they ingender euill and wicked manners: for <hi>corruptio vnius est generatio al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius:</hi> the corruption of one thing is the generation of another: as in nature we see the corruption of the egge, is the breeding either of a bird, or else of rottennesse and stink: and the turning of the wine is the making of that which was sweete wine, to become sharpe vineger: and the corrpuption of the graine in the earth, is the generation either of a new blade of corne, or else of a weed: euen so the corruption of good manners is the generation of euill conditions: the corruption of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie is the begetting of incontinencie: the death of humilitie is the life of pride: the corruption of faith is the generation of infidelity: the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of sobrietie is the procreation of drunkennesse: and the decay of pietie is the setting vp of prophanenesse. And is all this no hurt? Is there no hurt in euill words, which be as infectious and daungerous to

Which cannot be but to the grieuing of the spirit of God, who is thereby (as much as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in vs) dispossessed of his hold &amp; inheritance. For wold it not grieue any man to be either annoyed in his owne house, or put out of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance which he hath dearely purchased and paied for? And will it not much more grieue and offend Gods spirit to be dispossessed of his owne inheritance, which God hath purchased with his owne bloud: <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. and to haue the diuell set vp in his place like an vsurper?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28.</note> And therefore in the 30. verse of the former fourth to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> he addeth: <hi>And grieue not the holy spirit of God:</hi> vsing that as a reason why we should not suffer corrupt communications to proceed out of our mouthes. For, though there be in all men naturall corruption and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, which is bred and borne with them, yet by the grace of God, it is so suppressed and corrected in the regenerate,<note place="margin">Naturall corruption doth not domineere in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate. What it is for corrupt communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to proceede out of the mouth.</note> that it hath no full sway, nor domineering power in them. And therefore he saith not, let no corruption be at all in your minds: but he saith, <hi>Let no corrupt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication proceede out of your mouths.</hi> For it is said in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>that the imaginations of mans heart are euill continually.</hi> But if lewd speeches haue libertie to proceede out of our mouthes: that is, at pleasure to go and come, like a maister of a familie, that is a signe that Sathan hath wonne the hold, and keepeth possession of the heart. And on the contrarie, when good words are frequent and vsual in the mouth, it is a signe that Gods spirit doth beare rule: though now and then by reason of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall corruption that still remaineth in vs, some crooked thoughts wil breake in to our minds, and some froward speeches will breake foorth at our mouthes by force, or by stealth, while we be not so watchfull as we should be.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.3.4.</note> The Apostle S. <hi>Iames</hi> also agreeth with the former as touching the vse of the toung, in his third chapter, verses 3. and 4. where by two similitudes, he sheweth that the tongue hath a double vse, both in regard of our selues, as also in regard of others. And name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, first our maker, and then our neighbour. For with our tongues we
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:25201:80"/>
must blesse God: that is, praise God, and with our tongues we must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so blesse our neighbour: that is, pray for him, wish him well, and speak well of him, &amp;c. How this little member must be gouerned, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by two similitudes.<note place="margin">Two simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes.</note> First, of a bit in a horse mouth, which the rider vseth for his owne safetie: which also must be moderated: for if it bee let loose too much,<note n="1" place="margin">Of a bit in a horse mouth.</note> the horse will stumble, or go which way he lift, or cast his rider: if it be pulled in too much, the horse will either stand still or else go backe, or rise vp to the daunger of the rider. So the tongue if it be too silent, too fearefull, and too much restrained, the owner shall make no way in his heauenly iourney, he shall not be able to keep companie with others: it will make his affections rise vp with desperate cogitations to his own hurt: neither shall God haue his due praise of that member which he ought to haue: neither shall man reape that benefite thereof, which we owe vnto him: as it falleth out when men are so tong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed, that they will not preach nor reproue sinne, when they are called thereunto, and when others will not affoord their neighbour their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie or witnesse in time of neede to do him good. And againe, if it be let go too loose, and suffered to be too bold, then it will fling out, and runne riot (as the saying is) to the shame of the speaker and griefe of the hearers. Secondly, he likeneth it to the rudder of a shippe,<note n="2" place="margin">Of a rudder in a shippe.</note> which is to rule the ship, and to direct her course: whose benefite (if it be well stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) redoundeth to many, to the Pilote himselfe who doth guide it, to the owners, to the mariners, and to the whole ship, with all that is in it: and so on the other side is the daunger as great and manifold, if it be not well ordered and stirred. So the tongue is so to be vsed, as that thereby the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die may be well ordered, the affections may be bridled, others may be preserued, and all may be edified, by counselling some, by instructing some, by admonishing others, by comforting others, and by praying for all, and interpreting all things in the best part. Which graces whosoeuer hath attained vnto, hath attained to an excellent thing: <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Yea, a man of wisedome</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>spareth his speech,</hi>

But farre from this vse of the tongue, is <hi>Belial,</hi> and <hi>Ish-auen,</hi> the man of vanitie: for he walketh with a froward mouth, a mouth out of fashion and order, not contrarie to nature, but contrarie to grace.<note place="margin">A descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lials toung.</note> All his words be from the matter, all his vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings be commonly wilfull mistakings: all his conceits be malitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions:

of euery bodies matters which belong not vnto them. These are such as <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth against in the 12. Psal. the 4. verse,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 12.3.4.</note> where he saith, <hi>The Lord cut off all flattering lippes, and the tongue that speaketh proud things: which haue sayd; with our tongue we will preuaile, our lips are our owne, who is Lord ouer vs?</hi>

                  <p>Now, these are such as will be carefull inough for speaking of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or fellony, or any thing that may beare any action at law (although sometime through the iudgement of God they are ouerreached and taken in their owne craftinesse before they were aware.)

                  <p>But most wretched are those fooles, and monstrous is the folly of them, who instead of fearing the custome of sinne, and praying vnto God for grace against it, do take it as a sufficient plea, and defence for themselues (being admonished to leaue their sin) to say, Sir it is my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, you must beare with me: yea accompt it a grace vnto them to do as the custome hath beene of their forefathers, though it be neuer so wicked.</p>
                  <p>Againe, further we are to note, that euen in outward shew, there is great difference between the wicked and the godly, least we condemne the iust and the innocent causelesse.

Now it remaineth that we consider of his outward gestures, and then of the internall shop of his heart, and the stuffe that he keepeth there, together with the matter that he frameth of the same. And first for his outward gestures, they are such as (if we marke them well) do shew that all his behauiour is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit. The meaning is, that the man of <hi>Belial,</hi> and the vaine man, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cunning, and skilfull both in playing the hypocrite before God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in practising of other lewdnesse before the world. In actions religious (wherein consisteth the outward seruice of God) he counterfeiteth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cunningly,<note place="margin">He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiteth in religion.</note> making great signes &amp; shewes of deuotion &amp; piety, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuating, or lifting vp his eyes vnto heauen, as the Pharisee did, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:25201:84"/>
by running a pace, or making great expedition to the Temple, as <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiels</hi> auditours did, and by turning ouer with his fingers the Bible to places alledged by the Preacher, &amp;c. All which be signes, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions vnto the world, that he or she that doth so, is very deuoute, and godly, and haue their harts wholly possessed with the loue and feare of God, and their minds employed about the study and practise of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, sincerity, and honesty. All which gestures may well beseeme the godly, whose harts indeed are vpright with the Lord: but as for <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial,</hi> and <hi>Ish-auen,</hi> they are odious in them, because when they make such signes, and giue soorth such shewes and instructions, the Lord seeth, and telleth vs here in our text, that <hi>leud things are in their harts.</hi> They are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signes without the things signified, like an Iuy-bush ouer a doore, where no wine is in the house. The wicked that make them, are like the wicked Scribes and Pharises, who vnder colour of long prayer, studied how to deuoure, yea deuoured indeed (as Christ saith) widowes hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. They are also not vnlike to players on a stage, who come forth with long beards and side gownes, like graue Senators and wise Counsellors, when notwithstanding there is neither grauity nor wisedome in them. And as <hi>Belial</hi> playeth the counterfeit in religious exercises, to couer (with signes of holinesse) the <hi>leud things of his hart</hi>: so also in his ciuill conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and dealing amongst men,<note place="margin">He coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiteth in ciuill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</note> doth he (by making shewes and signes in his outward gestures, of that which he hath not) couer much leud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and practise much mischiefe. What was the kisse of <hi>Iudas</hi> but a signe of loue? yet treason was in his hart, and couered therewith. What were <hi>Ioabs</hi> courteous embracings, and kind salutations: but signes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abner</hi> of a kind friend? yet murther was in his hart, and couered therwith.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.14.</note> What is the harlots talking of paying her vowes, and offering her peace offerings: but a signe of a godly woman? yet euen then is leudnesse in her heart, and it is couered therewith. How many in the world do make signes with their eyes and countenance of great loue and kindnesse, with bending the body to embrace, and hastening their feete to meete euen those whom they hate in their heart? How many againe haue put finger to the eye, and seemed to weepe, and taken vp great lamentation, with wringing of hands, and refraining their meate, with other signes of griefe and sorrow, for the hurt, and death of some, whose death perhaps they haue procured, &amp; for whose losse they laugh and reioyce in their harts? What signes of humility also shall we see, or not see, euen in the proudest persons that are? what signes of grauity, in the lighest and vainest? what signes of charity in the cruellest? what signes of liberality from the most niggardly? and what signes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:25201:84"/>
&amp; valour, euen in the most cowardly persons that are? Long lockes, sterne countenances, bigge lookes, great bragges, monstrous oathes, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell threatnings, and like <hi>Saule</hi> breathing nothing but slaughter, as if they were more then Lions, and when it commeth to the triall they are lesse then men: like empty vessels, which make the greatest sound when they are empty. Of all which, with many moe the like, it may be sayd, as it is in our text, <hi>They make signes with their eyes, they signifie with their feete, &amp; instruct with their fingers, but leud things are in their harts.</hi> And againe, as the man of <hi>Belial</hi> and vaine man, doth oftentimes play the counterfeit both in religion and ciuility, making signes of that which is not in him, yea only to couer the leudnesse that is in him: so sometimes also doth he both openly declare by signes and gestures, the vanity and lightnesse of his heart: and as cunningly likewise by signes and gestures both practise, and also teach mischiefe and leudnesse, when he is amongst his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. And certainly, when the outward gestures of the body, and the parts thereof are not according to simplicity, it must needs proceed from some euill that is in the hart.</p>
                  <p>Now, this noting and marking of a lawlesse person by his gestures, &amp; externall behauiour, doth teach vs many very profitable lessons worthy our best consideration.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 The seuere precisenesse, and precise seuerity of the word of God, which looketh into the very gestures of the body: as the motion of the eyes, of the feete, and the fingers, &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>2 The tyranny of sin, which exerciseth all the parts of the body, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering ouer the whole man.</item>
                     <item>3 The nature of hypocrisie, and how it is descried in the outward parts, and gestures of the body.</item>
                     <item>4 The cunning of the wicked, who can teach sinne, and set forward mischiefe and leudnesse, euen by signes and gestures.</item>
                     <item>5 Lastly, the aptnesse and pronnesse of our nature to learne euill, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by signes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gestures, and dumbe shewes.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Of euery one of these a little: and first, of the strictnesse, and seuere precisenesse of the word of God, in marking and noting the very motions of the body, and euery part thereof. The Lord we see plainly noteth the very gestures of the body,<note place="margin">Euery me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the body is bound to his good behauiour.</note> as well as the words of the mouth, and actions of our life: yea he teacheth vs not onely how to liue, and how to speake, but also how to go, and to moue our bodies: euery part and member is set to schoole, and bound to his good behauiour. Euen as in the building of the tabernacle, and materiall Temple, there was nothing left to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of them that built it, but a patterne was giuen them by God
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:25201:85"/>
for euerything, euen to the very pinnes, and ash-pannes, and flesh-hookes, &amp;c. So, in the spirituall building of our bodily tabernacles, and temples of the holy Ghost, nothing is left to our wils and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but euen from the very thoughts of the heart, to the outward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of the body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea to the very mouing of the eyes, the fingers, and the feet, the Lord hath set downe an order in his holy word: and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer breaketh that order is noted for it by the Lord: but who soeuer wilfully neglecteth it, and setteth the same at naught, is also branded for a man of <hi>Belial</hi> and vaine person, whose heart is full of lewd things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whofe destruction commeth both speedily and suddenly vpon him. <hi>Caines</hi> countenance cannot be cast downe, but the Lord will note it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.6.</note> and search out the cause thereof, Gen. 4.6. to be an enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eye, and a bloudy heart against his brother for his goodnesse: to shew, that we must looke vnto our very countenance, least wrath and enuy be espied therein.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.13.</note> The harlot is noted well inough for her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent face, and thereby is she also noted for a harlot: to teach women and maidens to watch ouer their countenances and outward beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, that there appeare not too much boldnesse and lightnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, because thereby they are discerned, either what they are, or what they would be.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Esa.</hi> 3.16.</note> The proud women of Israel, could not walke as they did with their neckes stretched out, nor counterfeit a minsing gate, but the Lord doth note them for it: and doth he not note the daughters of England for the same things aswell as the daughters of Ierusalem? The Pharisees could not disfigure their faces when they fasted, but our Sauiour Christ would surely marke it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.16.</note> and haue it recorded in his word to their shame, and the admonition of all others. We are become a laughing stocke (saith the Church of God being in captiuity) and a nodding of the head vnto the Heathen:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.13.14.</note> to shew, that the very fleering of the countenance, and the nodding of the head in contempt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite of Gods people, must be answered for before the Lord, aswell as reprochfull speeches, and bloudy actions. And amongst other signes of contempt and reproch shewed by the Iewes against our Sauiour Christ at his death,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat</hi> 27.39.</note> this is noted by the Euangelist for one, that they wagged their heads at him. So, the man of <hi>Belial</hi> cannot worke his feates by signes and gestures, but the word of God will take notice of it, and tell all the world, that <hi>He maketh a signe with his eyes, he signifieth with feete, instructeth with his fingers.</hi> And according to this rule must we liue: by this card must we saile, making (as the Scripture teacheth vs) straite steppes vnto godlinesse. So farre are we from teaching men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to sinne (as the wicked <hi>Belials</hi> of popery slanderously charge the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:25201:85"/>
Preachers of the Gospell) that we allow not men so much liberty as to make signes to any euill purpose,<note place="margin">Against the slander of Papists.</note> but to carry euen the outward parts of the body, and the motions thereof, in such sort as they be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offensiue, nor infectiue, but according to sobriety and simplicity. For this is one chiefe end why <hi>the grace of God hath appeared</hi> (sayth the Apostle to <hi>Titus</hi>) <hi>to teach vs not onely to denie vngodlinesse and worldly lusts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11.12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>but also to liue soberly, godly and righteously in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent world.</hi> Which sobriety mentioned by the Apostle in that place, is opposite vnto all lightnesse, and scandalous behauiour which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth as well in the gestures of the body, as in other things.</p>
                  <p>Some in their wanton and light behauiour are both offensiue to the godly,<note place="margin">Our beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour must be in Sobriety.</note> and infectiue to the weaker Christians: these walke not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to sobriety. Some againe are as counterfeit both in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and also in common ciuility, embracing, affable, courting, duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, promising, and protesting &amp;c. when there is no good meaning at all in them:<note place="margin">Simplicity.</note> these walke not according to simplicity. All which coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit behauiour the Lord noteth and condemneth, aswell as <hi>Cain</hi> for for the heauinesse of his countenance, when it bewraied the enuy and malice of his hart. And no maruell: for both charity and chastity are the worse for such gestures as are not in sobriety and simplicity.<note place="margin">How cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by signes.</note> Charity is broken as well by a proud or disdainfull looke, as by a railing &amp; slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, or reprochfull speech. As well by the nodding of the head, and fleering of the countenance, and winking of the eye, or putting out the tongue is charity broken, and wrath prouoked, as by the violence of the hand. As charity is broken,<note place="margin">Chastity is assaulted by signes.</note> so also is chastity assaulted that way, euen by leud signes and wanton gestures of the body, as wel as by plaine motions, and enticements of speech: both modesty and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, loue and lust, will all appeare and shew themselues in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures and motions of the body, though the tongue sit still in silence, &amp; say nothing, according to the saying of <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> in another place of this booke:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 17.24.</note> 
                     <hi>Wisedome shineth in the face of the prudent.</hi> Many are ashamed to speake what they thinke, but yet by signes and gestures they will shew what they desire:<note place="margin">

Therfore euery member must be sanctified, &amp; made a weapon of righteousnesse.</p>
                  <p>This seuerity of the word of God is it that troubleth all the world: It is counted too great precisenesse to liue so strictly: We cannot looke awry now adayes (say some) but we shall be told of it in the Pulpit. Ah (sayth another) the world is come to a good passe indeed, we must now

go to the schoole of good manners againe;<note place="margin">This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisenesse doth much trouble Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines.</note> we must learne of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher how to go, and how to looke, and when to laugh, and when to be merry. These and such like speeches are rife in the world, but it is onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the men of <hi>Belial</hi> and <hi>Ishim auen,</hi> lawlesse and dissolute persons, vaine and foolish people, such as haue cast off Gods yoke from them: and like them that sayd of Christ.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.27. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 12.4.</note> 
                     <hi>We will not haue this man to raigne ouer vs: come let vs breake their bands asunder, and cast their cords from vs: our tongues are our owne, we may speake what we list, who shall controule vs?</hi> and so are our eyes too, and our fingers too, and our feete too, we will looke, and go, and gesture it as we list, and what hath any man to do with our gestures? These are right men of <hi>Belial</hi> indeed, whom the Lord (that sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the heauens) doth laugh to scorne, and shall haue in great derision when destruction shall come suddenly vppon them in his wrath: yea he shall vexe them in his sore displeasure, and breake them in peeces like a potters vessell, if they be not wise vnto repentance in time, euen before his wrath be kindled, yea but a little. This precisenesse that the profane <hi>Belials</hi> of the world haue in so much contempt,<note place="margin">This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisenesse is called in Scripture circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</note> is nothing else but that circumspect walking which is commended and commanded vnto vs by the Apostle from the Lord in Ephs. 6. <hi>Walke circumspectly</hi> saith he, <hi>like wise men</hi>: as if our life were a iourney to be walked, vpon a narrow bridge ouer a deepe water, ouer which there is no safe passage if a man go lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and skipping, and gazing about him, as those that wander and roue at scope in the wide fields:<note place="margin">Why we must walke circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly.</note> but we must looke to our feete, and to euerie step that we set, or else we are quickly gone, and being downe very hardly recouered againe, without Gods great mercy and grace.</p>
                  <p>So much for the first point. Now the second thing that we haue to obserue,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point.</note> is the tyranny of sinne, hauing once gotten possession in the hart: If lewd things lodge in the heart, surely they will take vp all the outward parts of the body to serue at their pleasure, and from one member to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother will leudnesse fetch his continual walke.<note place="margin">Sins walke.</note> Therefore saith the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Apostle: <hi>Let not sinne raigne in your mortall bodies, to obey the lustes thereof,</hi>

                     <hi>neither giue you your members as weapons of vnrighteousnesse and vncleannesse.</hi> To shew, what a tyrant sinne is, who when he hath gotten hold in the heart of a wicked man, will domineere ouer his whole bodie, and euery member shall serue as a weapon to fight withall in the defence of sinne, and to the offence of vertue.</p>

most miserable bondage and slauery nothing is free to serue the Lord, but all are at Sathans becke, and ready to obey his suggestions.

Yea, of such bewitching power is this tyrant sinne, that he poysoneth like the Crocodile with his very sight and countenance: he hath greater power ouer his seruants the members of the body: nay his seruants the members, haue greater power ouer others, then the Centerion in the Gospell had ouer his souldiers: <hi>I say to one come,</hi>

Then first, here let vs consider what is meant by the <hi>hart.</hi> And next, what profitable doctrines may be gathered from this sentence: and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence thereof with the rest of the wicked mans description.<note place="margin">What is meant in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the hart.</note> By <hi>hart</hi> in this place he meaneth not the fleshly and materiall heart, which is the good creature of God: but the corrupted, and depraued qualities of the heart. For the heart is put sometime for the whole inward man, as in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Let the hid man of the heart be meeke and quiet</hi>: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for the thoughts and affections, for the will and vnderstanding: as in 1. <hi>King.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Giue me an vnderstanding heart</hi>: the prayer of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> That is, giue vnderstanding vnto my hart, mind, or soule: for hee had a hart before. So that in the heart is vnderstanding, but in the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it is leud vnderstanding, because he vnderstandeth leude and vile things best. And in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. it is said, <hi>The imaginations of the thoughts of mans heart were euill continually</hi>: to shew, that thoughts and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions lodge in the heart: but in the man of <hi>Belial</hi> they are leude and wicked. In the 23. of the <hi>Prou.</hi> 26. the Lord saith: <hi>My sonne, giue me thy heart:</hi> that is, the affections of thy heart: as thy desire, thy loue, thy ioy, thy feare, thy trust, thy zeale, thy delight, thy sorrow, as if he shold say, if thou desirest any thing desire me: if thou louest any thing loue me: if thou ioyest in any thing ioy in me: if thou fearest any thing feare me: if thou trustest any trust me: if thou be zealous for any thing be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:25201:90"/>
for me: if thou sorrowest for any thing be sorrowfull that thou canst not do thy dutie to me as thou oughtest: and these things I leaue not to thy choise, but see thou do them indeed. Now all these affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in the wicked man of <hi>Belial,</hi> but they are leud, and not for the Lord. In the fourth of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 12. the word of God is called <hi>a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uider of the thoughts and intents of the heart</hi>: so that in the heart lye thoughts and intents: that is, purposes, conclusions, and determinations, but in the wicked they are all leud and naught. So that the meaning of these words (<hi>Leud things are in his heart</hi>) is, that the man of <hi>Belial</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth leud things, he thinketh and studieth leud things, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth and intendeth leud things, he desireth and affecteth leud things: yea he deuiseth and contriueth nothing else but leud things. This ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomizing and discouering of <hi>Belials</hi> hart in this sort, with the rest of his behauiour, in other parts of his bodie, teacheth vs many excellent pointes of doctrine for our instruction.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The first point.</note>Of the first: That a wicked and prophane man, such as <hi>Salomon</hi> here speaketh of, is no better within then he is without, but rather worse: is euident both by this, and diuers other places of holy Scripture. Here he saith, that as he is froward in his speeches, and dissolute in his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behauiour, so his heart is leud and wicked. So that if the hart be naught all is naught:<note place="margin">If the hart be naught al is naught</note> If there be any goodnes in his heart, it must be either in his vnderstanding, or his will, or his affections: but the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of all these is leudnes, therfore within there is no better then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but rather worse. In the 6. of <hi>Gen.</hi> verse 5. it is said: <hi>That mans wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse is great,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">A descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a naturall man.</note>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> searcheth euery part of the naturall man within and without, and findeth all alike: <hi>Roman.</hi> 3. from verse 11. to 19. Let him be asked the question, and heare his answer. And first of his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:25201:90"/>
What vnderstanding hath the vnregenerate or naturall man? None: <hi>There is none that vnderstandeth</hi> (saith he) meaning the things of God. How are their affections bent? What? do they not desire to know God? No: (saith the Apostle) <hi>There is none that seeketh God.</hi> What? is there none better then another? No: (saith the Apostle) <hi>They haue all gon out of the way: they are made altogether vnprofitable: there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> But let vs make a better search: it may be there is some goodnesse in some secret corner, or in some of their members. What say you of their throat? <hi>Their throat</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is an open sepulcher:</hi> from whence proceedeth nothing but stinke and rottennesse to infect the aire. How are their toungs vsed? <hi>To deceipt</hi> (saith the Apostle.) What is vnder their lippes: <hi>The poison of Aspes.</hi> And what in their mouths? <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of cursing and bitternesse.</hi> They are swift in going, whereabout is it? It may be they plie it so fast to saue some bodie that is in daunger, or to visite the poore and needie. No, (saith the Apostle,) <hi>Their feete are swift to shed bloud.</hi> But yet it may be their trade and manner of liuing is good and profitable to the Commonwealth. No, (saith the Apostle) <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and calamitie are in their waies.</hi> But yet it may be their life is harmlesse and peaceable amongst their honest neighbors. No, (saith he) <hi>the way of peace they haue not knowne.</hi> But yet for all this, they may feare God in their hearts, may they not? No, (saith he) <hi>The feare of God is not before their eyes.</hi> Why then we perceiue that a meere naturall man whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnregenerate, such as <hi>Salomon</hi> calleth, <hi>The man of Belial,</hi> is all one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both within and without: in his life lawlesse, and in his heart leude and wicked. The vse of this first point is to be made against those wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that (being altogether sold vnto sinne, and hating reformation) will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in this sort: Whatsoeuer my sayings and my doings be, or howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer my gestures, and outward behauiour be, or whatsoeuer my religion be, yea though I come not at Church to heare the Sermons, nor take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pleasure in the Scriptures, &amp;c. yet I would you should know it, I loue God, and I regard Gods word: yea I haue as good a hart to God as the best of you. But he is deceiued: for if a leud heart be a good heart, then so it is: but a good heart sendeth foorth good things, (being first renewed by the spirite and grace of God) but if thou be a wicked lawlesse <hi>Belial,</hi> and a vaine man, that walkest in froward customes, &amp;c. then know for a certaine that thy heart is full of leude things, from whence proceed all thy outward disorders. And how can that hart be a good hart to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that is stored with leud things? And so much for the first point.</p>
                  <p>The second conclusion that ariseth from this place,<note place="margin">The second point.</note> is this: that God iudgeth of a man according to that which is in his heart: (whatsoeuer
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:25201:91"/>
he be in shewe) yea, though a false heart may be (and is commonly) shrowded vnder a ciuill behauiour, yet it is seene of God, and iudged by him too. <hi>God seeth not as man seeth,</hi> (saith <hi>Samuel</hi>) <hi>man looketh on the outward appearance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7.</note> 
                     <hi>but God looketh vnto the truth of the heart. The hart of man is deceiptfull aboue all things</hi> (saith <hi>Ieremie</hi>) <hi>yet I the Lord search the heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.10.</note> 
                     <hi>and trie the reines, to giue to euery one according to his wayes:</hi> to shew, that the wayes of man are in his heart, and none can knowe them throughly, but the Lord, whose proper office is to search the heart: and that he will surely do.</p>
                  <p>A needfull point this is for two sorts of people (especially) to think well vpon. The first, are Papistes of all sorts, Church Papistes and all. They are skilfull in their Popish eleuations,<note place="margin">The skill of Papists.</note> idolatrous crossings, down low duckings, demure countenances, holy habites, and obseruations of times, but they keepe their consciences to themselues, and the Lord looketh vpon the leudnes and villanies that are lurking in their harts,<note place="margin">The villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists.</note> till a fit time serue for the bringing of them foorth: as murthering of Princes, vndermining of kingdomes and states, subuerting the Gospel, enriching the kingdome of Antichrist, vnder colour of wilfull pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: besides their whoredomes and other abhominations, which make them now so to storme and rage, because they are discouered vnto the world. But let them looke vnto it, God will iudge them for the leude things that are in their hearts. Many ceremonies they make like <hi>Balaam</hi> with his seuen altars,<note place="margin">Their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Prayers.</note> &amp;c. but both his and their hearts go one way, and God seeth it well inough. Many prayers and great deuotion they pretend, but after the Pharisees fashion, who when they seemed to pray most deuoutly, then they deuoured most greedily and cruelly poore widowes houses.<note place="margin">Inquisitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> Their Inquisitions are full of such prancks, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen amongst their holy fathers: but I will not nowe stand raking in those puddles: Leude things are in their hearts, and God seeth them well inough, and will iudge them: not so much by that which soundeth in their mouths (although he will also iudge them for that) but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by that which is in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. Sort. Politicke Protestants</note>This is also to be thought vpon of our politicke Protestants, who say they defie Poperie: but yet are not (many of them) very sound at the heart. They are too well read and practised in <hi>Machiauell,</hi> to be good Christians: they will not sticke to promise, to protest, to say and vnsay, to do any thing for profite and gaine. These ciuill honest men can outwardly behaue themselues in print, with kind kissings, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous embracings, with courting and saluting, but in their heart God seeth much crueltie, and couetousnesse, deceipt, prophanenesse, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:25201:91"/>
trecherie: like a legion of Diuels in a common Inne for all that come from hell,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.</note> so they bring no godlinesse but gold with them. They creep and crouch (saith the Psalmist) to make the poore fall by heapes into their nets: their courtesie and kindnesse is framed rather by art then by heart: yet all this artificiall dissembling is seene to God, and in time to the world. Wo be vnto them if they repent not, for, <hi>Leude things are in their hearts,</hi> as in the heart of <hi>Belial.</hi> Many are sicke of <hi>Amnons</hi> disease,<note place="margin">Amnons disease.</note> who seemed to long for cakes of his sister <hi>Thamars</hi> making: but he could not be well till he had his pleasure of his sister.<note place="margin">Absaloms practise.</note> And as <hi>Absolom</hi> inuited his brother <hi>Amnon</hi> to a great feast of purpose to murther him, which he most leudly effected: so can many as pollitikely inuite those to their feasts whom they meane to snare and catch at their tables: of al which it may be said as it is said here of <hi>Belial</hi>: Whatsoeuer is in their lippes, yet, <hi>Leud things are in their hearts,</hi> and accordingly will God iudge of them, and iudge them too for leud and wicked persons.</p>
                  <p>Many of our gilded Polititians, and varnished Protestants at large, are no whit behind their tutour <hi>Machiauel,</hi> nor his brother the Pope, in shrowding a leud heart vnder ciuill pollicie, and politicke ciuility, to no small endamaging of the Church of Christ: but perhappes they thinke that God doth not note it, and will not iudge them for it. A man may descant vpon <hi>Machiauels</hi> name, as <hi>Abigail</hi> did vpon <hi>Nabals: Nabal is his name</hi> (saith she) <hi>and folly is with him.</hi> So <hi>Macheuil</hi> is his name,<note place="margin">Machiauels name ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</note> &amp; he matcheth all in euill, and an euil match also hath he made, for he hath matched a Princesse and a pesant together, Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and carnall pollicie together, (or diuellish pollicie rather) who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree like the bondwoman and the freewoman that were in <hi>Abrahams</hi> house, the one hating, scoffing and persecuting the other, so that there could be no peace in the house, vntill they were parted asunder: yea vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the bondwoman and her sonne were cast out of the dores. And this rude companion Carnal pollicie, (who neuer had any other bringing vp, or schooling then in the flesh, which is altogether for it selfe) is fallen grieuously at debate with Pietie: and with his cruell long nailes hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most scratched out Religions eyes: and yet saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he loueth Religion wel, yea and protesteth that he maketh much of her too, and of all her friends. And verily I do beleeue him:<note place="margin">How car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall pollicy doth make much of religion.</note> but I beleeue withall, that it is as <hi>Iudas</hi> made much of Christ, who (being pursebeater) stole what he could fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his maister, and at the last sold him right out, for what he could get. So this same <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> (carnall pollicie I mean) by purloyning and stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from Religion, and her friends the Church, all that he can get, doth make much of Religion, and of the Church. And surely not without iust
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:25201:92"/>
cause doth true religion complaine in many places of the land, that her seruants the Ministers are so shaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and curtalled in their maintenance by pollicie,<note place="margin">Religions complaint.</note> (as <hi>Dauids</hi> embassadours were by <hi>Hanun</hi> king of <hi>Ammon,</hi>) that they are almost ashamed to shew their heades: and so weak brought that they cannot follow her, with that courage and chearefulnesse which should be in them. And in most places generally the course is this: (to let passe those gulfes that swallow vp whole liuings of Colledges and Churches,<note place="margin">Deuouring gulfes.</note> and allow their shepheard, or some other smokie Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> like vnto him, some twentie nobles a yeare, and a cast doubler to serue the Cure:) in most places I say (where liuings are laid to the Church) the course is this. If a preaching Minister be called to a place, (a pastorall charge I meane) where great ones dwell, who must pay their tithes as well as other men: and they perceiue that he be but a nouice in the world, then pollicie is called to counsell, who doth giue him entertainement, by art,<note place="margin">Politicke practises against the Ministers of Christ.</note> but not from the heart: for <hi>leud things are in his heart.</hi> Now sir, mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Pollicie will for a time be a diligent hearer of his Sermons, and with his presence and countenance draw on others to like of him, inuite him to his table, commend him for his giftes, in courteous and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar maner to conferre with him: yet with some straunge countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces sometime among, lest perhaps he grow too bold with him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing his faults, and demaunding of his owne due. Now all this while the world imagineth that here is such a friend, that he were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lose half his liuing then loose him. And the poore simple man thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that he, which pretendeth such friendship vnto him, which so earnestly intreateth him, so highly commendeth him, so stoutly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him, so louingly embraceth him, so zealously followeth him, and so diligently heareth him, will not deny him any part of his due, but will let him haue all, yea with the more rather then with the lesse. But he is deceiued: for the miserable worldling is all this while but practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by pollicie to get into his hands the spoiles of the Lords inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And in his heart perhaps he thinketh thus with himselfe: Surely I shall so fill him with my morsels, and make him so beholding vnto me for one thing or another, that except he will incurre the note of an ingratefull person, he shall not choose but let me haue his churchright as good cheape as <hi>Esau</hi> sold his birthright, for a messe of pottage, or halfe for nought: if not, then <hi>actum est de amicitia,</hi> farewell friendship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will meete with him some other way, and make him wearie of his place. Verily whosoeuer practise thus, haue leud things in their harts. But it may be they thinke that God doth not note them; neither will he iudge them for it. But they are deceiued: for surely he that telleth
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:25201:92"/>
vs here that <hi>leude things are in Belials heart,</hi> doth also tell vs, that euen therefore <hi>his destruction shall come speedily and suddenly vpon him without recouerie.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Politicke and cruell practises against the common wealth.</note> And let them thinke well of this point also, who in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth vnder colour of dealing well with poore men, carrie a leude heart and a cruell hand against them. As <hi>Achab</hi> was sicke for <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard which lay hard by his: so many rich men are sicke for poore mens liuings and commodities, because they lye somewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously for them: if a faire offer of some base exchange will serue, so it is: if not, then practise his ouerthrow: or by ouerburdening him with taxes, and paiments, or by some other deuice to wearie him, and so to make him giue ouer: but first speake him faire, and giue him a dinner. Herein they play the Lion that came to the sicke foxe,<note place="margin">Of the fox and the lion.</note> and offered to lick him whole with his tongue, when in his heart he purposed to teare him in peeces with his teeth: which the foxe perceiuing, he made him answer that his tongue indeed had a soueraigne vertue in it, but it had a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of ill neighbours, meaning his teeth, and vntill they be remoued, (quoth he) I thinke your Lordship will haue but a few patients. And like to the Lions Phisick is the kindnesse of vsurers in lending their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,<note place="margin">Vsurers kindnes in lending of money.</note> but their deuises be indeed innumerable, and therefore I will not meddle with them at this time.

and much bad stuffe and filthinesse which man cannot perceiue of a long time: all which they must giue account for.

And so much for the second point, which is this, that howsoeuer a man may carrie himselfe in outward shew, to the great admiration of the world, yet God doth looke further, and iudge him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the leud things that are in his heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The third point.</note>Now let vs come to the third point, and therin consider that the cause of all that euill and disorder which appeareth in the outward parts of the bodie, is in the heart. For when the Lord hath ripped vp the outward parts of <hi>Belial:</hi> as his mouth, his eyes, his fingers, and his feete: then he saith presently, <hi>Leud things are in his heart,</hi> as if he should say: No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell though his outward man be so ill occupied: for there is one within that setteth him a worke, and that is a leude heart, which is the cause of his froward mouth, &amp;c. A leude heart, or a heart not regenerated, is like <hi>Achan</hi> among the tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iosh.</hi> 7.</note> who secretly played the theefe, and brought all out of quiet: for whose sake all were plagued. And as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chans</hi> leude act was the cause of <hi>Israels</hi> trouble, so his owne leud heart was the cause of his leud act, and of his owne trouble. When <hi>Israel</hi> was plagued in king <hi>Achabs</hi> daies, <hi>Achab</hi> blamed <hi>Eliah</hi> for it, little drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that himselfe was the cause thereof. <hi>Achabs</hi> humour liueth still in most men, though <hi>Achab</hi> be dead: for euery one looketh one vpon another, and saith, that such and such are the causes of the troubles, and stirres that are amongst them: when it may be, if they searched well, they should find the cause (most part of it, if not all) to be the leudnesse and coruption of their owne hearts. Some set vpon the Preachers, as <hi>Achab</hi> set vpon <hi>Eliah,</hi> and crie out that they are trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and preaching hath marred all: but are they not deceiued as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab</hi> was? For ask them: Is it not the truth that we teach? and that they
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:25201:93"/>
are so much disquieted withall? they cannot, they will not deny it. Oh but (say some) they liue not according to their doctrine. Well, admit that to be true, (as it is in many) which yet is an accusation more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall then true, and is more maliciously, then truly or Christianly obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: yet are not they found lyers, which say, that preaching of the Gospell is the cause of euill? For, first, they confesse that we preach well, and that our doctrine is of God, and is sound and good. Then of that which is good, properly can come nothing but good: For <hi>qualis causa talis effectus</hi>:<note place="margin">Of good cometh no thing but good.</note> such as the cause is, such is the effect, saith reason. If there follow any euill effect of a good cause, it is <hi>per accidens,</hi> through some euill accident that came betweene, or vpon: as when wheat was sowed, tares came vp; the wheate was not the cause of the tares, but an ill accident happened vpon the sowing of the wheate, and that was this: <hi>while the keepers slept the enuious man came and sowed tares.</hi> Indeed Christ is called a rocke of offence, as though he were the cause of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: which yet is not so, for he is the doore of eternall life. And the doctrine of the Gospell is continually matched with many offences,<note place="margin">Christ is called a rocke of offence, but is no cause of offence.</note> &amp; yet it is the way to saluation. For where Christ commeth and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is preached, we meete with many lets, which either lead vs awry out of the right way, or else do stoppe vs, lying in our way, or giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of falling: and yet of all these, nothing can be imputed to Christ or to the Gospell. Not to Christ: for first, it is his office to leade vs by the hand the right way to heauen. Secondly, he is the light of the world,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.</note> by which we are guided thither. Thirdly, he is the path by which we come thither. Fourthly, he is the doore by which we enter in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and therefore none of these lets or stumbling blockes can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Christ, nor to the Gospell: for it is the nature of the Gospell, by taking away all lets, to set vs open an easie accesse vnto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen: and therefore it is called <hi>glad tidings.</hi> Nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is more disagreable to the nature of Christ and his Gospell, then offence and disorder. But this offence happeneth through the leudnes of mens hearts:<note place="margin">How Christ is an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of falling.</note> for as soone as Christ appeareth, by and by men are wrapped in with offences, or rather of themselues runne headlong into them. Thus is he the stone to stumble at, not because he giueth occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of stumbling, but because occasion is wilfully taken. And so the Gospell which is the doctrine of vnitie and peace,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cal. de. scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalis.</hi>
                     </note> (as Maister <hi>Caluin</hi> both learnedly and largely doth shew in his Treatise of offences) is the occasion of great troubles and garboiles in the world: because the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked take occasion thereby to set all things in a broile. Therefore if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny euill follow the doctrine of the Gospell, it ariseth from some other
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:25201:94"/>
cause, which is this: <hi>Leud things are in his hart, who receiueth euill by the truth.</hi> And such men turne euen the best things to a bad end, so soone as they touch his leud heart:<note place="margin">Some are like the Spider.</note> like the spider, who being full of poison turneth euery thing into poison that she sucketh. If therfore men wold leaue raking abroad in the doctrine of the Gospell, and the liues of Preachers and other professours, and search at home in themselues, they shall find the cause of most of that hatred and contention, and wilfull mistaking, and rash iudging, and bitter censuring, and wicked liuing that is in our Christian Churches, to be in some an ignorant and prophane heart: in some an idolatrous and superstitious hart: in some a proud and ambitious heart: in some a couetous and worldly heart: in some a drunken and a voluptuous heart: in some a dissembling and Machiuilean heart: in some a scoffing and scorning heart: in some a cruell and Herodian heart: in some a trecherous and <hi>Iudas</hi>-like heart. Now when all these chaunce to ioyne together against the truth, as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> did against Christ, then know that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill whose name is <hi>Legion,</hi> is vp in armes against God, but to his owne destruction.</p>
                  <p>Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when we haue by the grace of God found out the cause of our euill to be an euill heart in our selues: we may truly say of our harts as <hi>Dauid</hi> did of <hi>Doeg,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 55.12.</note> and prophetically of <hi>Iudas: Psalm.</hi> 55.12. <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mine enemy did not defame me, but it was thou my familiar friend, which was bred and borne with me, euen thou my heart with whom I haue bene so familiar, that hast wrought me the greatest part of my woe.</hi> Of the same iudgement is the Apostle <hi>Iames:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.13.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God, for God cannot be tempted with euill, neither tempteth he any man.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">15.</note> 
                     <hi>But euery man is tempted, when he is drawne away by his owne concupiscence, and is enticed. Then when lust hath conceiued it bringeth forth sinne, and sinne when it is finished, bringeth forth death. Erre not my deare brethren.</hi> Where the Apostle plainely sheweth vs two things: first, that such is our impudencie, shamelesse ignorance, and presumptuous blind boldnesse by nature, that rather then we will acknowledge our selues to be in fault,<note place="margin">2. points to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrued in the words of <hi>Iames.</hi>
                     </note> and to be the cause of our owne euill, we will not sticke to lay the fault vpon God, and make him the cause of euill. As our first parents did: the woman blamed the serpent and the man bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not simply the woman, nor himselfe at all: but the woman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth which God had giuen him. Secondly, that whosoeuer thinketh that God is the cause of his euill, and not that his owne corrupt hart is wholly the cause thereof (the force whereof is so great both to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and draw vnto euill, to conceiue and to bring foorth euill) doth
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:25201:94"/>
erre and is deceiued.<note place="margin">Into a leud heart the word can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter.</note> Hereof it commeth also that the word of God cannot enter into many: it cannot fasten vpon their hearts, because their hearts are full of leud things. Like the Inne where Christ was borne: there was no roome for him in the Inne, and therefore he was faine to lye in the stable. And in many, though it enter, yet it tarieth not,<note place="margin">In an euill heart the word can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide.</note> but departeth away presently: saying as Christ said, when the Iewes sought after his life: <hi>Arise, let vs go hence,</hi> as being vnwilling to lodge in so filthie a place, and amongst his enemies. And hence it is likewise, that the Preachers words come out from many when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat a Sermon, as <hi>Thamar</hi> did from <hi>Amnon</hi> when he had defiled her, with her garments all rent and torne.<note place="margin">Simili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> If pure wine be put into a filthy and vncleane vessell, in powring it foorth againe, it will appeare what stuffe was in the vessell, for they come out together: so, if wholesome doctrine be deliuered to a leud heart, in the rehearsing thereof it will appeare with what manner of vnderstanding and affection he heard it. Such caskes do many bring with them to put our Sermons in,<note place="margin">A leud hart maketh a leud report of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther runne out like Siues, or else are defiled with ignorance, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or preiudicate conceipts, that it wold loth a man to heare it come from them. For though it came to them in a princely robe, yet it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from them like a beggers cloke: yea though it came to them with a louely countenance, yet it commeth from them like a filthie carrion, dragged and haled in the miry streetes amongst dogges: that a man would thinke the Preacher had bene out of his wits, to deliuer such matter, or in such manner as they vtter it: or else (which is the right) that they wanted both wit, and vnderstanding, or grace, or conscience, or honestie, or all, that heard the Sermon to report it in such a leud manner.</p>
                  <p>But the best is, the shame turneth to themselues, and no bodie is so much defiled with such hearts as the owners thereof: So saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ: <hi>Those things which proceede out of the mouth come from the heart,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat</hi> 15.18.19.</note> 
                     <hi>and they defile the man: for out of the heart come euill thoughts, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, adulteries, fornications, false testimonies, slanders: these are the things which defile the man,</hi> meaning him that is troubled with them: as if he did but vomite vpon his owne clothes,<note place="margin">A man of a leud hart doth most shame and annoy himselfe.</note> that speaketh from a filthie heart. And verily they are but fooles that do so: for what wise man will carrie one with him still, that shameth him wheresoeuer he goeth. A leud &amp; vnreformed hart, is such an vnmanerly companion, that doth nothing else but discredite our persons, deface our religion, grieue our friends, harden our foes, aduance the Diuell, prouoke the Lord, marre all the good things that come neare it, and alwaies annoy, shame and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:25201:95"/>
vexe the owner. <hi>Lot</hi> had much ado with the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> but none did more dishonour him then his owne daughters. <hi>Noah</hi> was vexed with the old world, but none did him so much shame as his owne sonne. <hi>Dauid</hi> had many enemies, but none put him in such feare and danger, as his owne <hi>Absalom. Sampson</hi> had much ado with the <hi>Philistines,</hi> but his owne heifter his wife ploughed vp his riddle to the aduantage of his enemies. Our Sauiour Christ had many enemies, yet none like <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> who was alwaies in his companie. So euery man, yea euery true Christian shall haue many enemies, crosses, troubles, and dangers, but his owne heart is his greatest enemie, which doth flatter him most, and deceiue him soonest: which for want of godlinesse cannot be content with that it hath: which for want of contentation cannot be in quiet: for want of quietnesse cannot haue any ioy of any thing that it enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: which for want of heauenly wisedome cannot deuide his times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, nor tell how to deale with all sorts of people: which for want of patience cannot beare an iniurie, or put vp a wrong: for want of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull affections cannot tell how to forgiue offences: for want of charitie cannot tel how to construe things well: for want of the feare of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue a good vnderstanding: for want of a good vnderstanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerteth the straight waies of the Lord: which for want of humilitie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see the meaning of Gods wayes: which for want of a lowly affection cannot tell how to seeke peace: for want of Gods grace cannot acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his fault: and for want of remorse of conscience cannot repent him of his leudnesse. Such a heart is the heart of the wicked <hi>Belial,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fraught with leud things, disordereth, distempereth, and shameth all the life of that man that hath it and is ruled by it. And so much for the third point: in handling whereof, we haue seene that all the cause of outward disorder and trouble is within a mans owne hart: of the other three points in the next Sermon.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vt of these words (ioyned with the rest of <hi>Belials</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription) we haue hitherto learned three excellent and worthy points of doctrine. First, that <hi>Belial</hi> is no better within then without. Secondly, that the heart and whatsoeuer is in the heart of man, is knowne to God, who will also iudge a man according to that which is in his heart, whatsoeuer shew he maketh outwardly. Thirdly, that the cause of all outward disorder, and scandalous behauiour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is in the wicked mans owne heart. Now, it remaineth that we consider of the three other points, which (being propounded in the former Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) for want of time I could not intreat of.<note n="4" place="margin">The heart must be reformed before one can be a good man.</note> Whereof the first is this: that so long as the heart is vnreformed, and continueth stored with leud things, it is not possible to be a good man. For vntill then (as we may perceiue by this anatomie of <hi>Belial</hi>) the affections will be rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and lawlesse, the speech will be froward and peeuish, our religion will be hypocriticall and counterfeit, our prayers will be lippe-labour and cold babling: our zeale will be either none at all, or very bitter &amp; rash, our faith will be meere historicall, our loue will proue onely self-loue, our anger, reuengefull and iniurious, our life dissolute and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, our repentance desperate and faithlesse, and our death dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and comfortlesse. Therefore if any would reforme his life, he must first reforme his heart, from whence as from a spring floweth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a streame of corruption and vnrighteousnesse; vnto death, if it be not reformed and altered; or of holinesse and righteousnesse vnto life, if it be well reformed and kept. Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> pointing to the right way that leadeth to the reformation of maners,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.23.</note> saith: <hi>Keepe thy heart with all diligence</hi>: and addeth this as a reason: <hi>for, thereout co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth life,</hi>

And <hi>out of the heart</hi> (saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ) <hi>proceede euill thoughts, adulteries, murthers, fornications, debate, strife, &amp;c.</hi> speaking of an euill and vnregenerate heart: to
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:25201:96"/>
shew, that a wicked mans heart is like a filthie dunghill, which both breedeth and harboureth all kind of venimous vermine: and as a snake on a sunnie day commeth foorth of her hole: so the wicked, when fit time and occasion serue, do set foorth, and shew the ware and stuffe which was hidden in their heart, saying in the meane time as <hi>Esau</hi> did. <hi>When the daies of mourning for my father Isaac do come,</hi>

In vaine do we sweepe the channels of the streete,<note place="margin">Similitude.</note> except we stop the fountaines from whence they flow. In vaine do we crop the weedes, except we dig vp their rootes from whence they receiue their nourishment. In vaine do we plaister the sore, except it be searched and cleansed to the bottom. So in vaine do we labour to bring forth good actions without, except first we labour to beget good affections within. <hi>How canst thou say that thou louest me,</hi>

And therefore whosoeuer will loue indeed, must beginne first at his heart, and frame that to loue.

On the other side, winne the heart, and all is wonne: without which there is no rowing but against the streame. A readie heart maketh a readie hand to giue, a readie tongue to speake, a readie eare to heare, and a readie foote to goe.

                  <p>Nowe therefore whosoeuer (being endued with that search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and powerfull spirite in any measure) handleth and deuideth the word aright, cannot choose but rifle the very thoughts of the hart.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A double vse of the former do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note>Of this point we may make a double vse, first, it may teach vs for a certaine truth, that there is no thought in the heart, but that God is priuie to it: for when he shall giue man a spirite to search, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to iudge the hearts of men, which aboue all thinges are so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull that they cannot be knowne (as the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> telleth vs) meaning that no man by his owne skill can throughly sound the depth of any mans heart, nor perfectly know his owne) how much more doth God himselfe search and know them most perfectly and exactly, who is all wisedome it selfe? <hi>Elijah</hi> was a sharpe sighted Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, as any was in all Israel: yet he could see no more then himselfe left, which stood zealously for the glorie of God, and hated <hi>Baal:</hi> but the Lord saw 7000. in Israel,<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 19.14.18.</note> which neuer bowed their knees to <hi>Baal,</hi> more then <hi>Elijah</hi> saw.

Therfore, when by the light of the word of God (shining in our hearts) we see more corruption in our selues then we did before, let vs thanke God, and repent of it, for to that end doth the Lord hold forth that candle, to discouer vnto vs our hidden corruption, and to draw vs to repentance, and not to stay there neither, but pray against more, that we know not of by reason of our ignorance &amp; negligence, and not to thinke ourselues well when we haue repented that which we know.</p>

other profane persons which care not for the word of God, know no more the deceipt of sinne, nor the corruption of their hearts, then the bruite beast doth, but glorie and reioyce in that which is their vtter shame: and how can they repent them of that which they glorie in? and that is, the leud things of their hearts, which for want of the heauenly light they cannot discerne. And this is that which <hi>Salomon</hi> meaneth when he saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 5.23.</note> the wicked shall die for want of instruction, and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray through his great folly. And as for their owne naturall light, it is (in comparison) but meere darknesse, and a false light, that (like a Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers shop light) doth deceiue men with false colours. And further, let no man be offended with the minister of God, who doth but hold forth the glasse, which doth shew vnto them the spottes and deformities of their soules: Nay rather let vs accompt him the best teacher that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth nearest our consciences, and that a good Sermon that rippetth and tumbleth vp all our hearts.<note place="margin">Note that.</note> And if we go from a Sermon which doth not trouble vs, and like a purgation worke strongly in discouering and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing our hearts, and the sinnes that lurke there: then let vs thinke, that either we haue dead &amp; hard harts, or else that the speaker wanted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will, skill, or courage, or that his weapons had no edge, and his phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke no strength. But many in steed of making this vse of it, do presently thinke that some body hath told the Preacher some tales of them: as the proude men of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> sayd that <hi>Ieremy</hi> spake as <hi>Baruch</hi> the son of <hi>Neriah</hi> had prouoked him against them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Now it will be time to see what remedie may be had against those<note place="margin">The sixt point.</note>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:25201:99"/>
leud things that breede in the heart: whereby we may approue our selues in the sight of God, such as need not feare that sudden and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerable vengeance which is to fall vppon the man of <hi>Belial.</hi> And surely, whither shall we go for a remedy, but vnto him that hath told vs the state of our harts, and that is to God himself? who doth not only by his word tell vs what we are, but also what we ought to be, and by what meanes we may be as we should be.

                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.9.</note> and that is the word of God. That which discerneth and sheweth vs the diseases of our harts, is that which also prescribeth a remedy against the same: but the word of God hath shewed vs that leud things are in the heart; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word of God also will shew vs how to reforme the heart: and is like a skilfull Phisition, who both sheweth the disease, and the remedy.</p>
                  <p>Now, the meanes which are prescribed in the word, are of two sorts, either Restoratiue in regard of the time past, or Preseruatiue in regard of the time to come, and both of God: which the holy Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> acknowledgeth when he sayth:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.3.</note> 
                     <hi>My soule prayse thou the Lord, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth thee all thy sins, and healeth all thine infirmities.</hi> And the same doth <hi>Ieremy</hi> also confesse,<note place="margin">

And this is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth, when he requireth vs to walke circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly: and is all one with that of <hi>Salomon</hi> in the fourth of the Prouerbes. <hi>Keepe thy heart with all diligence</hi>: as if there were no hold in the world so much assaulted, nor any mans daughter or goods so much layed for, as the heart of man is: and therefore that must be kept with all diligence, and watched most narrowly.</p>

A helmet she must haue,<note place="margin">A helmet.</note> but that must be of hope, which causeth her with patience to expect the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Gods promised saluation: and this beareth off all the blowes of Sathan.

                     <note place="margin">A girdle.</note> Then she must haue a girdle to keepe all her armour close about her, and that must be of truth and sincerity, or soundnesse of heart and a good conscience, which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to hypocrisie. Then a sword she must haue in the one hand,<note place="margin">A sword.</note> and a shield in the other, to defend her selfe withall, and to offend her enemies. But this sword must be the word of God, not the Popes <hi>Legenda aurea</hi> (which hath wel-neare as many lyes as lines in it) nor any of his dirtie Decrees.<note place="margin">A shield.</note> And her shield must be a liuely iustifying faith, which must still apply Christ and his merits, and oppose him against all that euer Sathan cannot obiect against her.<note place="margin">Shooes.</note> Then she must be shod with shooes, but they must be affections prepared, and alwayes in a readinesse to heare and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the Gospell, whereby she shall speedily and easily trauell and come to all the rest.<note place="margin">Prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall and feruent.</note> And to all these she must ioyne continuall, and feruent prayer, both for her selfe, that she may betime put on, and skilfully vse this armour: as also for others, and namely first, for her Captaines and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Ministers of the word,<note n="1" place="margin">For her selfe.</note> and next for all the Saints and members of the Church that be her fellow souldiers.<note n="2" place="margin">For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> And thus we see a Christian man in armes, appointed to keepe diligent watch ouer his heart, being

                  <p>Now further, that we may watch and pray to good purpose; we must know and remember: First, what we are to pray for. Secondly, what we must pray against.

King 3.9. in stead of an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous heart, a chast heart: in stead of a subtill and crafty heart, a simple and discrete heart: in stead of a proud and high minded heart, an humble and lowly heart: in stead of a foolish heart a wise heart: in stead of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious hart, a charitable hart: in stead of a hard hart, a soft &amp; tender hart: in stead of a vaine and profane heart, a holy and religious heart: in stead of a stubburne and rebellious heart, an obedient and tractable heart, and in stead of a counterfeit and dissembling heart, an vpright and a sound heart.<note place="margin">3. things to be learned by the words of <hi>Dauid</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.10.</note> And a heart thus altered and renued by God, <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth a heart new created: to shew first that we can no more of our selues reforme our owne hearts (whatsoeuer Papists prate) then we can cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a heart. Secondly, that vntill our hearts be renued by the grace of Gods Spirite, they are as if they were not at all.

                  </p>
                  <p>The second thing that we must pray for: is, that it would please his diuine Maiesty to ioyne sanctification and illumination together in our minds,<note n="2" place="margin">Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that is, not onely to enlighten our hearts with the vnderstanding of his will, but also to worke in vs the loue of righteousnesse, and obedience to his will: yea, that he would (to that ende) giue vs an vnderstanding heart, or a heart enlightened, that we may keepe his law with our whole hearts. So <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth in Psalme 119.34.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.34.</note> 
                     <hi>Giue me vnderstanding, and I will keepe thy law: yea I will keepe it with my whole heart.</hi> And that is the way indeed to come vnto a sound and a sauing knowledge of God,<note place="margin">A sauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> as our Sauiour Christ sheweth in the seuenth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> verse. 17. <hi>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God of no.</hi> Not the idle hearer, or vaine disputer, or the carping cauiller, &amp;c, but the doer: yea, he that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to followe Gods counsels, shall know Gods counsels, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:25201:100"/>
none else. And vntill we haue an actiue vnderstanding in the law of God, not the forme of doctrine onely, or a formall knowledge of the same, but the power of it (as the Apostle teacheth:) vntill then (I say) we be like <hi>Balaams</hi> Asse, who indeede could do that which other beasts could not do, and that was, to speake, and reproue his maister with a mans voyce, and yet was still a beast: or like <hi>Vriah,</hi> who ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried letters in his owne bosome to his owne destruction.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sa.</hi> 11.15.</note> Or like vnto the diuels, who sayd in the fourth of Luke, that they knew Christ, but it was to their torment. Therefore whosoeuer would keepe his heart well, and haue it purged and preserued from the leud things of <hi>Belial,</hi> let him pray that the truth may not swimme aloft in his braine (as it doth in many wicked men,) but that it may sinke downe into his heart, and worke righteousnesse and true obedience to Gods will.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note n="3" place="margin">Perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or constancy. <hi>Psa.</hi> 86.11.</note> because our harts are very false to God, and like run- awayes, new fangled, mal-contented, and desirous of liberty, therefore in the next place it will not be amisse to pray with <hi>Dauid: O Lord knit my heart vnto thee, that I may feare thy name.</hi> And then indeede are we in safety and security: for in his seruice is freedome and protection. But if we wander out of his seruice, and Iust after carnall libertie, then are we in danger, and it will fall out with vs as it did with <hi>Dinah</hi> the daughter of <hi>Iacob,</hi>

How needfull this prayer is, it may sufficiently appeare vnto any one that will but consider, that <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth in one Psalme, the 119. no lesse then seauen or eight times for this grace. And these are the things which I finde at this time most necessarie to be prayed for of euery one that would haue his heart well purged and reformed: not excluding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which others presently, or hereafter vppon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meditation, and experience, may finde requisite to bee prayed for.</p>
                  <p>Now, as we must pray for these graces and fauours of God before specified, so also must we beware of foure most daungerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and pray earnestly against them, that through Gods gracious helpe and power we may be deliuered from them.</p>

The inward meanes,<note place="margin">Inward.</note> is the Spirite of God working faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, and obedience in our hearts by the outward.

                        </list>
                     </note> Let them also beware and look to themselues, who giue ouer hearing of Sermons, of which there be two sorts, schismatikes and afflicted consciences: schismatikes are they that cut themselues off from our assemblies, whose propertie is to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie themselues, and to condemne others, and therein they haue no small felicity: of these, some be Papists, some Brownists, some Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, &amp;c. To the first sort we may say as the Apostle doth in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6.7. <hi>I maruell that you are so soone turned away vnto another Gospell, from him that hath called you, which is not another Gospell. But some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you intend to trouble the Church of God.</hi> And if we be not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and Ministers of Christ vnto them, yet doubtlesse we are vnto others, who are the seale of our ministerie vnto God in Christ. To the second sort we say as the Church saith in <hi>Canticles.</hi> 3.1.2.3.4. Thou wouldest find Christ, and canst not, thou hast sought his loue and canst not find it, therefore thou wilt seeke no longer: oh do not so, but heare what the bodie sayth to thee a member of the same: <hi>In my bed by night I sought him whom my soule loueth, but I found him not:</hi> What then? did she giue ouer seeking?<note place="margin">

The watchmen that went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Citie found me,</hi> (meaning that she went to the Ministers of the word for comfort) <hi>to whom I said, haue you seen him whom my soule loueth? When I had passed a little from them, I found him whom my soule loueth: I tooke hold on him, and left him not, &amp;c.</hi> Meaning that she (hauing long v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all meanes both priuate and publike) then found him when she was out of all hope to find him: and so do thou that art troubled in thy soule, because thou canst not yet find that alteration of thy heart, and that inward obedience, and that truth of heart, and that comfort and ioy by hearing the word and prayer, &amp;c. which thou desirest and lookedst for: vse all means, continue stil seeking, asking, and knocking, seeke priuatly at home in thy bed, by priuate examination and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: then conferre with thy Christian neighbors about the state of thy soule: then go to the Ministers of the word, and frequent the publike holy assemblies, with an earnest desire of finding: and doubtlesse at last
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:25201:102"/>
when thou art out of al hope, thou shalt find comfort. And as in taking of bodily phisicke, many (through the weakenesse of their stomackes) do cast vp that which they take, and yet take the same thing stil, though their stomake loath it: so in taking of spirituall phisicke, though yet thou doest in a manner loath it and distaste it, yet take it still, and at the length strength and delight will grow.</p>
                  <p>The second enemie that will hinder the reformation of the heart, if it be not auoided,<note place="margin">1. Enemie, vnbeleefe.</note> is vnbeleefe, which (like armour of proofe) Sathan commonly putteth vpon the hearts of the wicked, that no perswasion, counsell, nor threatning, will enter where the soule is armed with that: therfore it is said in the Gospel,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.58.</note> that Christ could do no great work in his own country, because of their vnbeleef: to shew that vnbeleef doth (as much as lieth in vs) bind the hands of the Lord, and hinder his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious worke vpon vs. Therefore commonly Christ asked this question of those which came to be healed of him: <hi>Canst thou beleeue?</hi> And to those that did beleeue, he would say, in commendation of faith, <hi>Thy faith hath saued thee, go in peace. O woman</hi> sayth he to one that would haue no nay, <hi>great is thy faith, be it vnto thee as thou beleeuest:</hi> and her daughter was healed the same houre: this was the Cananite, a Gentile. Another suing to Christ for his sonne that was possessed with a dumbe spirite, and being asked of Christ if he did beleeue that Christ was able and willing to dispossesse that spirite, cried out with teares, and sayd: <hi>I beleeue,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.23.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord helpe my vnbeleefe:</hi> to shew that we are to pray against vnbeleefe of heart, euen with teares. The best Christians are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto it, as appeareth in that Christ reproued his Disciples for their vnbeleefe, and hardnes of heart, because they would not beleeue them that had seene him after he was risen again. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.14. Where we are also to note, that vnbeleefe and hardnesse of heart do go together. And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> confesseth freely against himselfe, that he was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a blasphemer,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</note> and a persecutor, but he did it ignorantly (he sayth) <hi>through vnbeleefe</hi>: to shew that vnbeleefe doth not onely hold men in ignorance and blindnesse longer then otherwise they should be, but also doth nourish in them many grosse sinnes. Therefore whosoeuer would haue a better heart then <hi>Belial</hi> hath, let him pray against vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3. Enemie, custome of sinne.</note>The third enemie which hindreth our sanctification, is custome of any one sinne whatsoeuer.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:25201:102"/>
diseases, hardnesse of hart, and impenitencie: for, as that way must needs be hard which is drie, and much trampled vpon: so that hart must needs be hardned in sinne, which is voide of the softning grace of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and is accustomed to sinne: therefore such a hearer is compared to the high way: <hi>Luke</hi> 8.5. &amp; that in three respects: first, because it is croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and winding this way and that way, like the high way. Secondly, because it is common for all that come, men and beasts, God and the diuel, for good company &amp; for bad, like the high way. And thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is hardned by ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinning, as the high way is by ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> treading: therfore he that goeth about to reforme his hart, and yet accustometh to lodge any sin therein with loue and delight, doth but deceiue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
                  <p>Now further to withstand these enemies, and to put them to flight, the Apostles counsel is to be folowed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</note> in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Take heed</hi> (saith he) <hi>lest there be in any of you an euill heart, and vnfaithfull, to depart away from the liuing God: but exhort one another dayly while it is said to day, lest any of you be hardned through the deceitfulnes of sin.</hi> The summe of his counsel is this. First, that euery man by himself must looke vnto himselfe, that he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> hath not resident in him a filthy standing puddle, a wicked &amp; vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heart, or a heart that makes a practise of sinne, that is wauering, and inconstant in the seruice of God. Secondly, that euery Christian be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> carefull one for another, and by mutuall and dayly exhortations stirre vp one another vnto godlinesse,<note place="margin">A double reason of the former counsell.</note> for which he giueth a double reason: the first is from the nature of sinne, which is deceitfull, and at a blush like vertue: secondly, from the effects of sinne, which are hardnesse of heart, and impenitencie. Though the profane person with <hi>Esau</hi> seeke the blessing with teares, yet shall he find no place for repentance: so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> doth this cursed guest reward this wretched hoast,<note place="margin">A cursed guest: a wretched hoast.</note> who giueth him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> welcome and entertainement. And because brotherly loue can see the deceit of sin, better then self-loue: as another mans eye shall see how a mans garment sitteth better then he that weareth it: therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle willeth euery man in brotherly loue,<note place="margin">Brotherly loue how it worketh.</note> to note and to notifie vnto others, such things as they see amisse in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this holy course, who soeuer doeth wisely, speedily, carefully, &amp; continually obserue, shall do good both to his owne heart, and to other mens; and shall find in the end that the gaine will answer the paine, the fruite will defray the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: and that will be this, he shall find that his heart is not like the heart of <hi>Belial,</hi> who is still fraught with leud things: and consequently that he shall not neede to stand in feare of that destruction, which so speedily, so suddenly, and so irrecouerably shall fall vpon lawles <hi>Belial,</hi>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:25201:103"/>
and <hi>Ish auen,</hi> the man of vanitie: and so much for the phisick, or means restoratiue &amp; preseruatiue, to purge &amp; preserue the hart from leudnes.</p>
                  <p>But here it will be obiected by some, that I speake of things impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. Who can do all this,<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> will they say?

For first, God speaking of <hi>Belial,</hi> saith not simply, leud things haue bene, or may be in his heart, or go and come by stealth at vnawares, or annoy, or haunt his hart: but <hi>leud things are in his heart:</hi> speaking in the time present, take him when you will, <hi>he hath alwayes a leud heart</hi>: to shew that there is a continuall residence of leudnesse, and diuels in him. No man can say his heart is cleane, as touching perfection of puritie. No man can say but that leud things haue bin in his heart, haue haunted his heart, &amp; through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnes of sin haue stolen in, and gotten a lodging there awhile, like the counterfeit <hi>Gibeonites</hi> which deceiued <hi>Ioshua</hi> with their old shooes &amp; bottels, &amp;c. &amp; may steale vpon him vnawares, as theeues do when a man sleepeth: but yet the child of God regenerate, may say sometimes truly through the grace of Christ: I thanke God these leud motions, and perswasions, be now gone and put to flight: sinne dwelleth not in me like a freeholder, much lesse raigneth like a tyrant: these leud things haue no quiet rest, nor residence in me: Gods Spirite keepeth the hold, and Iesus Christ with his bloud and Spirite, doth cleanse me from all my sinne, and doth make vp the breach againe which Sathan made. And comfortable is the note that <hi>Dauid</hi> giueth of himselfe in <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>If I regard wickednesse in my heart, the Lord will not heare me</hi>: to shew that though wickednesse get into the heart, so we regard it not, nor like it not, but thinke the time long til he be gone againe, all is well: so cannot the man of <hi>Belial</hi> say, for he is glad of such a guest, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth leud things, &amp; delighteth in them, as in those that he liueth by,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:25201:103"/>
and is angry with euery man, with euery Sermon, with euery sentence, with euery word, yea with euery looke that seemeth to dislike of his waies, or that go about to disquiet or disturb his hart, or once to speake of it, or to meddle withal: yea for feare that any man should come neare him, and touch any thing that is in his hart, he will either sit far inough off from the Preacher, that he shall not heare him, or haue his armor of vnbeleefe vpon him, that whatsoeuer is said shal not enter: or wil shape him a short answer that shall seeme to meddle with him, or to iudge of his heart, how vile soeuer his life be, saying: O you must not iudge: who made you a iudge? my heart is knowne to God: looke to your owne: I thanke God I haue as good a heart to God, as any of you all: I loue not this pricisenes, or this purenesse; a man may be too holy, and serue God too much: what? a man that wil liue must dissemble a little, and play the good fellow; and must haue some deuises in his head that all the world know not of, &amp;c. And this is <hi>Belials</hi> reckoning, cast it ouer who list, &amp; set euery speech in his place, and the <hi>Summa totalis,</hi> wil be a compound summe, like that which standeth vpon pounds, shillings and pence, and this is the summe of all: it amounteth iust to Atheisme, Epicurisme, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertinisme, a Christian in name, &amp; a Protestant at large: and the summe of this point for an answer final to the former obiection is this. He that in truth, and vnfainedly studieth to please God in the part regenerate, may be said to haue a good heart,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 23.1.</note> and a heart reformed. <hi>Paul</hi> professed that in a good conscience he serued God: and yet in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. sayth, <hi>I do not the good that I would:</hi> I find that when I would serue God, euill is present with me, &amp;c. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliuer me from this bodie of sinne?</hi> Then he answereth himselfe: <hi>I thank God through Iesus Christ my Lord.</hi> Yet this followeth as a heauy burden of his song while he liued, <hi>Euill is present with me, I am led captiue to the law of sinne</hi>: that is, vnwillingly enough: therefore to end, let none thinke that no body ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth God with a good hart, but he that hath no corruption in his hart, as Anabaptists and Puritanes indeed say: so was it not with <hi>Dauid,</hi> nor <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any of Gods children in this life. And happie is he that now can go home, and find by this Sermon leud things chased out of his heart, with a stedfast purpose to serue the Lord with all his heart.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now then we are come to the ripping vp of <hi>Belials</hi> imaginations, which are described vnto vs: First, by their qualitie, which is bad, for he imagineth euill: Secondly by their quantitie: which is great and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall, for <hi>he imagineth euill continually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The euill qualitie and badde nature of <hi>Belials</hi> imaginations, will the better appeare, if we consider: first, the materiall cause of them, which is, <hi>leud things in his heart</hi>: secondly, the formall cause, and that is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall forging and framing of them: for of matter and forme doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing consist: and first, of the material cause of his images. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly before, he saith, <hi>leud things are in his heart</hi>: now he sheweth what he doth with them; surely nothing, but of that abundance of leudnesse which is in his heart, forge and frame out euill imaginations, wrong iudgements, crooked conceits, pestilent perswasions, and false resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, according to that which is said of man in the 6. of Genesis, when he had vniuersally corrupted his wayes: <hi>The Lord saw that the wickednesse of man was exceeding great vpon earth,</hi>

And further, as the stuffe is bad, so is the forme and fashion also of his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions naught: for, as of leud thoughts in the heart he imagineth, so he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth nothing but that which is euill and leud. And therfore these croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked conceits of his are called imaginations,<note place="margin">Of Belials me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tal ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, &amp; why they are so called.</note> as if he were an image maker, and they his images or idols: and indeed they are the images of his mind, and so they may well be tearmed in two respects: first, because like ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they haue shew or shape put vpon them, both to credit a bad matter, and also the more strongly to delude the beholder: for if one should take a block of wood and set it vp, and say, that is to be worshipped for a god, no bodie would beleeue that saying. And therefore idolaters and idoll makers,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Esa.</hi> 46.</note> do not go so to worke: but (as the Prophet <hi>Esai</hi> sheweth) they hew it, and frame it, and make it in shape like a man, or some other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then couer it with gold; a thing which draweth loue and delight vnto it, and then it is of more credit and estimation then it was before: for though it be but a blocke as it was before in regard of the substance, yet do not foolish idolaters so call it: but they call it either a god, as the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites did their golden calfe, which they erected in the wildernesse when <hi>Moses</hi> was absent:<note place="margin">

And therfore we truly say of the one: it is as it pleased the painter: &amp; as truly of the other, as it pleaseth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get. Now that which hath so bad stuffe for the matter, and so ill fauoured a fashion for the forme, must needes be of a bad qualitie: but such are the imaginations of <hi>Belial</hi> for they are made of the leud thoughts of his hart, and forged after a false, fond, and strong deluding fashion: therefore for the qualitie thereof they cannot be good: howsoeuer many times the wicked are so shamelesse, that when they haue vttered most vile conceits
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:25201:105"/>
of others without cause too, yet will not sticke to say, that they iudge charitably of them, and thinke the best, and will not make the worst of things.</p>

Surely the Lord created the wicked at the first, though not wicked: he preserueth them, and prouideth for them, though not to be wicked: therefore they should both in bodie and soule serue and glorifie him, but they do not. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell hath bewitched them, and taught them to bewitch others: with his faire promises he hath inueigled them, and taught them to inueigle and deceiue others.

Their heart is Sathans store-house, their head is his worke-house, they are his apprentises and bond-slaues, and do worke for the Diuell all kind of workes, sauing good workes.</p>
                  <p>And for euery one of his apprentises and iourneymen, Sathan hath a ware-house and a shoppe, after the manner of Merchaunts and great occupiers: for the Diuell is as great a dealer as any in the world,<note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</note> and therefore hath neede of many shops, and of many ware-houses, of many factours, and many seruants, and of a legion of diuels.

                  <p>So much in generall, of <hi>Belials</hi> maister, his storehouse, and his ware-house, and his ware. Now in particular (as it were in a bill of parcels) let vs see what wares are stored vp in his hart, and what workes he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thereof in the shop of his braine. There is in his heart store of malice: and of that he forgeth slaunderous reports, impudent lyes, and vniust reuenge. There is in his heart store of obstinate wilfulnesse, and wilfull obstinacie: and of that he forgeth out peruerse disputations, and crosse languages. There is in his heart store of enuie: and of that he forgeth false suggestions, and impatient murmurings against the prosperitie of his neighbours and brethren: as <hi>Esau</hi> did against <hi>Iacob</hi> because of his blessing, and <hi>Achab</hi> against <hi>Naboth</hi> for his vineyard. There is in his heart store of hatred against the truth: and of that he forgeth cruell deuises against those that professe the truth. There is in his heart store of disdaine: and of that he forgeth reprochfull speeches, high lookes, and straunge countenaunces against poore simple men. There is in his hart store of arrogancie and pride: and of that he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himselfe to be the only man in the world, when he beholdeth his wealth and brauery, like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> when he beheld his pallace. There is in his hart store of lightnes &amp; inconstancy: and of that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth strange fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; new fangled deuises. There is in his hart store of vncleanenes, and of that he frameth filthie conueiances for his beastlines, adulteries, and fornications. There is in his heart store of grosse ignorance in the Scriptures: and thereof he forgeth grosse errors, superstitious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippings, &amp; base conceits of the Almighty, thinking him to be like them selues, Psal. 50. There is in his heart store of disloyaltie: and of that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth trecherous practises against his Prince and Countrey, and slie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiances to carrie them out with all,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.7</note> like <hi>Iudas</hi> with his kisse, and <hi>Absalom</hi> with his vow at <hi>Hebron.</hi> There is in his heart store of hypocrisie: and of

that he frameth counterfeit holinesse to couer his wickednesse,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Kim.</hi> 21.9. <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.14.</note> like <hi>Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> with her fast, and the harlot talking deuoutly of her vows and peace-offrings. There is in his heart store of couetousnes, and of that he forgeth deceit, and wrong, &amp; a thousand deuises to get the world into his hands. There is in his heart store of prophanenesse and vngodlinesse, and of that he frameth iests against the Preachers of the word, like the scoffing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours of <hi>Ezechiel.</hi>

Doest thou offer kindnesse? thou shalt be suspected and ill rewarded for thy good will. Wilt thou be familiar with men? they wil imagine that thou seekest to burden them. Wilt thou be merie? thou shalt be taken for a scoffer, and without grauity. Wilt thou be strange? then art thou lordly, proud, stout, and high minded. Dost thou intreat for peace? then thou art afraid of them: so they will imagine. Wilt thou eate and drinke with men? they wil imagine that thou art beholding to them, as some thinke that we are beholding to them for hearing the Sermon. Dost thou talk in priuate with a woman? they that are leud will imagine that thou art leud with her. Art thou troubled with a generation of vipers as <hi>Iohn</hi> was? then thou art a bad ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If thou escape their malice by the goodnesse of God, then it was more by thy friendes then by the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:25201:106"/>
goodnes of thy cause. If thou dost any strange and vnwonted thing, they will imagine thou workest by the diuell. If the wicked man prosper, he imagineth that he hath serued God wel. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be familiar with them who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they loue not, they imagine him to be their enemy also. If any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamitie happen, they imagine that the Gospell is the cause of it. If any speed better then they, then they imagine themselues to haue wrong. And thus we see al their ciuill affaires to be ful of euil imaginations. Now from home let vs follow him to church (as they say) and see if his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters religious be any better: and first of <hi>Belials</hi> imaginations or forgeries, as touching the man of God that teacheth, and then of the matter that is taught. If the Minister speake scholastically, then he seeketh himselfe: if plainly, then he is no scholler: if he please their humor, he is the onely man, and no man may come neare him. If he vse to repeat his doctrine, then he is tedious and wanteth matter: if his deliuerie be mild, then he is afraid to displease: if it be bold and seuere, then he is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie and proud. If a man vrge the law, then he driueth men to des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration: if mortification, he driueth men into melancholy dumpes, and frayeth them out of their wits. If we vrge iustification before God by faith in Christ onely, then they imagine that we denie good workes. If we preach good workes, then we are Popish: if we teach that men must not pray to Saints, nor for the dead, then they imagine we deny prayer: if we say that the salutation of the Angell to <hi>Mary</hi> is no prayer, then we deny part of the new Testament: if we say the Creede is no prayer, then we deny the Creede: if we preach against common, vaine, and needlesse swearing, then they imagine vs to be Anabaptistes, and deny both the vse of an oath and magistracie: if we speak against gaming, dancing, &amp; other prophanations of the Lords day, then they imagine that we allow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians no manner of recreation. If we preach against any sin that they vse, then we preach of malice and against them: if we teach doctrine which they conceiue not, then there is no edifying in our sermons: if they like it not, then they imagine that no body else doth regard it: if they come to heare vs, then we are beholding to them for their presence: if they wil not heare vs, yet they imagine that we must speake though it be to the wals. If they let their children or seruants be catechized by the Minister, then they imagine that they do their Minister a great part of friendship in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of him: if they say ouer their stint of prayers, then God is beholding to them, and heauen they must haue of merit. If they heare sermons, then they imagine all is well, as though God were pleased with eare-seruice onely:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.</note> and alwayes they imagine grossely of spirituall things, like <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> who (when Christ spake of being borne againe) imagined that he
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:25201:107"/>
must go againe into his mothers belly. And as these <hi>Belials</hi> are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, such do they imagine all others to be, for as to him that hath an ague, all things seeme vnsauourie: so to him that hath an euill heart of his owne, all mens doings seeme to be euill: to verifie the saying of the Apostle in <hi>Titus</hi> 2.5.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Continually</hi>] saith the holy Ghost, to shew that the man of <hi>Belial</hi> is alwayes at worke. This word noteth in the wicked man two things. First diligence. Secondly perseuerance in euill. Great is the diligence of wicked men in sinne: for they lose no time: <hi>They cannot sleepe</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>except they haue done some euill.</hi>

                  <p>This note of continuance cometh in like a barre in the armes of the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:25201:107"/>
wicked to put a difference betweene them and the godly. For though the godly or regenerate do sometime fall into euill surmises, and bad i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations, through naturall weakenesse and corruption of heart, yet they continue not in it.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Shall we continue still in sinnes,</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that grace may abound?

And if they fall againe into the same sinne (as oftentimes they do,) it is with a greater detestation and lothing of the same sinne, and with a greater and more earnest striuing against it afterward.</p>
                  <p>And yet the godly are not so simple, and foolishly credulous, as to beleeue euery faire tale, or to be in league with euery flattering face, or to shake hands presently with euery new acquaintance, nor to trust e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery promise and protestation without any maner of trial nor to make the best of that which is of it selfe naught, and apparantly euill: nor to be free from all suspition, where there is iust cause to suspect; and in so doing they are not to be condemned, but rather to be commended: for as charitie is not suspitious without cause, so is it not foolish and bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish when there is cause.</p>
                  <p>And seeing as our Sauior Christ himself hath ioyned the innocency of the Doue,<note place="margin">The wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of a Christian.</note> and the prudency of the Serpent together; simplicitie and discretion as a most fit match, and well beseeming a Christian soule, let no man separate them asunder, but be simple &amp; wise too. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue diuers examples in the Scriptures.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.11.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> imagined that in <hi>Gerar</hi> his wife might be abused, and he slaine for his wifes sake: and not without iust cause, for he saw that the feare of God was not in that place, to shew that when good men haue to deale with those that feare not God, they may very iustly imagine that they shall not be well dealt withall. <hi>Iacob</hi> suspected that al was not wel towards him: and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iust cause,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen</hi> 31.2.</note> for he saw that his vnkle <hi>Labans</hi> countenance was not towards him as in times past; and againe he marked how <hi>Labans</hi> sons murmured against him.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Iudah</hi> imagined <hi>Thamar</hi> his daughter to be a whoore (though he knew not then who she was:) and not without iust cause, for she sate by the waies side with her face couered, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of whores in those daies, &amp; in that country.

All which examples do teach vs, that when there is iust cause of suspition, and likely tokens of danger and euill, we should not be secure &amp; simple, but wise to see dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:25201:108"/>
and prouident to auoide it: for that is the part of a wise man (saith the Wise man) to see the plague a farre off, and to flie from it, as <hi>Eliah</hi> saw (by a cloud that arose) raine comming a farre off, and caused the King to prouide for it before it came. And someime the godly haue i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined (in good pollicie) of a thing otherwise then they haue known the thing to be: as <hi>Ioseph</hi> did when he made his brethren beleeue that he tooke them for spies, when he knew them to be no spies. And som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by the outward likelihoods, as they coniecture of a thing, and are deceiued, as <hi>Isaac</hi> by feeling of <hi>Iacob</hi> in rough skins, imagined it had bene <hi>Esau</hi>: and <hi>Samuel</hi> by the countenance and stature of <hi>Eliah,</hi> imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that he was the man that should be the Lords annointed, but he was deceiued.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.16</note> So <hi>Elijah</hi> seeing none to stand for the glory of the God of <hi>Israel</hi> but himselfe, imagined that he in that case was left alone, but he was deceiued.</p>

Which kind of imaginations are to be altered into more comfortable and wholesomer perswasions by spirituall phisicke, that is, by the wise handling, and discreete applying of the promised mercies of God in the Gospell, tempering therewithall the threatnings of the law, either more or lesse, according as the spirituall phisition shal see the partie more or lesse humbled, or not at all, if he be too much humbled and cast downe alreadie.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He meaning of these words is this: that where there was no contention, the man of <hi>Belial</hi> soweth contention: and where contention was either dead, or dying out: he by rubbing and chafing of it, (as it were) fetcheth and reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it againe.<note place="margin">Contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like a dog and a lion. Stirred vp by Belial.</note> Contention is like a brawling dogge, or ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring lion, which being raised vp, will shew his furious disposition, and put men both in feare and danger. Now <hi>Belial</hi> is one that raiseth vp this dogge, and awaketh this lion, to his owne danger, and trouble of others. The summe is this: that <hi>Belial</hi> is a common makebate, a sower of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, an enemie to Christian peace, and one that cannot fish (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is) but in troubled waters. Whereby we may learne, that an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining head is good for nothing else but to breake vp the ground that the Diuell meaneth to sow with the seede of debate and strife. And now the wicked mans tree beareth fruite (such as it is) euen bitter contention,<note place="margin">The tree of wickednes.</note> which is nourished by leud thoughts in the hart, and watered by the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed suggestions of Sathan: it buddeth in the euill imaginations of his head: it blossometh in the counterfeit and prophane gestures of his body: it knitteth in the frowardnesse of his mouth: it ripeneth in the practise of his life, when he raiseth vp contentions: it falleth and rotteth when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction commeth speedily and suddenly vpon him without recouerie. Lo then the fruites of a wicked heart, and surmizing head. And one thing followeth another in order (or rather out of order:) for leud stuffe in the heart, maketh euill imaginations in the braine, and euill imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons serue to raise vp contentions amongst men. And the reason is this: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill imaginations or mentall images, are false resemblances, or surmizes that <hi>Belial</hi> hath framed of himselfe, or of others: and when they come to light, no bodie liketh of them: all men hate them, all men reproue them. <hi>Belial</hi> maintaines them, and then Contention the brawling curre is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vp: of himselfe he imagineth that he is wise, when he is but a foole,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:25201:110"/>
(especially in respect of true heauenly wisedome:) that he is bountifull, when he is most niggardly: that he is able to do much, when he can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: and then boasteth of himselfe what he is, and what he can do: as if he should say: Lo, this is my picture. It is nothing like you, saith another. It is saith he: and so dogged Contention is raised vp. Of God and his truth he imagineth carnally, superstitiously, grossely, and blasphemously, and commendeth it, saying: so is the Almightie, such is his nature: as if he should say: Lo, this is Gods image, this is his picture. That see others that be Gods friends,, and religious friends indeed, and they deny it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test it: and then contention is raised vp. Of State-matters, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth matters he imagineth crosly, and after his owne pleasure. Also of the Preachers methode and doctrine, he imagineth this and that, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth out a patterne of teaching himselfe: thus he should haue said, &amp;c. and this he defendeth to the raising vp of contention. Of euery mans acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he imagineth euill, descanting at his pleasure, of this mans dealing, and that manslife, of this mans words, and of that mans lookes, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out euery mans image as he listeth himselfe: which when men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and see how ilfauouredly, and deformedly they are set forth, they reproue the forger or counterfeiter. For who can abide to haue a wrong picture made of himselfe? If it be vnlike vs in eyes, or nose, or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or any part else, we scorne it and deface it. Much more are men moued when they are pictured like beastes, or see a man set foorth with a beasts head: that is a monster, who can abide it? Such a mate is <hi>Belial,</hi> who imagineth euill, and forgeth pictures (as it were) of euery mans doings and sayings as he listeth himself, some after a beastly maner, some after a monstrous manner, and all after a counterfeit and vnchristian manner.</p>

For when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of God (hauing the spirit of God for his instructer, and the word of God for his warrant) shall paint out the man of <hi>Belial</hi> in his right co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, though the picture and the person do agree, yet the wicked are too curious, or too incredulous, or too peeuish to beleeue it: but will find fault, and say: I am not so bad as he would make me. Swearing, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and sabbath breaking, and vsurie, and briberie, and vanitie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, and ingrossing, and gaming, &amp;c. are not so ill as we make them: &amp; hence arise contention: for the truth will not be outfaced. Thus we see the reason of the order that is vsed here in placing these words, and how
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:25201:110"/>
one thing followeth another. Now, for the better vnderstanding of the truth of this matter wherewith the man of <hi>Belial</hi> is charged, and for the clearing of such doubts as may arise about it, there are foure things dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be considered of.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>The causes of <hi>Belials</hi> contentious disposition, are principally two. First, the anger and wrath of God. Secondly, his owne euil affections. Gods anger is one cause: for God and he being at oddes, <hi>Belial</hi> cannot be at peace with Gods children. For he that imagineth euill continually, must imagine euill of all men: he that imagineth euill of all men, must also imagine (as he may well inough) that he is hated of all: he beleeueth no man, and is beleeued of none: he trusteth no body, &amp; is trusted of none: and being thus hatefull &amp; hated, it grieueth him to see others at vnitie: &amp; therefore to bring others into his own case, he raiseth vp contentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween partie and partie: like the Diuel, who being at enimitie with God, (himself) did not cease vntil he had set enimity between God &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this mutuall or ciuill dissention doth commonly follow amongst men v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the contempt and neglect of the word of God: and that is an effect of Gods most iust reuenging wrath: for when men refuse to submit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <hi>Onely through pride a man causeth contention.</hi> And this proud contentious humour of his, doth chiefly respect his own vainglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the furtherance of impietie and mischiefe: <hi>Let nothing be done</hi> (saith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>through contention or vaineglorie:</hi>

The second thing that <hi>Belials</hi> proud conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious heart respecteth, is (in diuellish pollicie) the more freely to practise his mischieuous deuises, imagining that he may the more quietly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in his wicked enterprises, without any question or molestation of himselfe. Yea out of the contentions of other men, some haue sucked no small aduantage. <hi>Saul</hi> pursued <hi>Dauid,</hi> till he heard that the <hi>Philistines</hi> were come foorth to inuade and destroy his land, and then be returned, by which means <hi>Dauid</hi> escaped his hands for that time: 1. <hi>Sa.</hi> 23.27.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.27.</note> While there was dissention among the people, no man layed handes on our Sauiour Christ, but euery man went to his owne house. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.43.<note place="margin">

By this polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie also did the seditious that were in the citie of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> raise a third armie (when they saw the Citie alreadie deuided) to the vtter spoile and ouerthrow of the whole Citie: so the contentions of the Citizens was a vantage to the seditious. And no doubt, but there are many such amongst vs, that would be glad to see ciuill dissention in the land (which God for his mercies sake, if it be his will turne from vs,) that they might then the more freely follow the spoile, and fall vpon the pray. And by what other pollicie (I pray you) doth the vicar of hell still hold his place, but by the contentions of Princes and Nations? To this end did Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> neuer leaue hitching and encroching vpon the Emperours right,<note place="margin">The Pope raiseth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Princes: and why:</note> vntill he had put him quite beside the cushion (as they say.)

Afterward fearing lest the Emperor would be reuenged of him, for his good entertainment that he gaue him, he excommunicated the Emperor againe, and set vp <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulphus</hi> Duke of <hi>Sueuia</hi> in his place: during which contention, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was at no leisure to deale against the Pope, as afterward he was, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had subdued <hi>Rodulph,</hi> and was setled againe in his Empire in peace.

is not learned, or else speaketh of malice, &amp;c.

The like pollicie hath Sathan also in raising of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention betweene man and wife,<note place="margin">Man and wife.</note> to interrupt their godly prayers, and good courses of Christian exercises, whereby Gods blessing and fauour may be hindred and kept from them: and he in the meanetime may set in his foote, and worke all kind of mischiefe, wrath, and vncleannesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them. Let vs consider well of this, that loue to feede (as it were) vpon stoutnesse, and peeuish affections, only for maistry sake: let vs learn rather to seek after peace &amp; ensue it, for contention wil come fast inough, like weeds amongst the corne, or as dogs that come out as a man rideth, before they be called.

Yet how many at this day do imitate <hi>Peter</hi> in his vaine curiositie, or curious veine, not fearing or regarding the rebuke that they shall haue from God for their labour? What thinke you of Bishops &amp; their calling (say some?) of this mans gifts, and that mans tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching say other? Euery cobler and pedler, or tinker, and prentise must know these things, and haue an oare in the Church gouernours boate: and hereof arise contentions, and schismes, and factions, and rents in the Church of Christ. In the meane time examine them how they haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Christ themselues (a thing indeede whereunto they are called:) alas they can say nothing of that matter, their owne callings are negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they leape in and out of them at their pleasure, their families and themselues without all discipline and gouernement. Alas what aunswer will they make when Christ shall stay them, and say vnto them: <hi>What is that to you? follow you me.</hi> When Christ was in a heauenly Sermon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst distrustfull care for the world, and fainting feare of persecution, there was amongst his auditours a very saucy, and vnmannerly world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, whose heart was so much vppon his halfe penny (as they say) that he could not stay vntill the Sermon was done, but (interrupting our Sauiour Christ) spake vnto him to deuide the inheritance betweene him and his brother: but marke Christs aunswer:<note place="margin">

                     <hi>then he calleth men vnto him as they went in at the gates, if they had any matter or controuersie before the King, and came to the king for iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then he questioneth with him in this sort. Of what tribe, or citie art thou?</hi> then he enquireth what his suite and matter is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he heareth it, were it good or bad, he telleth him, <hi>that his matter is good and righteous, but there is no man deputed of the king to heare thee. Oh that I were made Iudge in the land, that euery man which hath any matter or controuersie, might come to me, that I might do him iustice. And when any man came neare him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and tooke him, &amp; kissed him. And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel, that came to the King for iudgement: so Absalom stale the hearts of the men of Israel.</hi> Which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grew to an open treason, and rebellion against the king his father, yet against his owne life through the iust iudgement of God against him. In like sort at this day it is amongst vs:<note place="margin">The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty foggers, and hungry Lawyers.</note> do we not see many crafty Lawyers, petty foggers, and others of no calling, wanting worke, that can cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly creepe into mens matters, and counsell them (in shew like friends) of meere pitty to their cause, and of meere goodwill, <hi>gratis,</hi> for nothing, and can teach them which way to be reuenged of him that hath done them wrong, and how to maintaine sute one against another: when otherwise (but for such vipers) the parties were most likely to haue growne vnto a peace:<note place="margin">

                  <p>And yet I deny not, but that if men be lawfully called, they may med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in other mens matters,<note place="margin">We may meedle to make peace, but not strife.</note> as Counsellours may, and Iudges, the one to counsell and pleade, the other to determine: yea, God forbid else: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise many that are not able to followe their owne cause should haue great wrong. And others also may meddle being by parties requested, or by authority appointed as arbitrators to take vp or make a stay of matters, and so to ende strife, and make peace. As euery neighbour will runne with water and buckets, to quench a fire when a house bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: so euery Christian ought to do his best endeuour to make peace, and to end strife, when men are at oddes: but he that shall be a meanes to begin strife, or to enlarge the breach, is like him that setteth a mans house on fire, and afterward in stead of water bringeth more fire to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning downe of that, and the whole city: such a one is an odious man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all men, and counted not worthy to liue.</p>
                  <p>Many of tender conscience are much troubled about this point, namely, what to do if they see another man do euill, as to sweare vainely,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:25201:115"/>
to blaspheme Gods name, or to haue any offensiue image in his house, or to vse any vnlawfull recreation, or to spend away the time of holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, as the Preaching of the word, &amp;c. in profane exercises, and many other things the like, whether they ought to go vnto them and reproue them for their euill or no:<note place="margin">A necessary question.</note> if they should not, they thinke that they are accessarie to their euill: and if they should, much contention and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, yea mischiefe would (as commonly we see it doth) follow vppon them, because men vnregenerate can by no meanes abide to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their faults, nor hardly the regenerate themselues, except them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues haue receiued a singular measure of wisedome, and patience, and withall that they be wisely and louingly intreated too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Answer.</note>Surely in this case men must learne to be wise in the Lord, and take heed that nothing be done in a preposterous zeale, rashly, and without good warrant and discretion, least they do more harme then good when they thinke the contrary. In this case I suppose that many circumstances are diligently to be considered, but especially, we are to looke before, that we haue a lawfull calling, or warrant from God by his word, or some iust occasion which may serue in stead of a calling. We will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed (and afraid too) to go into our neighbours house, and to search euery roome of his house, without his leaue and consent, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine how he came by this, and where he had that, and to find fault with his diet, and his houshold stuffe, and to mislike him because euery thing is not as we would haue it: for such boldnesse were a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of folly, want of modesty, and all good nurture: yea it would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a wonderfull impudencie, insolencie, and shamelesse pride: neither would such a one be regarded, but rather thrust out of the doores by the head and shoulders, and examined like a suspitious person, by what commission or authoritie he doth so busie himselfe in his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours affaires which belong nothing vnto him. But if a man be sent for, by the housholder, to vew his building, or his stuffe, or any thing that is in the house, and required to giue his opinion of it, and to correct that which he shall find amisse, then with honesty, credit and comfort, he may speake freely.</p>
                  <p>If I come to a place as a straunger guest-wise, if he shall require me to pray with him in his family, and to Catechise his family, I haue a good calling, I may do it. Otherwise, I see not that I am bound to thrust my selfe into those duties vnrequired: if he shall require my iudgement in good sort, and earnest wise, to be resolued about any matter that is about his house, or any offence committed by himselfe, or by any of his family, as a houshold fault, I doubt not, but that I may safely speake my mind:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:25201:115"/>
Or if we be of old and familiar acquaintance, and so continue in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, then as a friend hauing some interest in my friend, I thinke I may in friendly wise contend with him about that which I see amisse in him or in his family, and admonish him. Or if a Pastour of a congregation shall see any priuate disorder, or abuse in any of his flocke, he ought to go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and soberly admonish him. Or if a question be moued in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, tending to any errour, or for the clearing of any doubt, I do not doubt but that vppon occasion thereof (one thing drawing on another) a man may more safely, freely, and with lesse offence speake as God shall enable him for the truth, then otherwise, as many that (of a sudden pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily and rudely) breake in vpon men, in their priuate discourses. Or if thou be the maister of a famliy, &amp; hearest thy friends at thy table, vse vngodly speeches against religion, or backbiting and offensiue speeches of any, whether present or absent, thou oughtest to tell them of it, least thou make thy house a receptacle of vngodlinesse and mischiefe. And if thou hast so good calling or occasion as thou hast heard before, then thou mayest and oughtest to speake (especially when the case toucheth the glory of God) though no man else wil speake, remembring what our Sauiour Christ sayd, when some carped at his Disciples which praysed him as he rode into <hi>Ierusalem:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>If these should hold their peace, the stones would cry.</hi> Or if thou be a man of great place and authoritie, and in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with the Prince and others of high calling, and seest the Church of God in daunger, as it was by <hi>Hamans</hi> wicked practise, and no body else will step foorth to speake in behalfe of the innocent; then oughtest thou to put foorth thy selfe, yea though thou venter thy owne life in that case, as <hi>Hester</hi> did:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hest.</hi> 4.19.</note> for (as <hi>Mordecai</hi> sayd vnto her:) <hi>Who knoweth whether God hath brought thee vnto such fauour and dignitie against such a day?</hi> Oh how many are there that haue both good calling, and iust occasion offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them many wayes, and may haue free accesse vnto Princes, and speake freely, and be heard willingly, whereby they might do much good vnto the poore Church of Christ if they would: but alas, vppon no occasion, and without any warrant they can contend where they neede not, nay where they ought not: and where they should speake there are they tongue-tied: nay, would to God they did not take all occasions of hindering good causes, and of betraying the truth.</p>
                  <p>But otherwise, if thou hast neither calling (as a Minister in his flocke, or a maister of a family, or a Magistrate in the common-wealth) nor place, nor occasion iustly and fitly offered vnto thee: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feare to venture (as many do, who haue as they thinke a great gift in a reprehensiue veine) least it fall out with thee as it did with the sonnes of <hi>Sceua,</hi> who tooke

vpon them to do as <hi>Paule</hi> did, that is, to cast out diuels when they had no such commission nor power, and it be sayd vnto thee as the diuels sayd vnto them: <hi>Paule we know, and Iesus we acknowledge, but who are you?</hi>

A worke both endlesse, fruitlesse, and dangerous it were for a straunger, a plaine simple man, or any man else whatsoeuer, except he were armed with great power and authority, to go to euery one in a faire or market, that should be heard swearing, or blaspheming, or scoffing, or vainely disposed. Christ would not medle with deuiding of lands, nor with giuing of sentence against the adultresse, because they were matters which belonged not vnto him.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former Sermon, to what ends, and by what meanes chiefly the man of <hi>Belial</hi> doth raise vp contentions. Now it remaineth that we consider the greatnesse of the sinne, the more to driue vs out of loue therewith: and next the difference betweene the contentions of the wicked and the contentions of the godly, because it is not simply vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to contend at all.<note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of this sinne is shewed.</note> Now for the first, the greatnesse of this sinne, namely, of <hi>raising vp contentions,</hi> and reuiuing of controuersies (after <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lials</hi> maner) may appeare two wayes. First, by considering what testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny God hath giuen of it (or against it rather) in his word. Secondly, by vewing the scars and harmes (as they say) that this beast hath done: that is, by beholding the blessings that by the meanes of wicked mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are quite rooted vp and destroyed. For the first,<note n="1" place="margin">By the testimony of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.16.17.18.</note> it is sayd in this present Chapter: <hi>There are</hi> 6. <hi>things which the Lord hateth, yea his soule abhorreth</hi> 7. <hi>the haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that shed innocent bloud, an hart that imagineth wicked enterprises, feete that be swift in running to mischiefe, a false witnesse that speaketh lyes, and him that raiseth vp contentions among neighbours.</hi> Where a man may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by his companions that he is matched withall, what manner of beast the make-bate is: for he goeth to be arraigned in the same line with the haughtie &amp; disdainfull persons, with lyers and murtherers, with men whose dexterity is in doing of mischiefe, and false witnesses, such as put Christ to death, all birds of a feather, beasts of one haire, and whelpes of a litter. All which the Lord sayth he hateth, &amp; abhorreth, &amp; so doth he the contentious person: as if he should say: I do more then hate him, I do hate and abhorre him. To shew, that a full cup of Gods wrath is tempered for such to drinke of. Oh that all contentious <hi>Belials</hi> had grace to consider well of this, that he might repent: for who can beare the displeasure of a Prince, whose wrath is like vnto the roaring of a lyon? Much lesse can he sustaine the fulnesse of the Princes wrath, which is death at the least, if
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:25201:117"/>
not with all extremity. If none can abide the wrath of a Prince, whose breath is in his nostrils, and hath power but ouer the bodies and goods of men, then who can endure the wrath of the Lord, when in all fulnesse and extremity it shall be powred vpon him, &amp; shall come with this note also, and signe of extreame wrath, <hi>My soule doth hate and abhorre him</hi>: all which is spoken after the maner of men, for our better vnderstanding, for otherwise and indeed, in God there be no such passions, nor motions, nor perturbations of mind as there be in men: but these speeches and the like do shew what God in his euerlasting counsell and iustice hath from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decreed, and what (according to the sayd decree of his) his Maiesty will execute against the wicked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The second considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the greatnesse of this sin of raising contention.</note>The second thing that sheweth the greatnesse of this sinne, is (as I said before) the consideration of those blessings and benefits whereof conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the bane &amp; destruction. Yea, if we consider the excellency of those benefits which by contention and her daughters are taken away, we shall see great cause why the Lord doth hate and abhorre him that raiseth vp contentions amongst neighbours. I say, by her &amp; her daughters, for she is the mother of 4. daughters, whereof euery one doth her part in this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall and vntimely destruction of those benefits which by them we are depriued of.<note place="margin">The dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghters of contention.</note> The daughters of wicked Contention are Warre, Sedition, Schisme, and Brawling: and euery one of these bring foorth children like themselues: and whatsoeuer is their meate, bloud is the drinke that they thirst after. Contention is the mother of war, when she commeth among strangers, &amp; goeth betweene nation &amp; nation, beweene Prince &amp; Prince. Of sedition, when she trauelleth at home in her owne cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try. Of schismes &amp; rents in the body of Christ when she falleth in the Church, about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion, whether they be of substance or of circumstance. And of brawles and vnquietnesse, when she is entertained in families betweene man &amp; wife: &amp; neighborhoods, between one neighbor &amp; another. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they come they are the death of 2. most noble &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vertues, namely, of order &amp; of vnity. Order is a disposing of all things in their right place: for the Lord who is a God of order, and not of confusion, hath set amongst men many differences, and degrees of rulers and subiects: of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children: of maisters and seruants: of husbands and wiues: of old and yong, according to the testimony of the Wiseman in Pro. 20.12. <hi>The Lord hath made euen both these,</hi>

                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.12.</note> 
                     <hi>the eare for to heare, and the eye for to see.</hi> And mens actions are not well ordered, vnlesse they be well tempered, according to the worthinesse and condition of these degrees. And that cannot be, vnlesse it be done according to the prescript rule of the law of God, which is the head and fountaine of all good order: for he that is the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:25201:117"/>
God of order made a law of order. Now, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention &amp; her impes, Gods order is peruerted: subiects rule, &amp; Princes obey: pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts yeeld to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: wiues domineere ouer their husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: seruants beare sway against their maisters: and yong men despise their elders. God hath distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished diuerse members in one body: one from another, &amp; set one aboue another, &amp; placed them all in wonderfull maner. The head as a tower, the eies in the same as watchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the eie-lids as windowes for light, the mouth as a doore to let in prouision, the toung as a porter to cal for that which is needfull, &amp; to examine that which is doubtful, the eares as spies to harken &amp; to listen, the hands as seruitours &amp; souldiers, the feet as messengers and porters to carry and recarry, the teeth as grinders of natures prouision, the pallate as taster, the stomach as a cook-roome, wherin all things are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe for the benefit of nature, &amp; the whole body so to be preserued for the benefit of the soule, who sitteth within as a Queene &amp; comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, with a Princely companie of heauenly attendants called <hi>animales virtutes,</hi> the powers of the soule: as reason, &amp; vnderstanding, and memory, &amp; will, &amp; affections: and all together seruing God who made them, &amp; doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue them, who redeemeth &amp; repaireth them, to the end he may for euer glorifie himselfe in their euerlasting glorification by Christ in his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdome. All which being beheld in that order that God hath set the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in, do shew the high wisdom of God: but being either wanting, or aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or displaced, they make a man not a man but a monster. As when one is borne without head or eyes, or eares, or hands, or feete, or is borne with two heads, &amp; many eyes, &amp;c. more then nature requireth, or hath his eares where his eies should be &amp; his feet where his hands should be, &amp;c. In like sort God in his lawes hath set downe a rule &amp; measure for euerie thing, which being kept doth make a seemly sight, but being broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doth breed a confused and monstrous being, whether it be in Church or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, whether in citie or countrie, in publicke or in priuate. Now contention displaceth all, setting (as it were) the feet vpward, &amp; turning the head downward, placing the mouth where the eares should be, and the hands where the feet should be, &amp; the eares where the eies should be: that is he is a speaker whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he should be a hearer,<note place="margin">A strange yet a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> he is silent whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he should speake, he is an actour when he should be a beholder, a talker when he should be a doer. So that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention bringeth forth no Christans, but mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. See you one (whether man or woman) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tending to talke, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ought to be silent and to heare others? there is a monster: for then is their mouth where their eares should be. See you a Minister silent, when he should preach? there is a monster in the Church, for his eares are where his toung should be. See you a Magistrate ruled by his officers, who should but
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:25201:118"/>
see out of him? he hold a monster in the common-wealth: for then are the eies become head, and all this is a monstrous peruerting of Gods order, and is then commonly to be seene, when wicked contentions haue bene raised vp against the truth.</p>

For, where right Christian vnitie and peace is, there is a comfortable communion of Saints, as we reade to haue bene in the Primitiue Church, they met often, and reioyced much. Now what an odious thing is that which depriueth Christians of such a blessing, and blessed meanes of fellowship and great ioy?

And in another place, it is sayd, <hi>put on loue:</hi> to shew, that a Christian is in a manner but naked, and vncomely without it, like a man without his vpper garment.

                     <hi>Dauid</hi> speaketh of it as of a thing rather to be admired then to be described. It is like a precious ointment that filleth all the house with a sweet smell, yea with a sauour of life, where it is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out. It is as the beame in the wall, as the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the house, as the sinewes in the body, and as the Sunne in the firmament, both profitable and comfortable with his light and his heate.

It is a large couering and a comely robe, that couereth the multitude of offences.</p>
                  <p>Now, he that raiseth vp contentions doth but awaken and rouse vp a cruell Lionesse with her whelpes, to teare all these blessings in peeces.

Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>Cast out the scorner, and strife shall go out, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and reproch shall cease.</hi> Shewing by his manner of speech, that there is no more respect to be had vnto a contentious scorner, or a scornefull contender, then to dung which is to be cast out of the dores vpon the dunghill. Therefore woe be to him that raiseth vp contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons betweene Prince and Prince, as the Pope doth: betweene the Church and her gouernours, as the Popish do: betweene Pastour and people, as Atheists do: betweene man and wife, as make-bates do: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene neighbour and neighborr, as tale-bearers do: betweene plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife and defendant,<note place="margin">The make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates annoy themselues.</note> as busie bodies and petti-foggers do.

                  <p>Now let vs see whether it be simply vnlawfull to contend or no: &amp; if it be not, then let vs see the difference betweene the contentions of the wicked, and the contentions of the godly, and what rules are best to be

A needful question surely this is: for, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wicked would make Christ &amp; his serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts very odious vnto the world, they would accuse them of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition &amp; contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

So the godly, &amp; the wicked do both contend, yet not both in like maner. The difference standeth in matter &amp; maner, which (being wel considered) will put an end to this controuersie, and shew who be troublers of Israel: this will clearly appeare in the example of <hi>Achab</hi> &amp; <hi>Elijah,</hi> the one a king the other a Prophet. 2. Ki. 18.18. <hi>Achab</hi> saith <hi>that Elijah</hi> troubled Israel (this was when they wanted raine in Israel, and when <hi>Elijah</hi> stood against the Priests of <hi>Baal.</hi>) <hi>Elijah</hi> againe telleth the king that he and his fathers house are they that troubled Israel. But what is it to trouble Israel? let vs see:<note place="margin">What it is to trouble.</note> surely it is a borrowed speech: for, to trouble, is nothing else but to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:25201:120"/>
mingle and confound together good and bad, vile &amp; precious, corrupt &amp; pure.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As we see in a vessell, where liquor is of diuerse parts and qualities, some thicke, some thin, the liquid &amp; refined standeth aboue, most cleare: the dregs &amp; grosse substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce go downe to the bottom, &amp; there lye pressed downe: shake the vessell, and the dregs rise vp, &amp; all is said to be troubled, that it is hard in that mixture to see which is the one &amp; which is the other. Euen so is it in the Church of God, &amp; common-wealth of Israel: when superstition and impiety are aduanced, which like muddy &amp; dirty dregs should be kept downe: &amp; on the contrary, pure religion and piety, which (like sweet wholesome wine) should be kept aloft, and preserued from mixture, is put downe, &amp; mingled with superstition &amp; humane traditions that be contrary to the word, then all things are sayd to be troubled, and out of order. Now, when things fall out thus, there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the affection &amp; iudgement of the wicked and of the godly. The wicked thinke things to be then at best stay, when they with their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions &amp; impieties may preuaile: but the godly (hauing iudgement) are of a contrary mind, knowing for certaine by the wisdom of Gods word, that men are then in greatest danger,<note place="margin">When men are in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test danger.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wicked thinke that they are in greatest peace &amp; safety.

Not for that he was proud &amp; arrogant, but because he perceiued the kings accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:25201:120"/>
directly to impeach the credit of Gods word, as if the trouble that he complained of, grew from that, &amp; nothing else. Therefore, thou trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Israel (saith the Apostle) not I, but thou and thy fathers house: for thou hast taken away the true worship of God, &amp; drawest the people to <hi>Baal</hi> a filthy idoll, by which meanes thou prouokest the Lord against the land: but as for me, I recall them vnto the God of my fathers, &amp; stand for the lawes of God giuen in mount Sinai. Therefore I am not he that troubleth the land: the controuersie is raised by thy selfe, for thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest with God and his word, which I stand for.</p>

We stand for the true worship of Iesus Christ, and the glory of God: we receiue the holy Scriptures as containing all things necessary to saluation, so do not they: we vse the Sacraments, not in part, but in whole, so do not they: not with any Popish eleuations, or superstitious adoration or kneeling to the Sacrament, as they do: we will not worship idols, or the creature for the Creator, as they do: therefore not we, but they are contentious disturbers of the Church of God. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is that Church and common wealth, which is gouerned by the word of God: then vnhappy are those that follow the inuentions of men, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the commaundements of God. It was a strong argument that <hi>Elijah</hi> vsed, wherewith he brake the kings hart, and made him to yeeld. And in other places of the Scripture also is this word (troubling) vsed in that same sence: as in Iosh. 7.25.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Thus then we see, that all are not to be condemned, which haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, for that in euery contention there are two parts each contrary to other: and if the cause of the one be good, the other must needes be bad.

Thirdly, iealousie:<note n="3" place="margin">Ielousie.</note> for none is more iealous ouer her mate and young ones: which may teach vs to be iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ouer the glorie of our spouse, and his graces in vs. Fourthly, mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:<note n="4" place="margin">Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> therefore <hi>Hezechiah</hi> said that in his sickenesse he mourned like a doue:<note place="margin">

from the wicked, who care not for Christ, because he is none of their head:<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 3.</note> like the harlot that cared not if the child were cut in peeces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was none of hers: whose meeknesse is haughtines &amp; stern fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, bitter crueltie and cruell bitternesse: whose innocentie is spoile and oppression, whose ielousie is only ouer their own glorie, &amp; whose mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for sin, is reioycing in their owne sin, and in the fall of others.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Speciall rules to contend by</note>Now seeing as we be come thus farre, it were not amisse to set down some rules in more particular manner, to guide poore simple Christians in their zealous and earnest contendings and striuings: in following wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they may haue comfort to their owne consciences: and others may glorifie God for their wise and godly cariage of themselues, to the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the truth, and the disaduantage of their aduersaries. To which end we are to know, that euery one that contendeth iustly, standeth either for Gods matters, or for mens causes. In striuing about Gods matters, it were good to obserue these rules following: (not that I would bind any man to these: but let euery man as God giueth him experience, impart his godly aduice and counsell for the good of others.) In Gods matters,<note n="1" place="margin">In Gods matters.</note> if the controuersie be in publike meetings before many, looke to thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: if it be in priuate betweene thee and a few, looke also vpon what occasion it groweth, and whether it be offred by thy selfe or by others: if by thy selfe, (especially before thy betters) looke how thou fall into it, and vse great modestie (crauing both leaue to speake, and attention to be heard) with submission of thy iudgement vnto men of iudgement, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently hearing them also with whom thou contendest, as well as thou art desirous to be heard thy selfe: and especially vse some words of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to draw the minds of the hearers to a reuerent regard of that thou sayest: left it be otherwise a profane contention: and do not as many do, who amidst their cuppes, (when men are earnestly employed in other pleasant and wittie discourses) chop in of a sudden with some great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of Diuinitie, vsing no meane at all to diuert and turne the hearers minds from that veine of mirth whereunto they are setled, vnto a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of more grauitie and maiestie, which requireth sober and aduised at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. If the controuersie be occasioned by others, then marke by whom it is raised, and to what end: if by prophane persons, onely to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and snare thee, then reproofe or silence is the best answer; according to the counsell of <hi>Salomon:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Answer not a foole in his folly, left thou be like him: and yet answer to his folly:</hi> that is, as his folly deserueth: <hi>lest he be wise in his owne conceipt.</hi> If the question ariseth by those that ate sober &amp; godly: then follow S. <hi>Iames</hi> his rule:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Be swift to heare and slowe to speake:</hi> that is, put not foorth thy selfe, (as the maner of many is:) but let others
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:25201:123"/>
first speake, and be thou required to speake before thou speakest. By this meanes also thou shalt the better be able to speake to purpose, and with mor ease to go through with the matters: like him that followeth another when the ice is broken before him. It is good also to looke vnto thy abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and not to meddle with a matter that is too high for thee: as many do, (because they would haue men know that they can say somewhat) when indeed they do but bewray their grosse ignorance and pride. This is <hi>Dauids</hi> counsell in his owne practise:<note place="margin">

Take for example the Apostles, who (being as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in a Councell at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> about the matter of circumcision, &amp; other points of Christian religion) spake one after another:<note place="margin">

                     </note> First, <hi>Peter spake, and then all the multitude kept silence, and then after him Barnabas spake, and after Barnabas, Iames, and all others kept silence.</hi> In the next place, looke to the right end of thy contending: and that is fourefold. First, Gods glory. Secondly, truths victorie to the suppressing of errour. Thirdly, thine owne comfort and instruction. Fourthly, the edification of others. To this end auoid all brawling and bitternesse, with vaineglorie and ostentation: and let all things be done in loue. Lastly, if you cannot agree, submit your selues to the iudgement of some learned men, thy Pastour if he be in place, and of abilitie to iudge, or to some other Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher with him,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29</note> or without him if he be not in place: <hi>Let the Prophets speak two or three,</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>and let others iudge, and the spirits of the Prophets shall be subiect to the Prophets.</hi> If the spirites of the Prophets, (that is the Ministers of the word) must be subiect to the Prophets, then much more in matters of controuersie must the spirits of those which are no Prophets be subiect to the learned.</p>
                  <p>In defending our owne causes,<note n="2" place="margin">What to do in our owne cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, &amp;c.</note> or in pleading the causes of other men: First, let vs be sure that the cause be good, then may we with lesse offence contend about the same, if we haue good calling, and iust occasion, with fit oportunitie (as hath bene shewed before:) For many complaine, &amp; contend which haue done the wrong: these are like dogges, which first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> bite and then crie: or like theeues which pursue true men: and may be compared to the harlot, who (hauing killed her owne child) contended with her bedfellow about the death thereof,<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 3.</note> as though that she had bene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the death of it. Secondly, if thy cause be good and iust: first, offer peace and agreement, according to the law of warre: if it be refused, seeke still, and with a mind still of embracing peace: yea suffer much, and put vp much wrong. Thirdly, auoid all occasions of contention, (as much as

lyeth in thee by all possible meanes) with great ones: and chiefly take heed, (if thou be a meane person) of hauing too much familiaritie with three sorts of men. First, thy superiours, especially whose hearts are not sure and vpright towards thee:<note place="margin">

And now he standeth like a theefe at the barre, who when he hath heard his enditement, and is found guiltie, must then heare the sentence of the Iudge according to his desert. As the malefactor goeth from the barre to the gibbet, so the wicked go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from his wickednesse to destruction. This is now the taile of sinne which cometh last, but not without a deadly sting. Sin is like the Bee,<note place="margin">Sinne like a Bee.</note> that hath both hony which is pleasant, and a sting which is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous then the hony is profitable: and whosoeuer will be so foolish and venturous, as to nourish this Bee in his bosome for loue of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, shall surely be wounded with the sting, more then the other shall heale againe. And therefore the pleasures of sinne are called pleasures for a season: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. not pleasures for euer:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25.</note> because in the end they leaue a sting of conscience behind them, which turne all the former pleasure into lothsomnesse and paine: as it did to the rich and delicate glutton in the Gosdell.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Esa.</hi> 57.</note> saith God, <hi>but they are as the raging sea. that alwayes casteth vp mire and dirt</hi>: to shew vs, that if we would find rest, we must not enter into the waies of wicked men, for there is no rest in their wayes.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.13.</note> And the wise man saith, <hi>That to the wicked there is sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row euen in laughter</hi>: to shew, that the mirth of wicked men is but from the teeth outward. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> (to shew the fruit of sinne) asketh this question:<note place="margin">

                     <hi>What fruit</hi> (saith he) <hi>haue you of those things whereof ye are now, ashamed?</hi> To shew, that the best fruite that sinne bringeth forth is shame and confusion: as <hi>Adam</hi> was not ashamed, vntill he had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed; so is it still with all <hi>Adams</hi> posteritie.</p>
                  <p>And here in my text, it is sayd, that the wicked shall be destroyed. As a thing that is altogether vnprofitable, &amp; much hurtfull amongst men, is destroyed, that is, is either rooted vp, or burned with fire, or cast into the riuer, or throwne out into the high way for men and beasts to tread vpon, or caried out into the fields for the foules of the ayre to deuoure, or buried in dunghils and ditches: so shall the wicked be destroyed and come to naught, and the remembrance of them shall perish from the earth.<note place="margin">Why the wicked shal be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> And good reason; for, to what purpose should the vnfruitfull tree stand? to do nothing but comber the ground? To what vse serueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauoury salt, but for the dunghil? When the brasen serpent maketh men to fall from God, what must be done withall, but breake it in peeces? Now, who more vnfruitfull then the wicked? therefore when their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time is come, they must no longer trouble and comber the Lords orchard, nor hinder the common wealth of Gods <hi>Israel.</hi> What more vnsauourie then vngodlines? or who more vnprofitable then the vngodly? Therfore, where should their place be but vpon the dunghill? Who cause others to fall from God, but wicked serpents, or serpentine wicked men, with brazen faces, and yron neckes, (as the prophet spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth:) therefore God must needes breake them in peeces, like a potters vessels, and make them like <hi>Nebustan,</hi> yea, he shall bruise them with a rod of yron: by which we may see what account God maketh of the wicked, which are lawles, &amp; obstinate, and how litle cause there is why the godly should either esteeme of them, or stand in awe of them.</p>

Shall <hi>Iezabel</hi> escape or be fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, because she is a Queene, and faire without? No, she shall be more cruelly destroyed, and deuoured of dogs, because she was of cruell and dogged conditions towards the seruants of Gods. Shall <hi>Achab</hi> escape the bitternes of death, because he is a King? Nay, but as his sword hath made many wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> childles in Israel: so shal his mother be made child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, &amp; he shall be hewne in peeces like an oxe in the shambles. If <hi>Herod</hi> will so farre forget himselfe, as to take vnto him the glory that is due to God; euen <hi>Herod</hi> shal be destroyed of lice. If <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> wil take no warning of his pride, but heare the judgements of God against him as a dreame, surely <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> that great and proud King shall be turned forth amongst the beasts. But we be Christians, and baptized (will some say.) All is one for that: neither circumcision auaileth any thing, nor vncircumcision, but a new creature. But at Easter we will be holy, and receiue the Sacrament, and then we hope that God will not destroy vs. Yes the sooner for that, if thou be a wicked man. For this cause (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) are many afflicted,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> and many are dead, because they haue receiued the Lords supper vnworthily. Will you steale, and rob, and lie, and whore, and deceiue, and swearefalsly, (saith the Lord by <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remey</hi>) and then come into my house where my name is called vpon? If the Lord doth detest the companie of wicked men in his house, much more then at his table. But wil God destroy the work of his hands? wil he destroy man, whom he made after his owne image? Yea verily: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause man through his wickednesse, hath defaced that glorious image of righteousnesse, and true holinesse, he shall be defaced and destroyed himself:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccle.</hi> 7.31.</note> God made man righteous (saith <hi>Salomon</hi>) but man hath found out many inuentions.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see, that there is a time of wickednesse, and a time of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: and when the measure of the wicked is filled vp, then shal they be emptied, and filled with wrath, because they are vessels of wrath.

The first obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is this: if God be iust in his threatnings, and that the wicked shall be destroyed, and haue such a portion of plagues as hath bene shewed out of <hi>Iob.</hi> 20 and other places of Scripture:<note place="margin">1.

                     <note place="margin">Answere.</note> 
                     <hi>and the godly so much euill here?</hi> To this his answere is, that if by good, we meane riches, honour, health, &amp;c. the question is absurd; for godlinesse and vertue is the true good. The pouerty of <hi>Lazarus</hi> (being a vertuous man) is better then the wealth of the rich man: the sicknes of a wise man with his wisedom, is better then the health of a foole. What goods soeuer a man hath, he cannot be a good man, so long as he him selfe is euil; and these outward things are common to good and bad. If a man must be termed a good man for hauing these goods, then a foole may be termed a wise man in a rich gowne. All these false goods are meanes to the wicked to make them worse and worse: and riches, to corrupt them and others: authoritie, to do violence: health doth make them lustie to do mischiefe: so the euils which men terme euils, are meanes to the good to make them better: as pouertie serueth to bridle lust: basenesse to humble them: incumbrances to driue them to God, and to teach them to succor others. But why are these goods common? Surely because God cannot be but good, insomuch as he maketh his raine to fall, and his Sunne to shine vp all. A father that keepeth his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:25201:129"/>
for his sonne, will not apparell him like a slaue, in his seruants li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueries. Princes make their pay common to al souldiers, but the garland is giuen to the valiantest. Kings cast their largesse at all aduenture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, but their honors and dignities, they bestow on them whom they do specially fauour. So God for his honor will not reward the trauels of his seruants with trifles. God being liberall and iust, will reward thee according to his honour, and not according to the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thy heart, and that for two causes. First, because he regardeth not thy workes, but his owne in thee. Secondly, because the reward is not giuen according to thy desert, but according to the worthinesse of him that bestoweth it.<note place="margin">A notable speech of Alexander.</note> 
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the great told a seruitour in his warres, that a hundreth crownes were inough for him to receiue, but not for the Emperour to giue. Corne, and foode, and rayment, and money, &amp;c. are things common to all, not peculiar to his children: therefore beg not these as the best giftes. But what are the goods then that good men haue in this life?<note place="margin">What be the goods of good men.</note> Many and excellent: first, they haue grace to make their life allowable to God that knoweth them. Secondly, in him they repose themselues. Thirdly, they haue peace in their consciences: for if God increase not their present estate, they abate their desires. Their foes commend their vertues: all the world bemoneth their wants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> those which haue the distributing of goods and honours, are blamed for not considering them. Lastly, the very asking of that question, be thou a Christian, or a Heathen? is vnto them an inestimable treasure.</p>
                  <p>If God would not giue me more, why haue I forgone those which I had? Surely because he saw, that if he had not taken them from thee, they wold haue taken thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. We pluck kniues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> children when they cry to haue them: we suffer the Phisition to take from vs our meats which we loue, and to abridge vs of our pleasures, yea and our of bloud too; because he hath seen our water, or felt our pulse.

                  <p>Another obiection is this:<note place="margin">2.

The answere to this is not hard,<note place="margin">Answere.</note> for death is but
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:25201:130"/>
the common passage, and what skils it whether we passe it by sea or by land, by our own corruption, or by the corruptnes of common weales? And if God bring his children to that point for one fault, and the iudge for another, what iniustice is in God? Oh what a thing were it, if we could see what fruite the Lord draweth out of their death. The child that seeth his father tread grapes, blameth him for it, thinking they should be kept, not conceiuing to what end the treading serueth: but the father who knoweth the goodnesse of them better then the child, considereth that within two moneths they would wither and drie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and therefore to preserue the vertue of them, treadeth them: when the child commeth to discretion, he museth at his owne folly, and yet as then he thought himself wiser then his father. After the same maner doth the child when he seeth his father make conserues of Roses, and other flowers: he is ready to weepe, and is sory to see them marred, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would make nose-gayes of them, which he himself would cast away by the next morrow. So God that made good men that which they be, he knoweth when it is time to gather them, that they rot not on the tree, and how long they may be preserued in their kind. He will take somefresh and greene, to preserue them all the yeare long, he will make conserues of their flowers, &amp; wine of their grapes, to keep a long time after. He will make their sauour, their sweete sent, their strength, that is, their godlines, vprightnes and vertue, to liue after them, which otherwise would be buried. Take for example, the Apostles and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: dost thou not yet eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drink of their liqour? doth not their constant confession make thee to confesse Christ? doth not their death help thee to endlesse life? Could <hi>Ignatius</hi> and <hi>Polycarpus</hi> haue liued aboue fiue or sixe yeeres more then they did? and yet, what part of all their ages hath lasted so long, or done so much good, as the last halfe hower wherein they died? Therefore let vs say, we are but babes, and forasmuch as we perceiue the wisedome of our father to be so great, and our owne ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance so grosse: let vs rather confesse our weaknesses in all cases, then presume to doubt of his iustice or prouidence in any thing. But the mischiefe is this, that whereas we will not iudge of a song by one note, nor of an Oration by one full sentence: we will presume to iudge of the harmonie, and orderly direction of the world by one action there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And if God seeme to hold his peace, and to suffer men to play their parts, ought we not to haue so good opinion of his wisedome, as to thinke that he can tell when it is time to pay home? And though he let the wicked play their part on the stage, and the godly to lie in prison, he can also prouide to end the braueries of the one with iust punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:25201:130"/>
and the wofull complaints of the other with ioyfull triumphs. The world is a kind of stage-play,<note place="margin">The world like a stage play.</note> conueied to a certaine end, by a most excellent maker: whereof we cannot iudge by one act that we see plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but we must tarrie till all the parts be played, which perhaps wil not be while we liue, nor in many yeares after. When we reade that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was sold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> we cannot be angrie inough with his brethren: when he is cast into the dungeon for chastity, thou couldest find in thy heart to blame not onely <hi>Pharao,</hi> but euen God himselfe: but when thou seest him taken out of prison to reade the Kings dreames, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as a King in <hi>Egypt,</hi> a succour to his father in his old age, &amp; the raiser vp againe of his whole house at their neede, then thou perswadest thy self that he which made him to raigne in <hi>Egypt,</hi> did suffer him to be sold int <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that the discord which offended thee, and the harmonie which delighteth thee againe, proceede both from one selfe-same mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that is, from one most wise and iust God.</p>
                  <p>Another obiection is this.<note place="margin">3.

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:25201:131"/>
it may be a greater punishment to them, to liue after they haue done amisse, then to haue died in the deede doing: for now they see: first, that their practises haue not successe according to their wils: secondly, that all the mischiefe they haue wrought is in vaine: thirdly, that they haue prouoked God against them, and the whole world, to no purpose: fourthly, that they haue gotten thereby nothing but shame, &amp; torment of mind. If God then by his seeming to be slow, do both amend thee (saith <hi>Plessy</hi>) and punish them, and both at once, then is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Lord stil iust in his threatnings, as he is in all his workes. Examples we haue hereof sufficient in <hi>Nero,</hi> in <hi>Herod,</hi> in <hi>Cain,</hi> in <hi>Iezabel,</hi> in <hi>Lewes</hi> the 9. a French King: all which liued after their cruell murthers, and massacres, and were seuerely punished, though none of those whose innocent bloud was spilled by them, were aliue to see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> punished. The reason is this, God punisheth not as worldly Iudges do, to content them that haue suffered wrong, or to satisfie thy reuenging mind, or to get himselfe the name of a good Iudge, but because he hateth the euill, which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to correct, and will also draw good out of it. If he should strike at our appointment, then should he be but our executioner, and we should be the Iudges: but God executeth his owne iudgements, and not ours.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The vses of the former doctrine.</note>These obiections being thus answered, let vs now see what good vse we may make of al the former doctrine. We learne from hence: first, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> when we see the wicked to flourish, to be contented, and patient, not enuying their exaltation: for God doth lift them vp of purpose to cast them downe: this vse doth <hi>Dauid</hi> teach vs to make of the wicked mans prosperitie:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.1.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Fret not thy selfe because of the wicked men, neither be enuious for the euil doers: for they shal soon be cut downe like grasse, and wither as the green herb. Psa.</hi> 27.1.2. And the truth of this point is further confirmed by our Sauior Christ,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.23.</note> who saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>that Capernau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was lifted vp to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/> they should be a cast downe to hell.</hi> Secondly, seeing that the life of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked (in regard of their wickednes) is so base and miserable, and their end so wretched and fearefull, let vs not desire to liue their life, in regard of their pleasure, but let vs chose rather to suffer affliction with the godly, for righteousnesse sake: as <hi>Moses</hi> did, assuring our selues, that as God doth lift the wicked vp, to cast them down, and to make them haue the sorer fall: so doth the Lord cast his children downe, to lift them vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. This point is confirmed by our Sauior Christ, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they that mourne now, for they shal be comforted</hi>: and this vfe are we taught to make of the wicked mans end. <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.21.22. where <hi>Dauid</hi> confesseth that before he knew the end of the wicked (which he lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:25201:131"/>
in the house of God) his heart was vexed at their prosperitie, but when he saw whereunto they were going, and what was their end then he saith, that he (in desiring their estate) shewed himselfe, both foolish, ignorant, and beastly before the Lord. Thirdly, seeing as these outward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> things are common both to good and bad, this should teach vs, to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend our rash iudgement of the godly, that are vnder the hand of God: because we know not for a certaintie, whether he be so afflicted for his wickednesse, or for some other cause: as the blind man in the Gospell, (by the testimonie of Christ) was blind neither for his own sin nor for the sinne of his parents,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9.3.</note> but for the glorie of God. And this vse are we taught in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Iudge not, lest ye be iudged</hi>: that is, iudge not rashly. <hi>And blessed is he</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>that considereth wisely of the poore &amp; needie:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 41.1.4.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord shall deliuer him in time of his distresse.</hi> Fourthly, seeing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as God doth plague the wicked for our warning, and (as it were) hang them vp in chaines before the world: let vs feare at Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon wicked men, and not ioyne our felues vnto them, least we be partakers of their iudgements: like those that were ioyned in the conspiracie of <hi>Corah,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Num.</hi> 16.26.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Num.</hi> 16.26</note> nor stand and gaze, or wonder at them (as the maner is,) but learne by their examples to auoide their wayes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3.5.</note> least we (not repenting) do also perish. Fiftly and lastly seeing as this fearefull vengeance commeth vpon the wicked in this life for sin: whensoeuer we feel the hand of God vpon vs, let vs examine our selues for our sins which are the cause thereof, and not do as the wicked, who neuer looke into that cause, but into secondarie and outward causes, like the dog who biteth the stone, but looketh not vnto the hand that cast it. And as we dayly fall, so let vs pray dayly and hourely, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing grace of Gods Spirit, that we may rise againe, and recouer our selues by true repentance, and liuely faith in Iesus Christ: to whom with the Father and the holy Ghost, be all glorie and praise for euer.
