            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE PREFACE OF THE <hi>Tranſlator.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I Read in <hi>French</hi> this following Book o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in my Paſſage
<pb facs="tcp:34717:3"/>
from <hi>England</hi> into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and finding it to pleaſe me very well, I reſolved to make an Eſſay, to put it into <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in order to that, I found I had a great deal of leiſure time to do it; for not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeak <hi>Dutch,</hi> and being not very deſirous to learn it, I ſat often alone in my
<pb facs="tcp:34717:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chamber, and in a few Days finiſhed this little Novel.</p>
            <p>Which how well I have done it, let the <hi>Reader</hi> Judge. But let me put him in mind, that it is the firſt Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay in this kind, or any other, that I have offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> will ſay ſomething as to the Original, that <hi>I</hi> think it is as full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
<pb facs="tcp:34717:4"/>
and thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged as well, and the whole Deſigne carried on, as probably, as it is poſſible for any thing of this Nature to be; and that the Deſign is laid with great Art, and managed with as good a Wit.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Reader</hi> receive this Book favourably, <hi>I</hi> do promiſe him, that <hi>I</hi> will in a little time
<pb facs="tcp:34717:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make him amends with ſomething of a more uſefull Subject.</p>
            <p>Although I cannot but acknowledg, that I think it equall to any of <hi>Scaroons,</hi> or the more Famed D. <hi>Miquel de Cervantes,</hi> and hath been eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo abroad: For in this ſmall time ſince it came forth, which is not four years ſince the
<pb facs="tcp:34717:5"/>
firſt Printing of it here at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> I have ſeen four other Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one of <hi>London,</hi> one of <hi>Paris,</hi> and another at <hi>Colen,</hi> and the laſt at <hi>Bruxels;</hi> which is the moſt imperfect Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of all.</p>
            <p>I think I have ſaid enough, and deſire the <hi>Reader</hi> to excuſe me, and pardon all the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

HATTIGE:
OR, THE <hi>KING of</hi> Tameran<hi>'s</hi> AMOURS.</head>
            <p>OF all places of the world, the <hi>Sea</hi> is fulleſt of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, but not thoſe of Love; 'tis the Scene Fortune moſt delights to play her Pranks in; but that Element is too boyſterous to agree with the tenderneſs of the Sex: Yet Love derives his Original from the Sea, which gave birth to his Mother; and though Gallantry be a Rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34717:7"/>
there, it cannot appear ſtrange where <hi>Venus</hi> was born.</p>
            <p>A young Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> (which Character ſpeaks him of Eminent Quality) full of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous emulation for the bravery of his Brethren of the Order, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd in purſuance of the Duty of his Profeſſion to follow their ſteps, in ſeeking Honour, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War againſt the Infidels: He came to <hi>Malta</hi> in a Frigat of 30 Guns, excellently fitted, and the beſt Sayler that had of a long time gone out of that Port.</p>
            <p>The Knight having performed his Land-ſervices was grown a little acquainted with the Sea; but it was the firſt time he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Veſſel, and very glad he was, at his coming to <hi>Malta,</hi> to find <hi>Gourdan</hi> there, and made him an offer of being his Partner for Honour and Arms. <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:34717:7"/>
an Old <hi>Corſair,</hi> very loth to admit a ſharer in Profit or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and very rarely making uſe of a Second in War, did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding accept the Propoſal made him by a young Man, the moſt hopeful of any that Order ever had. The Agreement was made, and the 15th of <hi>May</hi> they left <hi>Malta,</hi> and went to cruiſe on the Coaſts of <hi>Tunis,</hi> in hopes to meet with three Veſſels which <hi>Gourdan</hi> was informed were bound with Pilgrims for <hi>Mecha.</hi> The Wind was favourable, and in three days they were in Sight of <hi>Tunis:</hi> On the Fourth <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>'s Veſſel drawing nearer the Coaſt, diſcovered ſome Sail, and diſcharg'd a Gun to warn in his Partner.</p>
            <p>The Sails he diſcovered were thoſe of the three Veſſels they went in ſearch of, which made
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34717:8"/>
up to <hi>Gourdan,</hi> and attacqued him very vigorouſly, and were glad to ſee the Knight come up to ſecond him, making full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him as a Second Prize. But 'tis no ſlight dealing with the Corſaires of <hi>Malta,</hi> whoſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom it is to fight to the laſt, and dye before they yield: Thoſe I am ſpeaking of were ſtrangers to fear, the one having long run an uninterrupted courſe of Victory in all his Engagements, and the other ſupplying his want of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience by incomparable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. I will not enlarge in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: The Fight was ſharp and bloody, the <hi>Turks</hi> having four times as many Men as the Chriſtians, and three Ships at leaſt as good as the <hi>Malteſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gourdan</hi> had kept aloof from the Enemy about a Musket ſhot, till the Knight came up, who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34717:8"/>
no ſooner joyn'd him, but <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> would let him ſee at what rate he had purchas'd his Honour in the <hi>Levant.</hi> He fell in furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly among the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ply'd them ſo terribly with ſhot and Granadoes from both ſides his Ship, that you would have thought him on Fire. The Knight, though he needed no Preſident to teach him his Duty, yet glad to have a Man, Famous as <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> witneſs of his Actions, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded him ſo bravely, that the <hi>Turks,</hi> who till then made no doubt of the Victory, began to fear the ſucceſs: They cool'd in their Attaques, and fell off to more diſtance, not daring to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The Knight had no ſooner obſerved it, but, to make uſe of his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which had viſibly rais'd the Courage of his Souldiers, he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34717:9"/>
commanded them preſently to Board the Ship that lay next him, being the ſtouteſt of the three; he was readily obeyed, and as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ruſhed a-Board the Enemy; a Company of Volunteers imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately followed him, with ſome ſtout Souldiers, who, animated with his Example, did every one the Actions of Heroes. 'Twas wonderful to ſee (though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more true) all the Decks covered with the Bodies of thoſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> ſlain at the firſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault by a handful of Men: The Knight of <hi>Malta</hi> appear'd more than Man, he ſeem'd to be in ten or twelve ſeveral places at once; ſo ready was he, and nimble, to help where need. But I forget my ſelf, to engage thus in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the Fight, which is not my deſign, having a Thouſand other things to ſay, not of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34717:9"/>
importance (this Engagement being poſſibly the moſt terrible and glorious happen'd on thoſe Coaſts) but more ordinary and gallant, which my intention at preſent is to entertain the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der withal.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add only, that after ſix or ſeven hours Fight, wherein you may believe there wanted not occaſion for theſe excellent Captains to ſignalize themſelves, the Veſſels having all boarded one another, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſunk one of the Enemies, and put up the Standard of <hi>Malta</hi> in the main tops of the other two. <hi>Gourdan,</hi> who at that day thought no Man his equal at Sea, began to apprehend, from the Actions he had newly ſeen, the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the young Knight might one day exceed his, and rob him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34717:10"/>
of the glory of Soveraign of thoſe Seas: He had obſerved him more than once enter the <hi>Enemy</hi>'s Ships, and bear down all before him that offered to reſiſt, and hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his way to Victory through Wounds, Blood and Death; and that the honour of the Victory was almoſt wholly due to him: In a word, You are not to expect ſo much Juſtice in the Old <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaire,</hi> as not to believe him jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the growing Reputation of his young Partner, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſs glad of the Victory, than otherwiſe he would have been.</p>
            <p>The Knight had been wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (though not mortally, yet) ſo dangerouſly that he was oblig'd for ſome Days to keep his Bed; the news was no ſooner brought <hi>Gourdan,</hi> but he went to ſee him, and expreſt the beſt he could how much he was troubled at it; he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34717:10"/>
ended the Complement with all the Commendations and Praiſes, a Man jealous as he was of the young Knight, was capable to give. But the young Hero, no leſs modeſt than brave, put him off handſomely, attributing to <hi>Gourdan</hi> the whole advantage of the Fight; only he did juſtice to ſome of his Ship, who had ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized themſelves moſt, without ſaying a word of what he had done: They reſolv'd to return to <hi>Malta</hi> to refit their Veſſels, and to ſell the Prizes: Reſolutions at Sea depend much on the Pleaſure of the Winds; and they found themſelves becalm'd on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which for three Weeks ſtopp'd their deſign, and render'd that a very tedious Voyage, which a Week before they had perform'd in three Days.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:34717:11"/>
The Knight was ſoon well of his Wound, and finding himſelf able enough to walk about in the Calme, he had a mind to take a view of the Prizes with <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> who that day had given him a viſit: He found them both conſiderable for the number of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors</hi> of both Sexes, which in a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Country would be a current Commodity. When they return'd a-Board their own Ships, <hi>Gourdan</hi>'s Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, being a Friend of the Knights, and not well ſatisfyed with his Captain, took an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as they were ſpeaking of the prizes, to tell the Knight privately he had not ſeen the moſt conſiderable Prize, being a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Lady of Eminent Quality, and one of the handſomeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that had ever been ſeen. The Knight was ſurpriz'd <hi>Gourdan</hi>

had ſaid nothing of her, but looked on it as a Trick of an old <hi>Corſair;</hi> yet he could not but be diſpleaſed with the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as unjuſt and uncivil; but the Lieutenant told him, he was not to wonder at it from a Man who never knew what it was to be civil or juſt to the beſt of his Friends: He went on and told him how <hi>Gourdan</hi> had ſhifted the Lady into his Veſſel by Night, and plac'd her under the Guard of a <hi>Mooriſh Eunuch</hi> who had ſerv'd her long, and that <hi>Gourdan</hi> was ſo much in Love with her, and ſo jealous, he would not permit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one to ſee her; that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch had told him the Lady had ſo great an Averſion for <hi>Gourdan,</hi> not only for his uglineſs, but for his ill uſage of her, that ſhe was reſolv'd to dye rather than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his deſires. The Knight
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34717:12"/>
was of too noble and generous a nature not to pity the poor Slave, eſpecially being handſome, and no ordinary perſon; he preſently laid deſigns in her Favour, and told the Lieutenant he would go ſee his Captain on the morrow, and reproach him with having conceal'd that Treaſure, in hopes to prevail with him, at leaſt to uſe the Lady better, and ſend her back into the Veſſel ſhe was taken in: The Lieutenant, better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>Gourdan</hi>'s humour, told him, it was more than he was to expect from one ſo deeply in Love, and ſo brutiſh as <hi>Gourdan.</hi> However the Knight went to ſee him on the morrow: <hi>Gourdan</hi> receiv'd, careſs'd, and entertain'd him with a great deal of kindneſs, but not a word of the Slave: the Knight had of purpoſe given him occaſion to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34717:12"/>
diſcourſe of her, but <hi>Gourdan</hi> made him no ſatisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: At length the Knight, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt all patience, ask'd him, as in raillery, if he knew what was become of a handſome <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> Woman, which he was told had been taken in the bigger Prize; and told him, he was much ſurpriz'd he had not ſeen her when they took a view of what was found in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ships, and that he had ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of her: The Amorous <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſair</hi> took this for an Affront, and told him roundly he knew not what Woman he meant, that they had ſeen Women enough in the Prizes; that true it was he had one in his Ship who was no handſomer than the reſt; but, if that troubled him, there were enough left, and he might go pick out one from amongſt them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34717:13"/>
that ſhould pleaſe him beſt. The Knight little ſatisfyed with the Anſwer, reply'd very ſeriouſly, that he held the Conditions of their Partnerſhip ſo ſacred, that till they came to a dividend, he thought neither had right, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the privity and conſent of the other, to appropriate to himſelf any thing found in the Prizes: <hi>Gourdan</hi> was a Man of ſo ſhallow Diſcourſe he had not a word to ſay for himſelf, but, without any reply, roſe up and went to walk on the Deck, leaving the Knight in his Cabbin; who, muſtering up the Forces of his good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and gentleneſs, to ſtifle the reſentment the croſs uſage of this ſavage Man had raiſed within him, reſolv'd to win him to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by Civility; he followed him, and embracing him with a kindneſs would have gain'd the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34717:13"/>
heart of a Beaſt of the Field, <hi>I have no deſign,</hi> ſays he, <hi>to conteſt with you for the fair Slave you have poſſeſt your ſelf of; 'tis a ſort of Commodity I have no mind to deal in, but pray do not refuſe me the ſight of her: Gourdan</hi> was quite deaf of that Ear, 'twas a tickliſh Requeſt, and he did not intend to expoſe her to the view of a young Man ſo handſome as his Partner; he lov'd her too well to hazard her on ſuch an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and walking on ſtill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anſwering a word, he made it ſufficiently appear to the Knight he muſt hunt for other Game, as for this <hi>Gourdan</hi> reſerv'd it for himſelf; the Knight knew not whether he ſhould be angry or laugh at the proceeding, yet looking on <hi>Gourdan</hi> with more pity than anger, <hi>Few men in my Circumſtances,</hi> ſays he, <hi>would be</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:34717:14"/>
               <hi>ſatisfyed with this uſage; but you muſt be comply'd with, make much of your Slave; the time may come you will be a weary of her, and then I may be allow'd the liberty of ſeeing her:</hi> Having ſaid this, he left <hi>Gourdan,</hi> and retir'd to his Ship.</p>
            <p>A few days after, he ſent <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> word he had taken his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and was going among the Prizes in ſearch of a Woman to his mind, that might bear him Company; though in truth it was to find out one who could give him an account who ſhe was the Old <hi>Corſair</hi> had got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board; and very luckily he met with one who had ſerv'd her long and took her a-board his Veſſel, where he treated her with more Civility and Kindneſs than a Woman of her condition knew how to receive; he made her ſit
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34717:14"/>
with him at Table, and us'd her ſo obligingly as confounded the poor Slave: She was neither young nor handſome, and could impute the Favour to nothing but the pure generoſity of the Knight, whoſe good meen was ſufficient aſſurance of the ſincerity of his actions: Her Miſtreſs became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly the Subject of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and the Maid wanted not wit to ſatisfy his curioſity: She told him her Miſtreſs was a Lady the King of <hi>Tamaran</hi> had been paſſionately in Love with, and out of remorſe of Conſcience ſhe was going a Pilgrim for <hi>Mecha:</hi> The Knight, who knew perſons of that Quality did not without great reaſon perform acts of ſo extraordinary devotion, asked her merrily, whether ſhe knew the cauſe her Miſtreſs became ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely Pious; and ſeeing her
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34717:15"/>
diſpos'd to conceal nothing from him, he pray'd her to tell him the whole ſtory, not doubting but the account of the devotion of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of that Character muſt needs contain more then ordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures: <hi>Razy</hi> (the Slave he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd with) was by this time ſo taken with the Knight ſhe would not have deny'd him a far greater matter, and without further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty ſpoke to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tamaran</hi> is a Kingdom where Love at this day reigns more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, than ever he did at <hi>Cyprus</hi> or <hi>Granada:</hi> Gallantry is become ſo much in uſe there, 'tis almoſt as natural to be a Gallant, as to live, they are wholly given up to Love, and the young People, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd by their Fathers Examples, get themſelves Miſtreſſes before they get rid of the Rod of their School-Maſter. In a word, from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34717:15"/>
the age of fifteen to ſixty, from the King to the Plowman, every one enjoys his natural Liberty: whether it proceed from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Clymat, or temper of the People, I cannot reſolve you; I rather think Subjects are ſuch as their Kings make them. And the King of <hi>Tamaran</hi> being one of the moſt gailant Princes the World ever had, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there is nothing ſo much talk'd of in his Kingdom as Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry. But to come to my Story; that King, when he came to his Crown, fell in Love with <hi>Hattige</hi> my Miſtreſs, who is certainly one of the moſt beautiful Women eye ever ſaw. She is the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Janizary, and was married to a Perſon of Quality, who had a competent Eſtate, ſufficient to make her happy, had not her am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition preferr'd the Title of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34717:16"/>
to a King, before private Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities: To ſhorten the diſcourſe, the good Man found himſelf oblig'd to endeavour to content himſelf with the Honour the King did him in giving him a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and an Imployment abroad, which he ſcarce took for a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and would have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleas'd His Majeſty had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed it on another.</p>
            <p>My Miſtreſs, proud and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome as ſhe is, wanted not the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to put a value on her ſelf, and ſell His Majeſty a Conqueſt of that importance, at a rate ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to her height of Spirit and Beauty: True it is, ſhe hath not been admir'd for her wit, but that defect is ſupply'd by the oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs of her carriage, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Little Arts, which ſhe makes uſe of ſo much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of gaining the Monarchs
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34717:16"/>
heart, that never Prince was ſo deeply in Love as he: he hath that complaiſance and care to pleaſe her, as never man had for any Woman. And ſhe hath not loſt the advantage of it, but is by degrees become abſolute Miſtreſs of his Soul, and hath reaped the benefit of her conqueſt in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, a woman that knows the World, and is ſtudious of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, can propoſe to her ſelf. The Government of the Kingdom was in a manner in her hands: every one made his court to her, and whoever expected Favours or Rewards, muſt apply himſelf to <hi>Hattige,</hi> by whom all was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the pipe that convey'd the Royal bounty to the Subject: Paſt ages have furniſhed us with Examples of this nature, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity may ſee the like, but not equal to this; for it may be ſaid,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34717:17"/>
without ſtretching too much, the King of <hi>Tamaran</hi> took his Crown from his head to put it on <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige</hi>'s: The firſt Day he ſaw her he fell deſperately in love with her: the great riſe of my Miſtreſs and her power at Court, raiſed her many Enemies: yet her Pride and height of Spirit procured her more hatred than her favour did jealouſie: But the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and moſt dangerous Enemy ſhe had, was <hi>Oſman,</hi> chief <hi>Aga</hi> and Favourite to the King.</p>
            <p>A Favourite &amp; a Miſtreſs are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeen to agree, either of them endeavouring to engroſs their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters affection, is conſequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd for the ruin of the Rival: yet perſons of that character for the moſt part go cunningly to work; but thoſe I ſpeak of declar'd open War one againſt the other, being both great ſpirits, &amp; willing to let
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34717:17"/>
the World ſee the advantage they had one over the other: the King very prudent, and of a very peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able humour, ſided with neither, but having a kindneſs for both, and knowing they hated one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he gave neither of them credit in any thing ſaid to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of the other: <hi>Oſman,</hi> after many vain attacks, reſolv'd at laſt to try what jealouſie might work on his Maſter, and hoped his Paſſion, like that of other Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, might ſplit on that Rock: He apply'd himſelf diligently to obſerve the Conduct of the Lady, and find out ſome conſiderable and well grounded cauſe of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being throughly convinc'd his Maſter was ſo taken with the Charms of the Lady, it would be no eaſie matter to diſabuſe him, and that ſhe had cunning enough to clear and work her ſelf again
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34717:18"/>
into Favour unleſs the crime were great and plainly proved.</p>
            <p>My Miſtreſs look'd not like an Enemy to Nature, and her illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lover being (as uſual) leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous in his viſits than he had been at firſt, it was not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her conſtitution might force her to make uſe of a Gallant to her mind, to ſatisfie her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: at leaſt the <hi>Aga</hi> thought ſo, and you will find he was not deceiv'd.</p>
            <p>The Title of Miſtreſs, and Chief Miſtreſs to the King (beſides the power it gives perſons of that Character) hath introduc'd much Liberty into the <hi>Serrail. Hattige</hi> who never ſtinted her ſelf in any priviledge ſhe had, was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Soveraign there, not a perſon daring to contradict her in any thing: The <hi>Aga</hi> was no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and ſomewhat more
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34717:18"/>
formidable, and having Money at command (which is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at Court) he quickly by that means, had his Spies in every Corner, who promis'd him a faithful account of my Miſtreſſes Actions.</p>
            <p>As glorious as it is for an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Woman to ſee at her Feet every day a perſon who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all others, yet Monarchs are deceived if they think their Miſtreſſes are always true. No paſſion, but that of extraordinary love, can fix a Womans heart; Ambition alone is too weak a gage for their Fidelity; it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens, Princes owe their Amorous Conqueſts more to their quality than merit; and accordingly they extend only to what is external and groſs, when Love and Inclination, fruſtrated of their expectations from them,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34717:19"/>
and not ſatisfied with pomp and with ſhew, goes in ſearch of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction elſewhere. <hi>Hattige</hi> lov'd the King, as moſt Miſtreſſes of that kind uſe to do; that is, as far as the power of a Monarch could make her Love a Man, who raiſed her above all other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; ſhe reign'd in all outward ſplendor imaginable; but amidſt all her Glories ſhe was troubled ſhe found not a Man ſhe could Love for his own ſake. A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſubject to ſuch reflections as theſe, is hardly kept within the bounds of her duty; my Miſtreſs found it too hard a task not to tranſgreſs a little, and being in ſearch of one worthy her conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention, ſhe caſt her Eyes upon <hi>Rajep,</hi> the Maſter Gardiners Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rajep</hi> was a handſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, young and vigorous, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34717:19"/>
had pleas'd other Women, and was reputed to make his Fortune that way. She had twice or thrice ſeen him, as ſhe look'd upon the ſports as are uſually ſhewn for the divertiſement of the Ladies of the <hi>Serrallio,</hi> where Men Fight with Beaſts for the pleaſure of the Women. <hi>Rajep</hi> was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at the ſport, and always came off with Applauſe and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. Every blow he gave carried Death with it, and made all the Company ſhout for joy, which reached my Miſtreſſes heart. 'Tis not unuſual to find wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men affected with a Mans merit, upon occaſions of that nature; ſhe was deeply ſenſible of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe and Honour beſtowed by the Company on <hi>Rajep.</hi> When ſhe came from theſe Shews ſhe could not forbear being melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly and penſive, even in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34717:20"/>
King's preſence; She could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat, nor Sleep. This trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled extremely the amorous Prince, who was ſo inquiſitive after the leaſt concerns of the health and pleaſures of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, that he was more in pain than ſhe, to ſee her languiſh as ſhe did: He could not imagine what ſhe ailed, and was ſo much concern'd at it, he could not reſt for thinking of it. The Lady was more and more Love-ſick, and by degrees her paſſion grew ſo upon her it altered her quite. The good King redoubled his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes no leſs than his Care and Liberality; and if it had been poſſible, would have doubled his Love: He prayed her every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if ſhe lov'd him, to tell him the cauſe of her trouble, and proteſted he would not ſtick, for her ſatisfaction, to ſacrifice his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34717:20"/>
Life: So great, ſo true, and ſo tender a paſſion, might have turn'd that falſe heart of hers, had ſhe been capable of any love for him. But <hi>Rajep</hi> was her man; the moſt charming in her Eye; and the moſt accompliſhed on Earth. The King's bounties ſhe thought were but her due; or at leaſt ſufficiently requited in the ſuperficial acknowledgments ſhe made him; and that if ſhe lov'd him not heartily, 'twas not her fault, but his, who knew not how to gain her Affection.</p>
            <p>Such, Sir, is the fortune of Monarchs in love; when they are with their Miſtreſſes they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly lay aſide that Majeſty which dazles the Eyes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Hearts of Mankind; they go undreſſed into their Chambers, and make themſelves ſo familiar with their Miſtreſſes,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34717:21"/>
they afterwards uſe them as ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Men: The amourous <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige,</hi> wholly poſſeſt with her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for <hi>Rajep,</hi> languiſhed under it, not knowing what remedy to uſe. <hi>Zara,</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Slave, and her chief Confident, had a longing deſire to know what the matter was; ſhe heard her ſigh every moment; and, like a Woman of Age and Experience as ſhe was, ſhe thought, if it was not for Love, there was no great danger: She was not over haſty to know the Secret; but conform'd her ſelf ſo much to her Miſtreſſes way of living, that ſhe neither eat, nor ſlept; but wept, and ſigh'd, and walk'd, juſt as her Miſtreſs. At laſt, my Miſtreſs having often obſerved it, ask'd her what ſhe ailed to afflict her ſelf ſo: <hi>Alas, if you knew, Madam,</hi> anſwers the good <hi>Matron,</hi> ſighing, <hi>if you</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:34717:21"/>
               <hi>knew,</hi> ſays ſhe again, with a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Tone, <hi>what danger you run into by living as you do—But what ſhould I tell you of it, who have ſo little confidence in me. You have no cauſe to complain of that,</hi> Anſwers <hi>Hattige,</hi> ſmiling; <hi>for you know no perſon alive knows more of my Secrets than You. Yes, Madam,</hi> relplyes <hi>Zara, till now, becauſe poſſibly you never were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in any thing might deſerve the Name of a Secret; but now that the time is come to try my fidelity, to make uſe of my Advice and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, you are content to afflict your ſelf, as if you had not</hi> Zara <hi>with you;</hi> Zara, <hi>who loves you, (if I may be allowed to ſay ſo) more than her Life, which ſhe would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willingly ſacrifice for you: for what is the matter, Madam, what would you have? wherein may I ſerve you? why do you not make</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:34717:22"/>
               <hi>uſe of me?—Thou ſpeakeſt,</hi> ſays the Lady, <hi>as if thou readeſt what is in my heart. And who is it, but can gueſs,</hi> replyes <hi>Zara, what you ail? the only wonder to me is the King hath not taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and I tremble when I hear you ſigh before him: for, when all's done, what is it you want for compleat ſatisfaction? if it be not that he loves you too much, and you love not him; there is not that thing you can deſire in the world but you have it already. I tell you truly, Madam, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid your Melancholly will at length make him ſuſpect ſomething, and what he will think of it I know not. Thou ſayeſt well, poor</hi> Zara, replyes <hi>Hattige,</hi> ſeemingly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the kindneſs of the good Slave; <hi>and could I believe thee faithful enough to acquaint thee with all that is in my heart, I doubt</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:34717:22"/>
               <hi>not but thy Advice might be to my advantage. If you doubt my Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,</hi> ſays <hi>Zara, you need only ſay nothing to me, for ſo you will oblige me, in ſpight of my heart, to keep your Counſel: Yet I would have you know, that for forty years I have ſpent in the</hi> Serrail, <hi>I have been always look'd upon as an Example of Diſcretion: There hath not been here in all that time a gallant Woman but I have ſerv'd; and were we at leiſure, could give you a very pleaſant account of them. In a word, Madam, I know who I am, and I know what you want. Make uſe of me once more, and as ſoon as you pleaſe: Perhaps you may not find me always in humour to pleaſure you, but it pities me at preſent to ſee you languiſh.</hi> My Miſtreſs, who had before a good Opinion of <hi>Zara,</hi> and clearly ſaw how neceſſary ſhe was for

her, reſolv'd immediately to diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cover all to her, though to ſave her modeſty ſhe turn'd the ſtory thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou knoweſt,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>I had a Brother who loved me, and I from a Child lov'd him with the tendereſt Affection: My Father, to prevent miſadventures he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended from the violent Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we had one for another, parted us, ſending him to</hi> Candy, <hi>whence he never return'd. Never were more Tears ſhed then by me on that cruel occaſion; and to this Day I have not wore out the ſorrow for the loſs of him: But it is not that I have to ſay to you, dear</hi> Zara, <hi>you know it already; what I am to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint thee with, is, I have ſeen a man ſo like my dear Brother, in Meen, in Features, in Stature, in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; in a word, ſo every way like him, I verily thought him the</hi>

               <hi>Zara</hi> took the Billet, and went to give it an <hi>Eunuch</hi> ſhe confided in moſt; ſhe had ſeveral ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on ſuch Errands, whoſe Faithfulneſs ſhe bought with good ready Money: ſhe carefully inſtructed him ſhe ſent on this Meſſage, and conjur'd him to Secreſie. But what truſt is there to be repoſed in thoſe who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for him that gives moſt? <hi>Zara</hi>'s pay was not comparable to the Aga's; and that <hi>Eunuch</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of his Spyes, you may
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34717:25"/>
believe he carryed him the Billet in confidence of a good reward. <hi>Oſman</hi> receiv'd it as the beſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent could be made him; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to ſee what it contained, he retir'd into his Cloſet; open'd it; knew the hand; read it over and over with that extremity of revenge, that attends the deſire of pleaſure, when in a hopeful way of being Maſter of the Life or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of an Enemy.</p>
            <p>He paus'd a while e're he came to a reſolution what to do with the Billet; to Copy it out would ſignifie nothing, nothing being more to eaſie then to deny what we have not written; to keep it, were to put a ſtop to a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which, (to appear of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable conſequence) muſt be carryed on further: Having thought well of it, he was of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion it would be beſt to keep the

He thought of ſeveral, but this <hi>Eunuch</hi> belonging to the <hi>Serrail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> the Billet in all probability came from thence, where <hi>Rajep</hi> was altogether unacquainted. He could not imagine <hi>Hattige</hi> ſhould be the Perſon; ſhe, who was the proudeſt, as well as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34717:26"/>
Lady of the Kingdom, and the King's Principal Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: He would have ask'd the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> but feared he might ſpoyl all by being too curious: This made him content himſelf with asking a few Queſtions for ſome further light; but finding, by the Anſwers, all he was to hope for at that time was the Billet; he diſmiſt him with this Anſwer.</p>

               <p>THere is nothing too hard for me, when concern'd in the Service of Ladies: 'Tis the duty of a civil Perſon, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to oblige them: I take ſuch delight in it, I always think my Life well expos'd in their Service: You may gueſs, Madam, how ready I am on ſuch an occaſion as this; let me but know the way I am to take, no Obſtacle ſhall ſtop me: I dye

            <p>The <hi>Eunuch</hi> was liberally paid by <hi>Rajep</hi> that moment for betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; he gave him a fair Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, &amp; the honeſt Agent, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the favour, went directly with the Billet to the <hi>Aga;</hi> who, raviſhed at the good ſucceſs, caus'd a Copy to be made of this as of the former Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and ſent it to <hi>Hattige.</hi>

The Aga more joyful of the news than can be expreſt, caus'd a Copy to be made of this Billet by the hand that had copied the other, and diſmiſs'd the <hi>Eunuch</hi> to purſue his Commiſſion: <hi>Rajep,</hi> who did not expect ſo great a progreſs in ſo ſhort a time, thought himſelf highly obliged to the fair Làdy unknown, who ſav'd him the Troubles and Inquietudes of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger delayes.

               <hi>The</hi> Aga <hi>was glad of this Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let alſo; had it copied; and ordered the Eunuch to bring him word as ſoon as</hi> Rajep <hi>entred the</hi>

               <hi>cauſe of my melancholly; but the care I have of your Health, far dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than mine, and the Concern I am under, to ſee you ſo altered in few days, will not permit me any longer to conceal from you the cauſe of my ſadneſs. I muſt tell you then, though I were ſure to loſe your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by it, my grief proceeds on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a dream I had lately, which made ſuch impreſſion on my ſpirit, I cannot to this moment get it out of my thoughts. At that, ſhe ſtop'd, not able to proceed for weeping and ſobbing, which ſhe could not forbear; and I had much ado to perſwade her at length to put an end to; and preſſing her more earneſtly to go on, and tell me her dream. Alas!</hi> (continued ſhe, ſighing) <hi>may it not be a fatal Prediction out of my own mouth againſt my ſelf? I dreamt,</hi> Sir, <hi>I ſaw you in</hi> Roukia <hi>'s arms, the Maſter Gardiner's Wife, and</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:34717:30"/>
               <hi>was not able with tears or reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to force you thence. Can you be ſo falſe, and will you not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at leaſt to divert the blow Heaven threatens me with?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ah, Sir, rather let me die, than ever ſee this come to paſs. Here her grief ſeiz'd her more violently than ever, and ſhe fell half dead into my Arms. You may believe, dear</hi> Oſman, <hi>I ſaid many things to her to bring her again, and perſwade her out of the thoughts of the Dream, which you know ſignifies nothing. I have often heard talk of</hi> Rouchia; <hi>but as beautiful as they report her to be, I never had the curioſity to ſee her. I was ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the lovely</hi> Hattige, <hi>for whom I have reſolv'd to keep my ſelf entirely, and ſtick to her alone. To end my Story, you muſt know, I prevail'd with her ſo far, with oaths and kind words, that I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abus'd</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:34717:31"/>
               <hi>at laſt, and left her perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cur'd of thoſe ſuſpitions of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhe had entertain'd againſt me. She recover'd her former Gayety of humor, and was kinder than ever, having expreſt to me all the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and ſtrength of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Paſſion; I ſtay'd with her longer than ordinary, and am more in love with her than ever. I am but newly come from her, and to tell you the Truth, had ſcarce the power to leave her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pray ſtay a little longer,</hi> (ſays ſhe ſtill) <hi>as I was going. And ſtill one moments ſtay procur'd another, full of love and of kindneſs; which ſeem'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe ſtill as ſhe ſtaid me: I could entertain you all night with the pleaſure I had in the Cloſet of that charming Woman; and yet not tell you all, which, you know, is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in a Lover to do to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, though never ſo faithful.</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:34717:31"/>
               <hi>But what think you of her tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for me? Was ever woman in love ſo allarm'd at a Dream? And muſt I not love her more than ever, for having endur'd what ſhe did, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daring to acquaint me with it? 'Tis true,</hi> (ſays the <hi>Aga</hi> very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly) <hi>what you have ſaid, is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing, but not to that degree you imagin'd. Give me leave to acquaint you only, that a Man for whom I have the higheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and veneration, being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately in Love, as you are, with a Woman, one day in confidence gave me an account how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly he had ſpent ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in her Company; and that ſhe had given him a taſte of all that the moſt tender and paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Love hath of ſweet, and of charm; and that he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the happieſt Lover on Earth. You would think your ſelf much</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:34717:32"/>
               <hi>abus'd,</hi> (ſaid I) <hi>if all thoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of Love and of tenderneſs you have been ſo taken with, were but a Doſe of Poyſon to caſt you into a ſleep; and that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy you ſpeak of, is at this moment in the Arms of another. There was nothing ſo true, Sir,</hi> (adds the <hi>Aga) as what I told him; that man, if he had pleas'd, might have been an eye-witneſs of it. I could have let him have ſeen his Miſtreſs in Bed with another man, ſo far beneath him, as a Subject is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oſman, Oſman,</hi> (ſays the King) <hi>you ſhall not make me jealous: I believe</hi> (continues he, looking ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly on the <hi>Aga) ſuch a thing might happen. Women are now adays ſo treacherous, there is no truſting their Careſſes. But I am very well ſatisfied I cannot be concern'd in ſo infamous an Example. I know</hi> Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:34717:32"/>
               <hi>and know her too well, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſhe ever had kindneſs for any but me. However,</hi> (replies the <hi>Aga) 'tis of you I am ſpeaking all this while; and ſince I muſt be plain with you, and that the honour of my King is concern'd in it, you are the Perſon ſo baſely diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd.</hi> 'Tis that charming <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige,</hi> whom you love and adore ſo, 'tis ſhe betrays you this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the manner I have told you. The King, aſtoniſht with the ſudden ſtroke of ſuch terrible News, was ſpeechleſs a while; but preſently after, looking angerly on the <hi>Aga; As long as your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives, Oſman</hi> (ſays he) <hi>extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to the pride and exceſſive Expences of</hi> Hattige, <hi>I had the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to bear with them, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome ground of Truth; but her Reputation being in queſtion, wherein mine is ſo deeply concern'd,</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:34717:33"/>
               <hi>I ſhall think very ill of you, if you accuſe her without good proof to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict her: 'Tis now almoſt three Years ſince I ſaw</hi> Hattige, <hi>and have reaſon to know her better than any: Had there been another in the Kingdom greater than my ſelf, or were any one my equal in it, I might peradventure have ſome apprehenſion ſhe might be guilty of ſuch a Crime: I ſay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure; for I doubt very much, whether ſhe would in that Caſe be falſe to me. But conſidering her pride and height of Spirit, you ſhall never make me believe ſhe can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe her ſelf to think of any thing below me, unleſs I ſee it with my Eyes: Do not I ſee how ſhe uſes all the World, and that there is not a more ambitious Woman living? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe loves me. Yet I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſhe would love me more, were I greater than I am; for nothing</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:34717:33"/>
               <hi>but Greatneſs can ſatisfie that proud Soul of hers.

What you! Can you let me ſee,</hi> (crys the King ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angrily) <hi>when I am but juſt now come from her? Well Sir</hi> (ſays the <hi>Aga) What you ſay is true, but it is no leſs true, that if you pleaſe, you may find her with another in her Chamber, if you pleaſe to take the pains of going thither.

The King obſerving him come on ſo reſolutely, and with joy in his face, as a man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34717:34"/>
to a Triumph, began (not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to believe him, but) to fear there was ſomething in the matter: And it made him the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apprehend ſome untoward Adventure, that he knew <hi>Oſman</hi> a Man of good ſenſe, and not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily miſtaken; and one, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very good grounds, would not have engag'd in a buſineſs of that nature: So that the King knew not what to think. He would not for his life have given him that advantage over his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; eſpecially after the Story he had juſt then told him. And now all the Kings care was to make the deſign of the diſcovery miſcarry, though ſhe were crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: When they were got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two or three ſteps of <hi>Hattiges</hi> Apartment, and had no more to do but draw the Curtain, the King ſeem'd, as if he knew not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34717:35"/>
whither he was to go, nor what he had to do. His Guide, jealous of his Honour, and eager to make him an Eye-witneſs of his ſhame, was forc'd to puſh him on, and mind him there was no time to be loſt, if he would find them ſo together as was neceſſary for a clear Conviction, and if he ſtaid any longer, the whole <hi>Serrallio</hi> would know they were in: The King heard him not, or made as if he had not: He was buſying himſelf with needleſs precautions of ſhutting up Doors, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that there was no need to have them ſhut) made a great noiſe if they were ſtirr'd; of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Guards in needleſs places, and calling for help, that they within might hear him. In a word, to mad the <hi>Aga</hi> (who ſpent his breath in telling him he muſt not ſtay, but go directly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34717:35"/>
to <hi>Hattige)</hi> for one ſtep he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd he went back two: At laſt he order'd the matter ſo that the Gallant was aware of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and had time to eſcape, ſo that when the King was come to the Lady's Chamber, the Bird was flown, and no other ſign of her guilt, but a little more than ordinary finery, and a dreſs very different from what the King left her in, which would have paſt for good proof with a Lover leſs blind than he: <hi>Hattige</hi> had the dexterity to invent ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to take off the ſuſpition of any deſign; and to be before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with the Monarch, ſhe told him, he had pleas'd her ſo well that Evening, that, to charm him on the Morrow more than ever ſhe had done, ſhe had try'd on ſome new Dreſſes, and he was come moſt luckily to tell her how he
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34717:36"/>
lik'd them. Yet ſhe muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs her ſelf a little ſurpriz'd at his ſudden return, and extraordinary Viſit; and that either his paſſion for her was increas'd that Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or that he had ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Reaſons for it, which ſhe could not gueſs, but might deſtroy all the pleaſure ſhe took in ſeeing him the ſecond time. The King, perplext at what he ſaw, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd her very coldly, as if he had not been ſatisfi'd with her Excuſe, and let her know by his looks, he had ſome ſuſpicion of the Bravery he found her in; yet he durſt not condemn her, as want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient reaſon for it. <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who ſtaid in the next Room, and had, by his Maſters fault, loſt ſo excellent an occaſion, was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to eat his Fingers for madneſs, raving and exclaiming againſt the weakness of his Patron, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34717:36"/>
calling him all the Names his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger could ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>The good Prince, who had too much good nature to be proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the obliging Kindneſs and Flatteries of his Miſtreſs, was not only quickly perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all ſhe ſaid, but (which is moſt incredible) he had the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to tell her the reaſon of his Viſit, and all that the <hi>Aga</hi> had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with. Then it was it rain'd Torrents of Tears; then was her Hair pull'd by handfuls, her Head-gear and Cloaths tore all to pieces and a thouſand other Actions of Deſpair ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, that the King to appeaſe her, was forc'd to ask her pardon. <hi>Oſman</hi> knew nothing of all this, when his Maſter entred the Chamber <hi>Oſman</hi> was in, and with rears in his Eyes pray'd him if he lov'd him, to go make the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34717:37"/>
innocent <hi>Hattige</hi> ſome reparation of Honour: This put <hi>Oſman</hi> into ſuch indignation he almoſt loſt his reſpect to his Maſter, who continuing obſtinate to have him make a ſubmiſſion ſo unjuſt and unbecoming a Man of his Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Oſman</hi> took out the four Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets which he had of purpoſe brought with him, to juſtifie what he had ſaid, if there ſhould be occaſion, and ſhewed them the King, asking him if he knew the Character of thoſe <hi>Hattige</hi> had written. Then he pray'd the King to give him leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, which he granted him, more for ſhame he knew not what to ſay to him, than for any other reaſon he had to get rid of him: What an aſtoniſhment was the poor Monarch in, at ſight of the Billets? It was not in his power to come to himſelf; he
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34717:37"/>
walk'd all alone about the Room, with his head to the ground, (preſs'd down, you may believe, with the new weight it bore) and his Heart full of extraordinary Conflicts and violent Emotions.</p>
            <p>My Miſtreſs, (ſurpriz'd the King ſtay'd ſo long) was afraid the <hi>Aga</hi> might ſpoil all, and mar what her tears had ſo well mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and would go her ſelf to ſee what the matter was: She found him muſing as a man in a maze, and going up to him, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him, in that fond and obliging manner, where with ſhe charm'd him when ſhe pleas'd; <hi>What troubles you now, Sir,</hi> (ſays ſhe,) <hi>that you uſe me ſo cruelly? Any new trick of the</hi> Aga's? <hi>Will he never have done contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of miſchief? Ah Heavens! How unfortunate am I</hi> (adds ſhe, wetting his Face with the Tears
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34717:38"/>
that fell from her Eyes) <hi>to ſee you ſo eaſie to believe thoſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Calumnies that Villain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of me?</hi> With that ſhe fell as half dead into his Arms, which ſo ſoftned the Heart of the kind Monarch, he could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger reſiſt ſuch Charms; but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing her with unparallel'd Tenderneſs and Sorrow, carry'd her in his Arms, and laid her on the Bed, praying her, with Tears in his Eyes, to come to her ſelf again, otherwiſe ſhe muſt expect to have him die with her.</p>
            <p>This exceſs of Tenderneſs was too little to comfort the afflicted Fair One: She would know fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what the Traytor (ſo ſhe call'd the <hi>Aga)</hi> had told him of new, and proteſted ſhe would not ceaſe crying till he had told her all, and ſhe had juſtifi'd her ſelf from all his Calumnies. The
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34717:38"/>
good King was very loath to let her ſee the Billets, fearing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it would be hard for her to juſtifie her ſelf againſt them; but the deſire he had to find her innocent, made him give 'em her; telling her, he was well aſſur'd, 'twas a new Impoſture; and that he very well knew, 'twas an uſual thing to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit hands. She took the Billets, and began to read them; but with terrible Acclamations: <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!</hi> (ſays ſhe) <hi>Can man be ſo malicious? Well Sir,</hi> (adds ſhe) <hi>what Arts, and what Induſtry are made uſe of to ruine me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy me in your Opinion? And will you make nothing of it; but paſs it by, and take no care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge me? Aſſure your ſelf, I will without more ado, cauſe to morrow morning a</hi>Maraboug <hi>to be made, where I'le bury my ſelf</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:34717:39"/>
               <hi>alive, unleſs you do me Reaſon, and clear my Reputation from ſo criminal an Imputation, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects no leſs on You than on Me. You have a Heart of Stone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a poor Woman, who hath quitted all for Love of you, and made her ſelf a Sacrifice to your Paſſion; and in the mean time. permit your ſelf to be abus'd by a Favourite, a Villain, whoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Ambition you know; and he can prevail with you, not only to do what ever he pleaſes, but to believe the ſtrangeſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible things in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a ſhower of Tears ſell with theſe words? She had a Store-houſe of them, and could command them thence in what quantity ſhe pleas'd: The King did all he could to quiet her; he promis'd to vindicate her, and let her ſee very ſuddenly, he was not
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34717:39"/>
for <hi>Oſman:</hi> Strange Weakneſs! But Kings in love are Men, and not Gods.</p>
            <p>On the Morrow, the <hi>Aga</hi> was with the King at his riſing, but received in a lamentable manner: He complained of him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd him (you ſee with what Grounds) and at laſt baniſh't him, forbidding him his Preſence, till he ſhould be ſent for. <hi>Oſman</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd without Reply. He might have made more ſtir, by produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the <hi>Moor;</hi> but after Uſage ſo hard and unjuſt, he would not be at the Pains; but choſe rather to be thought to be in fault, and at diſtance from a Maſter ſo eaſie to be ſeduc'd by the Flatteries of a Woman, than to juſtifie himſelf for undeceiving him.</p>
            <p>Many were amaz'd at the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite's Fall; ſome rejoyc'd at it, eſpecially my Miſtreſs; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34717:40"/>
now near the King no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but what ſhe ſlighted, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf to take her full ſwinge in her Amours, relying on the blindneſs of the good Prince, whom ſhe thought ſhe had laid too ſoundly aſleep, to fear his waking a good while. Her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was to diſcover how the <hi>Aga</hi> came by the Billets: there was no colour of reaſon to ſuſpect <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jep,</hi> who was not only too honeſt, to be capable of ſuch Treachery, but oblig'd by joynt intereſt not to accuſe her. The Eunuch, who had been the Mercury of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, was the moſt ſuſpicious. She ſent in ſearch of him, but <hi>Zara</hi> could have no news of him, and ſo the Treaſon came out. <hi>Hattige</hi> fail'd not to charge the Miſtreſs of her Intrigues, to make better choice of thoſe ſhe imploy'd, and whom ſhe truſted as Meſſengers
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:34717:40"/>
in matters of that importance.</p>
            <p>The King was too Amorous not to be ſubject to jealouſie. He could not put out of his head thoſe Billets written in a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter ſo exactly like <hi>Hattiges,</hi> though he knew Folks have the art of counterfeiting hands: And taking time at his leiſure, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in private, and weigh with himſelf all the Circumſtances of that Evenings Adventure, it made him for a while very unquiet, and full of vexation. At laſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd for his ſatisfaction, and eaſe, to obſerve in perſon, the Conduct of his Miſtreſs, to rid himſelf at once of the Suſpicions that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented him, or the Paſſion he had for her if guilty: He bethought himſelf of a Stratagem for the purpoſe, which hit very luckily.</p>
            <p>He had the priviledge to enter the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> when he pleas'd,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34717:41"/>
through Doors made of purpoſe, the Keys whereof were in his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody. The Day he intended to put his Deſign in Execution, he ſpent almoſt all in <hi>Hattiges</hi> Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, paying her all the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Devoirs he us'd to do, with more than ordinary Gaiety and Tenderneſs; inſomuch that ſhe thought him better ſatisfied than ever of her Fidelity to him: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he ſtaid of purpoſe, much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ordinary, though to the good Ladys very great trouble, it being a Day of Aſſignation for <hi>Rajep,</hi> who with the impatience of a fortunate Lover, waited <hi>Zara</hi>'s coming: But when a Perſon who is jealous knows how to diſſemble, he deceives the moſt miſtruſtful.</p>
            <p>The King from <hi>Hattige's</hi> Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings went into his own, to dreſs himſelf like a Bedowin (ſo they call the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Women of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34717:41"/>
Mountains, of whom there are commonly great numbers in the <hi>Serallio)</hi> his Face he cover'd with a black Vail, and his Body a white Blanket, and put on a pair of Linnen-Drawers, and black Stockings, which is all the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of that ſort of Women, when they are in the Towns; for in the Country they go as <hi>God</hi> made them. The King in his new Dreſs ſlipt ſoftly and alone into the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and poſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before the Door of his Miſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Apartment; where, to avoid ſuſpicion, he laid him down on a Bench, as the <hi>Bedowines</hi> uſe to do.</p>
            <p>It was a Gallery you muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity paſs through, whether you went in or out of my Miſtreſſes Lodgings: At one end of it was a Lanthorn, which had a Light in it all Night; but the King being at the other end of the Gallery, it
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34717:42"/>
was almoſt dark there. He had not long been on the Watch, but he diſcover'd the Enemy, though he had no great mind to ask, Who goes there: He never bid them ſtand, but let them come on undiſturb'd, that he might have them where he deſar'd. 'Twas ev'n <hi>Zara,</hi> leading another <hi>Bedowine</hi> by the hand, whom the King prepoſſeſt with ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, preſently believ'd ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Woman as himſelf. And to ſpeak the truth, the <hi>Bodowin's</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Gate confirm'd his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. <hi>Zara</hi> went up to the door, never minding the Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and turning towards her <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowin,</hi> bid him have a moments patience, and ſhe would go to her Miſtreſs for Orders for his Entrance. The King had time then to take a full view of the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowine;</hi> who turning about to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34717:42"/>
that ſide where the King lay, perceiv'd there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in humane Shape on the Bench, and being now in an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Country, the <hi>Bedowin</hi> thought She could not be too cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and for fear of leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her fomething that might hinder her retreat, thought good to make up to what ſhe ſaw, and examine nearer at hand what it was: Fortune, being commonly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to thoſe Love expoſes, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it ſo, that a <hi>corner</hi> of the Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket the King had wrapt himſelf in being untyed, the curious <hi>Bedowin</hi> diſcover'd part of a Sword, which being Enamell'd with Vermilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in that little light there was, gave the <hi>Bedowin</hi> enough to know 'twas time to look about her, and not ſafe to be there. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly She went ſoftly to the other end of the Gallery, and ſo
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34717:43"/>
down the Stairs, and away out of Doors; which ſhe was very glad of, having ſcap'd a ſcowring, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully perſwaded the Sword ſhe had ſeen, threatne her Life.</p>
            <p>The King, who thought he had not given his fellow <hi>Beao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> the leaſt ſuſpition, could not fancy her marching back was to run quite away. He got up to ſee what was become of her: <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> arriving, took him for the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowin</hi> ſhe had left at the door, and wiſper'd him in the Ear, he might enter, and be kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. The King, glad of the miſtake, followed his Guide, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by the hand, a way he knew better than any one alive. He was no ſooner got into <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiges</hi> Chamber, but ſhe took him about the neek, hugging him in her Arms with the Tranſports of a Woman amorous as ſhe. <hi>Dear</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:34717:43"/>
Rajep, (ſays ſhe) <hi>how glad am I to ſee thee, having ſpent all this day with a King, whoſe Careſſes are torments to me? Thou muſt make me amends by a thouſand Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports of Love.</hi> This was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent beginning for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs Entertainment, who took all patiently, not ſtirring from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Diſguiſe: The Lady more haſty than he, to make good uſe of thoſe pleaſant moments the preſence of a Lover, belov'd as he was ſhould produce, couldnot endure that ſo little delay. Her longings, more prevalent than her Modeſty, put her into a fit of charming Wrath againſt the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her inſenſible Lover: ſhe made him a thouſand Reproaches, and would have tore off with her own hands his Vail, and his Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and the reſt of his fine dreſs: <hi>What,</hi> Rajep, (ſays ſhe) with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34717:44"/>
an amorous Indignation) <hi>do you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that I ſhould unmaſk you? Have you no more Deſire to ſee and embrace me? Is the time you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, with the peril of your life and mine, of ſo little <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alue, that you can afford to loſe ſo many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious moments?</hi> No ſoomer had ſhe ſaid this, but down dropt the Diſguiſe. <hi>Zara,</hi> who had helpt her Miſtreſs to undreſs the falſe <hi>Bedowin,</hi> firſt diſcover'd the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and ran away with a ſhrieck that frighted her Miſtreſs, who was never ſo ſurpriz'd as to ſee 'twas the King. <hi>Hattige</hi> very luckily ſwouned away for fear, for 'tis very probable the injur'd Monarch would otherwiſe in the beginning of his fury, have been tranſported into ſome act of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt her, which might have miſ- become him. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Woman almoſt dead at his
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34717:44"/>
feet (though ſhe did but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit) his fury vaniſh'd, to give place to his pity, which ſeiz'd him with that Tenderneſs, that made him ſenſible, falſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull as ſhe was, he could not forbear loveing her ſtill. He call'd to the Slaves of the Apartment, and order'd her to be laid on a Bed, where it would have pleas'd him to approach her with her Falſhood; but finding his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too weak for his good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, melting at ſight of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſo amiable, though falſe, he retir'd.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Oſman</hi> was call'd to Court, where he had from the King a very favourable Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make him amends for his former hard Uſage. He told him, he was but too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the ill Conduct of <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige,</hi> againſt whom he let fall
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34717:45"/>
the moſt opprobrious Language imaginable; proteſting he would for the future uſe her as the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of Women. The <hi>Aga,</hi> being a dextrous Courtier, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with Lover's Relapſes; knowing where lay the Weakneſs of his Prince, ſaid not a word for, or againſt her; only pray'd him to believe, he had not in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, a Servant more faithfull, and jealous of his Maſter's Glory, than him. But that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid if his Majſtey ſaw that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man again, things would return to their former courſe. The King bluſh'd at theſe words, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching him with his frailty. Yet he ſwore a thouſand Oaths, it ſhould never be ſo again, which his Heart miſ-gave him he would not keep, as it afterwards hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Rajep,</hi> Order was given
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34717:45"/>
to apprehend him. <hi>Meharen,</hi> the Maſter-Gardiner, having no Heir but that dear Nephew of his, when he had the News of what had paſt in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and the Order againſt <hi>Rajey,</hi> threw himſelf at the King's Feet, but was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected. Yet his Freinds at Court appeas'd the King in ſome meaſure, and prevail'd with him to change the Sentece of Death, paſt againſt <hi>Rajeb,</hi> into that of Baniſhment during Life.</p>
            <p>My Miſtreſs the firſt, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and third day of her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, ſaw not the King: This was a long time for the amorous Prince, who us'd to be ſcarce an hour away from her. Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of that nature are not loſt, without a great deal of pain. She had Friends ſhe imploy'd, who every moment acquainted the King with the lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34717:46"/>
her Repentance had brought her to, being ſo pin'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſhe was not likely to live an Hour. The fourth day the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Oſman</hi> was fulfill'd. The King foftned with the ſad News, melting into Tenderneſs, ſigh'd, ſtaggerd, and at laſt, following his Inclination, went to give her one Viſit more, under pretence of taking his Revenge of her, being aſham'd, without doubt, of ſo unbecoming a Relapſe, after the noiſe he had made of the Falſneſs of that Woman. To excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he ſaid he would go to her only, to take from her thoſe Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els he had given her, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd not to wear auy thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him. The <hi>Aga,</hi> who knew his Maſter well, and of what Conſequenee that Viſit might be, would have diverted him dextrouſly, by taking the Ladies part.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:34717:46"/>
And telling him, It did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a generous Prince, as he was, to repent of his Liberality, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to Women. But if he deſign'd only to frighten her, (which he doubted not, was all he intended) it would ſuffice, as he conceiv'd, to ſend any one to her from his Majeſty, without doing her the Honour of a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Viſit. The Counſel was good, but unſeaſonable for a Lover, who was going in ſearch of what the other would have diverted him from. The King anſwered, he knew what he did; and that in ſome Affairs he lov'd to follow his Humour, without any Advice. The <hi>Aga</hi> by this judg'd all was loſt, and that the King would be engag'd deeper than ever. He ſhrug'd and retir'd, unwilling to be Witneſs of an Action, which would be charg'd half upon him,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34717:47"/>
if preſent. The King was not diſpleas'd as his retyring, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps things would have gone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then they did, had the <hi>Aga</hi> been there. The King came to <hi>Hattiges</hi> Apartment, where preſently, without ſtaying to give her notice of his coming, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for the Keys of the Cloſet where the Jewels were, he caus'd the door to be broke open; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred it, and finding the box (they were in) open, he fell to view<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing them over, and taking parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice of them, as it were to give time to his perfi<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs to come, and appeaſe him. She fell down at his Feet, with her Hair about her Ears, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd his Knees with that irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable tenderneſs, he took her up, and led her into the Cloſet: what Reconciliation was made there, I know not; but certain it is, the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:34717:47"/>
King left the Jewels behind him, and returning two hours after, made her new Preſents.</p>
            <p>This agreement by degrees ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered ſuch ſtrength, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Prince viſited her oftner than ever, and ſeem'd to have forgotten, not only what he had ſaid of <hi>Hattige,</hi> but all that had paſt; which for a Lover of his Character was of conſequence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, never to be forgotten. It was talk'd of abroad, but not much to his advantage. Only the <hi>Aga</hi> ſaid not a word of it. Being politique, he knew there was no remedy, and that it was an incurable Infirmity in his Prince, whoſe Aſcendant was Love: So that the <hi>Aga</hi> held it imprudent in him, to ruin his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to ſerve his Prince againſt his will; and was confident, <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige</hi> was a Woman of that humor,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34717:48"/>
ſhe would deſtroy her ſelf at laſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rajep</hi> being baniſh'd, and <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige</hi> more addicted to Gallantry than ever, (the King having caus'd her only to change her Gallant, and add to her former, the Pleaſure of Variety) <hi>Zara,</hi> who through his means, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain taken into her Favour, was imploy'd a new to find out one with whom ſhe might break thoſe Oaths of Fidelity ſhe had newly made to the King. <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige</hi> did no longer mince the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to this Slave, ſo well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her Concerns. And the good Matron, who knew her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs deſir'd a Gallant, as well out of the Infirmity of her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Weakneſs of Temper, as to pleaſe her Inclination; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to find her out one, with whom ſhe alſo might do her Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. The King, on the other
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34717:48"/>
ſide, who after he was convinc'd of the Falſeneſs of <hi>Hattige,</hi> began to love her leſs, was very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of a new Miſtreſs, and fell in love with <hi>Roukia,</hi> as <hi>Hattige</hi> had foretold. It was an Inclination he was ſtrangely ſurpriz'd into, and perhaps in a manner not to be paralell'd.</p>
            <p>Women, beſides the natural Beauty of the Face, which chiefly gains them Admirers, have a Thouſand other ways to engage Men to love them; for their Voice, their Wit, their Humour, their Shape, their good Meen, and other Qualities, capable to produce great Effects in the Hearts of their Lovers. But I ſcarce dare tell you, how Love brought the King enamour'd of <hi>Roukia,</hi> who being one of the Handſomeſt Women of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, charm'd him by that part,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34717:49"/>
of which ſhe took the leſs care, becauſe ſhe would have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to ſhew it him, and would not have expos'd it to the Light, but for neceſſity, and without dreaming it could be the cauſe of ſo lucky an Effect. <hi>Excuſe me, Sir,</hi> (ſays <hi>Razi)</hi> laughing, <hi>if I enlarge no further on this Sublect. You may gueſs by what I have ſaid, few Fiſh are caught with that Bait.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Evening, about Sun-ſet, the King from the Terraſſe of the Garden of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> looking through the Trees, had a ſight of <hi>Roukia</hi> in that pleaſant Poſture: The Sun, who ſeem'd to ſtay to guild with his Rays, an Object ſo charming to that Prince, never ſaw any thing whiter, or better ſhap'd.

of the Royall Spectator, who did all he could to ſee a little more; but Love would not permit it, being reſolv'd the part he had firſt ſeen, ſhould have all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that Conqueſt. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Courier (for Gallantry) was diſpatch'd with a Billet to <hi>Roukia,</hi> to this effect.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I Love you, Madam, and love you with a Paſſion no leſs tender than new: I will not tell you how you have wounded me, but it was no leſs than an innocent Treaſon. I have heard ſay, you were dangerous to ſee, but not of that ſide I ſaw you: Others run away from the ſight of that, wherewith I am ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and it was my Fate to feel the Power of your Charms, by that which is commonly leaſt charming: However I am more in love, than any man living; and what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34717:50"/>
of me, when I ſee you as I ought? I cannot tell. I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon to fear an entire Defeat. I dye with impatience to expoſe my felſ to your moſt powerfull Charms. I am preparing for you that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, this Evening. Let me not languiſh; otherwiſe you will be the Death of your King, whom you have already too cruelly wounded, not to pity him a little. The <hi>Moore,</hi> who brings you this Billet, will tell you what is to be done. Adieu.</p>

            <p>Thus it is our Kings declare their Love: they never ſigh in vain. They need but ſay, <hi>I love you,</hi> and <hi>I will,</hi> and the buſineſs is done. Our Women think it their duty to obey them in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Love, as our Men in Affairs of State. <hi>Roukia,</hi> inclinable as the reſt of our Countrey-Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in things of that nature,

was ſo charm'd with the Honour of being written to by the King, that, without examining circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſhe preſently return'd him this favourable Anſwer.</p>
            <q>
               <p>SIr, you are no leſs Maſter of our Hearts, than our Lives: You ſhall never find me other, than full of Reſpect and Obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you: Your Will is a Law. And Nothing ſhall be too hard for Me, when You command it to be done. The Direction I have from the <hi>Moor</hi> ſhall be obſerv'd; You muſt only take care to imploy <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haren</hi> about buſineſs: All things elſe will aſſuredly be favourable. And if you love me as much as you ſay, you will ſave me part of thoſe pains that attend the Impatience of one in Love, when forc'd to wait long.</p>

The King receiv'd this Letter with the joy of a Lover, who was to be happy that day, which ſeem'd long to him; who was to ſtay till night, before he could go to the place of Rendezvous. He was ſo wholly taken up with his new Paſſion, and the pleaſures he promis'd himſelf from it, that he never thought of ſeeing <hi>Hattige,</hi> which he ſeldom fail'd to do. A Commiſſion was preſently made ready to ſend <hi>Meharen</hi> out of Town. Night being come, the King went alone, &amp; without noiſe into the Garden of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where the Comedy was to be acted by him and <hi>Roukia,</hi> who at the hour appointed came in by a Ladder he had caus'd to be brought for the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This enterview was charming on either ſide: The night was not ſo dark, but the King could
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34717:51"/>
diſcern <hi>Roukia's</hi> excellent Shape; and judging the Features of her Face to be anſwerable, he made no doubt but ſhe was beautiful, as ſhe was reported: But what charm'd him moſt, was her admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Wit, which ſhe ſhew'd on all occaſions, to make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for what the Night hid from his Eyes. The King was tranſported at it. And to tell you the truth, they ſpent not much time in Complement, but were quickly familiar, as if they had been acquainted many years. 'Tis a priviledge Kings have, to make more way in a day, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in a Month.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Roukia,</hi> no leſs proud of the Honour the King did her, and the Dignity likely to attend it, than ſhe was of his love, did her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavour to deſerve it, &amp; with admirable ſucceſs; for ſhe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:34717:52"/>
gain'd his Eſteem no leſs than his Affection. She ſaid a Thouſand pretty things, which he was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſht at, and made him (very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligingly for her) blame Love for having been ſo ſlow in bringing him acquainted with her, who deſerv'd beſt of any his A fection, and his Care: They were got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Grotto,</hi> convenient enough for an Entertainment, almoſt like that of <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Dido;</hi> and were there for ſome time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Interruption. I will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb them, (continues <hi>Razy,</hi> ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) to give you an account what paſt there between them. You have been in Love, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and may gueſs what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe they had. The King it ſeems was well pleas'd with it, for he reſolv'd to paſs the reſt of the Night there.</p>
            <p>The Summer is the beſt Seaſon
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34717:52"/>
for Rancounters of Love: but this being a Gallant us'd to Succeſs, afforded leſs matter of diſcourſe than one, who had been leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate would have done; and at length he fell aſleep with his Fair one. Love, who had more Buſineſs to do in the ſame Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, allow'd him but a ſhort time to reſt. <hi>Roukia,</hi> hearing a Noiſe, awak'd him to tell him of it. At firſt, he could hardly believe it, the place being inacceſſible to any but himſelf, and <hi>Meharen,</hi> as Maſter-Gardiner, whom he had ſent abroad, and therefore had no apprehenſion of: He hearken'd more attentively, and could hear ones voice, and afterwards his ſteps: Before he would proceed farther, he was willing to know who were ſo raſh to enter that Place, which it was Death to do by Day, without his Permiſſion;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:34717:53"/>
he was ſcarce got up, but he ſees them approach to come into the <hi>Grotto.</hi> It was a ſpacious Place made of purpoſe for a Cooling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room in the Heats of Summer; and had in it ſeveral Beds of Turf, very prettily made with Pots of Jeſſamin Flowers, and other Sweets, all about. In a word, it was a place pick't out for the Kings Pleaſure. It appear'd, by the manner of the new Comers entry, they were no ſtrangers to the Place. They choſe a Quarter not far from the King's. But it was ſo dark, it was impoſſible to ſee one another. He let them ſeat themſelves at their eaſe, and had obſerv'd they were two, but could not diſcern whether Men or Women. One of them, whoſe voice the King preſently knew, ſays immediately to the other; <hi>'Tis the fineſt place in the world,</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:34717:53"/>
               <hi>to laugh at the Jealous, and to be quit with them. He hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brought me hither, where I have been forc'd to ſpend with him many a tedious quarter of an hour.</hi> This was <hi>Hattige:</hi> The King was extremely ſurpriz'd, not knowing how ſhe ſhould po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſibly have come into the Garden; but he was the more ſurpriz'd, and <hi>Roukia</hi> alſo, at the anſwer of the other, whom both knew to be <hi>Meharen: I confeſs, Madam,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>he deſerves not to poſſeſs alone the Affections of a Lady beautifull as you are, but he is my Maſter. And nothing but a Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, great as that I have for you, could have prevail'd with me to be falſe to him, as I am. Nothing but the extremity of your Beauty, whoſe charms are irriſiſtable, could excuſe ſuch a Crime. But let a man value himſelfe never ſo much</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:34717:54"/>
               <hi>on his Honeſty and Integrity, yet a Paſſion rais'd in him by a Perſon ſo amiable as you, will be Proof againſt all Batteries of Duty, and eaſily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter it. 'Tis but in jeſt,</hi> Meharen, (ſays <hi>Hattige) that you raiſe theſe Scruples: I am falſe, as you are, but that's nothing with me. 'Tis a fine thing to be falſe, if you know how to do it handſomely. I have a Heart will be its own Maſter, and love one to day, and another to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow. What would become of Men and Women, if, when they engage in kindneſs with one, they muſt abſolutely ſell themſelves, and not be allowed to change, when they grow wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or have a greater Inclination for another. 'Tis a natural Right to beſtow our Affections where we pleaſe, and when we pleaſe to revoke the Gift: And wretched are they, who enjoy not that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:34717:54"/>
               <hi>Our Sentiments are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Change, as other things; and Love as well as Nature is not charming, but in Variety: For Example,</hi> Meharen, <hi>to day I am for You, but three or four days hence I will not undertake but I may be for another. And it would be Injuſtice in you, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect I ſhould be truer to You, than I am to the King. True, Madam,</hi> (replies <hi>Meharen,</hi> ſmileing) <hi>I have no Reaſon to blame in you that ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inconſtancy, to which I owe my Happineſs: But would you ſay as much to the King, Madam? You may believe,</hi> (ſays She <hi>I glory not in theſe Maximes before him, not for fear he ſhould follow them, but to avoid giving him Cauſe to have an ill Opinion of Me: Were He of my Humour, I think I ſhould love him the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and perhaps I hate him for</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:34717:55"/>
               <hi>nothing elſe, but that he loves me too conſtantly. I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured handſomly to engage him to be falſe to me, inſomuch that I told him one day, I dream'd I had ſeen him in your Wife</hi> Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kia's <hi>Arms, whom I knew to be a handſome Woman, and hop'd he might have a mind to her, or the Curioſity at leaſt to ſee her; but my Addreſs was loſt upon a Man obſtinately faithfull, and produc'd no other Eruit but nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous Aſſurances of his Truth and Tenderneſs for me. You did not much oblige me in that particular, Madam,</hi> (ſays <hi>Meharen) and when you have occaſion again to dream, to be rid of one troubleſome to you, let me intreat you it may not be at your Friends coſt. How,</hi> (replies <hi>Hattige) would you take it ill the King ſhould do as much for you, as you do for him? Yes without</hi>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:34717:55"/>
               <hi>doubt,</hi> (ſays <hi>Meharen) for I do it not for that purpoſe, that he ſhould do as much for me. Well,</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers <hi>Hattige) if he do not, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will. I fear not that,</hi>(replies <hi>Meharen) I know my Wife very well, and am perſwaded She is Fool enough to die, rather than do me ſuch an Jnjury, though the King ſhould tempt her. She quarrels with me every day, for but letting the Slaves come into her Chamber; and I dare engage once more, ſhe would rather dye than appear to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man, though the beſt of my Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This pleaſant Dialogue had very different Effects on the two Auditors, who were ready ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to laugh, and ſometimes to be angry: The King all the while had <hi>Roukia</hi> in his Arms, and ſqueez'd her Hand when they ſpoke of her. She did as
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34717:56"/>
much to him upon the like Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. True it is, he had ſmall Kindneſs for <hi>Hattige</hi> after he had found her falſe, and leſs a great deal after he fell in love with <hi>Roukia.</hi> But it cannot but vex one to ſee a Miſtreſs (though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken) in the Arms of another, eſpecially of one Inferiour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Setting aſide the Crown, yet <hi>Meharen</hi> was not comparable to the King for Vigor or good Meen: He was not very old, yet not ſo young as the King, and a hundred times harder favour'd.</p>
            <p>Pleaſant as the King was, at dumb Raillery, with <hi>Roukia,</hi> and preſſing her hand, yet he was mad to hear what was ſpoken; and any one, but <hi>Meharen</hi> (of whom he took very pleaſant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge) ſhould have felt terrible Effects of his Anger. <hi>Roukia,</hi> but for <hi>Hattige,</hi> had born her part of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:34717:56"/>
the Sorrow: but finding by her, her Buſineſs with the King went on the better, and that ſhe had paid her Husband in his own Coyn, ſhe thought ſhe had all the Reaſon in the world to rejoyce.</p>
            <p>But this new pair of Lovers had their Deſign, and were not come into the <hi>Grotto</hi> only to talk: the Scene was going to alter. But the King was ſo little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant, that he had not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to ſee the beſt Act of the Play; but riſing up with a great noiſe; <hi>Meharen,</hi> (ſays he, with a voice would have made the moſt Confident quake) <hi>Is it thus you ſerve me? Is this your Execution of the Orders I gave you?</hi> 'Tis hard to repreſent the aſtoniſhment, the fear and confuſion of our Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and Shepherdeſs, when they heard the King. <hi>Meharen</hi> fell at his Feet, with his Face to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34717:57"/>
the Ground, and not able for ſome time to ſay a word. <hi>And you Falſe One,</hi> (ſays the King to <hi>Hattige) you Baggage without Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Truth, is this your requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of the Obligations I put upon you, in making you what you are?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was harſher Language in the caſe, but I will not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you with it: I muſt draw to an End. The Maſter-Gardiner being a little recover'd of his Fright, though labouring ſtill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apprehenſions of Death, did all he could, (not to excuſe himſelf, there being no colour for it, but) to take all the Fault on himſelf, and make <hi>Hattige</hi> appear leſs faulty, whom he would needs endeavour to ſave, by offering his Life as a Sacrifice for her. The King ſaid he would accept of it, provided a Perſon he had with him would be content, and with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:34717:57"/>
that he made <hi>Roukia</hi> draw near, who had not yet appear'd on the Stage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meharen</hi> was one of thoſe Husbands, who though they love their Wives well, cannot forbear hunting other Mens Game. He had been in love with <hi>Hattige</hi> when ſhe was at the Janizaries. And the choice the King had made of her for his Miſtreſs, had but increas'd <hi>Meharen's</hi> Paſſion: So that he had ſeveral times ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himſelf to <hi>Zara,</hi> whom he knew to be a Miſtreſs of that Trade, and found faithful on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Occaſions: The Liberty he had to enter at pleaſure the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> contributed much to the good Fortunes <hi>Zara</hi> procur'd him. But as for <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige,</hi> ſhe thought her then ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible, ſhe had almoſt diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him from any thoughts of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34717:58"/>
her, till the Diſgrace of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, which, inſtead of fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Zara,</hi> encourag'd her to make a Trial of what he deſir'd her; who no ſooner had the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunity of ſpeaking to <hi>Hattige,</hi> but the Bargain was made. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle did <hi>Meharen</hi> think it muſt have coſt him his Wife, and his Conſternation was yet greater, when he heard her Voice, than when he heard the Kings: He knew not what to do or ſay, he ſaw himſelf paid in his own Coin, and without cauſe of Complaint: He puffed out his Rage in great fighs. The King triumph'd, and to encreaſe <hi>Meharen's</hi> deſpair, and the pleaſure he took to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm him with Grief and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, he commanded him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the Particulars of his Intrigue with <hi>Hattige,</hi> how he came acquainted with her,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34717:58"/>
and how he got her out of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Our unfortunate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer was forc'd to obey him, and gave him an Account of the Paſſion he had had for her many years, and was renew'd after his Nephews Adventure, which let him ſee <hi>Hattige</hi> was not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: That <hi>Zara</hi> had been his Confident, and that very day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their Interview, like a Man that leaves all for Love, he had not Power to execute his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: As to her coming out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> it was through a Window of her Apartment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Garden, and that ſhe was let down in a great Wicker-Basket: The King had the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to go ſee the <hi>Machine,</hi> and found it in a Poſture to help up the fair Lady, who had deſerted it. But it was his Pleaſure <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kia</hi> ſhould go up in her Room, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34717:59"/>
that her worthy Spouſe ſhould weigh her up inſtead of <hi>Hattige,</hi> whom the King gave him in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, though not to his Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. However it was the Kings Favour to him. It was his Majeſties Goodneſs to do it: And I know not how he could have us'd him better.</p>
            <p>Thus got <hi>Roukia</hi> into Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only of the Kings Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Care, but of <hi>Hattige's</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, and all that belong'd to her, who had not remov'd or taken with her any of her moſt Precious things: yet <hi>Hattige</hi> was ſo far from being troubled at it, that ſhe lov'd her Pleaſure and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty ſo well, ſhe would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven more than ever ſhe was Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of, to be out of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> But <hi>Meharen,</hi> grown wiſer by <hi>Roukia's</hi> example, kept <hi>Hattige</hi> as cloſe, as if ſhe had continued in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34717:59"/>
the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> This quickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Diſputes and Quarrels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, till at laſt they grew weary one of another. <hi>Hattige</hi> to be rid of him pretended a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from Heaven, which the <hi>Turks</hi> are very ſubject to, and told him ſhe was requir'd to make a Voyage to <hi>Mecha,</hi> otherwiſe her Sins would never be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd: The Cauſe was ſpecious enough to oblige <hi>Meharen</hi> to give her her Paſport, though he had not (as he had) a mind to be rid of her. He gave his Conſent to the Pilgrimage, and ſent her to <hi>Tunis,</hi> recommending her to <hi>Mahomet Baſcabey,</hi> his intimate Friend, and praying him to fu̇r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the fair Pilgrim with a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to carry her to <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, Sir, ſays <hi>Razie,</hi> is the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my Miſtreſs. You ſee I have not ſpar'd her, that I might give
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34717:60"/>
you a true Account of all her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, which none knew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I, who have been with her ever ſince ſhe was taken into the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> but never approv'd her Conduct; therefore ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd ſtill to hide it from me, yet I knew all ſhe did. Certain it is, had her Soul been Beautiful as her Body, there had been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more perfect under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. She would charm you, Sir, did you ſee her, and 'tis pity a Man as the Captain of the other Veſſel ſhould have her in his hands. She would be far better in yours. The Knight anſwer'd, he had a deſire to ſerve her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, but not to make an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of her. That he had been in ſearch of her on no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: And if it were poſſible, he would at the firſt Oppertuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſet her at Liberty, and all thoſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34717:60"/>
of her Veſſel. But it muſt be kept ſecret, leſt if his Friend any way ſuſpected it, he might put a ſtop to their good Fortune. <hi>Razie</hi> amaz'd at ſo great Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> who ordinarily uſe not too well thoſe of her Nation, knew not what to think of it, but took it for a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. She thank'd the Knight for the Favour he gave her hopes of, and was carry'd back to her Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, laden with Proviſions; which the other Women were the more ſurpriz'd at, having been ill us'd by the other Captain, whom they thought no more inhumane than this.</p>
            <p>That Night the Knight did but think of the Adventures of the Lady, and as bad as ſhe had been repreſented, yet being young, he could not chuſe but have a mind to ſee her; but he was affraid, the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:34717:61"/>
ſight might coſt him dear, ſince he found by hearing the Story of her, he had more than an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Inclination for her. Few Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> of his Age, would have been ſo ſcrupulous: Curioſity, if not Love, would have prevail'd over all other Conſiderations. But this (who was Honeſty and Generoſity it ſelf) made it his Buſineſs to ſerve the Lady, without the leaſt hope of Recompence. Yet he lov'd to do things civilly, and was willing before he went any further, to ſpeak once more to <hi>Gourdan,</hi> and was preparing to go ſee him, juſt as <hi>Gourdan</hi> came to him, a little more gay than ordinary. <hi>Well Sir,</hi> (ſays He) <hi>how like you your Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? I hope you will excuſe me the eaſier for what Love made me do. I can eaſily excuſe,</hi>(anſwers the Knight) <hi>the Love one has for a fair</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:34717:61"/>
               <hi>Lady; but cannot excuſe a Man who uſes them ill, as You do. I am more troubled at it,</hi> (ſays the <hi>Corſair) than you think, who know not as I do, the Women of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: they are humourſome, and will never love a Man, but when they are forc'd to it by ill <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage. That's a ſcurvy piece of Policy,</hi> (replies the Knight) <hi>and becomes not a civil Perſon. Believe it,</hi> (adds He) <hi>it would be more for your Honour, to ſend her back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Veſſel, than do her the leaſt Violence.</hi> He ſpake theſe words in ſuch a manner, as made <hi> Gourdan</hi> redden, without anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word. The Knight proceeded to ſay, <hi>I know You will not take my Advice, but I would do my Duty to mind you of it, and if you have any Value ſor me, you will leave the poor Slave at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at leaſt, to love or not love</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:34717:62"/>
               <hi>you: for whatever you have to ſay of the Cuſtoms of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of this Country, you ſee the ways you have us'd to win her, have not yet taken, but end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quite contrary to your wiſhes. She is not an ordinary Woman, to be threatned, and ill us'd into Compliance. And could you have your will of her, pray tell me what Pleaſure could you have of her, but would reflect with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage on a Man of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem You are of in our Order.</hi>

            <p>This open'd <hi>Gourdan's</hi> Eyes; he imagin'd the Knight had been told of the Ladies Beauty, and was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in Love with her, which might be the reaſon he ſpoke in that manner, and hoped perhaps he would be ſuch a Sot to quit her to him: Theſe were <hi>Gourdan's</hi> thoughts, who turning to the Knight; <hi>All your Rhetorick, Sir,</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:34717:62"/>
ſays he, ſmiling) <hi>will not ſerve your turn, you are too young for me. And without makeing a fine Speech, as you have done, I will only tell you, I will keep my</hi> Turk; <hi>and let her love me, or not love me, ſhe ſhall not ſtir from Aboard me. But, Captain Gourdan,</hi> (anſwers the Knight, ſomewhat more coldly) <hi>is this</hi> Turk <hi>yours, that you can diſpoſe of her in this manner? and have you more Right to her than I? I do not intend to take her from you: I have already told you my mind as to that—I know not,</hi> (replies <hi>Gourdan,</hi>haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily) <hi>what your Thoughts or Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are; but I will ſooner part with my Life, than that Woman; and ſhall take him for my Enemy, who ſhall but think to make me quit her.</hi> The Knight, little valuing the words of a Man, whoſe Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie diſturb'd the little Senſe he
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34717:63"/>
had, would fain have perſwaded him by fair means. <hi>What I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is but reaſonable and juſt, and if you are my Friend, as you have often aſſur'd me, you will not deny my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, or at leaſt, you will not force me to uſe the means to ſet this Woman at Liberty. You will find it a hard matter to do,</hi> (ſays <hi>Gourdan</hi> furioufly) <hi>and with more Strength than you are Maſter of:</hi> and ſo went his way. This was high Language enough, for a man as the Knight was, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board his own Veſſel; but being as moderate as the other was brutiſh, he choſe rather to let him go, than offer him any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front.</p>
            <p>This was the laſt Viſit they made one another; <hi>Gourdan</hi> was miſtruſtful of the Knight, and watch'd narrowly over his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34717:63"/>
Prey: But his Lieutenant gave the Knight an account of all, and offered him his Service: The Knight was ſo juſt, he deſir'd no other Service of him, but to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Billet he would cauſe to be written to the fair Slave. The Lieutenant promis'd it. <hi>Razie</hi> was ſent for, becauſe the Knight, though he underſtood and ſpake well the <hi>Moors</hi> Language, would not write it: when <hi>Razie</hi> was come, ſhe wrote thus to her <hi>Miſtreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>MAdam, A Man Generous and Gallant, as he, whoſe Captive you are, is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncivil and Brutiſh, is deſirous to reſtore You and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s our Liberty: Make ready for the firſt Wind that ſerves, and hang a Cord at your Window, that when the time comes, you may have Notice.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:34717:64"/>
The Billet was ſeal'd, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried privately to <hi>Gourdan's</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, who preſently convey'd it to the fair Slave, by the Eunuch who was his Friend. The poor Lady was over-joy'd at the News; but had been ſo accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd to ill Fortune, ſhe doubted very much to obtain a Happineſs ſhe had ſo little reaſon to expect: That Villain of a Pyrat, (for ſo ſhe call'd <hi>Gourdan)</hi> had torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her that day worſe than ever; and ſhe was reſolv'd, if he came again, to throw her ſelf into the Sea. The Billet brought her in a manner to Life again, and ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pray'd to <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſo hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as ſhe did then to the Wind, by which ſhe expected her Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: What hands ſoever ſhe ſhould fall into, ſhe thought it would be a Happineſs, if ſhe could but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the hands of that brutiſh

Captain. One Night, as ſhe leaſt thought of it, ſhe ſaw a Man come in at her Window, which at firſt frighted her; but his countenance made her recover her ſelf. It was the Knight of <hi>Malta. 'Tis time, Madam</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to free You from your Chains: 'Tis the braveſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the world to return to</hi> Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis; <hi>make uſe of it, and allow me the Pleaſure of doing this ſmall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to a Perſon, who deſerves better to be ſerved by all the world, than ill us'd as ſhe has been.</hi> I cannot tell, whether <hi>Hattige</hi> was more taken with the Knights good News, or his good Qualities; but after ſome Conſideration, ſhe was ſo affected with him, to thank him; ſhe embrac'd him, and was not able to ſay a word: She was a-Bed; and as there is nothing ſo handſome as a beautiful Woman a-Bed, he was ſo charm'd at the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34717:65"/>
ſight of her, he was as much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd as ſhe, and knew not what he did. Having by her Actions expreſt all the Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments poſſible. <hi>I believe, Sir,</hi> (ſays She) <hi>Heaven hath ſent me the Succour you bring; but ſure I am, the World hath not a Man ſo Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſo Handſome as You.</hi> The Knight had the Gallantry- to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn her Kindneſs for Kindneſs; and helping to dreſs her, being in haſte, he inſtructed her what to ſay, and what Courſe to ſteer to avoid meeting with the <hi>Corſair.</hi> To end my Story, the fair <hi>Turk</hi> was not long a dreſſing. 'Twas not a time to be curious in it: She put on no more than was abſolutely neceſſary, and (had the Knight pleas'd) would have got out of the Veſſel juſt as ſhe got out of the Bed. The Seamen were ſtirring, and fitting
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34717:65"/>
the Rcpes to make for <hi>Malta,</hi>-though the Wind was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for them: The Knlght help'd the fair <hi>Turk</hi> to get down at the ſame Window he got in at, into a <hi>Canoe,</hi> he had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ready under the Poop, and preſently with the Favour of the Night they gain'd one of the Prizes, wherein he deſign'd to ſend her: He took out thence all the Chriſtians that guarded the Veſſel; and having taken leave of the Lady, who would have been longer glad of his Company, he parted with a great deal of Trouble to go to his own Ship; where he gave Order, as <hi>Gourdan</hi> did in his, the Anchor ſhould be weigh'd, that they might Sail for <hi>Malta.</hi>
