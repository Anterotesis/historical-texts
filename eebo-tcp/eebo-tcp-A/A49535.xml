            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62532:3"/>That I may therefore give you some Light into its Mysteries, I shall first direct you how to breed such <hi>Horses</hi> that may be for <hi>Training</hi>; or else instruct you, how otherwise to procure them. Secondly, how to know by <hi>Shapes, Marks,</hi> and other Tokens, what <hi>Horse</hi> may be most convenient for your purpose. Thirdly, how to <hi>diet</hi> him so, that he may perform all things within his Power, without Danger. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what manner of <hi>Exercise</hi> is most conducive to this Design: and on these Heads I intend to inlarge in my following <hi>Discourse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before I enter upon my <hi>Subject</hi> propos'd, I think it necessary to answer <hi>Four Objections,</hi> that may be made against this <hi>Art of Dieting and Training Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> that I may remove all prejudice from the minds of those, who think they may have Reason to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it; and that I may vindicate (with Truth) this <hi>Art,</hi> and clear it from all Aspersions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first Objection</hi> I shall mention, is made by <hi>de Grey</hi> in his Epistle to the Reader, (<hi>Edit.</hi> 4<hi>th.</hi>) where under the <hi>Vmbrage</hi> of his Love to <hi>Horses</hi> and in pity of the Hardships they undergo in <hi>Hunting,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly inveighs against it, as the <hi>Sourse</hi> of all their Miseries. But that I may not be tax'd of <hi>Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by my <hi>Reader,</hi> and for his satisfaction I shall set down his Words, which are these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Nobility and Gentry of this our Isle of Great</hi> Britain, <hi>did truly know how honourable, and how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Horsemanship were, and how much they are esteem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some Horses they have, though not for Mannage, yet for Hunting: but what manner of Hunting? Fox-hunting forsooth, or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62532:4"/>
they do so much over-strain the strength of these poor Horses, (forcing them over deep Fallows, tough Clays, and wet and rough Sands,) that albeit those Horses be strong and able, yet are they so toil'd out therewith, as that when they come home at night they would pity the Heart of him that loveth an Horse to see them so bemired, blooded, spurred, lamentably spent, and tyred out; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if such Horses had been ridden to the Great-Saddle and Cannon, they would infinitely have delighted all men that should have beheld them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answer, that for my own part I am not very fond of <hi>Fox hunting</hi>; but I can see no <hi>Reason</hi> why <hi>Persons of Honour</hi> should not <hi>gratifie</hi> their <hi>Fancies</hi> with this <hi>Recreation,</hi> since <hi>from the beginning</hi> Horses were made for the service of <hi>Man</hi>; and doubtless for their <hi>Recreation,</hi> as well as more necessary Uses. And I am very confident, that if Horses be <hi>train'd, dieted,</hi> and <hi>ridden</hi> according to <hi>Art,</hi> there will be left no ground for this <hi>Objection.</hi> For by <hi>good Feeding</hi> Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would be prevented; and by <hi>Airing,</hi> and <hi>due Exercise,</hi> the Horses <hi>Wind</hi> would be so improv'd, that no moderate Labour would hurt him; nay, though a Horse by <hi>immoderate Riding,</hi> were reduc'd to such <hi>Tragical Exigencies,</hi> as <hi>De Grey</hi> mentions, yet by the Assistance of <hi>Art Nature</hi> may be in <hi>Twenty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, there are others, that though they may approve of keeping their Horses <hi>clean,</hi> yet are not reconcil'd to <hi>hunting</hi>; but being either Admirers of <hi>Coursing,</hi> or else keeping Horses only for the benefit of their <hi>health,</hi> and the taking the <hi>Air</hi>; will not be perswaded, but that they can bring their Horses to the same <hi>Perfection</hi> without <hi>hunting,</hi> as with it.</p>
               <p>To answer the first of these, I mean <hi>Coursers</hi>; I affirm, 'tis impossible to attain the end of this <hi>Art</hi> by that Means: for being oblig'd in search of their Game to toil their Horses all day, over <hi>deep Fallows,</hi> in a foot-pace only, they are likelier to bring their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to <hi>Weariness</hi> than <hi>Perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the same <hi>Answer</hi> may serve the <hi>Others</hi> likewise: for <hi>Riding</hi> a Horse up and down the <hi>Field</hi> after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, brings a <hi>Weariness</hi> and <hi>Dislike</hi> to an Horse in his <hi>Exercise,</hi> through his Ignorance of the Time, when his Labour shall cease; whether, or to what End he is so labour'd. Whereas on the contrary, an Horse naturally takes delight in <hi>following the Dogs,</hi> and seems pleas'd with their <hi>Musick,</hi> as is evident by his <hi>pricking up his Ears,</hi> gazing on them, and pressing to <hi>gallop</hi> towards them, when ever he hears them in <hi>full cry,</hi> (though at a distance.) Nay further, I have been <hi>Master</hi> of a <hi>Stonehorse,</hi> that so entirely lov'd the <hi>Hounds,</hi> that when at any time (through eagerness of Sport, and desire to save the <hi>Hare</hi> from being


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62532:5"/>
eaten) I have rid in amongst the Dogs, he would so carefully avoid treading on them, that he has more than once hazarded my Limbs (by making a <hi>false step</hi>) to save <hi>theirs.</hi> From hence I infer, that doubtless Horses extreamly <hi>delight in hunting,</hi> and consequently, that it is a fit <hi>Exercise</hi> for them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Others Object, That what soever <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> there may be in <hi>Hunting,</hi> they had rather deny themselves that satisfaction than hazard the <hi>Laming their Horses,</hi> which, (as they are told) few, or no <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> escape.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Hunters</hi> are sometimes <hi>Lame,</hi> I do not deny: but cannot allow, that it proceeds alwaies from this <hi>Exercise.</hi> For 'tis the <hi>Indiscretion of the Riders,</hi> in <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verstraining their Horses at Leaps</hi>; and by that meanes, sometimes <hi>clapping them on the back-sinews, catching in their shoos,</hi> and such like, and not the <hi>Sport,</hi> that is the cause of <hi>Lameness.</hi> But on the contrary, I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to shew any man <hi>Twenty</hi> other Horses lame (which never knew what belong'd to <hi>Hunting</hi>) for <hi>One Hunter.</hi> There are several other <hi>Reasons</hi> be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62532:5"/>Fourthly, Some again are Enemies to this <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Dyeting Horses in particular</hi>: affirming, that such <hi>exact Diet</hi> makes them tender, sickly, and takes them off their Stomach: and that the <hi>Charges</hi> are not only great, but likewise unnecessary.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>First part</hi> of this <hi>Obiection,</hi> I answer, that an Horse is so far from being made tender, or losing his Appetite, by such extream and several Feedings, if he have proportionate Exercise, that it rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures him to hardship. For much Labour (if not too violent) either in <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Beast,</hi> instead of weakning the <hi>Stomack,</hi> and causing <hi>Sickness,</hi> does rather advance the <hi>Appetite</hi> and preserve his <hi>Health</hi>; and it may be observed, that it doth oftner heighten than decay the Stomack.

               <p>As to the several sorts of <hi>Food,</hi> we shall prove in the sequel, that every part of it is both nourishing, and natural to all Horses Constitutions; so that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, tis not only allowable, but necessary: And to prove this, needs no more; than to ride an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Horse drawn clean,</hi> a days <hi>Hunting</hi> or three <hi>Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To them therefore that have grounds convenient for <hi>Breed,</hi> I shall direct this part of my discourse: and lay them down some few Rules that may be serviceable to them, though I shall be as brief as possible, and refer them to <hi>Markham, de Grey, Morgan, Almond,</hi> and <hi>Farring Compleated,</hi> (which is collected from the forementioned Authors

               <p>First therefore I wonld advise you to buy either an <hi>Arabian Horse</hi> (if you can procure him,) a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> or a <hi>Barb,</hi> for your <hi>Stallion,</hi> that is well <hi>shap'd,</hi> of a good <hi>Colour</hi> to beautify your <hi>Race,</hi> and well <hi>mark'd,</hi> to agree with most mens Opinions; though otherwise they are not so significative as Mr. <hi>Blunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> and his <hi>Italian</hi> Author <hi>Frederigo Grissone,</hi> would have us believe.</p>
               <p>To begin with the <hi>Arabian</hi>; Merchants, and other Gentlemen that have travell'd those parts, report, that the right <hi>Arabians</hi> are valu'd at an incredible, as well as an intolerable Rate; being priz'd at <hi>Five hundred,</hi> others say at <hi>one, two,</hi> and <hi>three thousand Pounds</hi> an Horse; that the <hi>Arabs</hi> are as careful of keeping the <hi>Genealogies</hi> of their Horses, as <hi>Princes</hi> in keeping their <hi>Pedigrees</hi>; that they keep them with <hi>Medals</hi>; and that each Son's Portion is usually <hi>two Suits of Arms, two Cymeters,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> of these Horses.

I am of opinion twill both dry up the <hi>radical Moisture</hi> too fast, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise instead of heightning his Pride and Lust, (which he alledges, weaken him too much.

               <p>Now when your <hi>Stallion</hi> is in Lust, and the <hi>Time</hi> for <hi>Covering</hi> is come, which is best to be in <hi>May,</hi> that the Foles may fall in <hi>April</hi> following, otherwise they will have little or no <hi>Grass,</hi> if they should be <hi>put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> (according to <hi>Markham</hi>'s opinion) in the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> tho he holds that <hi>one Fole falling in March</hi> is worth <hi>two falling in May,</hi>

that by this way, of a <hi>dozen</hi> Mares he dare affirm that <hi>two</hi> shall not <hi>fail</hi>: yet it may not correspond with the <hi>Interest</hi> of some <hi>private Gentlemen</hi> who turn <hi>Breeders</hi> for <hi>Profit</hi> as well as <hi>Pleasure</hi>; for a good <hi>Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> bearing such an extraordinary rate, and they having but <hi>One,</hi> have reason to be cautions, to avoid as much as can be all <hi>hazardous</hi> Experiments; which (with submission to the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Judgment) this in some cases may prove. For first, there have been Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of great spirit, that have <hi>kill'd</hi> themselves through <hi>excess</hi> of <hi>Lust,</hi> being left to range at their <hi>liberty</hi>; and those that have been confin'd to an <hi>Enclosure,</hi> &amp; a select number of Mares, have yet in one <hi>Weeks</hi> space so weaken'd <hi>Nature,</hi> that not above <hi>half</hi> the Mares have <hi>held.</hi> Secondly, some Mares are of so <hi>hot</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of <hi>Nature,</hi> and their <hi>Lust</hi> so <hi>violent,</hi> that if they are permitted to run long with the Horse, after they have conceived, will (if they be <hi>high in flesh</hi> and lusty) desire the Horse again, which generally hazards the Loss of the <hi>Embrio</hi> they go with.</p>
               <p>To prevent therefore these <hi>Inconveniences,</hi> I shall lay you down an other <hi>Method</hi> (as briefly as may be,) which is called <hi>covering in hand,</hi> as the former is generally term'd <hi>out of hand,</hi> and the way is this: <hi>viz.</hi> when you have brought both your Horse and Mare to as proper condition for Breed by <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>good feeding,</hi> then set some ordinary <hi>Ston'd-Nag</hi> by her for a day or two to <hi>wooe</hi> her, and by that means she will be so prone to <hi>Lust,</hi> that she will readily receive your <hi>Stallion</hi>; which you should <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> to her either <hi>early</hi> in a <hi>Morning,</hi> or <hi>late</hi> in an <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> for a day or two together, and let him <hi>cover her in hand</hi> once, or twice if you please, at each time, observing always to give the Horse the <hi>advantage of Ground,</hi> and that you have some one ready with a <hi>Pucket</hi> of <hi>cold water</hi> to throw on the Mare's <hi>Shape,</hi>

immediately on the <hi>dismounting</hi> of the Horse, which will make her <hi>retain</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> received the better, especially if you get on her <hi>back,</hi> and <hi>trot</hi> her about a quarter of an Hours space, but in any case have a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I shall say no more as to the <hi>keeping</hi> the Mares du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of their being with <hi>Foale,</hi> nor of their <hi>foaling</hi>; only this, that if you take care to <hi>house</hi> them all the <hi>Winter,</hi> and to keep them well, their <hi>Colts</hi> will prove the better.

               <p>The reason why I propose the <hi>Housing</hi> of them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Winter, with <hi>dry</hi> Feeding and Lodging, is, that they may be the <hi>liker</hi> their <hi>Sire</hi> in <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Shape.</hi> For the <hi>primary</hi> Cause of the <hi>fineness</hi> of Shape and Beauty in Horses is <hi>Heat,</hi> and <hi>dry</hi> Feeding.

               <p>Your <hi>Horse</hi> then being <hi>full Five,</hi> you may if you please put him to grass from the middle of <hi>May</hi> till <hi>Bartholmew-tide,</hi> or at least from the middle of <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> till that time; for then the <hi>Season</hi> being so <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently hot,</hi> it will not be convenient to work him: where whilst he is sporting himself at liberty in his <hi>Past<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>First then you are to visit your Horse <hi>early</hi> in the <hi>Morning,</hi> to wit, by Five a Clock if in Summer, or Six, if in Winter, and having <hi>put up</hi> his <hi>Litter</hi> under his Stall, and <hi>made clean</hi> your <hi>Stable,</hi> you shall then feel his <hi>Ribs,</hi> his <hi>Chaule</hi> and his <hi>Flank,</hi> for those are the cheif signes by which you must learn to judge of the <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>evil state</hi> of your Horses body, as I shall now shew you.</p>

Caution, be sure whilst you are <hi>dressing</hi> your Horse let him not stand <hi>naked,</hi> his Body being expos'd to the penetration of the <hi>Air,</hi> whilst you are telling a <hi>Banbury-story</hi> to some Comrades, that accidentally come into the Stable, as I have seen some Grooms, that would stand <hi>lolling</hi> over their Horses, when they were <hi>uncloath'd</hi>; and trifle away their time by listning to some idle Discourse; but when you have <hi>stripp'd</hi> him fall to your Business <hi>roundly,</hi> without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission till you have sadled him, and thrown his Cloth over him.</p>
               <p>And the reason why I advise you to throw a <hi>Cloth</hi> over him, whilst you are dressing his Legs is this; that although tis a general Rule amongst Grooms, that an Horse cannot take <hi>cold</hi> whilst he is <hi>dressing,</hi> yet is that Saying to be understood only of his <hi>Body,</hi> not of his <hi>Legs</hi>; for the rubbing of his Legs will not prevent catching cold in his Body.</p>
               <p>When this is done, you shall with an <hi>Iron Picker</hi> pick his Feet clean, (that the stopping of his Feet may not be a means of his taking up Stones in them,) <hi>comb</hi> down his <hi>Main</hi> and <hi>Tail</hi> with a wet Main-comb, then spirt some <hi>Beer</hi> into his Mouth, and so <hi>draw</hi> him out of the Stable.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it <hi>begets</hi> in him an ill <hi>habit</hi> of <hi>running away,</hi> as soon as he hath done drinking. Lastly, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight he hath of such <hi>violent Exercise,</hi> makes him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes <hi>refuse</hi> to <hi>quench</hi> his <hi>Thirst</hi>: and therefore (as I said) first <hi>walk</hi> him a little way, and then put him into a <hi>gentle Gallop</hi> for 5 or 6 score, then give him <hi>wind</hi>: and after he hath been <hi>rak'd</hi> a pretty space, then shew him the Water <hi>again,</hi> and let him <hi>drink</hi> what he <hi>pleases,</hi> and then <hi>gallop</hi> him <hi>again</hi>; and thus do till he will drink <hi>no more,</hi> but be sure to observe always that you <hi>gallop</hi> him not so much as either to <hi>chafe,</hi> or <hi>sweat</hi> him.</p>
               <p>Now by the way <hi>observe,</hi> that in his <hi>galloping after water,</hi> (after the first weeks <hi>enseaming,</hi>) if sometimes you give him a <hi>watering Course sharply,</hi> of twelve or twenty score, (as you find your Horse,) it will <hi>quicken</hi> his <hi>spirits,</hi> and cause him to <hi>gallop</hi> more <hi>pleasantly,</hi> and teach him to <hi>mannage</hi> his <hi>Limbs</hi> more <hi>nimbly,</hi> and to <hi>stretch</hi> forth his <hi>Body largely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When your Horse hath done drinking, then <hi>rake</hi> him to the Top of the next <hi>Hill,</hi> (if there be any near your Watring-place, for <hi>there</hi> in the morning the <hi>Air</hi> is <hi>purest,</hi> or else to some such place, as he may gain best advantage both of <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> and there air him a <hi>foot-pace</hi> an <hi>hour,</hi> or so long as you (in your discretion) shall think <hi>sufficient</hi> for the state of his Body, and then ride him <hi>home.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the time of your Horses <hi>Airing,</hi> you will easily perceive several marks of your Horses <hi>satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and the pleasure which he takes in this <hi>Exercise.</hi> For he will <hi>gape, yawn,</hi> and as it were <hi>shrug</hi> his <hi>Body.</hi> If he offer to <hi>stand still,</hi> to <hi>dung,</hi> or <hi>stale,</hi> which his Airing will provoke, be sure <hi>give</hi> him <hi>leave,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to <hi>stare about, neigh,</hi> or <hi>listen</hi> after any <hi>noise.</hi>

               <p>When you are returned from Airing, and are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, lead your Horse on the Straw, which (as I told you before) should always lye before the Stable door; and there by Whistling and stirring up the Litter under his Belly will provoke him to Stale, which a little practice will bring him to, and is advantagious for the Horses <hi>Health,</hi> and the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your Stable clean; Then lead him into his <hi>Staul</hi> (which ought likewise to be well littered) and having ty'd up his head to the empty <hi>Rack,</hi> take off his Saddle, rubb his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Leggs</hi> all over with the <hi>French-brush,</hi> then with the <hi>Hair-patch,</hi> and last of all with the <hi>Woollen cloath.</hi>

For without doubt no <hi>certain</hi> Quantity of Meat can be <hi>allotted</hi> for all sorts of <hi>Horses,</hi> any more than for all sorts of <hi>Men</hi>; and therefore proportion the quantity to the Horses Appetite: but be sure at all times give him his <hi>full feeding,</hi> for that will keep his Body in better <hi>state</hi> and <hi>temper,</hi> and increase his <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>vigor.</hi> Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to keep your Horse <hi>always sharp-set,</hi> is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy way to procure a <hi>Surfeit,</hi> if at any time he can come at his <hi>fill</hi> of <hi>Provender</hi>; according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Proverb, <hi>Two hungry Meales make the third a Glutton.</hi> But tho you perceive he gather <hi>Flesh</hi> too fast upon such <hi>home-feeding</hi>; yet be sure not to <hi>stint</hi> him for it, but only <hi>increase</hi> his <hi>Labour,</hi> and that will assist both his Strength and Wind.</p>
               <p>When these things are done, you shall <hi>dust</hi> a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty quantity of <hi>Hay,</hi> and throw it down to him on his <hi>Litter,</hi> after you have taken it up under him; and then <hi>shutting</hi> up the <hi>Windows</hi> and <hi>Stable door,</hi> leave him till <hi>One</hi> a <hi>Clock</hi> in the Afternoon; at which time you shall come to him, and having <hi>rubb'd</hi> over his <hi>Head, Neck, Fillets, Buttocks,</hi> and <hi>Legs,</hi> as before, with the <hi>Hair-patch</hi> and <hi>Woollen-cloath,</hi> you shall <hi>feed</hi> him as before. and then <hi>leave</hi> him till the time of his <hi>Evening watring,</hi> (which should be about <hi>three</hi> of the clock in <hi>Winter,</hi> and <hi>four</hi> in <hi>Summer</hi>;) and then having put back his <hi>foul Litter,</hi> and swept away that and his <hi>Dung,</hi> you shall <hi>dress</hi> and <hi>saddle</hi> him as before, and <hi>mounting</hi> him you shall <hi>rake</hi> him to the <hi>water,</hi> and

after <hi>drinking</hi> and <hi>galloping</hi> you shall <hi>air</hi> him along by the <hi>River side,</hi> till you think it time to go home; then order him in <hi>all points,</hi> as to rubbing, feeding, stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you did in the <hi>morning</hi>; and having <hi>fed</hi> him at <hi>six a clock,</hi> be sure <hi>feed</hi> him again about <hi>Nine</hi>; and having <hi>litter'd</hi> him well, and thrown him <hi>Hay</hi> enough to serve him for all <hi>Night,</hi> you shall leave him till the next <hi>Morning.</hi> And as you have <hi>spent</hi> this day, so you must <hi>order</hi> him in <hi>all respects</hi> for a <hi>fortnight</hi> together, and by that time his <hi>Flesh</hi> will be so <hi>harden'd,</hi> and his <hi>Wind</hi> so <hi>improv'd</hi>; his <hi>Mouth</hi> will be so <hi>quicken'd,</hi> and his <hi>Gallop</hi> brought to so <hi>good</hi> a <hi>stroke,</hi> that he will be fit to be put to <hi>moderate Hunting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now during this <hi>Fortnights</hi> keeping you are to make several <hi>Observations,</hi> as to the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> of your Horse, the <hi>temper</hi> of his <hi>Body,</hi> the <hi>course</hi> of his <hi>Digestion,</hi> &amp;c. and order him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. As <hi>first,</hi> if he be of a <hi>churlish</hi> Disposition, you must <hi>reclaim</hi> him by <hi>Severity</hi>; if of a <hi>loving</hi> temper, you must <hi>win</hi> him by <hi>Kindness. Secondly,</hi> you must observe whether he be a <hi>foul Feeder,</hi> or of a <hi>nice Stomach</hi>; if he be <hi>quick</hi> at his Meat, and retain a <hi>good</hi> Stomach, then <hi>four</hi> times of <hi>full Feeding,</hi> in a <hi>Day</hi> and a <hi>Nights</hi> space, is <hi>sufficient</hi>; but if he be a <hi>slender Feeder,</hi> and <hi>slow</hi> at his <hi>Meat,</hi> then you must give but a <hi>little</hi> at once, and <hi>often,</hi> as about every <hi>two</hi> hours, for <hi>fresh</hi> Meat will draw on his <hi>Appetite</hi>; and you must always leave a <hi>little</hi> Meat in his <hi>Locker</hi> for him to <hi>eat</hi> at his own <hi>leisure</hi> betwixt the times of his <hi>Feeding</hi>; and when at any time you find any <hi>left,</hi> you shall <hi>swe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Tis observ'd of some Horses, that they are of so <hi>hot</hi> a <hi>Constitution,</hi> that without they may <hi>drink</hi> at every <hi>bit</hi> they cannot <hi>eat,</hi> and those Horses usually carry <hi>no Belly</hi>; in this case therefore you must let a <hi>Pale</hi> of <hi>Water</hi> stand continually before them, or at least offer them Water at <hi>Noon,</hi> besides what they <hi>fetch</hi> abroad at their <hi>ordinary</hi> times.</p>
               <p>Next you are to observe the nature of his <hi>Digestion,</hi> that is, whether he retains his Food <hi>long,</hi> which is the sign of a <hi>bad</hi> Digestion; or whether Nature does expel the <hi>Dung</hi> more <hi>frequently</hi>; which if he do, and that his Dung be <hi>loose</hi> and <hi>bright</hi>

               <p>BY that time you have <hi>spent</hi> this <hi>Fortnight,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the foregoing <hi>Rules,</hi> your Horse will be in a pretty <hi>good state</hi> of Body; for the gross <hi>Humors</hi> will be <hi>dry'd</hi> in his Body, and his <hi>Flesh</hi> will begin to be <hi>harden'd,</hi> which you will perceive (as I told you at first) by his <hi>Chaul,</hi> his short <hi>Ribs,</hi> and his <hi>Flank</hi>; for the <hi>Kernels</hi> under his <hi>Chaps</hi> will not feel so <hi>gross</hi> as at first they did, his <hi>flesh</hi> on his short <hi>Ribs</hi> will not feel so <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>loose,</hi> nor the <hi>thin</hi> part of his <hi>Flank</hi> so <hi>thick</hi> as at his <hi>first</hi> housing; so that now you may without <hi>hazard</hi> adventure to <hi>hunt</hi> him moderately.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed, I think it necessary to clear one <hi>point,</hi> which I have heard much <hi>discuss'd</hi> amongst <hi>Horsemen,</hi> which is, What sort of <hi>Chase</hi> is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the <hi>training</hi> of a <hi>young</hi> Horse? some being of <hi>one</hi> Opinion, some of <hi>another.</hi> For some would have a Horse, which is <hi>design<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Others think those <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> too violent for a <hi>young</hi> Horse, and therefore chuse to train him after <hi>Harriers</hi>; and of this Opinion I must own my self to be, since <hi>Experience</hi> has fully <hi>shewn</hi> me the <hi>Advantages</hi> of the <hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences</hi>


                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:62532:27"/>
of the <hi>other.</hi> Now to prove this <hi>Assertion,</hi> let us take a slight view of the <hi>several</hi> Cbases which are commonly used by our <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> where the Horse is made a <hi>Companion</hi> and <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Sport,</hi> and they are these; the <hi>Stag, Buck, Hind, Fox, Otter,</hi> and <hi>Hare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>three first</hi> here mention'd, as there is not much <hi>difference</hi> in the hunting of them, so the <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences</hi> from each Chase are in a manner the <hi>same</hi> also. For which soever you <hi>hunt,</hi> tis either in <hi>Covert,</hi> or <hi>at force.</hi> Now if <hi>Deer</hi> be hunted in a <hi>Park,</hi> they usually chuse the most <hi>woody</hi> parts of it, as a <hi>Refuge</hi> from the pursuits of their <hi>Enemies,</hi> which is both <hi>unpleasant</hi> to the <hi>Rider,</hi> and <hi>troublesome</hi> to the <hi>Horse,</hi> to <hi>follow</hi> the Dogs thro the <hi>thick Bushes</hi>; and besides, usually the Ground in <hi>Parks</hi> is full of <hi>Mole banks, Trenches,</hi> &amp;c. which is <hi>dangerous</hi> for a young Horse to gallop on, till he has attain'd to some <hi>perfection</hi> in his <hi>Stroke.</hi> But if they be <hi>turn'd out</hi> of the Park, and be hunted <hi>at force,</hi> you will find, that as soon as you have <hi>unharbour'd</hi> or <hi>rous'd</hi> them, they will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately make out <hi>end ways</hi> before the Hounds <hi>five</hi> or <hi>six,</hi> nay sometimes <hi>ten</hi> Miles, they following in <hi>full Cry</hi> so swiftly, that a Horse must be compell'd to run <hi>up</hi> and <hi>down hill</hi> without any <hi>intermission; leaping</hi> Hedg, Ditch, and Dale, nay often <hi>crossing Rivers,</hi> to the great <hi>danger</hi> of the <hi>Rider,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Horse.</hi> So that in my opinion tis altogether <hi>improper</hi> to put a <hi>young</hi> Horse to such <hi>violent</hi> labour at the first, till by <hi>practice</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> he hath been made acquainted with <hi>hard service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now besides the <hi>swiftness</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> of this Chase, and the danger of <hi>cracking</hi> his <hi>Wind,</hi> and <hi>burst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> his <hi>Belly</hi>; besides the <hi>straining</hi> of his <hi>Limbs</hi> by such desperate Riding, and the creating in a young Horse a <hi>loathsomness</hi> to his <hi>Labour,</hi> by undergoing


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62532:28"/>
such violent and unusual service; the <hi>seasons</hi> for these Chases begining about <hi>Midsummer,</hi> and ending about <hi>Holy-Rood-tide,</hi> which is that part of the year in which the Sun's <hi>heat</hi> is <hi>excessive,</hi> and so scorches the <hi>Earth,</hi> that a <hi>violent</hi> Chase would hazard the <hi>melting</hi> his <hi>Grease,</hi> and the <hi>weight</hi> of the Rider, by reason of the <hi>hardness</hi> of the Ground, would occasion <hi>Foundring, Splents,</hi> and <hi>Windgalls,</hi> insomuch that in <hi>short</hi> time the Horse would prove altogether <hi>vseless.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The next <hi>Chase</hi> propos'd was that of the <hi>Fox,</hi> which although it be a Recreation much <hi>in use,</hi> and highly <hi>applauded</hi> by the generality of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi>; yet with submission to their judgment I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could find that <hi>pleasure</hi> in it which has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to me by some of its <hi>Admirers</hi>: and I am sure it is <hi>inconvenient</hi> for the <hi>training</hi> of a <hi>young</hi> Horse, since it is <hi>swift</hi> without respite, aud of <hi>long</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, both which, as I have already shew'd, are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastful to him; but the greatest <hi>Inconvenience</hi> that happens to a Horse in this Chase is this; that when a <hi>Fox</hi> is <hi>unkennel'd,</hi> he seldom or never betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a <hi>champion</hi> Countrey, but remains in the strongest <hi>Coverts,</hi> and in the thickest <hi>Woods</hi>; so that a Horse can but <hi>seldom</hi> enjoy the pleasure of <hi>accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi> the <hi>Hounds,</hi> without hazarding being <hi>stubb'd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> or other as <hi>dangerous</hi> Accidents. The fittest Horses for this Chase are Horses of great <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>ability,</hi> since this Chase begins at <hi>Christmas,</hi> which is the <hi>worst</hi> time of Riding, and ends at our <hi>Lady-day,</hi> when the Ground is <hi>best</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>next</hi> Chase to be spoken of is the <hi>Otters,</hi> which although it may seem <hi>delightful</hi> to some, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any means think it <hi>convenient</hi> for a Horse: for he that will truly pursue this <hi>Amphibious</hi> sport, must <hi>often swim</hi> his Horse to the equal <hi>hazard</hi> both of the <hi>Rider</hi> and the <hi>Horse.</hi>

               <p>But to conclude with the <hi>last,</hi> and the <hi>best</hi> of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and that is the <hi>Hare.</hi> It is in my opinion the most <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>delightful</hi> Chase of any whatsoever, and the most <hi>beneficial</hi> for training a <hi>young</hi> Horse. It


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62532:29"/>
is <hi>swift,</hi> and of some <hi>indurance,</hi> like that of the <hi>Fox,</hi> but far more <hi>pleasant</hi> to the Horse, because <hi>Hares</hi> commonly run the <hi>Champion</hi> Country; and the <hi>scent</hi> not being so <hi>hot</hi> as the Foxes, the <hi>Dogs</hi> are <hi>oftner</hi> at <hi>default,</hi> and by that means the Horse has many <hi>Sobbs,</hi> whereby he recovers <hi>Wind,</hi> and regains new <hi>strength.</hi> This Chase begins at <hi>Michaelmass,</hi> and lasts till the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>February</hi>

               <p>Now the <hi>best Dogs,</hi> to bring your Horse to <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of Wind and Speed, are your <hi>fleet Northern</hi> Hounds; for they, by means of their <hi>hard-running,</hi> will draw him up to that extraordinary <hi>speed,</hi> that he will not have time to <hi>loiter,</hi> and by continual pra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctice will be so <hi>inur'd</hi> and <hi>habituated</hi> to the violence of their Speed, that in a short time he will be able to ride on <hi>all sorts</hi> of <hi>Ground,</hi> and be at such <hi>command</hi> upon the <hi>hand,</hi> that he will <hi>strike</hi> at what <hi>rate</hi> you please, and <hi>three-quarters speed</hi> will be less trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to him than a <hi>Canterbury-gallop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have often thought this one of the <hi>Reasons</hi> why your <hi>Northern Breeders</hi> for the generality <hi>excel</hi> those of the <hi>South</hi>; since certainly the <hi>speed</hi> of their <hi>Hounds</hi> contributes much to the Excellence of their <hi>Horses,</hi> and makes them endure a four mile Course without <hi>Sobbs,</hi> which some Horsemen call <hi>Whole-Running</hi>: but of this more in another place.</p>
               <p>The time being now come that he may be <hi>hunted,</hi> you shall order him on his days of <hi>Rest</hi> in <hi>all points,</hi> as to his <hi>Dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of clean old <hi>Beans</hi> spelted on a Mill, and as an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus to allow him <hi>Bread</hi> made after this manner.</p>
               <p>Take four Pecks of clean old <hi>Beans,</hi> and two Pecks of <hi>Wheat,</hi> and <hi>grind</hi> them together, and <hi>sift</hi> the <hi>meal</hi> thro a Meal-sieve of an indifferent fineness, and <hi>knead</hi> it with <hi>warm water</hi> and good store of <hi>Barm,</hi> and let it lie an hour or more to <hi>swell,</hi> for by that means the Bread will be the <hi>lighter,</hi> and have the easier and quicker <hi>Digestion</hi>; after which being with a <hi>Brake</hi> or any other way exceedingly <hi>well-kneaded,</hi> make it up into great Houshold <hi>Peck-loaves,</hi> which will be a means to avoid <hi>Crust,</hi> and prevent its <hi>drying</hi> too soon; <hi>bake</hi> them <hi>thoroughly,</hi> and let them <hi>stand</hi> a good while in the <hi>Oven</hi> to <hi>soke,</hi> then <hi>draw</hi> them, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>bottoms</hi> upwards let them stand to cool.</p>
               <p>When your <hi>Bread</hi> is a <hi>day old</hi> you may venture to feed your Horse with it, having first <hi>chipt</hi> away the <hi>Crust</hi>; and sometimes giving him <hi>Bread,</hi> sometimes <hi>Oats,</hi> and now and then <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>spelted Beans,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you find his stomach; you need not <hi>fear</hi> but such Feeding will bring him into as good <hi>condition</hi> as you need desire for <hi>Ordinary Hunting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When your <hi>Bread</hi> is prepar'd, and you <hi>first Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night</hi> expir'd, you must then pitch upon a Day for his first <hi>going abroad</hi> after the <hi>Dogs,</hi> and the <hi>Day before</hi> you <hi>hunt</hi> you must always <hi>order him</hi> after this <hi>manner.</hi> In the morning proceed in your <hi>usual method</hi> as before, only <hi>observe</hi> that day to give him no <hi>Beans,</hi> because they are hard of digestion, but give most of <hi>Bread</hi> if you can draw him on to eat it, because it is more <hi>nourishing</hi> than <hi>Oats</hi>; and after your <hi>Evening Watering,</hi> which ought to be somewhat <hi>earlier</hi> than at other times, give him onely a little <hi>Hay</hi> out of your hand, and no

               <head>CHAP. VII. Of making a Hunting-Match, its advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and disadvantages.</head>
               <p>SInce many <hi>Persons of Honour</hi> delight in good Horses, both for <hi>Hunters</hi> as well as <hi>Gallopers,</hi> it may not be improper to speak a word in this place concerning the <hi>Advantages</hi> or <hi>Disadvantages</hi> which happen in making of <hi>Hunting-Matches</hi>; since he that proceeds cautiously and upon true grounds in <hi>match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> his Horse is already in a great measure sure of gaining the Prize, at least if the Proverb be true, that <hi>a Match well made is half won.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> thing to be <hi>consider'd</hi> by him that designs to <hi>match</hi> his Horse, for his own <hi>advantage</hi> and his Horses <hi>credit,</hi> is this; That he do not <hi>flatter</hi> himself in the opinion of his Horse, by <hi>fancying</hi> that he is swifter than the <hi>wind,</hi> when he is but a <hi>slow Galloper</hi>; and that he is <hi>whole-running,</hi> (that is, will run <hi>four miles</hi> without a <hi>sobb</hi> at the <hi>height</hi> of his <hi>speed</hi>) when he is not able to run a <hi>mile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the ground of this Error I suppose arises from a Gentleman's being mistaken in the <hi>speed</hi> of his <hi>Hounds,</hi> who for want of <hi>Tryal</hi> against other <hi>Dogs</hi> that have been really <hi>fleet,</hi> has suppos'd his own to be <hi>swift,</hi> when in reality they were but of <hi>middle speed</hi>; and because his Horse (when trained) was able to follow them <hi>all day,</hi> and at any hour to <hi>command</hi> them upon <hi>deep</hi> as well as <hi>light</hi> Earths, has therefore


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62532:37"/>
falsly concluded him to be <hi>swift</hi> as the <hi>best</hi>; but upon tryal against a Horse that has been <hi>rightly</hi> train'd after Hounds that were <hi>truly fleet,</hi> has to his <hi>cost</hi> bought his <hi>Experience,</hi> and been convinc'd of his <hi>Error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore I would perswade all <hi>Lovers</hi> of <hi>Hunters</hi> to get two or three Couple of <hi>try'd Hounds,</hi> and <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice</hi> a week to follow after them a <hi>Train-scent</hi>; and when he is able to <hi>top</hi> them on all <hi>sorts</hi> of <hi>Earth,</hi> and to endure <hi>Heats</hi> and <hi>Colds</hi> stoutly, then he may the better re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ie on his <hi>Speed</hi> and <hi>Toughness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Horse which is able to ride a <hi>Hare-chase</hi> of five or six miles briskly, and with good courage, till his <hi>body</hi> be as it were bath'd in <hi>sweat</hi>; and then upon the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>Hare,</hi> in a nipping <hi>frosty</hi> morning can endure to <hi>stand still,</hi> till the <hi>sweat</hi> be <hi>frozen</hi> on his <hi>back,</hi> so that the <hi>cold</hi> may <hi>pierce</hi> him as well as the <hi>heat</hi>; and then even in that extremity of Cold to ride another <hi>Chase,</hi> as <hi>briskly</hi> and with as much <hi>cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,</hi> as he did in the <hi>former</hi>: That Horse which can thus endure <hi>heats</hi> and <hi>colds</hi> oftenest is of most <hi>value</hi> amongst <hi>Sports-men.</hi> And indeed tis not every Horse that is able to endure such extraordinary <hi>Toyl</hi>; and I my self have seen very <hi>brave</hi> Horses to the <hi>Eye,</hi> that have rid the <hi>first Chase</hi> to admiration, that when the <hi>Cold</hi> had struck to them, and they began to grow <hi>stiff,</hi> have <hi>flagg'd</hi> the <hi>second,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore to make a judgment of the goodness of your own Horse, observe him after the <hi>death</hi> of the first <hi>Hare,</hi> if the <hi>Chase</hi> has been any thing <hi>brisk</hi>: if when he is <hi>cold,</hi> he <hi>shrinks</hi> up his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>draws</hi> his <hi>Legs</hi> up together, tis an infallible token of <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Courage</hi>; and the same you may collect from the <hi>slackning</hi> of his <hi>Girths</hi> after the first Chase, and from

                  </gap> and therefore there is no <hi>reliance</hi> on such a Horse, in case of a <hi>Wager.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if on the <hi>contrary,</hi> you are Master of a Horse (not only in your own <hi>judgment,</hi> but in the <hi>opinion</hi> of <hi>knowing</hi> Horsemen) that is <hi>approv'd</hi> for <hi>Speed,</hi> and <hi>Toughness,</hi> and you are desirous to <hi>match</hi> him, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to <hi>run</hi> for a <hi>Plate</hi>; I will to the best of my power tell you the <hi>advantages</hi> that are to be <hi>gain'd</hi> in <hi>Matching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before I enter upon the <hi>subject</hi> propos'd, I think it convenient to tell you the way our <hi>Ancestors</hi> had of making their <hi>Matches,</hi> and our <hi>modern</hi> way of deciding <hi>Wagers.</hi> First then the <hi>old way</hi> of Tryal was by running so many <hi>Train-scents</hi> after Hounds, as was agreed on between the <hi>

               <p>The <hi>Wildgoose Chase</hi> received its <hi>Name</hi> from the manner of the <hi>flight</hi> which is made by <hi>Wildgeese,</hi> which is generally <hi>one after another</hi>: so the two Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses after the running of Twelvescore <hi>Yards,</hi> had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which Horse soever could get the <hi>leading,</hi> to <hi>ride</hi> what <hi>ground</hi> he pleas'd; the <hi>hindmost</hi> Horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound to <hi>follow</hi> him, within a certain <hi>distance</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on by Articles, or else to be <hi>whipt</hi> up by the <hi>Triers</hi> or <hi>Iudges</hi> which rode by, and which ever Horse could <hi>distance</hi> the other won the <hi>Match.</hi>

               <p>The best way to <hi>Match</hi> such a Horse is to agree to run <hi>Train-scents</hi> and the fewer the <hi>better</hi> for you, before you come to the <hi>Course</hi>: Also in these <hi>Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scents</hi> the <hi>shorter</hi> you make your <hi>distance</hi> the <hi>better</hi>: and above all things be sure agree to have the leading of the first <hi>Trayn,</hi> and then making choice of such grounds as your Horse may best shew his <hi>Speed,</hi> and the <hi>Fleetest Doggs</hi> you can procure, give your <hi>Hounds</hi> as much <hi>Law</hi> before you, as your <hi>Tryers</hi> will allow, and then making a loose try to win the <hi>Match</hi> with a <hi>Wind</hi>; but if you faile in this attempt then <hi>Beare</hi> your Horse, and save him for the <hi>Course</hi> at last.</p>
               <p>But if your Horse be <hi>slow,</hi> yet <hi>well Winded,</hi> and a <hi>true Spurr'd Nagg</hi>; then the more <hi>Trainscents</hi> you run before you come to run the <hi>straight Course</hi> the better.

               <p>One material <hi>Advise</hi> I had like to have forgot and that is this; be sure at no time give <hi>advantage</hi> of <hi>Weight,</hi> for you will find the <hi>inconvenience</hi> of it at the latter <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Day:</hi> for tho a Horse <hi>feel</hi> it not when he is <hi>fresh,</hi> yet it will <hi>sink</hi> him very much when he grows <hi>weak</hi>: a <hi>Horse-length</hi> lost by odds of <hi>Weight</hi> in the first <hi>Train,</hi> may prove a <hi>distance</hi> in the streight <hi>Course</hi> at <hi>last</hi>; for the <hi>Weight</hi> is the same every <hi>Heat</hi> tho his <hi>strength</hi> be not.</p>
               <p>But if on the other side you gain any advantage of <hi>Weight,</hi> article that the <hi>Horseman</hi> shall ride so much <hi>weight</hi> as you are agreed on, <hi>besides</hi> the <hi>Saddle,</hi> for by this means the <hi>Rider</hi> (if he be not weight of

               <p>Now as to the time that you take for dyeting, that must be according to the <hi>Nature</hi> of your Horse, and the present <hi>state</hi> of Body he is in; for tho he may be clean enough for ordinary <hi>Hunting,</hi> yet he may be far distant from that perfect State of Body, that is required in a <hi>Match,</hi> and to keep him in such strict <hi>Dyet</hi> all the <hi>Season,</hi> (except on such extraordinary Occasions) would be an <hi>unnecessary</hi> Expence.</p>
               <p>As to your Horses <hi>Disposition</hi> for <hi>Running,</hi> you must know it by use and <hi>Observation,</hi> for in this Point Horses very much differ, for some run best when they are <hi>high</hi> in <hi>case,</hi> others when they are in <hi>middle Condition</hi> of <hi>Flesh,</hi> and some again when they appear to the Eye <hi>Poor,</hi> and <hi>Low</hi> in Flesh; there fore according to your Horses <hi>Nature,</hi> and the time required to bring him into his <hi>best State,</hi> you must order your day for the tryal of your <hi>Match</hi> to be.</p>

               <p>And now whilst I am discoursing of <hi>Horsebread,</hi> I cannot be <hi>condemn</hi> another <hi>curiosity</hi> in some <hi>Feeders,</hi> who think, by dressing their <hi>Meal</hi> to the utmost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Fineness</hi> they do <hi>wonders,</hi> and that such <hi>pure Food</hi> must of necessity bring him to the <hi>greatest perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> imaginable both of Body and Wind.</p>

               <p>As to the manner of it, if your Horse be ingag'd in a <hi>Hunting-match,</hi> you shall <hi>sweat</hi> him twice this week, but not by <hi>hunting</hi> him after the <hi>Hare,</hi> as formerly, but by <hi>Train-scents,</hi> since the <hi>former</hi> on this Occasion may prove <hi>deceitful</hi>; for tho the <hi>Hounds</hi> be very <hi>swift,</hi> yet the <hi>Scent</hi> being <hi>cold</hi> the <hi>Dogs</hi> will often be at <hi>fault,</hi> and by that means the Horse will have many <hi>Sobs,</hi> so that when he comes to run <hi>Train-scents</hi> in earnest your Horse will look for <hi>ease,</hi> his <hi>Wind</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not so perfect as in Art it ought to be.</p>

then you may put him to his <hi>whole Task</hi> the oftner, according as you find him in condition; only observe that you are not to <hi>strain</hi> him for <hi>Ten daies</hi> at least before he <hi>ride</hi> his <hi>Match,</hi> that he may be led into the <hi>Field</hi> in perfect <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>vigour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you intend him for a <hi>Plate,</hi> let him take his <hi>Heats</hi> according to this <hi>Direction,</hi> only let it be on the <hi>Place,</hi> that he may be <hi>acquainted</hi> with the <hi>Ground</hi>; and as for the <hi>Hounds</hi> you may <hi>omit</hi> them, as not being <hi>ty'd</hi> to their <hi>speed,</hi> but that of your <hi>Adversaries</hi> Horse's.

And here too the same <hi>Rule</hi> must be <hi>observed,</hi> not to give your Horse a <hi>Bloody heat</hi> for <hi>Ten daies</hi> or a <hi>Fortnight</hi> before the <hi>Plate</hi> be to be run for: And let his <hi>last be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But now that I am speaking of <hi>sweating,</hi> it may be expected that I should lay down some <hi>Rules</hi> how to order a Horse that is in <hi>keeping</hi> for a <hi>Match</hi> in <hi>Frosty weather,</hi> or in case he be an <hi>old strain'd Horse,</hi> so that you dare not <hi>heat</hi> him in <hi>hard weather,</hi> for fear of <hi>Lameing</hi> him a fresh.</p>
               <p>In these cases some Horsemen have practic'd <hi>sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> their Horse in the <hi>House,</hi> by laying on him multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of <hi>Cloathes,</hi> being first made <hi>hot</hi> at the Fire; which is the most <hi>unnatural</hi> way of <hi>sweating</hi> a Horse

that can be, since 'tis <hi>provok'd</hi> by heat arising from the <hi>outward parts,</hi> and is too <hi>violent,</hi> the extreamity of the <hi>heat</hi> joyn'd to the <hi>weight</hi> of the <hi>Cloathes,</hi> not only <hi>weakning,</hi> but almost <hi>smothering</hi> him.</p>
               <p>The next way in use, is to give him his Heat <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>road,</hi> as I just now mention'd in his <hi>Cloathes,</hi> but this too is not so <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>kindly,</hi> as without his Cloathes, since here too the <hi>heat</hi> is augmented from <hi>without,</hi> and consequently abates his <hi>strength</hi> the more, and yet doth not altogether so well improve his Wind.</p>
               <p>Therefore if either you have a Horse that has been <hi>strain'd,</hi> or otherwise the <hi>weather</hi> be <hi>unseasonable,</hi> find out some <hi>dead Iog,</hi> or <hi>sandy way,</hi> though of but <hi>half</hi> a <hi>Miles</hi> length, and there <hi>breath</hi> your horse till he <hi>sweat</hi> as you would have him. I remember to have heard of a <hi>Gentleman</hi> having <hi>match'd</hi> his horse for a very <hi>considerable summ</hi>; and the weather proving <hi>hard,</hi> took this <hi>course</hi> to keep his horse in <hi>breath</hi>; he caused <hi>Straw,</hi> and <hi>foul Litter</hi> to be <hi>spread</hi> all along <hi>round</hi> an adjoyning <hi>Close,</hi> and every <hi>morning</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnats <hi>shook</hi> it up and <hi>turn'd</hi> it, to keep it <hi>hollow</hi> and <hi>soft,</hi> and then the Horse was had forth to <hi>gallop</hi> on it after his Water, and by this meanes kept his Horse in <hi>tollerable</hi> Wind.</p>
               <p>Now during this <hi>Month</hi> both on his <hi>Resting-daies,</hi> and after his <hi>sweats</hi> on <hi>Heating-daies,</hi> you are to observe the same <hi>Rules</hi> which you were taught in the <hi>first week</hi> of your <hi>Third Fortnights</hi> Keeping; only you are to omit all <hi>scourings,</hi> but <hi>Rye-bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THere are several <hi>Observations</hi> to be made by you during your <hi>Dieting</hi> your Horse, which if you <hi>miscarry</hi> in, may be the <hi>loss</hi> of your <hi>Match,</hi> or your <hi>share</hi> in the <hi>Plate.</hi> Therefore, that you may know how to proceed <hi>regularly</hi> in this <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>First then you are to observe his <hi>Chaule,</hi> his <hi>Ribs,</hi> and his <hi>Flank,</hi> according to the Rules formerly laid down; for if he be <hi>clean within,</hi> he will also be <hi>clean there</hi>; but yet he may feel clean <hi>there,</hi> when he is not clean <hi>within</hi>; and therefore those <hi>Grooms</hi> are very <hi>conceited,</hi> who upon their <hi>first view</hi> of a Horse and <hi>handling</hi> of his <hi>Flank,</hi> pronounce him to be in a <hi>true state</hi> of Body; for gentle <hi>Airing,</hi> warm <hi>Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> scanty <hi>Feeding,</hi> may <hi>disperse</hi> the gross <hi>Fat</hi> and <hi>Glut,</hi> and drive it from the <hi>outward</hi> parts, so that he may <hi>appear</hi> clean, when in reality he is <hi>not</hi> so: and therefore you are only a <hi>competent Iudg,</hi> who know how he was cleansed.</p>
               <p>Therefore you are to observe, first, whether in <hi>all points</hi> you have proceeded according to <hi>Art</hi> in his <hi>Training</hi>; as whether he performs his <hi>Heats</hi> with <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor</hi> aud true <hi>courage,</hi> whether he have been all along <hi>home-fed,</hi> whether you have not suffer'd <hi>pursi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>strength</hi> by <hi>too much.</hi> These things are the very <hi>grounds</hi> of <hi>Keeping,</hi> and therefore ought to be <hi>scan'd</hi> and <hi>consider'd</hi> with <hi>judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next you are to observe his manner of <hi>Feeding,</hi> as whether he holds his <hi>Appetite</hi> or no; and observe what sort of <hi>Food</hi> he likes <hi>best,</hi> and of that give him <hi>oftenest</hi>; and in case his <hi>stomach</hi> abate, keep him out <hi>longer</hi> Morning and Night, at his <hi>airings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner you must observe his <hi>Dung,</hi> which tho it be as fallacious oftentimes as a <hi>Sick-man</hi>'s <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> it being liable to <hi>alteration</hi> on the <hi>change</hi> of <hi>Dyet,</hi> or being <hi>influenc'd</hi> by the <hi>air,</hi> yet being <hi>clean</hi> and in <hi>health</hi> it will usually be a <hi>pale yellow</hi> colour, and be voided in <hi>round Pellets</hi>; but if it be <hi>loose,</hi> and <hi>soft,</hi> it is an <hi>infallible</hi> sign of <hi>weakness,</hi> and therefore must by <hi>good Feeding</hi> be remedied as soon as possible. But if it be <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>dry,</hi> so that he cannot dung but with <hi>difficulty</hi> and <hi>straining,</hi> then you must endeavour to <hi>relieve</hi> Nature, but not with <hi>scowrings,</hi> which would <hi>weaken</hi> too much, but rather chuse to give him this <hi>Glister,</hi> which will both cool and refresh him.</p>
               <p>Take a Quart of <hi>Whey,</hi> of Syrrup of <hi>Violets,</hi> and <hi>Pulpe</hi> of <hi>Cassia,</hi> of each Four Ounces and of <hi>Manna</hi> half an Ounce; this will <hi>Purge</hi> him gently, and is most excellent to <hi>cool</hi> his Bowels.</p>
               <p>The next thing to be considered is <hi>Lamness,</hi> which if it proceed from <hi>old strains</hi> you must make use of this <hi>Oyntment,</hi> which I have several times experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with good <hi>success.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. X. Of riding a Hunting-Match, or Heats for a Plate, and the Advantages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to each.</head>
               <p>I Have endeavoured to shew the Necessity and the Manner of <hi>Training</hi> and <hi>Dieting</hi> Horses, but this alone is not sufficient to the <hi>winning</hi> of either <hi>Match</hi> or <hi>Plate</hi> without a <hi>knowing</hi> and an <hi>honest Rider,</hi> and a <hi>skilful Iudge</hi> or <hi>Tryer</hi> be joyn'd thereto; but since no man is sitter to <hi>ride</hi> the Horse than he that has the <hi>training</hi> of him, I shall lay down some <hi>general Rules</hi> how to <hi>ride</hi> to the best Advantage either a <hi>Hunting-Match,</hi> or three <hi>Heats</hi> and a <hi>Course</hi> for a Plate.</p>
               <p>The first Requisite in a <hi>Rider,</hi> next to <hi>faithfulness</hi> in his <hi>Trust,</hi> is to have a good <hi>close Seat,</hi> his <hi>Knees</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held firm to his <hi>Saddle-skirts,</hi> his <hi>Toes</hi> turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>p</hi>; observing during all the Tryal throughout to sit <hi>firm</hi> in his <hi>Saddle,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>waving,</hi> or <hi>standing up</hi> in his <hi>Stirrops,</hi> which very much <hi>incommodes</hi> the Horse, notwithstanding the conceited Opinion of some <hi>Iockeys</hi> that it is a <hi>becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Seat.</p>
               <p>When you <hi>spur</hi> your Horse, <hi>strike</hi> him not hard with the <hi>Calves</hi> of your Legs, as if you would


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62532:48"/>
beat the wind out of his body, bust just turn your Toes <hi>outwards,</hi> and bring the Spurs <hi>quick</hi> to his sides; and such a <hi>sharp stroke</hi> will be more serviceable to the <hi>quickning</hi> of your Horse, and sooner <hi>draw blood.</hi> Be sure not to <hi>spur</hi> yonr Horse but when there is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and avoid spurring him under the <hi>fore-bowels,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his <hi>Shoulders,</hi> and his <hi>Girths</hi> near the <hi>Heart</hi> (which is the tend'rest place) till the last <hi>Extremity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you <hi>whip</hi> your Horse let it be over the <hi>shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> on the <hi>near</hi> side, except upon <hi>hard running,</hi> and when you are <hi>at all</hi>; then be sure with a <hi>strong jerk</hi> to strike your Horse in the <hi>Flank,</hi> for there the <hi>skin</hi> is <hi>tender'st,</hi> and most <hi>sensible</hi> of the <hi>Lash</hi>

                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>Observe when you <hi>whip</hi> or <hi>spur</hi> your Horse, and that you are certain he is at the <hi>top</hi> of his <hi>speed,</hi> if then he clap his <hi>Ears</hi> in his <hi>Pole,</hi> or <hi>whisk</hi> his <hi>Tail,</hi> be sure that you <hi>bear him hard,</hi> and give him as much <hi>comfort</hi> as ever you can, by <hi>sawing</hi> his <hi>Snaffle to</hi> and <hi>fro</hi> in his Mouth, and by that means <hi>forcing</hi> him to <hi>open</hi> his <hi>Mouth,</hi> which will <hi>comfort</hi> him, and give him <hi>wind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be any <hi>high wind</hi> stirring when you <hi>ride,</hi> observe if it be in your <hi>Face</hi> to let your Adversary <hi>lead,</hi> and to hold hard <hi>behind</hi> him till you see your opportunity of giving a <hi>Loose</hi>; yet you must observe to ride so <hi>close</hi> to him, that his Horse may <hi>break</hi> the <hi>Wind</hi> from yours, and that you by <hi>stooping</hi> low in your <hi>Seat</hi> may <hi>shelter</hi> your self under him, which will assist the strength of your Horse. But if the <hi>Wind</hi> be in your <hi>Back,</hi> ride <hi>exactly</hi> behind him, that your Horse may alone enjoy the benefit of the <hi>Wind,</hi> by being as it were <hi>blown forward,</hi> and by breaking it from him as much as you can possible.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:62532:48"/>Next observe what <hi>Ground</hi> your Horse <hi>delights</hi> to <hi>run</hi> best on, <hi>bearing</hi> your Horse (as much as your Adversary will give you leave) on <hi>level Carpet-ground,</hi> because your Horse naturally will be desirous to <hi>spend</hi> himself more <hi>freely</hi> thereon. But on <hi>deep Earths</hi> &amp;c. give him more <hi>liberty,</hi> because he will naturally <hi>favour</hi> himself thereupon. Be sure, if you are to run <hi>up hill,</hi> to <hi>favour</hi> your Horse and <hi>bear him,</hi> for fear of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him out of wind; but <hi>down hill,</hi> (if your Horses <hi>Feet</hi> and <hi>Shoulders</hi> will endure it, and you dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your own <hi>Neck</hi>) always give him a <hi>Loose.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Only take this for a <hi>general</hi> Rule, that if you find your Horse to have the <hi>Heels</hi> of the other, that then you be careful to <hi>preserve</hi> his Speed till the last <hi>Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,</hi> if you are not to run a straight <hi>Course,</hi> but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> so, then till the <hi>Course,</hi> &amp; so to husband it then too, that you may be able to <hi>make a Push for it</hi> at the last <hi>Post.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next you are to observe the nature of your <hi>Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites</hi> Horse, and if he be <hi>fiery,</hi> then to run just <hi>behind,</hi> or just <hi>cheek by joul,</hi> and with your <hi>Whip</hi> make as much noise as you can, that you may force him on <hi>faster</hi> then his Rider would have him, and by that means <hi>Spend him</hi> the sooner. Or else keep just <hi>before</hi> him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a <hi>slow Gallop,</hi> that he may either <hi>over reach</hi> or by treading on your Horses <hi>Heels</hi> (if he will not take the <hi>leading</hi>) endanger falling over.</p>
               <p>Observe on what ground the <hi>contrary</hi> Horse runs <hi>worst</hi> and on that <hi>Earth</hi> be sure to give a <hi>loose</hi> that your <hi>Adversaries</hi> being forced to <hi>follow</hi> you, may haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard <hi>stumbling,</hi> or <hi>clapping</hi> on the <hi>back Sinnws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Observe likewise in your <hi>Riding</hi> the several <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>Corrections</hi> of the <hi>Hand</hi> the <hi>Whip</hi> and the <hi>Spur,</hi> and <hi>when</hi> and how <hi>oft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

clapping down</hi> his <hi>Ears, holding</hi> out his <hi>Nose</hi> like a <hi>Pig &amp;c.</hi> you may then take it for granted that he is at the top of what he can do; therefore in this case observe how your <hi>own</hi> rides, and if he run <hi>cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> and <hi>strongly</hi> without <hi>Spurring,</hi> then be sure keep your <hi>Adversary</hi> to the same <hi>speed</hi> without giving him <hi>ease</hi> and by that means you will quickly bring him to <hi>give out,</hi> or else <hi>distance</hi> him.</p>
               <p>Observe at the <hi>End</hi> of every <hi>Train-sent</hi> what <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> the other Horse is in; and how he <hi>holds</hi> out in his <hi>Labour</hi>; which you may be able to give a <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of by his <hi>Looks,</hi> the <hi>Working</hi> of his <hi>Flank,</hi> and the <hi>slackness</hi> of his <hi>Girths.</hi> For if h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If his <hi>Wind</hi> fail him, then his <hi>Body</hi> will grow <hi>thin</hi> and appear <hi>tuckt up,</hi> which will make his <hi>Girths</hi> appear <hi>slack</hi> to the Eye. And therefore take this for a <hi>Rule</hi> that there is no <hi>greater</hi> Sign of <hi>Weakness</hi> then this which I have last <hi>mentioned</hi>; so that if your <hi>Adversaries</hi> Horse want <hi>girting</hi> after the <hi>first Scent,</hi> provided he were <hi>close-girt</hi> at his first <hi>starting,</hi> you need not much <hi>dispair</hi> of <hi>winning</hi> your Wager.</p>
               <p>When each <hi>Train-scent</hi> is ended (and so likewise after every <hi>Heat</hi> for a Plate) you must have <hi>dry</hi> Straw, and <hi>dry</hi> Cloaths both <hi>Linnen</hi> and <hi>Woollen</hi> which have been <hi>steep'd</hi> in <hi>Vrine</hi> and <hi>Salt-Peter</hi> a day, or two, and then dryed in the <hi>Sun</hi>; and likewise one, or two of each which have been so <hi>steeped,</hi> must be brought <hi>wet</hi> into the <hi>Field</hi>; and after the <hi>Train</hi> is ended you must have two or three <hi>Hel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
