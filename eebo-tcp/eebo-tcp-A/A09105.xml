            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of enuy could neuer after be cured, eyther by the holsome medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine

suffer themselues to be corrupted with the same poyson, and bytings

hate others for any true fault, which they see in them, but rather for
their good parts, vertues and gifts of God, and so being ashamed to
vtter the true causes in deed of their auersion, they pretend other idle

            <p>Thus wryteth that blessed man, and how fully this falleth out in
our affayre, where Gods holy gyfts and vertues themselues are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyed
at, by them that wil not immitate the same, is easy to discerne.
And if no other proof were extant, yet their owne books set forth in
such number and with such passion to discredit their aduersaryes are
sufficient witnesses, wherin they set downe so many high prayses gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by other men to their said aduersaryes, as albeit the partyes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
do nether chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge nor acknowledge them, yet is it euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that
the enuy of these and other like prayses hath put these mens mynds
quite out of ioynt. Neyther remayneth there any way (as it seemeth)
for the enuyed in this case to discharge them<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues of this raging tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
raysed against them, but eyther to chaunge their laudable course
of lyfe, wherby they haue gotten that esteeme which these men enuy
at: (&amp; this is not tolerable) or for these men to alter their iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
and se their owne follyes and passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s herin, which we shal endeauour
to lay before them in this our treatese, and that out of their owne
bookes and wrytings.</p>
            <p>And albeit we had fully purposed (as before is sayd) to wryte no
more about this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yer seing so many libels to come our daylie
so false and slaunderous, &amp; so pernicious, not only to Christian vnity
but also to the integrity of Catholike faith &amp; verity, and those vnder
the names of priests, the very honor of priesthood it selfe hath forced
vs to take pen in hand againe (contrary to our former determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)
therby to wipe away (if it be possible) some part of that notorious
discredit, and slaunder which iustly otherwise may fal vpon our whole
order if such intemperate proceedings published in priests names,
should passe vncontrouled by all kynd of priests.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, our entent in this treatese is, to shew that eyther these
<pb facs="tcp:20479:4"/>
infamous libels set forth in priests names are not indeed of priests, but
of some other that play their parts, or if they come from priests in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
then must we needs runne, in this matter, to the words of our
Sauiour touching <hi>sal infatuatum</hi> infatuated priests,<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> such as haue lost not
only all sauour of priestly wisdome,<note place="margin">Luc. 14.</note> and shining light of true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
but all true spirit also of Christian priests and priesthood,
which we shal declare by diuers proofes and considerations, take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out
of their owne books, for which cause we haue intituled this treatese.
<hi>A manifestation of the great folly and bad spirit of some in England that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
secular priestes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luc. 11.</note> Wherunto we were induced the rather as wel by
those words of S. Paul. alleadged in our first page, <hi>insipientia corum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesta
erit omnibus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> their folly shalbe made manifest to all (speaking of
such as made diuision) as also by that dreadful parable of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
concerning the wicked vncleane spirit, that leauing men for a
tyme, and finding no rest abroad returned, and perceauing the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
left by him to be wel cleansed, but not wel fenced, entred
againe with seauen worse spirits then himself, and so made the
ending of those men worse then their beginning.</p>
            <p>It were ouer long, and exceeding the measure of a preface, to set
downe heer, the interpretations and godly considerations of old
ancient Saints about this parable of our Sauiour, especially seing that
for so much as appertayneth to this our affayre, it is not hard for any
man to see the coherence and application therof for that when these
libellers were first made priests (if they be priests) and took that
most sacred order of cleargy vpon them, wherby they weare adopted
into the peculiar choise and seuered portion of almighty God (for so
much importeth Cleargie) they did not only renounce the spirit of
Sathan in general, as men do in baptisme by those words: <hi>ab renuncio
diabolo &amp; omnibus operibus eius, &amp;c.</hi> but particularly also the prophane &amp;
secular spirit of the world, and all corruption and vncleanesse therof
appertayning to libetty of the flesh, by their strait obligation of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity
deuotion &amp; piety annexed to that holy calling aboue other men,
which prophane and vncleane spirit being once excluded, by the
holy character and vnction of priesthood, and the house made cleane
by the broome of holy pennance, adorned also with graces and gyfts
of the holy Ghost, if after the same spirit returne agayne, and fynd
the guard and defence therof weake by negligence of the keeper, or
the dores broken open by the violence of passions (as in our case,
alas, it seemeth to stand) he presumeth (saith our Sauiour) not only to
enter agayne himself, but to take bad company also with him, to wit
<pb facs="tcp:20479:4"/>
seauen other spirits <hi>nequiores se,</hi> more wicked then himself, that is to
say more spiritual malitious, more couert and hidden, more obstinate
and self willed, more opposite to charity, and more like to the diuel
himself, that is a meer spirit, and the head patron and fountayne of
all wicked wilful spirits.</p>
            <p>For albeit the grosse spirit of wordly sensualitie be a foule and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
spirit (especially in a priest) and be also from the diuel, yet as
<hi>Cassianus</hi> in the former place doth note, and all other Fathers do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
in like manner, it is no way so dangerous or wicked as are the
spirits of more spiritual sinnes, to witt enuy, pride, ambition, hatred,
reuenge &amp; other like, which are so counterset and couered poysons,
as often tymes they are not knowne nor held for vices, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
neyther cured nor cared for; nay they passe for vertues, &amp; so
are often tymes taken by the possessors themselues, as for example;
enuy for zeale in Gods cause, pride for corage, ambition for desyre
of ability to do much good, and so in the rest; wherby it cometh to
passe that he whose house is possessed with these most pernicious
guests doth think himself wel furnished, and in good case, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
neyther endeauoreth to expel them out, nor confesseth his
fault or negligence therin, nor seeketh remedy by the holy refuge of
pennance, good counsel or other spiritual helpes, and herby cometh
it to passe that which our Sauiour saith: <hi>fiunt nouissim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

spirit, to a proud, turbulent, ireful, impudent or contemptuous
behauiour towards their brethren or equals, and much more to their
betters and superiors. And this shalbe sufficient by way of Preface.

it seemeth impossible that his Hol.<note place="margin">His Hol. se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Breue 17. Ang. 1601</note> would haue answered so

say had byn true (as we shal shew after the most points to be

rule of sinister interpretation, what man is there liuing that

               <p>But that which, most of all layeth open the folly of this

Canons of the Church and Sacrament of pennance as they
professe,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> condemning for noueltyes and innouations all other
helpes to spirit and deuotion. This we say and many other
things tending to this purpose, are as cleerly to be seene in this
their owne narration (if the Reader stand attent) as they are
touched by vs breefly in our foresaid<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> Apologie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to this effect it is said of F.</hi> VVeston:<note place="margin">Vertuo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches reproche fully alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adged.</note> He tooke vpon him to
control &amp; fynd fault with this and that, as the coming into the Hal of a

aud these so grosse abuses, which his pride &amp; vanity, &amp;c. At which his
pride and vanity we greatly maruayled, &amp;c. <hi>And a little after brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
in the said fathers speech with D.</hi> Bagshaw, <hi>they report
him to say thus:</hi>

on their owne side, there is not so much as any such matter
pretented. For proofe wherof let vs heare a peece of <hi>M. Bluets</hi>

               <p>VVel then, this being the subiect and argument of this their
whole narration to declare what the one side (being farre the
greater part) laboured to haue, to wit rules order and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline

foule enormyties already comitted, and worse feared among
<pb facs="tcp:20479:10"/>
them: and then how mightely the other side (being farre the
fewer) stryued against this, and would haue no special orders,
but such as were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all men, yea to the loosest sort of
Christians in the world, nor any other peculiar help or remedy
but only the Sacrament of pennance to be vsed, when, where,
and so often as euery man pleased and no otherwayes: This,
we say being the stryfe and contention, cleare it is, on which
side vertue, holynesse and perfection stood. And albeit this
side should haue byn ouerstrict and commytted tomuch rigor
in retyring themselues from the scandalous conuersation of the
rest: Yet was their fault (as yow see) of zeale &amp; loue of vertue,
and consequently much more perdonable then the turbulent
resistance and impugnation of the other side, that stood in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of disorder, libertie and dissolution.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the first part of the argument or subiect
of this former booke intytuled: <hi>The Relation of VVisbiche:</hi> which
hauing byn handled by them with great vntruth and partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in their first books both in latyn and English as we haue
shewed in our Apologie, is brought in againe now with great
indiscretion and folly, renewing the memory of such their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
in that place as we desyred might be suppressed with
silence, and that which is worse, they discend to diuers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
which wee for modestyes sake passed ouer in general
tearmes &amp; so should they also haue done according to the rule
of prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy: for to what end haue they printed the former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint of M. South worth (so graue &amp; Reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a

omitted: the story also of pewter stolne, of <hi>Mary the maid</hi> found
in one of there cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, to what end is it published by them,
or with what wisdome or discretion? And moreouer, they do
so wisely handle these matters in their defence (as yow shal see
in the next Chapter of this booke) that they leaue things more
suspitious a great deale to the Reader then he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the

               </p>
               <p>But besides this subiect of the excesses and scandalous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
of some in <hi>VVisbich</hi> there insueth also towards the end
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20479:10"/>
of this booke another argument of farre worse nature then the
former: for which respect it may be they abstayned to make
mention therof in the title or first front of their booke, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
perhaps least all good and modest men would be auerted
with the very sight and mention therof as proceeding of an
extreme surfet of vnchristian malice.</p>
               <p>The matter is,<note place="margin">The second argument of their relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, conteyning intollerable slaunders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits.</note> that wheras in tyme of the tumultuous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of these men and their fellowes both in Rome, Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and England, many things were spoken, done, &amp; wrytten
against the fathers of the Society by their vngrateful schollers
of our nation, without all ground of truth, but only through
passion, leuity, anger, and incitation of others, as appeareth
not only by the examination of the things themselues, but by
the confessions also of the partyes that did accuse, when they
were out of passion, and by the sentence of all iudges appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in these causes (all which we haue shewed largely &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in the 3. 4. 5. and 6. Chapters of our Apologie) yet
these men knowing in their consciences,<note place="margin">Conscience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les dealing.</note> and in the sight of
all the world this to be true, and that those calumniations ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
(or the most part of them) were meerly false &amp; deuised
vpon the causes aforesaid, and denyed afterward by those that
obiected them, do notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding set them downe now againe
as points iustified or iustifiable, and haue put them also in print
for the further infamation of Iesuits, and their whole order,
which is a practise of so high and odious malice as we are
wonderfully ashamed to mention the same, (but that they
haue printed it) as coming from any of our nation, and much
more from men, of our order and function. But now lett vs
take a vew of the things themselues. The first branch or head
of this calumniation hath this tytle.</p>
               <p>An abstract of the memorial sent by certayne Englishmen out of the

               <p>And heere yow must note, that in reporting this only title,
our brethren do so behaue themselues, as yow may easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
their entention to be only to defame; for so much as
they know wel inough what Englishmen they weare that
<pb facs="tcp:20479:11"/>
deuised and cast abroad this memorial,<note place="margin">About R. Fishers me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial.</note> to wit, <hi>Robert Fisher</hi>

as hath byn shewed at large in the 7. Chapter of our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie;
where we haue set downe the examination of the said
<hi>Robert</hi> vpon his oath before his Hol. <hi>Fiscal</hi> in Rome, and how
he misliked his owne dooings therin, bewrayed the falshood,
detected his complices, and confessed all to be deuised vpon
malice and stomake, which our brethren knowing sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
by the authentical copie of the said deposition sent into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and hauing seene also the publique testimony of six very
reuerend and graue Priests Assistants to the Archpriest against
that memorial, as also the letters of many other priests which
we haue there cyted, it is strange that perturbation of mynd
should so much preuayle with our brethren, and the remorse
of conscience be so litle, as to reuiue the same now againe, and
being only in latyn before, to print it now in English to the
vew of all men. And do they not know or remember that the
publishers of infamous libels and defamations are as deeply
both in the synne it selfe, as also in Church censures; as are the
makers and wryters therof? VVho can doubt of this? But
now to the contents of the libel.</p>
               <p>The first paragraphe after many falsityes alleadged against
Iesuits,<note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 69</note> concludeth thus: <hi>They hold no doctrine Catholike and sound

not graunted by them (&amp; which is worse) they haue beate into the heads
of most, that the masse is not rightly celebrated of any, but of a Iesuite.</hi>
Thus they wryte. And do our brethren beleeue this to be true?
Againe in the fourth paragraph, besides many calumniations
they say thus:<note place="margin">Ibidem. Foolish ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>

from one place to another, but he is richly apparaylled &amp; attended on
with a great trayne of seruants, as yf he were a Baron or an Earle?</hi> Is
this true also in the consciences of our brethren? Againe in the
fifth paragraph: <hi>They neuer send one scholler out of England to the

                     </gap> to dissolue it.</hi> Is this true also? Let the President and
books of that Colledge testifie?</p>
               <p>In the seauenth paragraphe they say: <hi>VVomen also are induced
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20479:11"/>
by them to become Nunnes, &amp; to leaue such goods, as they haue, to them,
&amp;c.</hi> And is there any one example (thinke yow) to be giuen of
this? Or is it any way probable, seing that Nunnes haue such
neede of their dowries for their owne maintenance yf they
wilbe receaued into any monasteryes beyond the seas? The
eight paragraph beginneth thus: <hi>All vniuersity men, and such as
haue taken any degree in schooles, the (Iesuits) hate, despise, contemne &amp;
reproch.</hi> And is this verifiable thinke yow, or likely to be true?
Their conclusion is this. <hi>To conclude</hi> (say they) <hi>Catholikes stand
in more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

they cause priests to be apprehended by the enimy, &amp;c.</hi> The censure of
which conclusion, as also of the spirit and pious disposition
of these our brethren which do publish these things in print
and in vulgar tongues against the whole order of religious
men we remit to all good Catholiks iudgment. And so much
of this first memorial.</p>
               <p>The second and third Catalogue of slanders which they put
downe, as well against the whole Society of Iesuits, as also
against those that labour in England, are much more deceyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

shal heare and consider both the absurdity of the things obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and the open apparant malice in setting them forth to
the world, with such approbation as heere they do.</p>
               <p>For better vnderstanding wherof, we must note that these
calumniations which heere they set abroad were certayne
briefe articles collected by some of the Fathers in <hi>Rome</hi> out of
a greate masse of seditious letters, which at the making vp of
the peace and ending of the stryfes in that cytie, were partly
discouered and exhibited voluntarily vpon scruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
by those that had byn troblesome, &amp; partly found by
chance, or rather perhaps by Gods prouidence, the better to
confirme the said peace within the colledge, which letters had

it was thought best that the said Collection of Articles

the consideration of so great iniuryes offered, where they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed

VV. G. with a letter wrytten in very frendly manner, laying
downe vnto him plainly and sincerely both the iniquity of the

would gladly haue yow make vp these foule matters as clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

your credit as they haue done, and are like to doe, yf they passe
further; and yf yow would haue followed any part of your

farre in them. But a litle anger oftentymes or emulation, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation

wayes for yow to choose, the one to set your selfe to proue
these thinges that yow haue auouched of our fathers yf yow
can, or els to giue some manner of satisfaction to them, laying
the fault vpon mistaking, misinformation, or the like. But
the best satisfaction of all would be to leaue of this course of
contradiction, and to attend to peace and vnion in our nation

God and man, and none can abide now in this place to heare

out of England from their first entrance vnto that day, not
two hundred thousand crownes, but two hundred pens to be
bestowed in benifite of the said Societie, and not on English
men or the English cause, that then he was content that all
the rest obiected by the slanderers should be graunted for
true; which he confirmed by diuers examples of English

was to require the testimonyes of all the good priests in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
for reproofe therof. And to the end no man should say or
testify more then he knewe (wherof it seemeth these men haue
litle care, who affirme euery thing absolutely) he suggested
vnto them a tryple way of wryting: the one, for them that
knew all to be false (as indeed it was, and may be prooued) so
to affirme in their letters: the other for such as could not say
so much of their certayne knowledge,<note place="margin">Great mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of F. Garnet.</note> that the whole accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
was false, but only that they knew not the things to be
true, nor had themselues any such opinion or matter to accuse
the fathers of; &amp; consequently must needs suspect these things
to be false, these (we say) to wryte so much and no more: And
the third way was, that such as could not or would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedle
in the articles or matters themselues objected, yet to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20479:16"/>
testifie that they were no authors therof, nor knew any thing

               <p>Thus scrupulously,&amp; with so great modesty wrote F. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
to the priests of England for their testimonyes of only
truth in this behalfe, for which these gybers say heere now;

                  <hi>and was content to play smal game be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

souldiars, then for sacred and anoynted priests, if they were
priests that wryte this, or had so much inward light of reason
or conscience as to consider the absurdity of this base kind
of comical wryting against such men of their owne religion.
And as for the testimonyes themselues required by <hi>F. Garnet,</hi>
we would aske our people what other way could there be
taken by any honest and modest men, for their defence in so
publike an infama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as they do to the report of their fellow priests, and
Catholike brethren? did not the Apostles also do the like
when need required, and all good men after them, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>VVherfore to end this matter, we say that the good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

people so much obliged to them for their labors and other
benefits, as our men are: they haue alwayes hitherto taken
and borne the same with the greatest patience that men
could expect, and haue neuer fought any other reuenge or
satisfaction at their hands that most haue iniured th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, but
their true reconciliation and amendement, nor any further iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
of themselues then only to satisfie the bare truth
in matters obiected. And this is most apparant besides
other argumentes by the end of the forsaid Roman sedition,
where such of the troublesome as remayned after quietnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored,
were as tenderly soued cherished and made of by the
<pb facs="tcp:20479:17"/>
fathers, as if neuer any such matter had fallen out. By which

were moued afterward to exceeding great internal sorow
for their former proceedings and some of them also resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

               <p>For first these men to grace themselues with my L. of
London, and other higher Magistrates by his meanes and
mediation, and to wreake their spite vpon others of their
owne coate, calling and religion, whose vertues they
can neyther beare nor immitate, and whose other gifts

also as publike enemyes to impugne their owne cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,

do defend the same contrary to their appetite and fancy,
which point of madnesse, they do prosecute in this whole
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20479:18"/>
book by six or seauen most absurd positions or paradoxes,
iustifying first, the proceeding of heretiques and persecutors
against Catholiks for cause of religion: then excluding all
spiritual authority and Iurisdiction of the Sea Apostolike
from England, as forrayne and subiect to the law of <hi>Premunire:</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Thirdly denynig the said Sea and Bishops therof all authority
to restrayne punish or force by way of armes eyther by him
selfe or others any temporal prince for heresy, Apostasy, or
whatsoeuer other cryme pertayning to Religion. Fourthly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
affirming, that if any Pope should attempt such matters he
may and ought to be resisted by Catholike subiects, and that
themselues would do it though he came in person. Fifthly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
they lay all the fault of so long and greeuous persecution as
hitherto English Catholiks haue suffered for religion, vpon
themselues, and their owne doings, not excepting heerin, the
very martyrs and Saints of God; and further they are not
ashamed to affirme, that yf they had byn of the Counsel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
they could haue done no lesse, then to haue agreed to
the said persecution, and to the lawes and statutes made for
the same. Sixtly that they meane hereeafter to change their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
former course, and (as their phrase is) <hi>to turne ouer the leafe,</hi> and
with such resolution as yf they should know any disignments
or treatese of his Hol. or other Catholiks for reformation or
restraynt of heresy by way of force in England they would
reueale the same to the persecutors. The 7. and last poynt is,
that they condemne the Semynaries and education of our
youth therin beyond the seas, wherin themselues or the most
part of them haue byn brought vp, and made that they are
now (excepting their sedition) and they dehort all Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
with great vehemency from sending their children thither
counseling them rather to keep them at home, where they
assure them, that God wil prouide other masters euen of the
ministers themselues, yf need be, to instruct them better then in
the Seminaryes they are instructed.</p>
               <p>These are the wise and holesome: positions which these
men haue in this booke set downe, and do handle as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
and argument therof, which yow see of what quality &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:20479:19"/>
consideration they are; to wit, the first ful of adulation, and
meerly parasitical, the second third and fourth pernicious er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
and heretical; the fifth wicked and reprochful; the
sixt trayterous, and the last ridiculous or rather impious,
which in part shal appeare by these few words which in this
place we are to say of each of them in order.</p>
               <p>The first point of this argument is set downe in the title it
selfe of the book,<note place="margin">The first point of the argument.</note> which they cal: <hi>Important considerations to
mooue all true Catholikes that are not wholy Iesuited</hi> (to wit not so
base or wickedly mynded as themselues to flatter and fawne
vpon te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poral fauour) <hi>to acknowledge all the proceedinges of the state
of England against Catholikes</hi> (since it excluded the Roman faith
and fel to heresy) to haue byn not only iust, but also <hi>myld and
merciful, &amp;c.</hi> Thus they say, adding further another peece of
the said title in these words: <hi>Published by sundry of vs the secular
priestes in dislike of many treateses, letters, and reportes, which haue
byn wrytten and made in diuers places to the contrary, with our opinions
of a better course hereafter, for the promoting of the Catholike faith in
England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus they frame their title: wherby (as yow see) they
first make themselues publike proctors for the heretiks and
presecutors, and then open accusers against the presecuted Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
on their owne side. That which they adde of the
publication of this booke, <hi>by sundry of them secular priests,</hi> we
easily beleeue that they were rather <hi>sundy</hi> and sundered also,
then many vnited in so wicked an attempt, and that they were

book, and should shew vs what this new course of theirs is,
which they cal, <hi>better for promoting of Catholike Religion herafter in
England,</hi> yow shal find no other thing prescribed by them but
only a flattering persuasion to sticke to the State against the
Pope and Sea Apostolike (wherin we persuade our selues
that the aduersaryes themselues do not beleeue them) &amp; then
a vehement exhortation to Catholiks to send their children
no more to the Seminaryes beyond the seas least they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the contrary doctrine, which is so foolish and
absurd as we are ashamed to mention or relate it.</p>
               <p>And thus much touching the first point.<note place="margin">The second cheefe point of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</note> The second is
about the law of <hi>Premunire</hi> many tymes mentioned before by
them, and now againe greatly vrged in the preface of this
book, where hauing rayled without all modestie or measure
against <hi>F. Persons</hi> and all other Catholiks and priests vnited
with him in admitting his Hol. ordinance about the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest,
they say thus:<note place="margin">Epist. pag. 14</note> 
                  <hi>As by this meanes</hi> (to wit by admitting the
Archpriest) <hi>he and his confederates haue incurred a double premunire
as in another place (siz in the booke of Quodlibets. I meane God willing
to declare) so entendeth he therby to draw yow all (good Catholiks) into
the same predicament premunireal and of treason with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching this booke of <hi>Quodlibets</hi> heere me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, yf these
men do meane therby that they may say or vnsay therin
what they list without controlment, then may all the other
<pb facs="tcp:20479:20"/>
books also hitherto set forth be called <hi>Quodlibets</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The booke of Quodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets.</note> no lesse then
this, hauing tyed themselues therin to no law eyther of truth,
probability, proof or modesty. Neyther can we immagine
what occasion this booke of Quodlibets may bring to handle
more at large this matter of <hi>Premunire,</hi> then heere, and in other
their wrytings hath byn expressed, seing that applying that
law as they do, to ouerthrow therby the Popes institution of
the Archpriest, their intention must needs be consequently to
exclude all Papal authority and iurisdiction from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of England, except the prince of what religion soeuer,
agree thervnto. VVhich doctrine of what quality it is, no man
can but see.</p>
               <p>And for better explication therof we are in this place to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise
the Reader, that albeit we haue said so much already
in our<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> Apologie about this matter as was needful for that
place,<note place="margin">About the lavv of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire.</note> and the obiections made by these people did require; yet
hauing both thought and sought more of that poynt since, by
occasion of the often vrging it, we find somwhat to be added
heere, to wit, that the Appellation to <hi>Rome</hi> in the first instance
which there we mentioned was rather an antecedent or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
to the law it selfe of <hi>Premunire</hi> then the cheefe substance
therof, which preamble was begon specially vnder K. Henry
the second in the cause of <hi>S. Thomas</hi> of Canterbury about the
yeare 1170. and continued on vntil towards the later end of
the raigne of <hi>K. Edward</hi> the 3. to wit about the yeare 1375.
which was but a yeare before the said Kings death, when
<hi>VVickclif</hi> now had begone to styrre against Cleargie men, and
the king being impotent permitted the gouernment most to
<hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> his fourth some, at great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance
in those dayes with the bishops, namely <hi>VVickam</hi> and
<hi>Courtney,</hi> the first of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> the second of <hi>London,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
not a litle incensed with <hi>Iohn VVickcliffes</hi> new diuelish per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions
against the cleargy and religious men.</p>
               <p>VVherfore a contention being in those dayes about the
collation of benefices and bishopricks in England, wherof
the Popes were wont to dispose for the most part, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in England after many contentions and disputes and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20479:20"/>
many sendings forth and back to <hi>Auinion</hi> in <hi>France</hi> where the
Popes at that tyme resided, that such prouisions of benefices
should not be sought nor made from the Pope immediately
for the tyme to come, but only in England by consent of the
prince and confirmation afterward of the Pope for the most
principal benefices and dignityes; and whosoeuer should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this procure prouisions immediately from the Pope or
any other power or iurisdiction contrary to this lawe, should
incurre the penaltyes therof. And this to haue byn the only
true meaning and intent of the said law and lawmakers, that
were Catholiks,<note place="margin">Policron. lib. 7. c. 44. Tho. VValsingh ab an 1343. vsque ad an. 1376. ex ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

therof. And in this sense there is no controuersy among vs, for
that later Popes haue eyther agreed thervnto or permitted the
same; and we see the like in vre also in other Catholike coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
at this day by agreement and composition betwene the
Sea Apostolike, Princes, and Catholike Cleargie.</p>
               <p>But besides this sense and meaning of the law there hath
byn another inuented by heretiks and enemyes synce that
tyme,<note place="margin">Registrum Symonis Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepij.</note> as though by this law all external iurisdiction of the
bishop of Rome should be vtterly excluded from England
not only in prouiding of benefices whervnto are annexed
temporalityes,<note place="margin">Nicol Harpes feld in hist. Eccles. Angl. saeculo 14. Cap. 5.</note> but euen in matters also meere spiritual. In
which sense <hi>K. Henry</hi> the eight Father of her Maiestie was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
by some of his Counsel infected with Luthers Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
at that tyme, to condemne the <hi>Card.</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and all his

of the Popes legats <hi>Campegius</hi> &amp; the said <hi>Cardinal</hi> without

               <p>And in this sense also hath the Popes authority byn called
forrayne and external and vtterly excluded from England by
diuers lawes statutes &amp; oathes set forth by Protestants against
the same, since that tyme. And in the same sense and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
(being plainly false and heretical as yow see) do these
libellers vrge it now against the Archpriest and others that
admit and approue his authority, though meerly spiritual, as
all the world seeth, as hauing nor benefice nor temporality
<pb facs="tcp:20479:21"/>
annexed to it or ioyned with it. And so we see with what
kynd of people these men are drawen by passion to conspire
and iump.</p>
               <p>The third point of their argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this book is to shew

               <p>And this irreligious paradox they go about to maintayne
throughout their whole book, alleadging fond &amp; childish ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
for the same:<note place="margin">Pag. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>as that the word of the spirit &amp; not the swords
of the flesh or any arme of man, is that which giueth life, and beauty
to the Catholike Churche and that the promise made to S. Peter is a sure

other such fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cies which the Anabaptistes do vse to proue that
there should be no external force or ciuil magistrate vsed by
Christians; and as <hi>Martyn Luther</hi> disputed, when he would
prooue that warre was not to be waged against the <hi>Turke</hi> for
religion, especially at the Popes direction. And yet are our
men so confident in these their follies as they are not ashamed
to say in the same place to Catholiks:<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>Giue no eare (deare Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes)

               </p>
               <p>Thus they say, and thus they assure Catholiks, but much

alleadge for the same (called by these men heere <hi>priuate VVhis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings,
Iesuitical persuasions, and vnlearned sophistications)</hi> are so
learned and weighty, as they are not able to answere one of
them; and if we should heere set downe the ranke of authors

that haue wrytten of this point within these 400. yeares,
as also in our dayes against heretikes and atheists, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced
the same by most learned demonstrations both out of

that albeit directly the supreme pastor of Christs Churche

that are supreame in their owne states, yet indirectly for
conseruation and defence of religion when it is impugned
or put in hazard by them, he may also vse the sword or help
of temporal forces for his restraint, eyther immediatly from
himself or by other princes at his direction; if (we say) we

               <p>And as for reasons, one or two only may suffice for reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
men in this so cleare a matter; wherof the first &amp; ground
of all other is, the subordination that is and ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weene
the temporal and spiritual ends of ciuil and ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Magistrats, and their powers; which subordination ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the most excellent declaration of <hi>S. Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi>
and other fathers is, and ought to be as the body to the
soule, the flesh to the spirit, and earthly things to heauenly
things. And as the body is subiect to the soule, the flesh to
the spirit, and earthly and temporal affayres to those that
are heauenly and eternall; so is the end of the ciuil common
welth subiect and subordinate to the end of the spiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth, to wit the Church of Christ. And as the
soule may and doth restrayne or correct oftentymes the body,
and the spirit the flesh when they go out of order, so may
the spiritual gouuernour do the same to the temporal, when
he breaketh this subordination and goeth about to impugne

both in scriptures ecclesiastical and prophane histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes,

flattery of these our new fawning brethren to the contrary,
is not only fond but also impious.</p>
               <p>There followeth the fourth part of their argument in this
book which conteyneth a braue and resolute protestation
against the Pope,<note place="margin">The 4 point of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> to wit: <hi>that if the Pope should come in person
with an army where they are, vnder pretence to establish Catholike
religion by force, they would oppose themselues against him, and spend
the best bloud in their bodyes</hi> (if any be good) <hi>in that quarrel, &amp;c.</hi>
Behold valiant Souldiers brought vp in the Popes seminaryes
brauing against him: who would beleene this to be spoken
by preests, except they auowed themselues to be authors of
the book? And how are these men (think yow) so soone
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20479:22"/>
of priests made souldiars? A litle before they talked much of
the word, and now vpon the suddayne they haue taken vp
the sword, to fight against their cheefe pastor and bringer vp,
and this also in defence of heresy. VVhence (think yow) is
this mutation? <hi>VVe are thorowly presuaded</hi> (say they) <hi>that priests
of what order soeuer ought not by force of armes to plant, water,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
religion.</hi> But we would aske them what good arguments
haue persuaded them herin, or what learned maister hath
taught them this new lesson, so contrary to their old? Surely
we can immagine none, but my L. of London, nor other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
then anger, enuy and other like passions.</p>
               <p>The fifth poynt of their subiect is to cast vpon Catholiks
(as hath byn said) yea vpon the best and most zealous sort,<note place="margin">The fifth point of their argument.</note>
and vpon the martyrs themselues all the fault, hatred and
enuy of the long and greeuous persecutions and sufferings for
religion in England, and to drowne them (as men are wont to
say) in their owne bloud and (which is more impious) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
them with all sorts of people both at home and abroad,
as traytors, conspirers, and practisioners against the State, and
as men of maleuolent mynds towards both their prince and
contrey: And is this priestlike? is this piety? nay they lay the
fault vpon the Popes themselues (as before hath byn shewed)
and is this tolerable?</p>
               <p>But yet they go further, and say that some of themselues,
<hi>if they had byn of her Ma. counsel, and knowing what they now know,<note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note>
would haue giuen their consents to that which hath byn done against
Catholikes</hi> Lo heere, they giue their consent <hi>à posteriori</hi> to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
the spilling of so much bloud, and the guylt of so many
spoilings and vexations of Catholiks as hitherto haue byn
vsed, and great probability there is that the iustice of almighty
God may admit them to that participatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the day of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
seing they desyre it so earnestly, and so importunatly
thrust themselues in now, by offering their postconsent. But
would any man beleeue this of Catholike preeists that are in
their right wits?</p>
               <p>If a man should pose them about the proceedings in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland

of their brethren lay all the fault of rigour and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vpon Iesuits and other Catholiks of their side? How wil
they answere or defend this?</p>
               <p>The sixt poynt of their book,<note place="margin">The sixt point of their argument. Pag. 5.</note> is an intimation of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention

as before haue byn related out of their two last books,
the one treating a defence and patronage of disorder and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
against vertuous, regular, and retyred life, the other two
(for now they are three in number as yow haue seene) of farre
worse quality tending to open rayling and rebellion against
Superiors, with manifest errors also in doctrine: much more
(no doubt) wil yow do the same, or rather feele a farre
deeper sense of compassion in yow toward them by vewing
ouer their manner of handling these subiects, which is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
euery where with such extreame passion, lack of
iudgment, modestie, and moderation, as truly in men of their

men do so treat the argument or subiect of these two books,
as yf they were good and tolerable of them selues, yet could
they not but become contemptible and odious by their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of treating, seing they manifestly declare therin, that no
reason, desyre of truth, zeale of reformation, loue of vnion, or
any other good cause or motiue induced them to take this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize
in hand, but spite and rancor only, enuy and malyce

in the manner of handling their pretentions, they so beare
themselues, as euery child may discouer not only great insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20479:24"/>
besides belonging to men of ther profession, and that only they

not caring what or how or of whome they say any thing, so

               </p>
               <p>By these words the reader may take a scantling of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous

a man of knowne vertue and learning, for so myld
and modest an admonition vpon their first two libels, as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20479:25"/>
yow shal now heare by their owne relation. For thus they
wryte.</p>
               <p>These are <hi>(say they)</hi> his words,<note place="margin">The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priests mild and fatherly speech proud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly censured by his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</note> 
                  <hi>(to wit the Archpriests in his
admonition:)</hi> The first point of your books (sayth he) (meaning the
diuision at VVisbich) was a thing long since ended with great edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and by the meanes principally of those which are most condemned
by yow; It toucheth the greater and better part of that company; it
nothing concerneth our authority, it being more ancient and hauing
orders taken at the attonement by their owne consent. It is wel knowen
at Rome, by whose meanes they were disanulted, nether is it more vnsit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for those which liued in one house to institute rules for such as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
demaunded and accepted them, then to procure a sodality
abroad.</p>
               <p>Thus wrote our Reuerend Father the good Archpriest and
as these men do confesse, it is all he wrote of this point of
<hi>VVisbich</hi> and let the Reader be iudge whether any Superior in
the world could wryte more myldly &amp; more humbly, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialy
if he consider the outragious iniuryes done him in these
two first books or libels set out by his Rebellious subiects
against him, and notwithstanding all this his patience and
modesty, consider we pray yow with what intemperance
they do canuase these few words of his heere set downe. For
hauing recyted his words they say.</p>
               <p>Thus farre our Archpriest. and it is all he wryteth to his Assistants of
this matter which we the rather note to shew the extremity of his pride
in supposing by such an answere to the said books concerning that diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and F. VVeston, and he himselfe in some sorte are charged.</p>
               <p>Thus wryte these men, being angry (as it seemeth) that
their patient Superior vouch-safed not them more words of
contention about this matter of <hi>VVisbich</hi> in his admonition to
his Assistants, which how iust a quarrel it is let wiser men
iudge, but much more, whether so few, so modest and so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
words vttered by a Superior without naming any, do
merit so contumelious a censure from subiects, as to accuse
him of extremity of pride <hi>lack of wyt and honesty, discretion, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
truth and humility</hi> in wryting them. Is it possible that so
<pb facs="tcp:20479:26"/>
high pride as heere is obiected can be gathered out of so lowly
words without high folly and higher maleuolence?</p>
               <p>But we shal aleadge yow another example in a different
kynd of foly, or rather frenzie, vsed by these passionate people
which is to grace and praise indeed their aduersaryes whome
they seek most to disgrace, by telling good things of them,
and deprauing them only by their owne comentaryes, as
in this example last alleadged of M. Blackwel,<note place="margin">Another kynd of stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g folly and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres.</note> whose words

                  </gap>rpretations of
their owne to make them reprochful. And the like they do
oftentymes concerning F. VVeston, alleadging both his words
and deeds worthie of praise in themselues, and then seking
to discredit the same by their wresting comentaryes, wherof
we haue giuen some examples in the former chapter, and we
may ad therunto now this, which they relate of him, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour
and speech when <hi>M. Dolman</hi> one of their owne side
came vnto <hi>F. VVeston</hi> to request him &amp; the residue (who made
the greater part of the company) to returne to the common
conuersation of the troublesome and dissolute againe, whose
answere to their demaund they set downe thus.</p>
               <p>VVould God (said F. VVeston with most earnest affection,<note place="margin">Pag. 17. F. VVest. reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious vvords malitiously interpreted.</note> as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
that yow M. Doleman were as able to persuade the rest, as yow haue
done me; for my owne parte I mynd to giue ouer and meddle no further,
but to commend the cause to God, assuring yow, yf I could do the least of
this house good for his soules health, by laying my head vnder his feete, I
would most willingly do it, &amp;c. And thus farre this dissembling Iesuite.</p>
               <p>Let any true Christian man iudge now of this vnchristian
censure of so myld, godly and Christian words; let our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
but aleadge vs truly some such of any of their side, and
we shal both beleeue them and praise them; But they can
bring nothing of like quality from theirs, and yow haue
heard the quite contrary by their owne letters and subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
alleadged by vs in our<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> Apologie, and heere in these
books yow may reade them in euery line shewing a plaine

he was to treat any matter of moment (a thing as all godly
men know most laudable, and vsed by all old saints, as also
by the best religious men of our dayes) for when the foresaid
M. <hi>Dolman</hi> (and as these men say also <hi>M. D. Bauyn</hi> with him) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by them and their clamors to desyre some final end
whatsoeuer of so odious braules, came to the forsaid Father
to treat about the leauing of, for peace sake, that fraternity or
spiritual congregation, which the bigger and better part of
the prisoners had made to themselues, for orderly lyfe and
avoyding the disorders comytted by others; these men
relate the matter thus.</p>
               <p>

thus with contempt they relate as yow see the good mans
recollection of himselfe by prayer, before he would treat so
weightie an affayre, which custome of prayer, these men
cal the <hi>new fashion,</hi> for that it is like they vse it not, and yet
they confesse the argument of his speech to haue byn such, as
it caused <hi>M. D. Bauyn</hi> a wise and learned man to shed teares
which these pleasant men also turne to a iest:<note place="margin">Pag. Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Then D. Bauyn</hi> (say they) <hi>to pay M. VVeston with his owne coyne, pretended to be so
mooued with his words, as yf he likewise could scarsely haue refrayned

wherof they relate, that he would not keep any certaine

               <p>VVe might heere alleadge many other examples in this
kynd of folly and passionate proceeding, wherby our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
not seing what maketh for them or what against
them, do go about to discredit others by such meanes, as do
giue greatest credit &amp; honour vnto them, as for example
when desyring by all meanes possible to bring in contempt
and discredit the venerable, godly and learned Society of
religious men called the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> they tel vs euery where
how strong and powerable they be in all countreyes, how
greatly in credit throughout all Christendome calling also
the most famous men of our age secular and religious,
priests and lay men, Iesuits or Iesuited, when they make
against them though they neyther are nor euer were of
that order, and so they cal <hi>M. D. Sanders, D. Bristow, Card.
Allen</hi> and others of our owne nation, Iesuites, though they
were neuer so; but only frends vnto them. And the like
also they do with many principal men of other nations
yea though they be lay men; as Don Bernardino de Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doca
late Ambassadour for the Catholike king in France, and
diuerse principal gentlemen in England, which is rather to

commend and grace the Society then otherwise.</p>
               <p>And the very same course they hould with <hi>F. Persons,</hi>
whome to disgrace they affirme to haue led our late Card.
Allen at his pleasure, made his bookes for him, induced him
to this, and to that, as he listed; and the like authority they
attribute vnto him with the late K. of Spaine, and this that
now is, saying that he did and doth with them what he
pleaseth; sending men into <hi>Ireland,</hi> making <hi>armadas</hi> and the
like.<note place="margin">Great folly &amp; passion not to see vvhat maketh for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or against them.</note> The same authority also they affirme him to haue with

hath byn able to make so many new Seminaryes in Spaine
and Flanders, and to send so many priests into England,
and to haue so many vnder him at his comandement: all
which things and other the like which they aleadge against
him tending rather to his credit if they be true then any
wayes to his discomendation do argue great folly and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
and great blyndnes of passion in our brethren, that

that ether F. Persons is a man of more wisdome, religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

man (we thinke) but these, can gather out of the Articles
themselues, seing they all tend directly both to clearnes,

so high a personage (his great grauity considered) can be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed.
All which besides many other things declared in the
first and sixt Chapter of this book, touching their intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

where the commodity of their cause requireth, against this
supreme and highest authority, howsoeuer now and than
they cast out some words of submission for a shew, and to
delude such Catholiks as wil beleeue them.</p>
               <p>And these now are 4. general heads or bodyes of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saryes

some other though more priuate and particular, yet

with lesse noise, or at least wayes being once compounded
and ended by others, not to haue brought them in disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of their dealing with <hi>D. Sanders</hi> and the <hi>Card.</hi> in particular.</p>
               <p>It little became eyther M Saunders <hi>(Say they)</hi> otherwayes an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

Lords and gentlemen to take armes. And the rather to persuade them
therunto they signified vnto them by the Popes commandement that her
Ma. was excommunicated, &amp;c. <hi>Behold here the condemnation of

                  <note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> The Pope himselfe in the

               <p>But heere we would aske these men how they do know

to be his schollers that so resolutely do accuse him heere of
voluntary putting himselfe in that peril how can they proue
it? and much les that he was a <hi>cheife ringleader</hi> in that warre?
or what sure ground haue they of this malitious imputation?
For sure we are, that we haue both heard and seene by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that he was not only induced, but also commanded in
his Hol. name by <hi>Bishop Sega</hi> then <hi>Nuntius Apostolicus</hi> in Spayne
and afterwards Card. to go in that voyage, not to be ringlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in matters of warre, as these men do odiously obiect, but
rather to be a moderator and vmpire in Ecclesiastical affayres
for direction to that people as occasion should fal out. But
howsoeuer that was, those things being now past, and the
man dead, and with almightie God, as we hope and persuade
our selues, for these men now to reuiue the same againe with
so great hatred and enuy as they do for flattering of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

this of him.</p>

F. Persons vttered so intemperatly throughout all their libells,<note place="margin">Their vvarre against F. Persons.</note> as they may seeme especially to haue byn wrytten against
him and against others only or cheefly for his sake. The
reason wherof notwithstanding the more we seeke, the
lesse we fynd, excepting only that general reason which we
haue touched before in our Apologie, that he beeing the man
that hath most benifited them, &amp; aboue others by way of the
Seminaryes, and after the said good <hi>Card.</hi> decease, by reason of
his place and office (being Prefect of the English mission for
those of his Society) may seeme cheifely to hold togeather
that cause which these men would deuide and dissipate. For
this reason (yf it be a reason) they being angry with him by
the very imagination of his beeing in place and credit to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their designments, they turne all their obligation of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
into the passion of hatred, conspiring, and coniuring
against him, as the only imagined obstacle of all their factious
attempts and desyres, though hithertoo we do not see, that
they haue alleadged many opposite acts of his parte, but only

by their owne apprehension or interpretation, or suspitions

               <p>For proof wherof, yf we runne ouer all their clamorous

they alleadge against, the sayed father,<note place="margin">Apol. ca. 12.</note> yf we set aparte, slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

and comming out of England it is so iustified by vs in our Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>logie,
and so many vtilityes shewne to haue ensued therby to
our common cause, as they may be ashamed euer to make
that obiection againe, his ioyning afterward with Card. Allen,
and his proceeding ioyntly with him both in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and
<hi>Rome</hi> for aduancing our comon Catholike cause and the <hi>Card.</hi>

they do carp at the same, in these libels, yet is it shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to them in the eyes of all ciuil men be they Catholiks
or Protestants: His comming backe to <hi>Rome</hi> againe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the yeare 1597. we see by experience was the sauing
of that Colledge, and the present fruits and effects of peace,
vertue, and learning there, do reject all slanders that in this
point can be obiected; his concurring afterwards to procure

               <p>His proceeding after that againe with the two messengers
sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to contradict, was such as their owne letters yet
extant did commend the same; The end also taken by his
Hol. was then approued and praysed by the cheefe of the
aduerse part,<note place="margin">Apol. ca. 9.</note> and all that followed afterward from <hi>F. Persons</hi>
as appeareth by his letters set downe in our Apologie, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to nothing els but to conserue that end, peace and vnion
which his Hol. and his high Comissioners the Card. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors
had made, and to this end had he continually written
to the Archpriest and Fathers of the Society as wel, as to the
other side, and that most earnestly and effectually, as his letters

do yet testifie. And yf any new breach or exasperation haue

he were the woorst man liuing, &amp; the greatest enemy that our

the most of the said number were Seminary priests, who yf

to higher aduersaryes than martyrs raigning with God, it is
hard for pryde to ascend or oppose it self, yet may their folly

come to be examyned and are found false and without
foundation (as euery where lightly they are, and heere also are
like to be in diuers particulars declared by vs) the conclusion
must needs be with the discreet and indifferent Reader, that
eyther these men haue very bad, or no conscience at all; or els
so litle discretion and such a wonted custome of telling vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truthes,
as they reflect not vpon eyther conscience or credit,
when they tel them; and consequently that both truth and
falshood is all one with them, and both vttered with like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,
and therfore the same credit to be giuen to the one as to
the other.</p>
               <p>For proof of this yow haue heard and seene (yf yow haue
read our former Apologie) how notorious falshoods and

                  </gap> in their sixt book called

their consciences for the truth of what they say. But with
what conscience they do this yow shal see by the euent, for
thus they wryte:</p>
               <p>These good Fathers <hi>(say they)</hi> as the diuel would haue it came into
England in the yeare 1580.<note place="margin">Ibid. pag. 24.</note> being the men in our consciences who haue

Thus they protest and sweare; and by this let euery man
iudge of these good consciences, it being an easy matter to
gesse how true this assertion may be, seeing the Iesuits came
not into England in xxj. yeares and more after her Maiesties
raigne, neyther was there any English Iesuite abroad all that

that no Iesuite was then in England or had to do therin; it
followeth that to lay all vpon Iesuits with such asseueration

and breach of faith against the King of Spaine? And yet yf
they be Catholiks, (as they pretend) they must needs confesse
the case to be no lesse fauorable on <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> VVilliams</hi> side, yf not
much more, both in respect of his great zeale in Catholike
religion, and rare piety of lyfe, shewed euer synce (wherin
would God the wryters of these books, being priests (as they
say) had any resemblance or would follow him) as also for
that (as we are certainly enformed) besides the former war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of conscience and iustice, he had also for safegard of his
honour a particular Patent from his General the Earle of
<hi>Leicester</hi> when he returned into England, with expresse licence
therin conteyned to leaue the seruice of the States at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,

there, about peace with <hi>Spayne</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> which no man
more than he and other Catholiks desyred to haue byn ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuated.
And he being of that renowned vertue and valour
that all men know, we doubt not, but he would spend the
last drop of his bloud in her Maiesties seruice, setting the only

but indeed cynical rather or sycophantical calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
Catholike priests and so Catholike as none in the world

we thinke it not amisse to ad a word or two more in this place
about Catholike doctrine and diuinity what it is herin for
better iustifying of the forsaid honorable gentleman his noble
and most Christian fact and resolution.</p>
               <p>First then the case being proposed, as before we haue set
downe,<note place="margin">The first point about restitution.</note> the resolution of Catholike doctrine and schooles is
this: that yf a man haue in his hand or custody by what
meanes from whome or with what conditions soeuer, the
goods of another wrongfully taken from him, eyther by
theft, violence, or other vnlawful meanes whatsoeuer, yea
though he were possessor <hi>bonae fidei;</hi> that is to say, that he ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knew when he tooke them, that they were other mens
goods, nor did consent help or aid the same wrong done; yet
yf afterward he should come to know the iniustice therof &amp;
that it lay in his hands to restore the same, to the true owner
it were euer lawful for him so to do, yea he were bound in
conscience therunto vnder paine of restitution of his owne
part, except only in two cases, to wit when eyther he could
not restore them of himselfe to the owner, but with his great
losse and daunger, or that he had hope that restoring them to
the vsurper he would make restitution therof himselfe, and so
saue his owne credit therin; and this first poynt is cleere and
without all doubt amongst all learned Catholiks, as may
appeare first by the law it selfe: <hi>l. officium, F. de rei vendicatione, &amp;
l. si bonae fidei possessor, ff. de petitione haereditatis. L. in Causa 1. §. vlt.
ff. de minuribus, &amp; ibid. l. plane, &amp; l. sed vbi.</hi> And then secondly by
all the most learned and approued wryters that treate therof
as a thing whereof there is no controuersy at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:20479:52"/>
The 2. point<note place="margin">The 2. poynt about resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of goods vvro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully betey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> of Catholike doctrine is in this case (which
comprehendeth the fact and state of <hi>Sir VVilliam Stanley</hi> more
fully and properly) that yf he which receaued another mans
goods to keep from him, be <hi>malae fideif possessor,</hi> that is yf he
know indeed the goods to be another mans, and that he did
consent or cooperate to the taking or detayning therof, as
<hi>Sir VVilliam</hi> cannot be excused (as it seemeth) but that he did,
then is there likewisse no question among diuines or Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
but that he is absolutely bound by all meanes possible
that he can to restore the same to the true owner, and not to
the vsurper from whence he had them, notwithstanding any
oath or any pretended obligation whatsoeuer made to the
contrary: yea he is bound to this by two bands, the one in
that he not only knoweth certainly now that they are the
goods of another, but did also know the same when he took
them: and secondly that he did and doth cooperate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the vniust vsurpation so long as he withholdeth them
from their rightful owner, which two bands are so great, as
they do not only oblige him to deliuer his hands with all
speed possible from this vniust detention of the said goods,
but further also, that yf he should restore them to him of
whome he receaued them, he should sin damnably, &amp; moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
be bound to restitution of the whole to the true owner,
out of his owne, in case the Vsurper otherwise should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the same. VVhich poynt yow may see handled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined

pretended to be made by <hi>Sir VVilliam</hi> for keeping the towne of

neyther the old king now dead, nor his sonne now raigning,

the contrary to wit that their only meaning and desire

our late good Cardinal thinking seriously towards the later

Ma. should faile, and what great contention and warres were
like to ensue about the succession of a new prince, he was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20479:57"/>
greatly troubled and afflicted in mynd, and casting diuers
wayes about how these mischeefes might best be preuented
and matters wrought to some moderation and composition
both to the contentment of forrayne princes and probability
to reduce the Cath. faith agayne into England, he took his
pen in hand, and set downe a very wise, moderate and pious
discourse of his opinion and iudgment therin sending the same
into <hi>Spayne</hi> with desyre to heare the opinions of his frends
about the same, who liking it very wel and being desyrous
to haue the same continued and set forward, diuers of the

               <p>The calumniation about the <hi>L. Dacres</hi> is most false &amp; slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous,<note place="margin">About the L. Dacres.</note>
and hath many malignant vntruthes; That which
passed betwene him and F. Persons is this, as we are certaynly
enformed by them that know it: He went out of England
to <hi>Vallidolid</hi> in Spaine about the yeare 1590. where finding
<hi>F. Persons</hi> begynning his new Seminary, he was most curteously
receyued and treated by him therin, and after some dayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
by his letters very effectually to the court at
<hi>Madrid</hi> where also he was honorably vsed, from whence he
passed to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there had 60. Crownes a moneth in gold,
payed him by the Spanish Embassador, which after some
tyme misliking his abode there he left; to returne into Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
where it may be that he fel into some discontentements
as banished men are wont to do, but this could not be by any
reason or probability with <hi>F. Persons,</hi> seing he neuer dealt
with him after his departure from Spaine, and is presumed to
haue had the forsaid prouision in Rome by his special come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
VVherfore to say heere as these men do that he was
<pb facs="tcp:20479:58"/>
held for a spy and suspected that he would burne the K. fleete
(wherof we neuer heard before) is open calumniation laid
vpon the good noble man himselfe, towards whome we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by very certaine and sure meanes that the said Father
is and alwayes was very wel affected in respect both of his
religion and house, whatsoeuer this seditious wryter and

               <p>As for the other,<note place="margin">Another im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation.</note> 
                  <hi>that F. Persons hath caused diuers of our nation to
be vtterly disgraced, discredited, yea and to leese their lyues in Spaine for
being contrary to his designes,</hi> is so manifest a slaunder as we are
ashamed to repeat: For what one example can these men
alleadge for sauing their credit and honestie heerin? It is wel
knowne that he hath saued the lyues of diuers, both by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
them out of the gallyes as also out of the inquisition,
as diuers can beare witnesse that are now in England deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by him. And more it is to be noted, that from the tyme
of <hi>F. Persons</hi> comming into <hi>Spaine</hi> in the yeare 1588. vntil his
departure from thence in the yeare 1596. no one Englishma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in any of the Tribunals of all those kingdomes was publikely
punished or put to death during those 8. yeares, wheras be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
many had accustomed to be. And this change is knowne
to haue come principally by the information and intreaty of
<hi>F. Persons</hi> with those Ecclesiastical Iudges, letting them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
first and aboue all other things, the true state of men
in England, touching religion at this tyme, to wit, that very
few especially of the yonger sort (how earnest protestants
soeuer they shew themselues) are to be accounted heretiks
properly and in rigour of the Canons,<note place="margin">Qentle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding vvith english heretikes in Spayne by F. Persons mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> as they appoynt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments

of the Cath. faith, or at leastwise instructions, hauing neuer

circumstances there are of great moment to mitigate the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

them seing that by experience it was found, that the most

then is there proofe inough therin to shew him to be contrary
to this doctrine, seing that the whole drift of the first book

against this doctrine taught (as there is said) by one <hi>Belloy</hi> a

amongst some of them to be printed as writen by him
which yet others of the sayd company not so mad as the rest
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20479:59"/>
dissuaded them from as a thing that would easily be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,

himself and others in England about matters of state how he might

               </p>
               <p>And heere also we would aske why they do not expresse
this letter more particularly, &amp; set downe the words therof.
For yf they meane a letter of his wrytten to the Earle of
<hi>Anguise</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> and intercepted heere in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d concerning

haue any other (which we assure our selues they haue not)
why do they not cite it, as plaine dealing men ought to do, &amp;
as we haue done towards them and theirs in our Apologie?
VVhy also do they slaunder the Catholiques of England with
so base and absurd a cogitation, as to deliuer vp <hi>F. Persons</hi> to

through their imaginations, esteeming his discret and feruent
labours for them, and their common cause a hundred tymes

               <p>And now hauing byn much more longer in this matter
then we purposed at the beginning, we would gladly end,
pretermitting infinite other such like stuffe of the same kind,
as in these books are euery wheare found, yet must we not
passe ouer one narration of theirs, for that it toucheth great
personages. The story is this;<note place="margin">Epist. to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. consid. Pag. 15.</note> that when their two legats
<hi>M. Bishop</hi> and M. Charnock came to Rome in the end of the

residing there, requesting his help to procure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> audie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of the Pope,<note place="margin">A notorious fiction and contumely to his Hol.</note> who enquiring if they had brought the K. his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
letter in their fauour, &amp; perceauing they had not, told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that albeit he would with the said letter, if they had brought
it, more willingly enter into the said action with them, yet
<pb facs="tcp:20479:60"/>
without it also would he speake to his Hol. in their fauour,
and so he did, making a speech which heere in their book
they take vpon them to set downe, and the very words he vsed
wherby he obtayned ful promise of their audience, with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
at his Hol. hands. VVhich the Spanish Embassadour
vnderstanding of, went presently to the Pope, and made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
speech in the behalfe of his maister, to whome the Pope
promised that they should not haue audience, which being
vnderstood by the french Embassadour, he returned to his
Hol. againe and renewed his oration and petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
more earnestly then before, and it was resolutely
graunted him; which being brought to the Spanish Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour
he went to the Pope with great vehemency the second
tyme, and as it were threatning him from his king made him
recal the second tyme his former promise.</p>
               <p>Lo heere a sharp combat framed in the ayre, neuer
thought of by the partyes as we are informed from Rome it
selfe. And first it is to be considered, how bold a deuise this
is, and how iniurious to his Hol. himselfe, who is made heere
like a doore, opened by one and shut by another, and geuing
a creake to each one that moueth it, which contumely how
farre it is from the wisdome, maturity and knowen constancy
of his Hol. in his resolutions all men do know who haue
dealt with him, and it is extreame audacity for these to deuise
such absurd and ridiculous matters of him as to say and vnsay
fower tymes one thing to so great personages. And thus much
of his Holines person.</p>
               <p>But now for the matter it selfe concerning the narration,<note place="margin">Great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilityes that the vvhole is fayned.</note> how or whether the two messengers went to the French Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
in Rome; whether the matter be wholy fayned or
no, we cannot precisely affirme, but great probability there
is that they were neuer with him, seing that their arriual in
Rome being about the 11. of December (as in our Apologie
we haue declared) at what tyme the said Embassador was not
there, but in <hi>Ferrara</hi> with the Pope, or in his way towards
Rome, his Holines entred not the citty, but some 2. or 3. dayes
before the floud, which happened on Christmas eue, and so
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20479:60"/>
empestred the citty, as there was no going vp and downe, and
much lesse negotiating, from that tyme to <hi>S. Thomas of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
his day Decemb. 29. when they were restrayned and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to ward by his Holines order, and therby had no tyme
afterward to go to the said Embassador.</p>
               <p>But howsoeuer this was, we are acertayned by due infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
taken at Rome both from <hi>Cardinal Burghesius</hi> Vice-protector
of England priuy to all the whole negotiation, and
of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sessa</hi> and <hi>Vayena,</hi> the King of Spaynes Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
whome our brethren appoint for cheef actor and orator
of pleading this cause (for of the other two <hi>Cardinal Caëtan</hi>
the Protector and <hi>Monsieur Syllarie</hi> the king of France his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
the one is dead, and the other gone from Rome)
these two great men (we say) do affirme that all this matter
to their knowledge is a meere fiction, and that his Hol. when
he shal know it (as before this it is likely he hath done) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but laugh, and yet be much offended with such audacity
to be published in print.</p>
               <p>And of the said Duke of Sessa Embassador of Spayne they
write from Rome that he laughed hartily when he heard the
Story,<note place="margin">The speech of the Duke of Sessa a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these priests audu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</note> saying: wel then they make me at least the better ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the two who finally preuayled with his Hol. But after
his laughter past, he asked seriously. But is it possible that
English Catholike priests should haue so litle shame &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
as to vtter such deuises of their owne in print, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
them vpon vs heere who neuer thought nor dreamed
therof what may be expected of them for the tyme to come?
These men (said he) wil not stick to fayne letters, wrytings
and speeches to wreake their wrath against any man. To
whome it was answered, that this indeed was doubted against
some, and F. Persons by name, whose letters they threaten in
many places to bring forth, and yet alleadge none hitherto,
for that perhaps they are not yet made, or deuised.</p>
               <p>VVel then there were no end yf we should prosecute all
they say and rayle against <hi>F. Persons</hi> as before we haue noted,
but especially about the restraynt of their forsaid two Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
(a pittiful case) of whome they conclude their former

1588. and his doyngs there, they wryte thus:</hi> He departed from
Rome,<note place="margin">Pag. 28. Ibid.</note> went into Spayne and became a courteour to attend K. Philippe
wher by Mendoza his fellow Iesuits meanes he grew shortly into so great
estimation (not for any goodnesse in him towards this Realme yow may
be sure, but rather in respect of his deadly hatred against it) that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
a Seminary to be erected in Vallidolid. 1589.</p>
               <p>Consider these words (gentle Reader) and weigh the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
folly and malice of the wryters; <hi>He went to Spayne to be
a courteour, got great estimation,</hi> and yet hath gotten nothing for
himself in all these dozen yeares, by al his fauour and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
but only to erect some Semynaries for our nation,
what courting is this? or what courteour followeth this
course to get nothing for himself but for others? yea for those
that professe themselues his enemyes as secular priests do; yf we
may beleeue these men affirming it euery wheare. These are
meere insulsityes.</p>
               <p>Againe they say;<note place="margin">About Don Bernardino de mendoza &amp; his frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship vvith F. P.</note> 
                  <hi>that he got his credit in Spaine by Mendoza his
fellow Iesuits meanes, &amp;c.</hi> But we haue shewed before that <hi>Don
Bernardino de mendoza</hi> was neuer Iesuite but a lay nobleman.
He was not in <hi>Spaine</hi> when <hi>F. Persons</hi> went thither, nor for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
yeares after, for that he resided in <hi>Paris</hi> as Embassador for
his king, where he had much more frendship and correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with <hi>M. Charles Paget and M. Tho. Morgan</hi> men of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
party (as is knowen) then with <hi>F. Persons</hi> betweene
whome and him we haue vnderstood for certayne that no
one letter or message passed for many yeares togeather, to wit
after the most disastrous affayre of <hi>Ballard, Babington, &amp;c.</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
he being drawen perhaps to intermedle more then was
expedient by the forsaid men and others (though we cannot
accuse him therin) and perceauing both <hi>Card. Allen and F. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
then in <hi>Rome</hi> greatly to haue misliked and complayned
therof as a matter so highly preiudicial to the life and states of
<pb facs="tcp:20479:62"/>
many good Catholiks in England and of the Q. of Scotland
her self, he neuer had any great confidence afterward with
the said two men, and when he returned after some yeares to
<hi>Madrid,</hi> where F. Persons was, we vnderstand that there passed
greate expostulations betwene them two about that &amp; some
other such matters, wherin the said Embassador had byn
thought to haue byn ouermuch misled by the foresaid men &amp;
their mates.</p>
               <p>By this then yow may see in part how likely it is that F. Persons
should get his <hi>estimation and credit</hi> in Spaine by <hi>Don
Bernardino de Mendoza</hi> his meanes, and much more how proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it is that the said Father procured a Seminary for English
priests and students in <hi>Vallidolid not for any goodnes in him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
this realme, but for his deadly hatred against it, &amp;c.</hi> who could
imagine such fond malice to be in men? And yet if we would
enlarge our selues vpon this poynt, we should neuer make an
end; for against this man it semeth their vvhole conspiracy
lighteth; And he may wel say out of the psalme <hi>opprobria,
exprobrantium ceciderunt super me,</hi> read the Catalogue of slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
set before the preface of our Apologie and the 12.
Chapter of our said book that treateth of this man in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and then lay them with these which we say heere and
that we haue related in the first Chapter of this book
and yow wil see sufficient store, and yet more wil ensue
after, for that no one part can be touched by them without
his particular impugnation, whome they imagine to stand
more in their way (for letting their seditious designments)
then many others ioyned togeather. And so consequently
they are forced by their owne folly and passion to assayle
him euery where, and this we feare to their owne confusion
in the end, God graunt it be not. And so inough of this.</p>

yet knowing them, as we may by these their books and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,

must needs think the better of him for it, and that there is
some great good thing in him, for which they enuy him so

as they seeme to be content (we meane of the principal that
wryte these books) to put out both their owne eyes according
to the prouerb so they might put out one of his. But this is
the nature of enuy. Let vs now examine some more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars

               <p>The 3. and <hi>fourth</hi> books obiected by them are the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

books we shal speake somwhat more in this place, but most
of the last, for that it is not in print, as all the other three are,
and so may be vewed and examined by the Reader himself,
to whome we giue only this aduertisment, that none of the
forsaid three haue F. Persons name vnto it, and consequently
are no otherwise knowne to be of his making but only by
their owne coniectures, albeit all three are such, as be they his
or no, they yeild litle matter of aduantage to these poore men
but much rather of greef and enuy, as by reading them will
appeare. And as for the third of Succession we shal discusse
some points therof afterwards beeing vrged therunto by
their often carping therat and a childish answere set forth
against it in print. Now we wil begin with the fourth,
wherof they write thus.</p>
               <p>This Polypragman Persons <hi>(say they)</hi> set out a booke intituled:<note place="margin">Epist pag 12. to Import. consid.</note> The

posterity, as to his next heyres, further then as the Spanish Iesuitical

               <p>Lo heere a great and heynous charge, and if any one sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

and euery one of them meerly false, then yow know what
to think of them.</p>
               <p>First then we graunt,<note place="margin">The Treatese intituled: A memorial for Reformation vvhen time shal serte.</note> that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> search made we haue found
that the said Father (not altogeather vntruly called heere
<hi>Polypragmon,</hi> for the multitude of his cares and labors in our
publique cause) hauing had occasion aboue others for more
then xx. yeares, not only to know the State of matters in
England, but also of many forraine nations and Catholike
kingdomes abroad, hath vsed like diligence from tyme to
tyme to obserue and note to himselfe certayne excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t things
found in other places, which are not so much in vse among

he hauing imparted somtymes with certayne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, they seemed to them of so great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for the
tyme to come, as they intreated him earnestly to put them at
least in wryting for himselfe and for others after him; to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike
good; when tyme might serue to vse them, if now he
would not make them common, as he signified in no wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e he
would.</p>
               <p>Herevpon he then being at <hi>Siuil</hi> in the yeare 1596. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing
letters from his Superiors to returne to Rome for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing
the tumults there he was more earnestly intreated,
that before his departure he would performe the same, and
so he did, calling it, <hi>A memorial or Remembrance</hi> for them that
shal lyue when Catholike religion shalbe restored into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>wherin he proposeth with all indifferency such matters as he hath
obserued and noted to be thought and considered of at that tyme, and
eyther to be taken, or reiected limited, chaunged or altered as they should
think best,</hi> all which appeareth by his owne Preface to that
treatese, which for more satisfaction of the Reader and fuller
declaration of his intent and purpose, we shal heere set
downe word for word as we find it in the said book, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we haue procured a true copy out of the original, though
with great difficulty, for that no copyes are giuen abroad
but only to some few confident frends to haue a sight therof,
and giue their iudgement of the matter.</p>
               <p>But yet before we set downe the said Preface we may note
<pb facs="tcp:20479:64"/>
the falsity of these first words of our brethren, affirming the
book to be intituled: <hi>The high counsel of Reformation for England,
&amp;c.</hi> wheras it is only intituled; <hi>A memorial for Reformation, &amp;c.
conteyning certaine notes and aduertisments, &amp;c. gathered, and set downe
by R P. 1596.</hi> Secondly it is not nor euer was set out or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
(as these men falsly affirme) but is kept in secret to
the author and his nearest frends only, to the end aforesaid.
<note place="margin">Many foule falsities and calumniatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vttered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather.</note>
Thirdly the whole calumniation that follovveth of the <hi>old
Romaine Agrarian lawes</hi> pretended therby to be so firmely esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
<hi>as no fee simple of Inheritance shal be left for any English,
&amp;c.</hi> All this (we say) is so notoriously false, as the plaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is therin to be found. First for that nothing proposed in
this <hi>Memorial</hi> is firmely established or set downe by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
but only suggested to be considered of,<note place="margin">Memorial part. 3. C. 4.</note> secondly it is
both often and expresly prouided in this book, that the old
auncient lawes customes and vses of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, how so euer some
of them may seeme incommodious, and different from other
natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in diuers poynts, yet are they not easily to be chaunged
or altered, but rather conserued and persited, by other good
things to be added vnto them, which being considered, and
the peeuish and maligne calumniation of these men therby
vnderstood, we shal leaue them to their wrangling and lying
humour and so passe to set downe the said promised preface
of the memorial whose title is this.

conceyue of the Authors whole drift and meaning, which he
prosecuteth afterwards according to the former three parts,
to wit of the whole body iointly, and then of the Cleargie,
Churches, schooles and vniuersityes particularly, and lastly
of the laity or temporalty, making 10. Chapters of the first

and sundry most excellent obseruations concerning

his endeauors, whome they haue neyther vertue nor
ability to imitate.</p>
               <p>It were ouer long and not standing with our purpose of
breuity in this place to alleadge (as we might) many excellent
places out of this memorial for our comfort, yet some few
peeces shal we touch as it were for a tast, and to discouer these
mens malitious enuying humour. The first Chapter of the
first part hath this inscription. <hi>Some special reasons why England
aboue all other Realmes ought to procure a perfect reformation when
tyme shal serue, &amp;c.</hi> And then it followeth in the Chapter
thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>If euer nation vnder heauen were bound to shew themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
grateful to almighty God,<note place="margin">The first cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of the first parte of the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial.</note> and turne hartily and zealously
vnto him, and to seek his highest glory by a perfect refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of their countrey, when his diuyne Ma. shal open the
way, it is the English nation for these reasons following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:20479:65"/>
First for that no other nation in the world,<note place="margin">Fauours of God.</note> on whome
God hath layd the scourge of heresy hath receaued so many
helpes and graces to resist the same, as England hath done,
which is euident by the multitude and valour of English
Martyrs, by the fortirude and zeale of so many and such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
by the constancy, patience, and feruour at home, by
the store of Seminaryes abroad, and by the seruent spirit of
priests brought vp in them and by many other fauors and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges
vsed towards the English nation in these our dayes.
All which do require an extraordinary demonstration of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes
in English Catholiks when the tyme shal serue, to
be answerable in some sort to these extraordinary benefits.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This is his first reason, wherunto he addeth 4. more of no
lesse moment, which we notwithstanding are forced for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nityes
sake to pretermit, our intention being only to giue a
tast, both of the argument handled in this book, and of the
maner how it is handled, yet for that the fourth reason being
further considered by vs, seemeth to beare with it an euident
demostration as wel of <hi>F. Persons</hi> syncere and plaine meaning
as also of his good opinion of these priests that now make so
many clamors against him, we are induced to set it downe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
being wrytten, as is euident, before these broyles fel out.
VVherfore let vs heare yf yow please his words.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Fourthly (saith he) the facility and commodity that there
is and wilbe in England to make this perfect reformation,
whensoeuer God shal reduce that countrey doth greatly
conuite and oblige vs to the same, for we shal not fynd that
difficulty &amp; resistance by the grace of God in England,<note place="margin">F. Persons hope of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.</note> which
good men do find in diuers other Cath. Countreyes,for brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
in of any reformation that is attempted, and that which
the very Prophets found euer among the Iewes, and that
Christ himselfe did find among the scribes and pharasyes, to
wit, the repugnance, of corrupt, peruerse &amp; stubborne people
that wil contradict and resist their owne benefit; we are not
like to find (I say the infinite mercy of our Sauiour be blessed
for it) eyther backward bishop or dissolute priests, or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious
religious men or women, to oppose themselues
<pb facs="tcp:20479:66"/>
against so holy a designment, as this our reformation is; or if
any one such should creep in among the rest, he would not
dare to shew himselfe, nor should he fynd followers: all is
now zeale and integritie in our new Cleargy: (almighty God
be thanked for it) and no lesse in our laity and Catholike
gentlemen of England, that haue borne the brunt of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for so many yeares; so as if we should want the effects
of a true and sound reformation at the next change againe, it
would be for want of some zealous men to sollicite and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the same. For on the behalfe of the Realme &amp; Countrey
I persuade my selfe most certaynly, that there will be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
which ought to animate such as feele the zeale of gods
glory within their breasts to ioyne hands togeather (as S.
Luke sayth all Apostolike men did in the primatiue Church)
and each one to seek aboue other to haue a part in the happy
procuration of so holy and important a worke.</p>

               <p>These are his words. And by this now may any man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider

               </q>
               <p>Thus he wryteth with much more of this first sort of men,
which we are forced to passe ouer for auoyding prolixitie;
and no lesse charitably wryteth he of the second sort called
commonly Schismatikes, of whome he sayth thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>As for Schismatikes or close or weake Catholiks that haue

               </q>
               <p>Thus he wryteth and then sheweth the best and most pious
manner of reconciling them, and from thence passeth to the
third poynt which concerneth heretikes, as wel such as easily
wil returne, whome he iudgeth most courteously to be dealt
with all, as with those that are obstinate, towards whome,
and their reduction he persuadeth most charity, labour, and
patience to be vsed, standing longest vpon this poynt of all
other. And surely to shewe the charitable disposition of this
man, most contrary to that which the enuy of his emulators
do point out and ascribe vnto him we are resolued in this place
contrary to our former purpose to set downe some good part
of his speech in this behalfe which is this ensuing.</p>

all wayes to conuince them yf it be possible of their errors,
<pb facs="tcp:20479:67"/>
&amp; this by reason and sweet meanes, as farre as may be, wherof
I shal touch some particulars in this place.</p>
                  <p>And first of all perchaunce it would be good considering
the present state of the Realme, and how generally and deeply
it is, &amp; hath byn plunged in all kynd of heresyes not to presse,
any mans conscience at the beginning for matters of religion
for some few yeares, to the end that euery man may more
boldly and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ntly shew his wounds, and be cured therof,
which otherwise he would eyther couer, deny or dissemble
to his greater hurt and more daungerous corruption of the
whole body. But yet it may be prouided ioyntly that this
toleration be only with such as lyue quietly and are desyrous
to be informed of the truth, and do not preach or teach, or
seek to infect others And by experience it hath byn seene
that this kind of suffering and bearing for a tyme hath done
great good and eased many difficultyes in diuers townes ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
vp in the low countreyes, which being mitigated at
the beginning with this entrance of clemency neuer greatly
cared for heresyes afterwards.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This is the beginning of his discourse, wherof he addeth
afterwards many reasons, &amp; setteth downe also diuers meanes
&amp; wayes in particular, how heretikes might best be persuaded
or conuinced, wherof one is, free, publike and in different dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
to be graunted them, with most equal and sure Lawes
and conditions, wherof he saith thus.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>But for conuincing their vnderstanding in matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy,
<note place="margin">A publique disputation vvith the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks.</note> I could wish that a playne contrary course were
taken by vs towards them, from that which they haue vsed
towards vs, seing that our cause doth beare it, which is of
contrary state and condition to theirs, for wheras their cause
being false and infirme, they would neuer consent to come to
any indifferent tryal or disputation with the Catholiks, I
would wish, that seing our cause is true and substantial,
and the more it is tryed, the more it wil appeare, that
once at least at the beginning ful satisfaction were giuen
by all English Catholiks to them, and all other heretiks
of the world, by as ful free, equal and liberal disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20479:67"/>
as possibly could be deuised within our Realme, &amp;c.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Thus he wryteth, and then setteth downe diuers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
about the meanes, lawes and conditions that might be
prescribed for the good preformance of this affayre, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluding
in these words.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>And thus much for gayning of those,<note place="margin">Pag. 51.</note> that haue byn decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by error, and are of good nature, and think they do wel,
and do hold a desyre to know the truth and follow the
same, and finally do hope to be saued as good Christians, and
do make accompt of an honest and true conscience, though
they be in heresy, &amp;c.</p>
               </q>
               <p>So saith he, and much more which we omit; and by this
we may see in part this mannes disposition, &amp; that he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
nothing of himself, but only propoundeth to be taken
or left in parte or in whole, as shalbe thought best. And thus
much for a tast of the first part of this Memorial.</p>
               <p>The second part of this worke concerneth the Cleargy,<note place="margin">The second parte of the Memorial.</note> contayning Bishops, Priests, Churches, vniuersities, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious

               <q>
                  <p>Hauing to speak of the Cleargie in general which God
from the beginning of his Church vouchsafed to name his
owne portion, for that they were dedicated more peculiarly
then other men to his diuine seruice, and our Sauiour to cal
them by the most honorable name of <hi>the light of the world and

                        </gap> Cleargie.</note> the first point of all to be remembred vnto
them, seemeth to be, that yf euer there were a tyme wherin
the effect of these names were needful to be shewed, and put
in execution, it wilbe now at the begining of our countreys
next conuersion, whose fal and affliction may perhaps in great
part be ascribed to the want of these effects in former tymes
past, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And furthermore it may be considered, that the State of
the Cleargie in England after our long desyred reduction and
happy entrance of some Cath. Prince ouer vs, and after so
<pb facs="tcp:20479:68"/>
long and bitter storme of cruel persecution, wilbe much like
vnto that which was of the general Church of Christendome
in tyme of the first good Christian Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> the
great,<note place="margin">The state of the church in Constantines dayes.</note> after the bloudy persecutions of so many infidel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
that went before him for thre hundred yeare togeather,
at what tyme as God on the one side prouided so many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
zealous and learned men for the establishing of his
Church as appeareth by the three hundred and eightene most
worthy Bishops gathered togeather in the first general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of <hi>Nice,</hi> so on the other side the diuel ceased not to styrre
vp amongest the Cleargie of that tyme diuers and sundry di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions,
emulations, contentions, some of indiscreet zeale
against such as had fallen and offended in tyme of persecution,
and some other grounded vpon worse causes of malice, emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
and ambition, tending to particular interest, wherby
both that good Emperour in particular and all the Church of
God in general were much troubled and afflicted, and many
good men scandalized, and God almighties seruice greatly
hindred, and the common enemy comforted.</p>
                  <p>And considering that the tymes, men, matters and occasions
may chaunce to fal out very like or the same in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
it shalbe reduced to the Catholike faith againe, great
and special care is to be had, least semblable effects should also
follow to the vniuersal preiudice of our common cause.</p>
                  <p>VVherfore this ought to serue as a preparatiue both for
our Prince and people, to put on the same pious and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
mynd that <hi>Constantyne</hi> did,<note place="margin">A considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the prince and people.</note> to beare patiently with the
infirmityes of men, and remedy all matters the best he may,
and the people, but especially priests to beware of like deceyt
of the diuel, and among other things if perchance in tyme of
persecution cause hath byn giuen or taken of offence or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
betweene any persons whatsoeuer, that haue laboured in
Gods seruice and do tend al to one end, to procure effectualy
now, that it be altogeather cut of, and put in obliuion, and
this especially amongst the Cleargie, and by their meanes also
amongst others. And if there should be any vnquiet or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
spirit found, that vnder any pretence would sow, or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20479:68"/>
reap, or maytaine diuision, that the holy Apostles counsel be
followed with him, which is to note and eschue him to the
end that all may ioyne cheerfully and zealously to the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vp of this great and important worke of reformation.
And thus much for concord.</p>
               </q>
               <p>This is his beginning of the second part, and conforme
therunto is the prosecution therof, shewing in the second and
third chapters <hi>how bishopricks, deanryes, and other cheefe prelatyes
ought to be prouided with the first and what maner of men are to be
procured for them.</hi> And wheras some of these calumniators,
haue giuen out and wrytten also in books, that this father
would first destroy the auncient subordination and hierarchie
of the english Church this is refuted by the very titles of
these chapters and much more by his whole discourse therin,
and secondly haue affirmed that he would haue no clergie
man to haue any propriety in any ecclesiastical lyuing, but
only to be put to pensions, this also is euidently false, in Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks,
deanryes, Archdeanryes Canonryes and the like, as
may appeare in the chapter heere mentioned; for that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suadeth
these first of all to be prouided of incumbents and
thirdly it is no lesse false in particular cures and common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices,
as is cleare by that he suggesteth Cap. 2. for their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
with fit men by way of opposition and trial both
for learning and maners. And wherof then thinke yow
arose the calumniations of putting priests to pensions? yow
shal heare it out of the fathers owne words:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>I haue spoken before (saith he) of English preachers to be

                        </gap>7.</note> allotting to euery bishop so many as may be had for that
purpose, and that he deuyde them as he shal thinke most
needful, and that for some yeares it wilbe more commodious
perhaps for the publike and more liberty for the preachers &amp;
priests themselues to haue no appropriation or obligation to
any particular benefices, but ample commission rather for all
parts, with a sufficient stipend to liue vpon, vntil things be
better setled.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Lo heere that which is spoken to great good purpose for
<pb facs="tcp:20479:69"/>
some few preachers only to be free from any particular
charge, and this for a while, to the end, they may attend to all
places, is turned odiously by these men to all priests in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
VVhat wil yow say of this malitious kynd of dealing?
but the narrownesse of this place suffereth vs not to passe
herein any further.</p>
               <p>There remayneth then the third part of this book concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the laytie,<note place="margin">The third perte of the Memorial.</note> conteyning the Prince with his counsel, the
nobility &amp; communalty, and hath this title in the first chapter
therof: <hi>Of the laity &amp; temporalty in general, &amp; of their agreement,
and concurrance with the Cleargie most needful for both their good, the
difference also of both their states.</hi> And then the Chapter begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>By that which I haue spoken in the first Chapter and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of this memorial about Cleargymen,<note place="margin">Cap. 1. 3. part.</note> the difference
and distinction may appeare, that is betwixt these two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal

to wit the Cleargie and layty, which is a distinction obserued
from the very beginning of Christian religion,<note place="margin">The distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>argy and laity.</note> and the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue

<note place="margin">Tertul l. de Monog.</note> And before that againe <hi>Tertullian</hi> a most learned and auncient
wryter not only setteth downe the same distinction of cleargy

vnto the same, so aboue all other things is it of importance,
that he be wel affected and disposed, and so much the more
in England aboue other countreys, by how much greater,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20479:69"/>
and eminent his authority is, and power with the people,
more then in diuers other places, by which meanes it hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to passe, that England hauing had more store of holy
kings in ancient tymes then many other contreys togeather,
came to haue also religion and piety more abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly setled
by their meanes then diuers realmes about them, &amp;c. Thus
there.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The 3. Chapter is of the <hi>nobility and gentry</hi> beginning in
these words:<note place="margin">Pag. 247. Nobility and ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try. Mem. Pag. 247.</note> 
                  <q>By the nobility of England, we do vnderstand
according to the fashion of other countreys, not only noble
men of title but <hi>gentlemen, esquyres, knights</hi> and other degrees,
that be aboue yeomen, husband men, and the communalty;
in which inferior sort of nobility beneath <hi>Barons</hi> (I meane of

obserued betwixt their degrees in forraine countreys, as in
ours, and I take ours farre the better, and more laudable

               <q>
                  <p>This nobility then and gentry being the cheef members
of our Realme, are carefully to be preserued by our Catholike
Prince in their ancient honors, dignityes, and priuiledges, and
whatsoeuer iniury or disestimation hath byn layd vpon them

what points the nobility of England hath byn iniured, disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
or oppressed to the end that supplication may be made
to the Catholike Prince for remedy therof.</p>
                  <p>And as the ancient nobility of England in tymes past came
to that dignity in the common-wealth, and to their credit &amp;
estimation, both with Prince and people, first for their piety
and zeale in Christian religion, and secondly for their fidelity
and valour in seruice of their prince and countrey, so their
heyres and posterity must conserue the same, by the self same
meanes, &amp;c. And so he followeth on with many other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations

knowen that it came forth with the consent, liking and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation

when this book was wrytten (English affayres standing as
they did, and do) then the matter of succession to our crowne,
wherof both religion and Realme, spirituality and tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
for the most part dependeth, especially the subiect of the
former book, (for two they are in number) is of such weight
and consideration, and so ought to be with Catholiks, as it

(yf they be Catholiks) so intemperatly to exclayme against
this book, which in the iudgment of farre wyser Catholiks
and more disappassionate then themselues was most needful
at that tyme, when it was wrytten, and is greatly profitable
now and wilbe most of all hereafter for so much as the first

religion aboue all other respects and considerations,<note place="margin">The effectes of the tvvo bookes of succession.</note> and the

with another of that contradicting company, yet hardly can
we yeild to thinke so basely of <hi>M. Pagets</hi> wit (howsoeuer his

of the king of Scotlands pretence to England, as of all other
princes and pretenders to that crowne besides, let the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

part which toucheth his Maiestie of <hi>Scotland,</hi> we neuer disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
any the least malice at all in the wryter, but rather a
very indifferent mynd to haue the vttermost right of euery
man knowne without offering wrong or iniury to any; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which indifferency the said king of <hi>Scotlands</hi> title
is set downe in the very first place in that book as first and
cheef pretender among the rest, neyther is there any one
thing emitted (to our knowledge) that truly and rightly may
be said or added in setting out of the same title. And when
the exceptions made by the opposite pretenders against him
are declared, nothing is auouched, which is not openly
knowne to be true neyther any thing vrged or exaggerated
more, then against the rest: neyther doth this flattering ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
<hi>discouerer</hi> so much as obiect any such thing done or
attempted by the author of this conference, nor can he with
any shew of truth so do. And if the said author any where
doth shew lesse desyre of the aduancement of the King of
<hi>Scots</hi> his title towards England (which yet in words we find
not expressed) while he is of different religion from him, and
no Catholike, his Maiestie is wise inough to consider that he
could not do otherwise according to the cheef and mayne
principle set downe throughout that book about the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of true religion (that is to say Catholike) required in all
pretenders that must or may be admitted by Catholike sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
VVhich principle being granted (as in the <hi>Conference</hi>

necessary principle, it followeth (we say) that the author
being a Catholike could not possibly according to the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of that religion (though otherwise he louing and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing

               <p>Nether can this flattering <hi>discouerer,</hi> or his mutinous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teners
(how desyrous soeuer of gayning fauour) say or do
the contrary, yf they be Catholikes (as they professe) and
haue Catholike consciences, and wil conforme their actions
therunto, for that all true Catholike doctrine and piety is
against them in this behalf.</p>
               <p>And finally whatsoeuer this maleuolous calumniator
doth prattle in this place of the Authors euil affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the king of <hi>Scotland</hi> to grace himselfe by another

ly in his book,<note place="margin">VVhy the Iesuits are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called out of England.</note> but in effect, these are the principal, to wit,
that the said Fathers being of a spiritual body which besides

cannot but haue more force, skil, and vse in spiritual manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of soules, then euery other priest, that lacketh those
particular helpes. And consequently to remooue them out of

then any other sort of men can, which is no smal point of

assurance of Catholikes in like cases. And then they being

he seemeth to me to take away not only the salt of that land,
but euen the Sunne also of that afflicted Church, &amp;c.</q> Thus
wrote he, and this was his iudgement both of the matter and
men.</p>
               <p>And hauing thus determined their first demaund, he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to treat the second in the Chapter following making
this title therunto:<note place="margin">Cap. 32.</note>

mynds (and to speake most temperatly) their imprude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,

reasons and testimonyes also of principal English men that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20479:85"/>
are no Iesuits whose iudgments &amp; opinions about this point
of the fathers gouernment he had required by letters as wel
from <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Flanders Spaine</hi> and other places, who all
agreed, that it was neyther conuenient nor possible (without
ouerthrowing all) to depriue the Seminaryes of the Fathers
gouernment and assistance. And as for reasons he alleadgeth
diuers, saying among the rest, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Si impotenti &amp; lubricae isti aetati fraena laxentur, vt in sua manu po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situm

                  <q>If the bridle of matters should so be
let loose vnto this impotent and britkle youth, so as they
should vnderstand that it lay in their hands to be gouerned
of whome it pleaseth them; who doth not see whether the
matter would come at length?</q> to wit, euery day to change
their Superiors, and demaund new maisters, teachers, and
the like. And then he demaundeth them where they would
find so many sufficient and expert priests both able and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to take the labour to gouerne so many Seminaryes, both
in <hi>Rome, Spaine</hi> &amp; <hi>Flanders?</hi> Diuers other reasons &amp; conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
he alleadgeth which we are forced for breuityes sake
to omit; But thus yow see their two principal demaunds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyded negatiuely.</p>
               <p>But yet he resteth not heere, but goeth further to treat of
the remedy and reformation of the troubles raysed by those
seditious, and so frameth his sequent Chapter therof vnder
this title: <hi>Quaenam remediae praesentibus his tumultibus videantur, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibendae;

33. <q>what remedyes were best to be vsed for pacyfying these

               </p>
               <p>And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> passing a step further, he sheweth that the way to

or to remit any thing in discipline for their outcryes: <hi>nisi

                  <q>Except perhaps
any man would say, that the most easiest and commodious
way to tame the fury of violent wanton colts, were to take
quite away their bridles and let them runne &amp; do what they
list.</q> Lo his opinion being a stranger vnto vs; and what
coltish behauiour he saw in some of our troublesome at that
day to make him haue this conceyt is easie to gesse.</p>
               <p>But what would he say now, if he were aliue to see some

fearcely wanton? would he not giue counsel (think yow)
not only to put on bridles and sadles, but also good spurres
for their better taming?</p>
               <p>And this if wee respect their merits and deserts, but as the
same good Cardinal notwithstanding all this, when he
cometh to put downe his iudgment in particular how the
said tumultuous should be dismissed and sent away, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suadeth
it to be donne with all sweetnes and gentle vsage; so
would he do no doubt in this other case of our new turbulét
crew, if he were in <hi>Rome</hi> at their arriual these. And the like
course by all probabilitie wil his Hol. according to his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed

we all do most earnestly desyre and that all may be wel and

               <p>And yet to prosecute the argument of this Chapter som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
further, to the effect we haue begone, we cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertise
our said brethren of their great folly and indiscretion in
taking this course of clamors in their way towards Rome for
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecouering as they pretend their same, nothing being more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary theirunto then to professe a cause so many

Hol. owne <hi>Breues,</hi> partly by this Card. sentence of visitation,
you haue already heard, especially they adding publikely
two circumstances, which must needs with his Hol. make
their matter farre worse.</p>
               <p>The first, that whoras in the former styrres of Rome,<note place="margin">1. Naughty circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stance.</note> it was
but suspected that heretiks and the common enemy had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
their hand therin, and were eyther ayders or abetterers
to make those demaunds of remouing Iesuits from England
and from the Colledges, now it is openly knowen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
that they are the cheef dealers and styrrers therunto.</p>
               <p>The second not much vnlike to this, is,<note place="margin">2. VVicked circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> that wheras in the
former broyles of Rome, some of the troublesome did vnder
hand only and by indirect meanes seek to bring in some prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Embassadors, to fauour their sedition by making it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of State, as though they had byn contradicted only by
men depending of <hi>Spaine:</hi> now these our brethren do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
in the sight of all the world attempt the same seditious
course, by running to <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aris,</hi> and seeking to informe falsely his
most Christian Maiestie that he hath interest in their tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations,
and that it is a matter of State for him to fauour them,
for that they oppose themselues against Spaniards and
Iesuits deuoted to them, VVhich vnchristian deuise, tending
to set Christian princes togeather by the eares about our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
affayres, as it cannot be but odious to God and all good
men that heare of it, so aboue all other it is iniurious to his
Holines whose spiritual authority and ordinations are dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
by these men to matters of state (as we haue before both
in the Apologie, and this book noted) about his Hol. institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Archpriest malitiously drawne by them to matter
of <hi>Premunire,</hi> and no lesse malitious is this to entangle now
their obedience to wards his Holines with interest of secular
princes.</p>
               <p>For we would aske them heere seriously in all law of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or honesty,<note place="margin">A point to be considered of tumultuous proceeding.</note> what can it concerne the <hi>state,</hi> eyther of the

the Ecclasiastical substitute of his Holines in England? Is
<pb facs="tcp:20479:87"/>
this to be made a matter of state by these new Statists? is this
a thing to intrecat secular Princes and monatches with all? no
truly, but only where there is intent to set sedition, and to
put in garboyle and variance secular princes with the Pope, &amp;
therby themselues to be free to say and do what they list vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

and to break with the Pope himself, protesting on the other
syde no lesse obedience then these men do now, though we
hope these meane better, but the course is not vnlike nor other
effects hitherto.</p>

               <p>But yet further it shal not be amysse to ponder also what

not only haue his fauour and enioy honors in his court and
common welth, but be vsed and trusted also by him aboue
other men, and such as would not, though he meant not to
put them to death, yet would he exclude them from his
frendship and familarity, and from all dignityes, &amp;c. This
being done, <hi>euery man</hi> began (say the forsaid authors) to shew
his affection, some retyred themselues with greef and sadnes,
some held their peace, some denyed flatly, but none of all
these had intention to please the Prince in his demaund:
others there were, that thinking by this occasion to wyn the
spurres, and get themselues credit and authority aboue the rest,
came fawning to <hi>Constantius</hi> and his officers, offering to do

but rather (as noble mynds are wont to do) wil conceaue the

God almighty should at length mooue their harts (for which
we pray dayly) to harken vnto that most honorable and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

some toleration in religion, wherof these men also do whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

yet do we most certainely assure our selues, knowing
the grauity, honor, and wisdome of our <hi>Counsel</hi> as We do, that
this is but a vayne vaunt; and that when God shal inspire
them to harken to this proposition, they wil deale with other
manner of men of the Cathol. party then these, who being
deuided from the rest, that is from the body, head, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal

And so much of this.</p>
               <p>There remayneth to say a word or two of forraine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Their credit vvith for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine princes.</note>
whose fauour they seek to gayne by this their dissenting
from their fellowes, as namely with the king of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to
whome they sent first to offer themselues, as diuers wayes we
vnderstand, and after that to the K. of <hi>France</hi> by their knowne
Agents in <hi>Paris,</hi> promising to be at his disposition, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb facs="tcp:20479:91"/>
themselues against all pretences for <hi>Spayne,</hi> &amp;c. but these
are deuises so ordinary in court, and with so great Monarches
as these are (we meane to offer mountaynes, and to curry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
by accusing others) that it cannot worke any great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
in them, especially considering how litle these men
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do eyther <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra</hi> in the weighty affaire which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
about the succession of <hi>England,</hi> and this, whether we
consider eyther the protestant party or the Catholike of our
realme, for that with the former they haue but very poore
credit hitherto, except they go forward, and with the second
perhaps much lesse except they turne backevvard; and so for
the tyme they rest betweene both, which the wisdome of
princes and their counselors wil soone espy and discerne; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
his Maiestie of <hi>Scotland</hi> (being very wise as he is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
wil easily heare and come to know,<note place="margin">His Maiest. of Scotland.</note> that since they dealt
with him by their late messengers to offer their seruices, they
haue dealt againe another way in England, and haue deuised
a new discourse about the successio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as we are credibly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
more to the taste of some great personages of our <hi>State,</hi>
whose present fauour they most desyre.</p>
               <p>He wil ponder furthermore, that if they be truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
as they pretend, then can they not with a good conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
to God and to their owne religion desire sincerely, and from
their harts, whatsoeuer they say or pretend, his Maiesties go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
ouer Catholiks, except he be of the same religion,
which if it were, then is the desire of his preferment not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
theirs, but common to all Catholiks: and if it be not, then
are they in the case of those flatterers of <hi>Constantius,</hi> wherof
we spake before, and not vnlike to be so esteemed by him as
those were by the other, though not so roughly handled.
And finally his Maiestie of <hi>Scotland</hi> wil weigh and remember
that whatsoeuer these men do say or doe, they being of so
smal consideration and credit as they are, and so mutable as
we haue shewed, and their motiues so weake and passionate
(as by their owne wrytings and doings appeareth) no great
account is to be made therof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:20479:91"/>And the like may be said of his Maiestie of <hi>France,</hi> who
being so great and potent a monarch as he is, must needs euery
day haue store of such poore sawning people running vnto
him for their owne interests, but yet with pretence of offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
seruices against <hi>Spayne,</hi> whome though in wisdome and
law of princely royalty he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not presently reiect, yet conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with maturity of former points and circumstances, to
wit, what they are, why they come, from whome and against
whome? what grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds they haue to worke vpon, to what end
they tend, what they can performe, and other the like, he
wil quickely both discouer and discard them, for seing by his
wisdome, that to deale much with these men, can neyther be
honorable not profitable, as tending rather, to alienate then
oblige, or gayne the Catholike party in England. And this
wil prooue the true euent of this action, if we be not decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and when they shal haue spent in <hi>Paris</hi> the good som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
of money which they carryed out of England with them,
and shal want the supplyes, which now perhaps they hope
and expect, and shal heare from all places (as already they do
and wil daylie more and more) the general bad opinion that
is of them among all good Catholikes, both English and
other, they wil then begin (if we be not deceyued) to see the
folly of this bad and mad course taken in hand, which we
beseech God they may so do before it be to late to amend
it. And this is all we shal say of this matter, for the

for better knowing him.</p>
                  <p>His coming out of England and maner therof we know not
in particular, nor greatly doth it import, only we know that
he came to the English Seminary of <hi>Rhemes</hi> in <hi>France</hi> a poore
litle begging boy,<note place="margin">The being of VV. vvatson at Rhemes.</note> where being taken of charity, his first allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wance
was for a good tyme pottage only and licking the
dishes which other men had emptied before him: after this
he was admitted to serue at the table, and carry away dishes:
after that againe he was admitted to make beddes, swepe
chambers and other like offices belonging thervnto, in which
kynd he serued especially one <hi>M. Boast</hi> a good priest and a holy

the squint eyed boy (for so he called him) would haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
so wicked a man he should neuer haue comen (no doubt)
within his chamber dore. And yet further yow must note,
that all this while <hi>VVil. VVats.</hi> besides his poore estate vvas
the most contemptible and ridiculous thing in all that house
for many yeares, for that his grace was in tumbling and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

was fitly made, and so he passed by the name of <hi>wil was,</hi> or

But at length after diuers yeares pretending much humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

and not hauing eyther sufficient wit or learning (but

he fel into diuers great disorders and absurdityes, wherof one
was his foule fal by going to the protestants Church, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
also the discouery of many Catholiks to the persecutors,
wherof <hi>M. Bishop</hi> (if you remember) speaketh, in his depositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s

<pb facs="tcp:20479:97"/>
of the particular circumstances) was in this doleful wise:</p>
                     <p>After that I had byn two dayes in <hi>Durance</hi> I (hearing that
I should be vrged to go to the heretical Church) wickedly
determined (after a great though short conflict had with my
self) to preuent their euil attempt by pernicious pollicy, in
requesting conference with some learned protestant, which
being graunted,<note place="margin">His perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pollicy.</note> I did (though faynedly yet altogeather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully)
so farre condescend by a litle and a litle vnto him,
that lastly I went to their heretical seruice, with this intent
(and truly with none other at that tyme God he knoweth)
thinking therby to haue escaped their hands, adding herunto
a blynd supposition, that in such an obscure place, I should
not giue scandal to any Catholike by that wicked act, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
(those being compelled oftentymes that wil not come
voluntarily) it should not be knowne (til I had escaped)
whether I came without or with my owne accord.</p>
                     <p>But as this was a meere dissimulation with my Sauiour,
so did he iustly punish me for the same: for as soone as I had
<note n="*" place="margin">let him also thinke of his novv.</note> depriued my selfe of his heauenly grace, I had no power to
resist that which before I did alwayes most detest and abhorre:
so that where I thought by schismatical pollicy to haue dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
with God almighty vntil I might haue escaped the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds
of men, and so to haue returned vnto his holy Church againe,
he most iustly (seing my presumptuous sinne) gaue myne eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes
power ouer me in such sort, that although both at the
court and other places in the tyme of my durance, I had vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

that my shew of coming to the Church should not
serue, except I vvould reueale such things vnto him) that I
most sinfully at the last did condescend vnto his diuelish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
though at the first I was of that mynd, rather to haue
suffered death then to haue proceeded to any further wicked<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Thus farre we thought good to recite of his owne letter,
pretermitting a great deale more that followeth, wherin
he setteth downe the particular acts and circumstances of his
bewraying and betraying Catholiks, for which he confesseth
that he was so much eschued and abhorred by all Catholiks, as
he complayning therof sayth:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>My burden is too great already for me to beare, but that
God of his mercy, I trust, wil ease me with this grace, yet I
feele none so great discomfort now in my misery, as the want
(I dare not say of charity) but of compassion amongst Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks
of this my wretched state, in so much that it is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to deny me bodily releefe (as some hard harts haue
done,<note place="margin">VV. VVat aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doned by all Catholiks.</note> in refusing to help me with a cup of cold water, or a
glasse of beere) but further those that pitty this my wretched
lyfe are glad to hold their peace, least they should be suspected
for speaking in my cause, and therfore are priuately warned
by their frends not to medle with or in my defence, if they
wil escape blame. I therfore humbly desyre all good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks,
first of forgiuenesse for that which is past: secondly of
their charity to iudge of me no worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they know: thirdly
if they can accuse me of any crime, wherof I haue not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and do not accuse my selfe for Gods sake let me know it,
and appoint the punishment due vnto me for the same and I
wil withal my hart submit my selfe vnto their censure, and
vndertake the payne. Last of all, wheras I heare that diuers are
incensed against me (by wrong informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truly as I suppose)
in accusing me of a new, great and fearful sinne in presuming
to celebrate being in the state of excommunication, or at least
of irregularity (as they say) wherby (if it were so) I haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
a new irregularity &amp; consequently a great sinne,<note place="margin">He had more need to look to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter novv.</note> if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
ignorance did not mitigate the offence (as I doubt
not but it would) as being a thing wherof as yet I neuer
stood in doubt and therfore had no cause to examine the case.
I wil therfore set downe my case plainly according to the
true confession which I haue already made and set downe in
this wryting, and that is, first that my lamentable fall was

publike in respect of my schisme and alienation from Gods
Church not by publike reuolt at the barre before a iudge, but
before ciuil magistrats in a court of common causes. Secondly
my great syn of accusation which diuines do cal <hi>Clerici percus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio</hi>
was not publike, nether in respect of the company nor
place, but priuate as wrytten in my chamber or wards, and
sent vnto that wicked Tyrant (very wickedly indeed) closed
vp like a letter, &amp;c.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Heere lo yow may see VV.VV. his accusation of his owne
offences, which grace would God he had not lost synce; and
that this is his owne style yow may iudge in part by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
he hath made in his book of <hi>Quodlibets</hi> about the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of his parentheses, misliked (he sayth) by some Readers.
Secondly yow see after his accusation and confession, both a
complaint against the seuerity of some Catholiks, with some
excuse of himself. The complaint we thinke verily to be
false: for what Catholike (thinke yow) would deny a cup of
water, or a glasse of beere (except there where no glasse in the
house) to so miserable a poore fellow standing in bodily need,
though neuer so much spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>itually offending by his fault? As

made diligent inquiry and do fynd that the said Father was
borne in the parish of <hi>Stowey</hi> in <hi>Somerset shire</hi> in the yeare
1546. a yeare before <hi>K. Henry</hi> died to which parish there
came soone after out of <hi>Deuonshire</hi> to be vicar their (for parson
their is none) <hi>Iohn Hayward</hi> a vertuous good priest that had byn
a cannon regular before, and this man liued there for 30. yeares
togeather, vntil after <hi>F. Persons</hi> departure out of England, who
hauing byn his master in the latyn tongue, and liking his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes
in learning did euer afterward beare a special affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
towards him, all the tyme he liued, but yet was ther neuer any

that tyme, neyther could there be with any probability, the
one being borne (as we haue said and appeareth by the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

is it likely, that he should haue byn called <hi>Persons</hi> (as they
fondly say) for that this priest was a parson, seing that benefice
is no personage but a vicaridge as all men know: and more
like it is he should haue byn called Hayward after the said
priests name, and not by his office if he had byn his sonne:</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, as in our Apologie we haue said <hi>F. Persons</hi> had
fiue brothers &amp; systers elder then himselfe by the same mother

                  <p>Finally we haue shewed in our said Apologie that his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
were right honest people, and of the most substantial of
their degree among their neighbours while they liued, and
his Father was reconciled to the Cath. Church by <hi>M. Bryant</hi> the
martyr, and his mother a graue and vertuous matron liuing
diuers yeares, and dying in flight and out of her countrey for
her conscience, and was neuer so much as suspected for any
such matter as these wicked companions haue deuised. And if
there were no other argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but that neyther <hi>F. Persons</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
nor any frend of his had neuer any doubt or least scruple
therof hitherto (as may appeare by that neyther in his entring

(if it were otherwise secret and not knowen before) but much

in all their bookes they do, wherin we can say no more (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering,

he frameth to himselfe therof, and yet presumeth to know
more then others. His syn also of rayling and bitter slaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole company of Iesuits in this libel is so much the
more wicked and odious both to God and man, by how much
the more he is beholding and most deeply obliged vnto them,
for that they both took him into the Colledge at <hi>Rome</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
fauour (being a poore rude seruing man before) and
vsed such special loue and charity towards him afterward
(to make somwhat of him) as moued enuy to many others.
And this is euident as wel by the testimony of all them that

speech though we approue not in the Apostata,
yet sheweth it the ingratitude of this fellow against those men
now, and so much the more in that he cannot but speake
against his owne conscience in so many malitious things as
he hath set downe contrary to that, which hertofore he hath
wrytten with his owne hand, and testified with his owne
mouth wherof good proofes are extant, and some yow haue

God graunt we see not him passe further then hitherto

                  <p>The first point concerning <hi>Appeale</hi> and matter of schisme,

the controuersy tatleth without any purpose at all, saying the
same in effect, but yet much lesse and worse then others of his

in this case, it is not their disclayming from being members of the
body of the Seminaryes but of another body,<note place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> videlicet, their owne society
that can excuse them, for that to be a schismatical member to a body is
suffiseth to be membrum genericum to that body, though not specificum

by this reuelation made of harts and mynds by this conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
English Catholiks do come to know what substance &amp;
weight there is in euery man, and how farre he may be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
when tyme shal require, which is a point of no smal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as matters stand with vs, for if this reuelation and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery

might haue byn equal to their naughty wil for setting of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and raysing broyles in our cause &amp; contrey; what reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles

               <p>VVel then,<note place="margin">Reuelation of 3. sorts of people.</note> and what wilbe the end, think yow, both of
men and matters in this affaire? Surely for the matter we haue
no doubt at all, but that it wil receaue vtility by this tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for that the holy ghost hath auouched it, <hi>factet cum tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione

and cleansed and our corne both winowed and purged.</p>
               <p>But as for the men that haue mooued this tempest, though
we would be loath to make our selues prophets in their
cause and successe, but rather do pray hartily for them, that it
may be good, yet if we wil consider matters according to the
former prophesies of scripture or els by the foresight of reason
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20479:116"/>
and discourse (which are the best grounds of prophesies of
temperate and wise men in these our dayes) we may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
make this triple coniecture that some (especially the
wryters &amp; publishers of these late libels and principal dealers
with the aduersaryes) are like inough (if God worke not a
miracle) to passe further, and become as <hi>Th. Bel</hi> and others haue
done before vpon like and perhaps lesse ground of passion, &amp;
malice; and these are to be deplored as yow see: others that do
offend vpon euil information only, or haue byn misled by
other mens persuasions, not seing the daunger wherunto they
are drawne wil (we trust) vpon sight of the truth returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and these are as hartily to be imbraced and highly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
as if they had neuer runne away, the ground therof not
being euil intention; but sinister information.</p>
               <p>A third sort there is, that probably wil stand indifferent, &amp;
doubtful for a tyme, and according to this, wil good mens
opinions be also of them, to wit dubious and vncertayne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they see the final issues of their actions, and thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
our Church of England as yow see, to knowe her people di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
as wel by manifestation of their actions as reuelation
of their thoughts which are the two effects mentioned; prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
by <hi>S. Symeon</hi> and <hi>S. Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It followeth that we say somwhat how Catholiks are to
beare themselues in this tyme of trial, which poynt may be
considered eyther in respect of the enemy, and persecutor, or
of the trouble some of our owneside, that vaunt to be in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit

but that the dutiful maner of carriage hitherto vsed by our

obedience and true spirit of Christian sufferance
(whatsoeuer these brabling people do or haue calumniated
them to the contrary) is absolutely the best way, and most
pleasing in the sight both of God and man, and the principal

mercy vpon vs and our countrey and inspire the harts both
of our Prince and State to deale more myldly and mercifully
with vs.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding if any question or matter should be
vrged against religion, faith or conscience in any one poynt
of Christian Catholike doctrine and beleef, therin it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for euery good man to stand firme and immoueable,<note place="margin">VVhere and vvhen Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks must stand immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable.</note> and
to say with the Apostles:<note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Oporiet mag is Deo obedire quam homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>
VVe must obay God more then men. And in this point
we do not thinke that any one religious Protestant in the
world holding his faith for true, would not do and say the
like, if the case were his, and concerned his religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the yeilding or going further of these our vnquiet
spirits in matters that be against true Catholike Doctrine,
&amp; to vrge other men also to the same for gayning to themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
some temporal fauour &amp; credit, or to make therby others
odious whome they enuy or mislike, is more perfidiousnesse
to God, then fidelity to the Prince or State, and so ought it to
be held by all men of wisdome and iudgment of what reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
soeuer, and no wayes to be imitated by those that be
true and sincere Catholiks. And thus much for their carriage
towards the Prince and state, and persecutors in Religion.</p>
               <p>And as for the second sort, which are our passionate disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
brethren, broken out from vs these monethes past by
intemperate heate of emulation and contention, the best dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that we can giue for Cath. mens behauiour and carriage
towards them is,<note place="margin">Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards the troublesome</note> as towards brethren and frends in a frenzie
or traunce, or as men rather possessed with violent and raging
spirits; that is to say to wish and worke all good vnto them
that may be procured by good meanes, but yet to beware of
comming into their fingers, or within their reach whiles they
remayne in the fit of their fury, and to the end we may know
and consider with what spirits they are possessed or ruled by
for the present albeit we haue discussed the matter somewhat
particularly in the preface of this book, and more largely
throughout our Apologie, but especially in the last Chapter
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20479:118"/>
therof, yet now hauing seene and discerned more of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and state by reading their later bookes and by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their proceeding and progresse in their affaires. VVe
meane in this place to ad somwhat to that which we haue
said before, noting first by the way, that the difference of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
betweene man and man,<note place="margin">Difference of spirit, vvhat great diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety it maketh.</note> is the greatest and most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
difference that in moral matters can be obserued which
holdeth also in beasts, byrds, and other creatures according to
the proportion of their inferior spirit or natural instinct, as for
example, two egges put in one nest, the one of a doue, the
other of a hauke do bring forth two yong byrds, whose bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
at the beginning are not so easily discerned as the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their spirits is seene as soone as they grow vp. And the
like is in the whelpes and cubbes of dogges and foxes the one
naturally running to mans conuersation the other flying,
which diuersity of spirit, and inward instinct, bewrayeth
quickely the contrariety of their natures, nor is this only seene
in creatures of diuers kynds, but euen in those that be of the
same, as two yong colts of one breed the one of a generous,
the other of a iadish inclination are so opposite the one to the
other in the whole course of their future lyfe by this diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sytie
of spirit as the one is of much value, the other contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</p>
               <p>And if this hold in horses &amp; other vnreasonable creatures,
that haue only the participation of the inferior sensual part of
soule or spirit, how much more is the difference to be noted in
man, whose higher part guiding all the rest, dependeth of the
worthinesse of his spirit for life and action, wherin two men
that be brethren in birth, and as like one to the other other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
as nature can proporture them, yet by this diuersity of
spirit may they be as opposite one to the other not only as
things of diuers kinds that be enemyes by nature, as haukes &amp;
doues wolues and lambes, foxes and dogges but farre more,
euen as much as heauen and hel. And this we se by example
as wel of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel Esau</hi> and <hi>Iacob, Lucifer</hi> and <hi>Michael</hi> borne
brethren, as also by euident reason, seing that the spirit of man

so as if that be naught, corrupted, peruerted or coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinate
with malice, enuy, pride, ambition, or other such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
and spiritual poysons, he followeth that with all viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
as a bark carried away vnder ful sayle with pernicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wynds
to her assured ship wrack vpon rockes of perdition.</p>
               <p>And on the contrary side he that is blessed of God with a
good spirit, he floweth on sweetly, though more softely and
calmely to the assured port of euer lasting saluation, and these
two men though neuer so like in shape of body, or neare in
propinquity of flesh, office, charge, degree, vocation or other
such coniunction vpon earth, yet are they indeed more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite

remayneth stil betweene men that participate the one or

other things wrytten of him by the prophets; but preached
further, and sheweth in his actions, the spirit of humility,
mansuetude, meekenes, patience, modesty, sobriety, truth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,

                  <note place="margin">Supra Cap. 5.</note> the true title being, <hi>A memorial for Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi> as hath byn declared; and then setting downe such
decrees (wheras indeed nothing is decreed but suggested only
throughout that book) as neuer were made, wrytte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or thought
of by the author, but rather the quite contrary.</p>
               <p>As for example they say, the first decree is, that when En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
shalbe restored to the Cath. faith, <hi>no orders of religious
people, shalbe suffered to returne into England or be permitted to liue
<pb facs="tcp:20479:131"/>
within the Brytans Ocean</hi> (as their words are) <hi>but only Iesuits &amp;
Capuchynes, &amp; this for that Capuchines taking no rent or temporal pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions,
the Iesuits shal remayne with all, &amp;c.</hi> VVheras first he that
readeth the said <hi>Memorial</hi> shal not fynd the Iesuits so much as
once named throughout all that book; and secondly there is
no speech of <hi>Brittish Ocean</hi> or <hi>Scotland</hi> therin contayned, but
only of England. And thirdly the plaine contrary to that
which they affirme is expressely set downe in diuers parts of
the said Memorial, to wit, that all religious orders approued in
the Church of God, without exception should be restored in
respect of the publike iniury done to all by their expulsion,
which is set downe in one place thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>And for that religious orders haue byn more defaced,<note place="margin">Memorial of Reform. part. 1. Cap. 7.</note> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored
&amp; persecuted in our realme, then in any other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
countrey in the world, perhaps it would be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient to
make such amends and recompence as is not besides in any
other kingdome, to wit that all the approued religious orders,
that are in the Church of God, should be called into Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
and placed iointly in the citty of <hi>London</hi> at least, for that it is
to be presumed, that this citty would be capable of all, and
from thence they might be deryued afterwards by litle &amp; litle
into other places of the Realme as commodity were offered,<note place="margin">About the restoring of religious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</note>
and as mens deuotions should require, and as they should be
proued to be most profitable and agreable to the state of our
countrey, but altogeather to be in <hi>London,</hi> and that in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of their first institution would be a most excellent
thing, and a priuiledge aboue all other kingdomes in the
world, where all religious orders are not seene togeather, and
much lesse in the perfection of their first institute and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance,
which ought to be the condition of admitting any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
into England at our next reformation, be they men or
women, to the end that the greater glory of God be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
in all things.</p>
                  <p>Thus saith the memorial in this place which is afterward
repeated againe vpon diuers occasions, as namely in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part and 6. chapter, where it is said: that as on the one
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20479:131"/>
side it is greatly desyred (as before hath byn noted) that all the
approued religious orders of Gods Church should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againe into England for more honorable satisfaction
of impietyes comitted against them in tymes past by their
eiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; so is there no lesse desyre of good men, that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
therof may be called, as wil promise the perfect obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of their first institution, and rule, and therby be true
lights and salt of our countrey indeed, &amp;c. This is there wryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
and now let euery one iudge how honest and true a man
he is, that putteth forth these <hi>Quodlibets,</hi> and so shamfully
auoucheth the contrary.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The second act enacted or Statute <hi>(saith he)</hi> made in that high infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Consistory,<note place="margin">Pag. 93.</note> was concerning Church &amp; Abbey lands, &amp;c. all which
must be vnder the holy Society of Iesus, presently vpon the establishing of
the spiritual monarchie, which done, their Father General must cal out
4. Iesuits and two secular priests, (who must be also demy Iesuits) &amp; these
six vicars (I pray God not of hell, for of heauen they are not) like six Duch
peeres shal haue the lands,<note place="margin">Pag. 94.</note> meanes, &amp;c. resigned ouer to their hands, for
to allow to Bishops, persons, &amp; Vicars, &amp;c. a competent stypend only to
liue on, euen as the Turkes Bassaes &amp; Genisaryes do lyue vnder him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus wryteth he as out of the said book wherof no one
word is there but all to the contrary.</hi> The third Statute <hi>(saith he)</hi>
was made concerning the nobility &amp; gentry, such as (to omit others) Sir
Robert Cecil, Sir Iohn Fortescue, &amp;c. with sundry other knights and
Squyres, all which were limited by that blynd prophane parlament, what
retinue they should keep, how much should be allowed them to spend
yearly, &amp;c. <hi>And do yow not think these men to be more then
half frantick that publish such deuises in print?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fourth Statute</hi> (saith he) <hi>was made concerning the common
lawes of this land, &amp; consisted in this principal poynt, that all the great
Charter of England must be burnt,<note place="margin">Pag. 94.</note> &amp; all the manner of holding lands in
fee simple, fee tayle, franke almayne, &amp;c. must be brought into villany,
schoggery and popularity, &amp;c.</hi> Thus he saith; but if yow read the
book it selfe yow shal find the playne contradictory of all
put downe in the said <hi>Memorial.</hi> For in the fourth Chapter of
the third part therof which is intituled: <hi>Of the Innes of Court and

study of common lawes, &amp;c.</hi> the whole course of the same lawes
is persuaded to he continued with supply of some points that
may be found wanting and reformation of others that may
be abused, so as all this heer alleadged is a meere fiction in
the ayre.</p>
               <p>The fifth Statute <hi>(saith he)</hi> was concerning Calumniation, with a
<hi>prouiso</hi> in the forsaid Statute that whosoeuer did offend a Iesuit, or
speak against this high Counsel of Reformation, it should be lawful for
the Fathers or their Synodical ministers to defame, detract &amp; calumniate
him or her at their pleasure; be who they shal be, noble peere, or Prince,
Bishop, Cardinal or the Pope himself, &amp;c. <hi>To this deuised Statute,
we know not what ro say, seing there was neuer any such
word or thought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The sixt Statute</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the forsaid high Counsel of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
may wery wel be called the Statute of Retractation, which is a hoate
counterblast to the former horneblast of Calumniation, &amp; it goes vnder
the tenour of a</hi> prouiso, <hi>that if such &amp; such things do happen, then the
persons defamed, contemned and condemned</hi> ad inferos <hi>aliue, shalbe as
highly exalted, aduaunced and elcuated</hi> ad caelos <hi>after their death, &amp;c.</hi>
This they wryte, which being matters of meere madnes, as
yow see, and neuer dreamed of by the author, deserue only
contempt and compassion for answere, especially seing that in
the end of all their babling about this book of reformation &amp;
Statutes therin conteyned, they conclude their whole treatese
thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Happie were some men,<note place="margin">Pag. 109.</note> yf they might but haue a sight of that Statute
book, &amp;c. No doubt, but he should fynd notable stuffe in it, that would
serue for many purposes, &amp;c.</hi>

                     </gap>
                  </note> This he seemeth to say of himself co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
herby that he neuer saw the book by him impugned, so
that whatsoeuer he hath set downe in almost 20. pages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
against the same is not ouely without book but also
must needs be forged and deuised hy himself. And this is
sufficient to shew the mans honesty and the credit of his
compagnions and cause.</p>
               <p>All which being considered litle more needeth to be said in
this place, for direction of discreet &amp; prudent Catholiks how
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20479:133"/>
to beare themselues (which is the argument of this Chapter)
in this tyme of controuersy and contention raysed by the
common aduersary and mayntayned by his instruments,
wherin we can say no more, but as the holy Apostle S. Iohn
said <hi>vnctio docebit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioan. 2.</note>
the sweet direction of Gods holy spirit wilbe
a sufficient guide vnto Catholiks in this behalf;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.</note> and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
or discerning of spirits so often and highly comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
by S. Paul,<note place="margin">Hebr. 5.</note> and by vs before recommended wil yeild abounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
light for the same.</p>
               <p>For he that shal but a litle consider with himself on what
side goeth the spirit of modesty,<note place="margin">Some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations for discerning the spirit of our conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</note> patience, longanimity, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
truth, charity, mortification, feare of God and the like,
and on the other side the playne contrary spirits of clamors,
rage, reuenge, enuy and emulation, audacious speches, disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
contempt, resistance, temerarious assertions, false and
slaunderous asseuerations, as out of their books haue byn she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.
He that wil weigh further with himself, where how
and when, and by what men, and against whome and vpon
what causes and motiues these emulations and contentions
were first begone, and haue byn continued synce and what
manner of men out of all sorts of discontented people haue
runne vnto them against their Superiors, maisters, Fathers, &amp;
benefactors, &amp; what ends the most of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue had or are like
to haue, according as in our<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 2. 3. 4. &amp; 5.</note> Apologie we haue declared. He
that wil ponder moreouer how, and by whome this great
worke of Englands conuersion was begonne, and hath byn
mayntayned synce, and is brought to the state wherin now it
standeth, and that the vnion of this body hath euer consisted
in due subordination of one to another, which these men now
cannot abide; it wilbe very easy to frame a sound iudgment
of the whole cause and men that handle it.</p>
               <p>For first denyed it cannot be, that priests and Iesuits ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

<hi>Doway, Rhemes, Rome,</hi> and other places afterwards, to wit, <hi>D.

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> did set this cause first on foot, and haue promoted the
same euer synce, with conioyned labors of teaching, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
wryting bookes and the like, and God hath prospered
their labors, as by the effects we see, which being so it is easy
to perceaue what spirit this is now which goeth about to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
and disioyne all this agayne, vnder fond and odious
pretences, that they are of diuers bodyes of diuers Societyes
and of different vocations? &amp;c. Is not this that diuelish spirit
of dispersing; so much detested by Christ himself in the ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?
Consider we pray yow, who do gather and who do
disperse.</p>
               <p>And then further yf we consider wherfore these dispersers
haue made all this trouble and diuision, all this foule breach in
our publike cause that was so highly honoured and admyred
by straungers before, and haue alienated so many mens harts
from vs, and giuen so much matter of ioy and laughter to our
enemyes at home:<note place="margin">VVhy our contentious priests haue styrred so much.</note> yf we examine what hath byn the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all this we shal fynd no other by their owne confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but for that an ecclesiastical Superiour was put ouer them
without their asking or consent. But was this a sufficient
cause (trow yow) to make so great broyles in such a tyme and
place, as this is? Suppose he had byn an euil man that was so
appoynted (as no moderate Cathol. or Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t we think wil
affirme that know him) had it not byn more modesty, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and prudence also to obay, as the rest of the Cleargie did
(being twenty to one of them and their faction) then to haue
made these scandalous broyles, for which their soules must one
day answere to almighty God?</p>
               <p>And yet further when afterward vpon their first tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
that litle treatese of schisme was wrytten with diuers
sharper words then some could haue wished, but yet take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out
of the Canons themselues, and suppose it had byn ouersharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and vnaduisedly done, yet seing it was neuer printed, nor
passed furrher then the hands of particular men at home, can
this be an excuse to such multitudes of horrible sc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>launderous
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20479:134"/>
bookes and libels published fynce for reuenge both in English
and latyn, to the vtter infamy of our cause and Nation?</p>
               <p>No heretike or Archeretike,<note place="margin">All heresyes haue some shevv of iust cause giuen them at the beginning.</note> that euer was, wanted some
probable shew of offence or expostulation at the first breach,
as may be shewed in euery one of them: and yf we beleeue the
wryters of our tyme <hi>Martyn Luther</hi> had no smal occasion giuen
him by the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> for depriuing him and his order of the
preminence to publish the Popes Bulles. <hi>Iohn Caluyn</hi> also had
a great exasperation by the Bishop of Noyon in France, that
burned him in the back; But was this inough (think yow)
to iustifie or excuse the scandals that after ensued by their see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of reuenge? One thing is certayne in this our case, &amp; not
vnlike to theirs (especially to that of Luther) that as he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
wel his superiors mynd and iudgment to be against him,
and not daring openly to contradict them, gaue fayre words
and promises for a good space, but euer did the contrary and
passed from worse to worse: so our trouble some people know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the first beginning of the institution of the Archpriest
yea before he was appoynted, that his Hol. iudgment and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
was wholy against them in this contention and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
