            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
CASE
OF
Clandeſtine Marriages Stated, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BY the Sixty Second Canon of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt,
as well as by the Conſtitutions of <hi>John Stratford,</hi>
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the Reign of King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third, it is ordained, <q>That no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhall be married, but in the Pariſhes where
one of the Parties dwell.</q> And in the Hundred and ſecond
Canon it is further provided, <q>That when a Licenſe is granted,
the Perſon that grants it ſhall take good Caution and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,</q>
as for other things in the Canon mentioned, ſo
laſtly for this, <q>That they ſhall celebrate the Marriage pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
in the Pariſh-Church or Chappel where one of them
dwelleth, and in no other place, and that between the Hours
of Eight and Twelve in the Morning.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt Clandeſtine Marriages that have happened, have
proceeded from the Breach of theſe Canons. For were
they punctually obſerved, and all Marriages ſolemniz'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Pariſh Church or Chappel where one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
dwell, and no where elſe, no Clandeſtine Deſign this
way could be carried ſo cloſely, but that the Friends muſt
know of it: at leaſt a ſtop muſt be put thereto when it
comes to the Miniſter. For when a Miniſter celebrates a
Marriage that is Clandeſtine, he doth it either out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or ill Deſign. As to the Ignorance of the Miniſter,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98460:3"/>
in this particular (and many Clandeſtine Marriages proceed
only from their being impoſed on this way) the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
preſcribed by the Canon muſt be a very effectual way,
becauſe when all are married in their own Pariſhes, the
Miniſters cannot be ſuppoſed to be ignorant whether they
have Conſent of Friends, or no, (unleſs perchance in ſome
of the larger Pariſhes in <hi>London,</hi> where other Care may be
taken by requiring the Friends of both Parties to be actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſent) and therefore though a Licenſe ſhould be frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently
obtained, yet if directed to him, it can be of no
Effect, becauſe all Licenſes go with a <hi>Proviſo</hi> of Nullity,
in Caſe of Fraud; and therefore to him that knows the
Fraud (as it is ſcarce poſſible but every Miniſter muſt in his
own Pariſh) it can be no Licence at all, but he will be as
much liable to the Penalty of the Law, if he marries with
a Licenſe in this Caſe, as if he had no Licenſe at all. And
as to a Miniſter's being Party to the ill Deſign of a Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine
Marriage, you ſhall ſcarce ever find this to happen,
when People are married by their own Miniſter. For the
Penalty being Suſpenſion <hi>per Triennium,</hi> none that have Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices
which are worth any thing, and are ſenſible of the
Fraud (as all Miniſters muſt be in the Pariſhes where they
live) will expoſe themſelves to be deprived of them ſo long
for the ſake of a Marriage-Fee. But moſt an end they
are not Miniſters of Pariſhes, but indigent Curates, or unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
Chaplains, that wilfully engage themſelves in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
who having nothing to loſe, on this Account are out of
the Reach of the Penalty; and therefore if there be but one
or two ſuch in a County, uſually the whole Trade of Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine
Marriages goes to them; and therefore the beſt way
to prevent ſuch Marriages, will be to confine all according
to the Canon to be married at home in their own Pariſhes by
the Miniſter of the Place that hath an Intereſt there, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to ſuffer if he doth amiſs. Becauſe if this be done, the
Miniſter can neither be impoſed on by a fraudulent Licenſe,
where the Perſons are ſo well known unto him (as thoſe
of his own Pariſh muſt be) or will he dare to marry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one. It may, I confeſs, be poſſible, that a Miniſter, to
gratifie ſome Gentleman of his Pariſh, who, he thinks, is able
to protect him from the Penalty, or elſe make him amends
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98460:3"/>
for what he ſuffers by it, may be prevailed with to celebrate
a Clandeſtine Marriage for his ſake, and thereby put an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
upon him, and all his Family and Friends on the
Account of the Advantage uſually gotten to the man by ſuch
ſtolen Matches. But in the Pariſh where the Woman lives,
it will be quite otherwiſe. For it being for the moſt part
the Man that ſteals the Woman, and not the Woman the
Man, there inſtead of obliging he will injure, and that in
ſo high a degree, that the Family which ſuffers, with all
their Friends and Relations (which perchance may make
the major part of the Pariſh) will be ſure to fall upon him
with their utmoſt Reſentments; and in this caſe a Miniſter
will have but little Comfort of his Life among them afterwards,
though he ſhould eſcape the Penalty of the Law; and ſcarce
any being ſo weak as not to foreſee it muſt be ſo where ſo
juſt a Provocation is given: This alone will be a ſufficient Tye,
were there none other to keep any Miniſter from betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any of his own Pariſh. And therefore were one ſmall
Alteration made in the Canon, and inſtead of the Pariſh-Church
or Chappel where one of the Parties dwells, it were
ordered, That all Marriages ſhould be celebrated in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Church
or Chappel only where the Woman dwells (as
indeed common Cuſtome hath already ordered it in moſt
Marriages that are not Clandeſtine) I apprehend it would
be a thorough-Remedy to the whole Abuſe. However, were
the Canons, as they now ſtand, punctually obſerved, this
alone would go ſo far towards it, that there would not be
ſo frequent Inſtances of this injurious Practice, as to alarm
the Nation againſt us, as now we find they do, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
them to bring Sanguinary Laws upon us to prevent
it.</p>
            <p>But the Miſchief is, that when the Church makes good
Laws, our Courts, when they find them againſt their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
will not put them in Execution. For were all obliged
to be married in their own Pariſhes, it would cut off above
half the Trade of granting Licenſes, which would very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably
deminiſh from the Profit which Chancellors, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries
and Regiſters make of their Places. And therefore
inſtead of executing the Canons above-mentioned (as is their
Duty) they make it their whole Endeavour to baffle them,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98460:4"/>
and make them of none Effect by all the Tricks they are able.
For,</p>
            <p>1. They never take any ſuch Caution or Security, as the
Hundred and ſecond Canon injoyns in their Licenſes, but on
the contrary ſcarce ever direct any that they grant to the
Pariſhes where the Parties dwell, but put in any other Pariſhes
which the Parties to be married, ſhall deſire, at what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
ſoever they may be from the Places of their uſual Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
without any regard at all had to the Canon which
enjoyns the contrary. Whereby occaſion is given to abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Frauds in this Particular, which otherwiſe might be
prevented.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas the Hundred and firſt Canon enjoyns, That
none ſhall grant any Licenſes, but ſuch as have Epiſcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
or the Commiſſary of the Faculties, Vicars-general of
the Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, <hi>ſede plenâ,</hi> or the Guardian of the
Spiritualties, <hi>ſede vacante,</hi> or Ordinaries exerciſing Right of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal
Juriſdiction in their ſeveral Juriſdictions: And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Law is, That thoſe Grants are only to be made before
themſelves, and not before any Subſtitute whom they ſhall
appoint, that all the matters requiſite to the granting of a
Licenſe, may be firſt well enquired into, as Whether there be
any Precontract? Whether there be Conſent of Friends?
Whether the Parties to be married are within the prohibited
Degrees of Relation, or no? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which often require the
Skill of the Judge himſelf to determine in them. The good
Orders of the Church have been ſo far neglected in all theſe
Particulars, and the Corruption of Officers in our Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Courts, for the ſake of Gain, hath run ſo high, that
every thing is done contrary to them in this matter. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of Chancellors and Commiſſaries taking any Pains in
the Particulars above mentioned, or making any previous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations
requiſite to prevent either Fraud, or illegal Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
they leave the whole matter to their Regiſters, who
regarding nothing elſe but to make the moſt of this Trade
by diſperſing and vending as many of thoſe Licenſes as they
can, as often as they have occaſion of them, ſeal them by
Heaps, with Blanks reſerved to inſert the Names of any ſuch
as ſhall afterwards come for them; and as Cuſtomers come
in, fill them up without any other Enquiry of the Perſons
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98460:4"/>
concerned, than for their Money to pay for them. And when
this Stock is ſpent, then they go to ſealing again; and for
the better advancing of this unlawful Gain, they are not
content to break all the good Orders of the Church concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this matter, themſelves, but alſo involve a great many of
the Clergy, with them, in the Guilt and Scandal of this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
by making ſome of them their Factors in every
Deanry for the diſperſing of thoſe Licenſes, who under
the Name of Surrogates, are drawn in to be their Under-agents
in ſo ſcandalous a Work, which is to the great Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of the Church, as well as againſt all Right and Law.
For,</p>
            <p>1. No Chancellor or Commiſſary hath Power to make any
ſuch Surrogates to act out of their reſpective Courts. For
although they now take upon them thus to do, it is only
founded on a Clauſe in their Patents, which give them the
Office to be executed <hi>aut per ſe, aut per ſufficientes Deputatos.</hi>
The meaning of which, only is, That in caſe of Sickneſs, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
on juſt Occaſions, or any other lawful Impediment,
they may appoint others to hold their Courts for them, and
expedite all other Acts uſually done out of Court; but not
that they ſhould erect inferiour Courts under them, as they
do now by their Surrogates in every Deanry, to draw the
more Griſt to their Mills; which is directly contrary to Law,
and of infinite Prejudice to the Church, in corrupting and
depraving all the good Orders and Diſcipline of it, and
drawing thereby the <hi>Odium</hi> of the People upon the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
thereof, by the frequent Acts of Unjuſtice, which by
Clandeſtine Marriages are done unto them.</p>
            <p>2. It is a very great Snare to Clergy-men, in being thus
made the Tools of thoſe mens Knaveries, and may expoſe
them to one of the moſt diſgraceful Puniſhments of the Law,
that is, the Pillory. For to fill up a blank Inſtrument after
the Seal is put to it is Forgery by the Law of the Land;
and I had once the Curioſity to adviſe with one of the ableſt
Lawyers in <hi>England</hi> about it, who aſſured me it was ſo; and
although I urged the conſtant Practice of every Dioceſs in
<hi>England,</hi> againſt it, he anſwer'd, <hi>That would not alter the
Law, but whoſoever ſhall inſert any thing into an Inſtrument, after
the Seal is put to it, will certainly be found guilty of Forgery in</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98460:5"/>
Weſtminſter-Hall, <hi>whenever proſecuted there for it. And if a
Clergy-man once undergoes the Diſgraceful Puniſhment due
to that Crime, the Blot may be ſufficient to make his Miniſtry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
all his Life after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It is making Clergy-men Parties to Knavery and Fraud,
and putting the blame of the unjuſt Practices of Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
Commiſſaries and Regiſters, upon thoſe, who for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the Church, as well as of themſelves, are moſt
concerned to prevent them. And thereby a great deal of
Clamour is drawn upon us, which we can never prevent, as
long as any of the Clergy are thus permitted in ſo mean and
baſe a manner to be ſubſervient to the Knavery and unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
Practices of theſe men. For they, regarding nothing
elſe but their Gain in the Choice of thoſe whom they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
to be their Surrogates, chuſe only ſuch as are propereſt
for their purpoſe this way, who being of the poorer and
meaner ſort, make their Advantage of the Employment, by
marrying themſelves all thoſe that come to them for Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and thereby advancing their own Gain as well as that
of their Maſters, become the more diligent Agents for them.
And I am told of ſome that keep Markets weekly for this
purpoſe, there expoſing their blank Licenſes to ſale, as Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
do their Wares, which they fill up for any that will pay
for them, without any other Reſerve, but that of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to themſelves, by putting in only thoſe Churches for
the ſolemnizing of it, where they themſelves are Miniſters.
But at beſt, tho' all Surrogates do not thus carry their blank
Licences to Market, yet all keep Shops of them at home,
and ſeldom or never refuſe any Cuſtomer that comes on how
unjuſtifiable an Account ſoever. And therefore when a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
comes to them, and a Marriage Fee is to be gotten,
without any further Enquiry, the blank Licenſe is brought
forth, the Names of the Perſons to be married, are inſerted
into it, and then the Surrogate thinks himſelf ſafe, and away
he goes to the Church with them, and there marries them by
Vertue of a Licenſe from himſelf, without regarding how
they come together, ſo he hath a Fee to his Maſters for
the Licenſe, and another to himſelf for the marrying of them.
And if it happens that any ſuch are afterward queſtion'd for
theſe Marriages, the Licenſe is produced for their Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98460:5"/>
which being under the Seal of the Office, and in the
Name of the Chancellor or Commiſſary that grants it, the
matter is uſually ſhuffl'd off, and no Juſtice at all done to
any that complain of the Injuries, that they ſuffer in this kind.
For the Truth is, were the thing brought to an Examination,
the Law would excuſe the Miniſter, who produceth the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
(unleſs his being Party to the Fraud, were proved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, which he uſually takes care to provide againſt in
the manner of tranſacting it) and lay the whole Blame upon
the Chancellor or Commiſſary, in whoſe Name it is granted,
who uſually know ways enough to baffle all Proſecution, that
ſhall be made againſt them on this Account; and therefore no
Examples being made of thoſe that offend in this kind, they
are the more bold ſtill to go on in the ſame illegal Practices,
and the Church infinitely ſuffers in its Reputation thereby;
and in truth, no Excuſe can be made in this Particular, while
our Governours, who have Officers under them for the putting
the Laws of the Church in Execution, permit them thus in ſo
ſcandalous a manner to corrupt them all for their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>Of which ſcandalous Corruption being abundantly ſenſible,
by what I found of it, where concern'd, about two Years
ſince I ſet my ſelf to reform it, and drew up a Monitory to be
ſent to all the Clergy of my Juriſdiction, wherein I inhibited
them to marry any either by Licenſe or otherwiſe, unleſs one
of the Parties liv'd in their Pariſh, according as it is enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Canon above-mention'd. But hereon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary
and Regiſter came to me with open Mouths, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining,
<hi>That this would totally ſpoil their Places.</hi> To which
I anſwer'd, That my Buſineſs was not to take care of their
Places, but that the Canons be kept; and if they would make
Gain by what was inconſiſtent herewith, they were not to
be tolerated in it. Whereon the Commiſſary told me, That
<hi>although the Canon was as I ſaid, yet he could aſſure me, that
the Practice was quite the contrary through the whole Kingdom;
and that ſince the Archbiſhops, and all their Suffragans thought
fit to tolerate it, he thought it would not become me to contradict
it.</hi> And on Inquiry, finding it really to be ſo as he told me,
I was forced to let the matter fall, becauſe I thought it would
appear a ridiculous Singularity in me to attempt a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98460:6"/>
in that which the Archbiſhop and Biſhops of our Church
thought fit in all parts of the Nation beſides, to allow. And
beſides, I had an Account given me, That the late Biſhop of
<hi>Norwich</hi> miſcarried in the ſame Attempt. For, on his firſt
coming to his Dioceſs, finding great Clamour about Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine
Marriages, he made his Chancellor and Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
call in all their Surrogations, and ſuppreſs all blank Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and ordered, that no Miniſter ſhould marry any, but
whereof one of the Parties dwell in his Pariſh: And by this
means, for a while, things were kept in good order, but they
had not been long ſo, but the Maſter of the Faculties, and the
Vicar-General to the Archbiſhop, took the Advantage to ſend
their Licenſes into the Dioceſs; which the Biſhop perceiving,
and having no Authority to controul them herein, he
thought it better, ſince he ſaw there was no Remedy, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Corruption to be ſtill continued by his own Officers,
over whom he had ſome Awe, then by thoſe Interlopers, with
whom he had nothing to do; and therefore relaxed all his
former Orders, and left his Officers to proceed in the ſame
Courſe as they did before; and the Miſchiefs which have
ſince followed hereon, are too many to relate; but two very
ſignal ones in my Neighbourhood, I cannot paſs over; the
one of a Man that hath married his Father's Wife, and the
other of one that married a Woman, whoſe Husband was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
in the next Pariſh, by Vertue of thoſe Licenſes. And
this Courſe can never be remedied, unleſs the two Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
will be pleaſed to undertake it, and ſend their Orders
to all their Suffragans, that the Canons be punctually obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in theſe following Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. That all Surrogates, with blank Licenſes, be ſuppreſs'd, and
no Licenſe for Marriage at all granted, but by the Perſon himſelf
that hath Authority in this Particular, or that Deputy only
who keeps his Seals, and preſides in his Court in his abſence.</p>
            <p>2. That all previous Examinations be made, and all Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Securities carefully taken, which are by Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
before any Licenſe be granted.</p>
            <p>3. That no Pariſh-Church or Chappel be put into the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for the Place of celebrating the Marriage, but thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
where one of the Parties that are to be married, dwell.
And if the Archbiſhops have Authority ſo to do (which, I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98460:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
think, they have, all Licenſes in this kind, being only <hi>ex Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ</hi>)
that they limit it to the Pariſh-Church or Chappel where
the Woman dwells.</p>
            <p>4. That a ſevere Proſecution be enjoyned againſt all thoſe
that tranſgreſs in any of the Premiſſes.</p>
            <p>If the Bill paſs againſt Clandeſtine Marriages, which I hear
is now before the Parliament, I confeſs it will be too late for
the Church to meddle with this matter; but in caſe the Bill
be caſt out (as perhaps it may) I think it will then be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the Church to undertake the Buſineſs, and employ
all the Authority it hath to reform ſo great an Abuſe. And
if the Archbiſhops and Biſhops will be pleaſed ſo to do, to
whom the cognizance of this matter doth moſt properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
I know no way can be more effectual for it, than the
putting the Canons in execution in the Particulars I have
mentioned. And if this be done as ſoon as the Bill is caſt out,
by a publick Order from the two Archbiſhops, to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective
Provinces, and the Biſhops be hearty and zealous in
the executing of it, I doubt not, there will be theſe following
good Effects thereof.</p>
            <p>1. A ſpeedy Remedy will thereby be put to this great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe,
which hath raiſed the Clamour of the Nation ſo loud
againſt us, and made ſo many diſaffected to the Church by
reaſon of the Injuries that ſome of their Families have ſuffer'd
by our tolerating ſo unjuſtifiable a Practice among us.</p>
            <p>2. Full Satisfaction will be given to thoſe who ſo earneſtly
call for a Reformation in this Particular; which will be the
moſt effectual Method of preventing the ill Deſigns of thoſe
who endeavour the bringing of Sanguinary Laws upon us for
this purpoſe; which, if effected, will be a great Severity, and
may prove a conſtant Snare to their Lives, whenever the
People have Malice enough to raiſe a Proſecution againſt
them.</p>
            <p>3. It will ſtop the Mouths of thoſe who are too often heard
to reproach the Biſhops with this whole Abuſe, as if the whole
Reaſon of it were from this, That they ſold their Chancellors,
Commiſſaries, and Regiſters Places, and therefore were bound
to tolerate thoſe Officers under them in all their illegal Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that they may thereby the better raiſe the Mony that
they exacted from them, for their Admiſſion to thoſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98460:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And thus far having ſtated to your Lordſhip this whole
Caſe, and ſhown you therein from whence the great Abuſe
of Clandeſtine Marriages ariſeth, the Manner how the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it is grown ſo frequent, and the Means whereby it
may be prevented, I earneſtly beſeech your Lordſhip to
make uſe of that Opportunity which God hath given you,
in putting to your helping hand for the Reformation of this
Corruption, that the Reputation of our Church, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of ſo many Families that are Members of it, may not
thus continually be ſacrificed to the illegal Gain, which
Chancellors, Commiſſaries and Regiſters reap to themſelves,
from the Practice of it. In order whereto, I wiſh your
Lordſhip would be pleaſed to lay the State of this whole
Matter before my Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that if the
Parliament puts not that ſevere Act upon us for the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of this Abuſe (as I hope they will not) his Grace
may do herein, what in his great Wiſdom he ſhall ſee may be
moſt conducing to the Good of the Church.</p>
            <closer>I am,
My LORD,
Your Lordſhips moſt Humble Servant.
