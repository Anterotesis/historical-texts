            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A King in all his territories is present by his power, and in his pallace by his presence, but by his essence, he is no where but in that place, which possesseth his body: God after all these waies is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in euery place.

But seeing that it is necessary that the cause be ioyned with the effect, eyther by it selfe, or by some vertue or influence, it followeth, that sithence God is the cause of all things, that they are, that hee is also ioyned vnto them, giuing them to bee, that they are: and that not by some vertue or influence, but by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: for in God there is that distinction of things, which is in the creatures.</p>

seruant of God, liuing in this cold and miserable regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, where charity is waxen key colde, and iniquity doth rage &amp; abound, must often repayre to the fire of prayer, that he may grow warme.

            <p>Hetherto belong these short &amp; succinct Prayers, which for this cause are called darting, because as it were are the darts of a louing soule, which with great celerity are shot forth, and do wound the heart of God: by force of which,

the soule is stirred vp, and is more enflamed with the loue of God. Very many versès of <hi>Dauid</hi> are profitable &amp; conducent vnto this purpose, which a man ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to haue in readines, that by them he may be lifted vp vnto God: not alwaies after the same manner, least the assiduity of the same wordes breed wearines, but with all variety of affections, which the holy Ghost doth stirre and rayse vp in his soule: for hee shall finde conuenient and meete verses for all these in this heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seminary of Psalmes.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he may lift vp his heart by the affection of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and desire of remission of sinnes, by these wordes: <hi>Turne away thy face, O Lord, from my</hi>

            <p>When the clocke giueth a signe of the passed hower, let vs call to mind the hower of our death; &amp; also that hower, in which God vouchsafed to dye for vs, &amp; let vs read &amp; meditate on those words,

which a holy Father teacheth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Blessed be the houre in which my Lord Iesus Christ was born &amp; dyed for me.

In like manner as often as we enterprize and vndertake to doe any thing, wherein we feare that wee shall find contradictions &amp; hindrances, or dread new occasions of daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, it behooueth vs to defence and arme our selues with the weapons of Prayer: When we at any time goe out of our doores, when we are to haue busines with a wrangling &amp; a contentious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or to deale in any matter of great moment &amp; consequence, when wee come to a banket, wherein there is danger of sinning, eyther through gluttony, or too much
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9372:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
talke, in these and suth like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a great preparation of Prayer is to be sent before. By this means all thinges will become motiues vnto vs to haue alwaies somthing to doe with God, &amp; of all things we shall receiue fruite, and at all times haue occasion to pray. This is that continuall exercise, to the which the Apostleinuiteth vs, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Touching &amp; admonishing your own selues, in Psalmes, &amp; hymmes,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Col. 3.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; spiritual songs, singing with a grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoeuer ye shal doe, in word or deed, doe all in the name of the Lord Iesus, giuing thankes to God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the Father by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This exercise very much help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Deuotion: for it is as the watchman &amp; keeper of the house watching that none beside God enter to take possession of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soule. It is profitable also to preserue the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9372:47"/>
heate of Deuotion: hence it is, that they that are freequent in this consideration, doe very easily call vnto them their minds, &amp; gather together their sences and spirits, when they are to pray.</p>
            <p>For what other cause, doest thou think there is, that one forth with at the beginning of prayer doth enioy tranquility and peace of minde, an other scarcely afterma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny houres, &amp; after long praier can quiet his heart &amp; make it peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? The cause is obuious &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, because the one hath his heart gathered vnto him &amp; war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with these short &amp; succinct prayers: the other through for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnes of God is waxen key cold, &amp; therefore the one sooner waxeth hot, the other later. Wee <note place="margin">A Simily.</note> see this in a fornace, which if it be wel heated in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning, is kept hot all the day after with a little
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9372:48"/>
fire: but if it grow stone colde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it requires a great deale of fire, before it be thorowly heated again: so it is necessary that they doe, that will be deuout, that this diuine heate may be preserued in their hearts, vnlesse they will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe new troubles in heating them so often as they goe to pray. For the Deuoton of our heart is <note place="margin">A Simily.</note> as heate in water, or in yron, which naturally is cold, but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally hot: for when it is taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fire, of which it was made hot, foorth with it returneth to his former and proper estate &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. He therefore that would alwaies keep yron hot, it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him either alwaies to keep it in the fire, or often to put it into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire, that so the external heat may be kept in it: the same diligence is necessary in the nourishing and warming of our hearts.</p>

For death entreth by our windowes vnto our soules: &amp; therfore after the example of our Lord goe into the desert, that is, as much as thou canst, seperate thy selfe from the company of others, &amp; be solitary, if thou wilt be ioyned vnto him, &amp;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:9372:53"/>
see him by the purity of thy heart: flye also the frequent meetings &amp; talkatiue conferences, especially of worldly persons. Seeke not for newe deuotions &amp; amities: fill not thine eyes &amp; eares with vaine fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies, &amp; eschew all things, which disturbe &amp; trouble <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> quyet of the minde, and the tranquilitye of the soule, as venemous &amp; hurtfull to the soule. For not without cause the holy Fathers desired to liue in woods, and in places farre remote from the company &amp; frequenting of men. This saith the schoolman. But that thou maist be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed &amp; strengthned in this, hear what Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> saith: If thou <note place="margin">Bern. in his 40. Sermon vpon the Canticles.</note> beest mooued with the prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; instigation of the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp; dost by all meanes endeuor to make thy soule the spouse of God, sit by the Prophet solitarily, because thou hast lifted thy selfe

O holy soule get thee aparte, that thou maist perform thy seruice to him alone, whome thou hast made choyce of before all others. Flye publicke assemblyes, auoide also those that are domesticall with thee: sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thy selfe from thy friendes &amp; from them that are the neerest vnto thee, and from him that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth vnto thee. Doost thou not knowe that thy bridegroome is shamefast, and will not affoord thee his sweete and pleasant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:9372:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>

Therefore seperate thy selfe not in body, but in minde: but in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, but in deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. For the spirit before thy face is Christ thy Lord, and the spirit requireth not solitarines of body: albeit somtimes seperate thy selfe in body, when thou maist doe it fitly, especially in the time of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer. And afterwardes: Thou art alone if thou thinkest not vpon common matters, if thou dost not affect thinges present, if thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisest that which manye loue, if thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temnest that which many desire, if thou eschewest braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, if thou dost not languish for losses, if thou dost not remember iniuryes: otherwayes although thou beest alone in body, yet thou art not alone. Doost thou not see that thou maist bee alone, yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many? &amp; seeing <hi>y<hi rend="sup">u</hi>

amonge manye, thou art alone in what assemblye of people soeuer thou art: only beware that thou be not too curious a searcher, or too rash a iudge of other mens conuersations. Hetherto <hi>Bernard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therfore let a deuout man loue and seeke for solitarines, not only that which is internall, but also that which is externall: for it is certaine that the one is helped by the other. It is reported that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senius</hi> heard a voyce saying vnto him: <hi>Arsenius</hi> flye, be silent &amp; at rest. Let euery one think that the same is also spoken vnto him, and let him fly and auoyd all kinde of commerce, society, conuersation, conference, consolation, visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea of friendes and parents, vnlesse eyther charitye require it, or necessitye commaund it. Let a man alwayes desire to be alone, let him meditate with himselfe,

let him liue to himselfe, &amp; let him confer with God, who is the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of solitarines.</p>
            <p>And let no man think that such a life is full of melancholye and heauines: it is so much the more delectable and pleasant, by how much the societie and familiaritie with God is sweeter, then that which is with men. For this cause Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith: The towne <note place="margin">Hierome in his Epist.</note> is a prison vnto me, but the desert a Paradice. And <hi>Bernard</hi> saith: With whome God is, he is neuer <note place="margin">Bern. in his Epist.</note> lesse alone, then when he is alone: for then he freelye enioyeth his heartes ioy, then hee is his owne man to enioy God in himselfe, &amp; himself in God, &amp;c. what Paradice can be more pleasaunt in this pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, then that which God promiseth to a soule deuout, and attendinge vppon him, when as hee sayth: <hi>Beholde, I will allure</hi>

               </hi> earth, and going out of this world, and by little and little, more and more encreasing in the loue and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her Creator. These be the dayes of her spirituall youth, when the loue is stronger &amp; more vehement. These songs are sung in the wildernes, and in the valey of Achor, which is of trouble: by which is vnderstood the humility of contrition: for there the way vnto hope is first opened vnto the soule, and there she receiueth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes: there she pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

            <p>This solitarines is not onely profitable and conducent vnto deuotion, but also vnto all other vertues: for it cutteth off all the occasions of sin, which are wont to happen in the assemblyes and companies of men: but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye the occasions of falling in the tongue, which almost are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.

The Christians are a people inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, voyde of vice and offence, neyther haue they any other fault then that they gather themselues together in assemblies before day, where they sing prayses &amp; hymmes, in the honor of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine man called Christ, who was crucified in Palestina. What need we many words? it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of all the Saints, that they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the greater part of the night in spirituall exercises, prayers, contemplations and readings, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling that of <hi>Dauid: In the night lift vp your hands to the Sanctuary,</hi>

This belongeth not onely and solely to the clergy, as some vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly babble: but to all them, that desire to enioy God, and to come to the perfection of life. Saint <note place="margin">Hierome in an Epis. to Celantia. Cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Hierome</hi> exhorteth a certaine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Woman called <hi>Celantia</hi> to doe thus, in these words: So take care for thy house and family, that thou mayst bestowe some time and leasure vpon thy soule. Choose for thy selfe some fitte place, somewhat remooued from the noyse of thy family, into which, as into a hauen thou mayst betake thy selfe out of the great storme and tempest of thy cares, and there appease and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage by the tranquility of thy secret closset, the waues and billowes of cogitations raysed by outward troubles.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:9372:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of prayers, so firme and solide cogitation of future thinges, that by this leasure thou mayst recompence all the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses of the other time.</p>
            <p>Neyther doe wee saye this to that ende, that wee may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe thee from thine affayres, but wee doe it, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>t there thou mayst learne, and there medy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, what an one thou oughtest to shew thy selfe in thine affaires. This saith he.</p>
            <p>But if thou shalt aske mee, how often in a day thou shalt turne thee vnto this studie, and take this taske in hand; I cannot prescribe a certaine rule vnto thee: for all men haue not the same occasions of leysure and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines.</p>
            <p>Yet remember that in the law the twoo dayly Sacrifices, the <note place="margin">The two daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</note> morning Sacrifice and the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:9372:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are very often commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which euery Christian ought spiritually to offer, withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe at those times from externall thinges, that hee may attend vppon Celestiall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>That as twice in a day we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshe our bodies, that is, at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and at supper: so also twice a day wee giue the due nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment vnto our soules: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is of no lesser digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then the body: neyther is the meate lesse necessary for the soule, then for the bodye, yea it is much more necessary.</p>
            <p>The ordinarye nourishment is necessary for the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the naturall heate doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes consume and waste the substance of man: and therefore it is necessary, that it be repayred on the one side, as it is decayed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:9372:60"/>
on the other: so the soule hath in it a pestilent heate (which is the concupiscence, and euill inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our appetites) consuming and wasting all good: therefore it is needfull that that bee dayly repayred by Deuotion, which is wasted and decayed by that hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pestilentiall heate.</p>
            <p>We must also know, that mans nature by sinne is corrupt, incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to all earthly things, which by the weight doth drawe man vnto it, as the Wiseman saith: <hi>A corruptible body is heauy vnto the soule, and the earthly mansion keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>

               <hi>downe the minde that is full of cares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore as they that haue the charge and keeping of a <note place="margin">A Simily.</note> Clocke, are wont euerye day twice to winde vp the plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, for they of their owne proper motion doe by little and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:9372:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
little descende, and drawe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the ground: so they that desire to keep their soules vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and well ordered, ought at the least twice a day to erect and lift vp her weightes: seeing that our wretched nature is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clynable to thinges below, that it alwayes endeuoureth to sinke downwards.</p>
            <p>Ah howe euidently doe they dayly feele this that pray. How often doth a man (his morning prayer being ended) thinke that the weight and poyse of his clock is lifted vp into heauen, and that hee hath all his intention and will fixed aboue: so that hee seemeth not to vouchsafe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde these earthly thinges: and a little after, when hee shall turne himselfe to his dayly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, and beginneth to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique with men, when as the

intermingled with all kinde of our occupations and businesses. For I remember that I haue seene good and godly spirits supported by the vse and helpe of these, whose condition, manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and infirmity did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to haue any longer prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: albeit these kinde of prayers cannot long hold out, if the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of other profounder and longer prayers be wanting.</p>

            <head>THE TENTH THING that doth kindle Deuotion, is the continuing and perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in good exercises. <hi>CHAP.</hi> XIII.</head>
            <p>BVt that this exercise may bee profitable, we must note, that in this place duration and long perseuerance is required in it.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9372:62"/>
For there are many found, that neuer make an end of that they once began, but alwayes weaue &amp; vnweaue (as they say) the web of Penelope.</p>
            <p>These propounding this way vnto themselues, doe sticke to it two or three dayes, and foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with are tyred and doe forget it, so that when they returne to that they began, they are so cold, and so far remoued from themselues, as if they had neuer begun, or as if they had neuer heard, no not by a dreame, what praier is. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they betake themselues to new purposes, and they choose againe vnto themselues a new exercise, and when they haue somewhat proceeded, eyther through wearines, or because they think they haue taken paines enough, they returne vnto rest, &amp; forget their labour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:9372:62"/>
And so they spend their whole life in building &amp; pulling downe, and in rowling (as it is said) the stone of <hi>Sisyphus,</hi> which when they haue rowled to the midst of the mountaine, suddenly it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth downe, and so in beginning and in rowling they consume their whole age.</p>
            <p>Such are they that vpon euery small and light occasion dooe forsake their prayers and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exercises: to whome it often happeneth (as I haue tryed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience) that whilst they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to intermit their prayers onely for two or three dayes, they intermit it all their life long.</p>
            <p>For when they would returne vnto it, they finde no gate nor entrance vnto it: and the way vnto it becomes dayly more difficult vnto them: therefore
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:9372:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they stay without, and returne to the custome of their auncient life. For a man without prayer, and without spirituall exercise, is as <hi>Sampson</hi> without his hayre: who forth with loseth his stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, and remaineth feeble and weake, like other men, and is greatly endangered, least he fall into the hands of his enimies.</p>
            <p>Therefore it behooueth vs to bee firme and stable in this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise: for it is certaine, that of the constancye and ordering of it, dependeth all our life.</p>
            <p>Contemplate in the celestiall bodies, howe great a constancy and firmenes they keep in theyr course &amp; motion, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged since the time, wherin they were created. For seeing that they weretobe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> causes on which the administration of the whole world was to depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:9372:63"/>
that in them there should be great constancye, that the world might bee alwayes well ordered and disposed. So seeing that of this spirituall exercise, the whole order and processe of a spirituall life dependeth, as experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, it is meete and requisite, that hee that would haue his life well ordered and disposed, that hee haue the causes well ordered and disposed, on which the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it dependeth.</p>
            <p>See with what constancye the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> did obserue these three times of prayer, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the feare of death, nor by the gayn-sayinge of hys e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimyes, hee could bee brought from hys accustomed order: so that hee chose rather to endaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his life, then to breake off his set course of prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:9372:64"/>
So also a deuout man ought so firmely to purpose with himselfe, and inuiolablye decree, to attend and waite vpon God at his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed howres, that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faile in al other his businesses, which concerne not God, then in this one so greatly commended of GOD. Imi tate the naturall prudency of Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, who hiding <note place="margin">A Simily.</note> their heads, do yeilde their whole bodyes to the smiter, that that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lost, which is of lesse weight, they may preserue that which is of greater valew. Imitate the <note place="margin">Gen. 31, &amp; 33.</note> wisdome of the most holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke <hi>Iacob,</hi> who returning out of Mesopotamia, and beeing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue &amp; entertaine his brother, whome he greatly feared, sent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his sheep, oxen, and camels, with all his substance: after them he placed both his mayds &amp; their children: after them <hi>Leah</hi> &amp; her
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:9372:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
children: but <hi>Rachel</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioseph,</hi> as most precious &amp; estimable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures he ordred in the last &amp; safest place: signifying that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hazard all the rest, then those two, whom he so much esteemed. Tell me O thou seruant of God, what hast thou in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, which thou art so much to regard, as this <hi>Rachel</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioseph?</hi> What is <hi>Rachel,</hi> but a contemplatiue life? what is <hi>Ioseph,</hi> but the spirituall sonne, which is borne of her, which is innocency &amp; purity of life? wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that treasure is more to be esteemed, then the losse of anye temporal thing: so that thou must make account rather to lose these, then fayle in the other. Therfore my brother, hap what wil, alwaies keepe with thee thy <hi>Rachel</hi> &amp; thy <hi>Ioseph.</hi> Do not imitate them, who haue prayers, exercises, &amp; spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thinges for a cloake &amp; colour
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:9372:65"/>
of their negligence, who when they are to doe, or lose any thing, they alwayes expose the spirituall thing to the daunger, that they maye keepe and defend the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall.</p>
            <p>I knew a godly religious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who as often as she heard the sound of the howre, in which she was wont to pray, at that very same time (as it is also reported of those holy Fathers of Egipt) all <note place="margin">An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> other thinges beeing set aparte without delay she betooke her to her exercise. When she conferred with an other godly woman, with whose conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted forth-with after shee heard the stroke of the passed houre, she departed from her, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly breaking off her speech, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: If to day I shall omit mine ordinarye taske for this cause, to morowe I shall omit it for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:9372:65"/>
(for euery day bringeth his hinderance) and stil so proceding, I shall commit a thousand errors. At another time the same deuout woman beeing with me, the like circumstances fell out, where at her departure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me she shewed no token of vanitye, but of great edifying: so that scarcely three times in a yeere she fayleth in this her moste holye exercise. I haue brought this example for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of those that be negligent, but I dare not reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the fruite, that she obtained by this perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For these times and dayes wherein we liue, are so enuious, and so full of iniquitye, that they will not abide that the vertues of the liuing should be published: as the examples of many Saintes do testifye.</p>
            <p>There is not any thing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more speedily bringeth a man to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:9372:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the height and top of perfection, then this continuance and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, as well in the exercises of Prayer, as in the diligence and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his life: for a traueller that euery day goeth forward a little, <note place="margin">A Simily.</note> if he perseuer and continue in his progresse, soone commeth to the end of his iorney. but if he faile and faint in it, and a little after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his voyage a new, consumeth all his life in it neither euer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the end of his iorney.</p>
            <p>But if at any time a casualty hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, which cannot be refused in this life, so that thou doest stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fal, and through weaknes doest faint, doe not discourage thy selfe, nor cast away thy hope: but albeit thou fall a thousand times in a day, ryse againe and be conuerted a thousand times in a day: &amp; in what place thy threed was broken, knit it together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againe,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:9372:66"/>
doe not goe backe to the beginning, for if thou doest, thou shalt disturbe all thy worke &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>Neyther onely is constancy <note place="margin">The exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises are not to be changed.</note> needfull in the very exercises the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: but also in the manner of them. For there be some, that doe not fayle in their dayly taske: but daily change their intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: to day they goe this way, and to morrow that: and thus being vnstable and vnstayed in theyr affections, they remayne constant in nothing.</p>
            <p>Sometimes they begin of the Passion: a little after they leaue it and take vnto themselues another Meditation, and another exercise.</p>
            <p>Sometimes they clymbe vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, relinquish sacred hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manytie, and ascend to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; sublimity of Diuinity. Some leaue all these, and begin of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:9372:67"/>
memory of theyr sinnes: so that they neuer prosecute the thing taken in hand, and neuer come to the end of their dyet, to which without doubte they had sooner come, if they had perseuered in the same way, albeit it was not so direct nor compendious.</p>
            <p>It happeneth vnto these as to hunting dogges, who followe <note place="margin">A Simily.</note> two Hares, and take neyther: the tree hardlye encreaseth, that is often trans-planted: and the wound is slowlyer healed, when the medicines are often or dayly altered.</p>
            <p>Seeing that there are manye and sundrye wayes, by which man goeth vnto GOD, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye manners of considerations, by which the spirite is lifted vp vnto him: let euerye one pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with him selfe, which is the best fitting for his purpose, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:9372:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
let him entertayne and followe that: for that is the best course that he can take.</p>
            <p>But let him beware that hee dooth not fall into the errour of manye, who when they haue found God in some one exercise, they deny that there is any other way, but that alone: which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but to denye that there be moe wayes, by which we goe vnto GOD: when as the holye Ghost, who is our leader and Captayne, dooth leade euerye one by his owne way, which hee seeth to be most commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him.</p>

            <p>They that cannot rise at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, let them endeuour to rise a little before the rising of the Sun, as the Wise man admonisheth: <hi>We ought, saith hee, to preuent the</hi>

To be briefe, this time is so conuenient to attend vppon the Lord, that the Wise man beeing delighted with this oportuniye, said: <hi>He riseth well in the morning that seeketh for good thinges,</hi> or the <note place="margin">Prou. 2.</note> chiefest good. For this time of all times in the day, is the conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and fittest to talke with God, and to deale in the busines of our saluation: for then all the powers &amp; faculties of our foules are more cheerefull &amp; ready, &amp; better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for this dutye. Our sight is not so wandring, our stomacke
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:9372:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
empty, our head refreshed with sleepe, the time quiet, and the heart free and fasting from the cogitations and businesse of the daye.</p>
            <p>A short supper, and a hard bed are good meanes for early rising: <note place="margin">Good meanes for early rising.</note> they make the sleepe shorter, &amp; the time of prayer longer. But a large supper, and a soft bed work the contrary: for when much is to be digested, much sleepe must be had, and the softer the bed is, the more vnwillingly it is left.</p>
            <p>But when as eyther for age, or for infirmity, or for presence of friends, or society, a man cannot rise at that houre, yet let him not omit to watch a little, and to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate in his heart of those things that belong vnto God. For it is not absurde in such necessitye to make an oratory of thy bedde, as that holy Prophet did, who said:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:9372:70"/>
               <hi>I cause my bedde euerye night to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 6.</note> 
               <hi>swimme, and water my couch with teares.</hi> For as it is not inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to sit praying, when as the weakenesse of the body will not suffer any other way: so neyther is it absurd to lie and pray in bed, when as necessity, or vrgent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son doeth constraine it. Let thy soule bee bended and prostrated before the presence of God: and let thy body haue that forme and fashion, it maye haue: for that the best composition of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which doth not hinder deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If it may be, let the man that is weake be halfe cloathed, that he may sit in his bed, if so be his weakenesse be so great that hee cannot rise.</p>
            <p>It verye much helpeth mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prayer, if a man before hee goe to sleepe doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what giue himselfe to prayer:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:9372:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for in the morning hee shall finde in his heart the fruite of that seed, which hee sowed the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Therefore that man doth <note place="margin">A Simily.</note> very well, that alwaies goeth to bed with some holie Meditation in his minde, as hee that at night couereth the coales in the ashes, that in the morning when he ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, he may the more easily make a fire. And to preserue this fire the better, it is profitable, that as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at thou awakest in the night, foorth with to lift vp thine heart to God, saying. Glory bee to the Father, &amp;c. or some such like verse; for this shal very much help not onely to this which we speak of, but also to driue away vayne fansies &amp; wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoughts which are sent of the deuill: for at this time he is wont to bee more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie about a man, then at other times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:9372:71"/>
Wherefore Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> saith, that euen to the holy and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bed of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which euerye night hee had wont to water with his teares, the deuill had accesse with all the pompe of his pleasure's</p>
            <p>In the morning, when wee a wake, <note place="margin">As soone as we awake we must thinke of God.</note> as soone as wee open our eyes, let our heartes bee powred foorth in the remembraunce of God, before any other cogitation doth possesse them: for then the soule is so tender, and so well dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that it presently assumeth the first thought, which is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and apprehendeth it so firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it can hardly be remooued from it, or receiue any other.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is necessary, that wee haue recourse to the good seede, least the euill seede possesse the ground of our heartes. Of such weight is this counsell, that

            <p>According to these examples, he that prayeth, ought somtimes to vse such like iestures and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that his heart with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter facility may bee lifted vp to God: seeing that we see that no meane fruites are deriued from it.</p>
            <p>It is good for a man sometimes with lowly humility of spirit to prostrate himself vpon the earth, adoring with all the blessed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible Maiestie, who casting downe their crownes before the throne of God and the Lambe: giue glory vnto God, &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">Apoc. 4.</note> that whatsoeuer they haue, they receiued it from him.</p>
            <p>

When we pray we ought also to <note place="margin">Cerimonies in prayer are not to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.</note> lift vp our eyes towards heauen, which ceremonies, seeing that our Sauiour himself so oftentimes vsed, they ought not to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, but obserued, as exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples left vnto vs of our Master &amp; Teacher. For albeit God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent euery where, yet heauen is his proper place, in which hee doth those works, which he doth not in other places.</p>
            <p>Heere the reader is to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, that it is not alwaies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to pray with be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded knees, seeing that by this meanes our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion is often times hindred, by reason of the griese and weaknes of the body. True it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is good to suffer some affliction in praier, seeing that the Lord in his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, suffered so great thinges for our sins: yet this is not the chiefest fruite of praier, for in comparison
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:9372:74"/>
of the light, and sweetnes of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which god bestoweth in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the griefe of the body, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall exercise seeme very small. Therfore in the time of praier let the composition and ordering of thy body be such, as may be both for thy health, and that thy soule may be quiet, and fixed vpon god alone; especially when the time of thy praier is longer, that is, of two or three houres, (as it is the custome of some) seeing that few are found, who are able to bear so long paine and griefe, without diminishing and abating of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is especially required in this exercise.</p>
            <p>I know &amp; confesse that al these things are not of any such speciall conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: yet they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducent &amp; auailable to our purposed end. For euen as rhetoritia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that wold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pile &amp; frame a perfect oration,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:9372:74"/>
are not content with teaching the matters themselues alone, which are the very strength and sinewes of the oration: but also they vse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maner of variations, which are not of the substance of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: as apt structure &amp; compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, fit concourse and conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of vowels and consonants, tropes, schemes, figures, &amp;c. For these make the oration perfect &amp; absolute: so also we frame &amp; form here an other oration celestiall &amp; heauenly, which we are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime in the presence of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine maiesty: it is meete therfore, that we should omitte nothing, whether it be much, or litle, which is conducent vnto the essence and perfection of it: especially seeing that there is nothing in this kinde of discipline, which ought to bee called small or little.</p>

            </head>
            <p>BEside al those things, which hetherto we haue spoken of, afflictions and corporall troubles and greeuances are profitable to excite and stirre vp Deuotion: as are fasting, discipline, vnsoft and rowgh apparrel, watching, a hard bed, and sober and slender dyet. Frist because such exercises are fomentations and nourishers of Prayer and Deuotion: Secondly because they are pillers and bases, on which they leane: Thirdly, for the common rule: which is, that <note place="margin">A common rule.</note> God doth bestow his grace vpon euery one, as he is fit to receiue it.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:9372:75"/>
For none can deny, but that he is more fit and better disposed, who prepareth himselfe together both in spirit &amp; body, then he that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepareth himselfe in spirit.</p>
            <p>We must here know, that there are two wayes of preparing and <note place="margin">Two waies of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our solues vnto prayer.</note> disposing our selues to receiue grace: one false, the oeher true. The false way is, when as a man onely in word, and with a luke warm desire doth seeke for God, without the true &amp; internal sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sobbing of the soule. And this is the reason, why many doe seeke for God, &amp; do not find him: do aske, &amp; not receiue. And in this slender &amp; cold desire they alwaies liue &amp; neuer finde God: because they seeke him not with all their heart, as he ought to be sought of them, who desire to find him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Prophet. <hi>Ye</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ier. 29.</note> 
               <hi>shall seeke me, and finde me, because
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:9372:76"/>
ye shall seeke me with all your heart.</hi> This is the second way of dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing &amp; preparing our selues, which here the Prophet noteth: that is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we seek for God, with a true &amp; in ward desire, &amp; with labor &amp; affliction of heart. Of which God speaketh by his Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Turn you vnto me with al your hart, &amp; with fasting, &amp; with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>

               <hi>&amp; with mourning: &amp; rent your hart, &amp; not yourclothes, &amp; turn vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lord your god.</hi> In which place we are to note, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as the euil which outwardly appeareth not, either is not seen, or is not an euill indeed, or very small: so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inward afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the spirit, except it outwardly break forth, &amp; doth also afflict the body, is ether feined, or very smal. But that which doth so mightily afflict y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit, that it doth also affl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ict the body, that istruly &amp; indeed worthy to be called afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; of this the Prophet speaketh.</p>

He that seeketh god with such an affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let him assure himselfe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God wil not hide himself fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, but will be found of him.

&amp; to humble thyself before thy God, thy woordes were heard, &amp; I am come for thy words.</hi> See how plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this place the Scriture testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, what deuout prayer can do, when as corporal affliction is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto it.</p>
            <p>We read of that holy Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall sinner, that being drowned <note place="margin">Ioh. 20.</note> as it were with teares, she sought the Lord in the Sepulcher: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she receiued comfort before all others, because before al other, shee sought the Lord with great affection.</p>
            <p>But what do I speake of teares so godlye, when as the sackcloth of peruerse and wicked King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab,</hi> could so moue the diuine eyes &amp; brest, as to reuoke, or at the least to defer the sentence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against him &amp; his house?</p>
            <p>To be briefe, as often as the Scripture remembreth that the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:9372:77"/>
children of Israel mourned, fasted, &amp; cryed vnto God, it addeth, that they were heard, &amp; deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the danger they were in: wherby it most manifestly apeereth, that these are great helps to find God. Wherupon a Schoole man saith, that almost no grace descendeth into the soule of man except it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e by prayer, affliction, &amp; corporall tribulation.</p>
            <p>There are many kindes of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <note place="margin">Whence the griefe of the soule in prayer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryseth.</note> &amp; austerenes of life, most acceptable vnto God &amp; most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            </p>
            <p>The pittifull and fatherly heart of god doth not long suffer the soule afflicted with the loue and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for of her spouse, to be discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate, and destitute of comfort: but doth help her, &amp; minister co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation vnto her. When as the mother seeth her child weeping, &amp; desiring gugawes with teares, her hart cannot brooke that the request of her child shuld be long deferred, and that he should be hurt with weeping; but foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she giueth him that hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth, and for which hee wept.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:9372:78"/>
What then will he doe, that offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himselfe for Israell with farre greater affection, then that of the mother, who saith: <hi>Though the</hi>

            </head>
            <p>AN impediment contrary to the former is too much scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulositie and too much griefe, &amp; anxiety of hart, which some doe conceiue by reason of the sinne, they haue fallen into. For this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes doth bring more harme then the sinne it selfe. For seeing that it is the property of sinne to bring remorse and sting of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, there are some so subiect to this euill, that their hearts are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with exceeding bitternes, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines and griefe; neyther can they nowe enioy that Diuine sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and quiet, which Prayer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:9372:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Furthermore seeing that sinne is like vnto deadly poyson, which speedyly pearceth the heart, killeth the spirites, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth death, there be some, that falling into a sinne, are foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with so vanquished in minde that they lose all theyr inward strength, which before they had attained to worke well.</p>
            <p>For as there is nothing, which doth more stirre vs vp vnto good, then the vigour and strength of the heart, so there is nothing, which doth more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish heate and feruour in vs, then the weakenes and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the same.</p>
            <p>For this cause the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the wildernesse were wont in times past to admonish their Disciples, that they should alwayes stand armed with this courage and fortitude of minde,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:9372:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for by this meanes a man as it were leaning on a strong staffe, is prepared and readye to all thinges which are to bee done: but to him that faynteth or casteth downe his courage, the contrary hapneth.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it is the common opinion of many, that moe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue greater harme of an indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete estimation of sinne, then of the sinne it selfe.</p>
            <p>This indiscreete remorse of <note place="margin">Whence too much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of conscience ariseth.</note> conscience doth somtimes spring and arise from faint-hartednes: &amp; sometimes from a certaine secret pride, which closely perswadeth a man that he is some body, and therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he ought not to fal into such a defect: to whom humility pro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary: to whom it is no maruel if there be slidings into many defectes; for humility hath alwaies set before her eyes her

            <p>This faint-hartednes also is sometimes deriued from hence, that a man doth not knowe the grace and efficacy of the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ, nor the vertue of the medicine, which he hath left vnto vs in his death and passion for the healing of this defect, and remedying of this feare.</p>
            <p>Therefore let this be the first <note place="margin">The first remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst too much scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulositie.</note> remedye against this euill, to knowe the Lorde, and the price, and vertue of his merits, least we at anytime cast away the hope of the Diuine mercy, whether it be in great sinnes, or in little.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth cherish this hope, when he saith: <hi>My babes</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.</note>

            </p>
            <p>What diffidence and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust can then hurte or annoye thee, being shadowed with these winges, and couered with the merites of so greate an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour?

            <p>Why then dooest thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thy selfe, seeing that such satisfaction, and so great merits are so liberally and freely offered vnto thee?</p>

Thou wilt aunsweare, Noe: Therefore assuredly perswade thy selfe, that that death so long agoe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed is no lesse profitable, theu if it weredayly offered: for the Apostle sayth, that that high Priest by one oblation, <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> whych hee offered vppon the Crosse, hath clensed and sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified vs for euer: he hath left that in hys Sacrifice for vs, that it may bee a perpetuall medicine and treasure vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Thou wilt obiect againe, and say: I offend and sinne dayly, albeit God dayly powreth and heapeth his blessings and graces vppon mee, therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but distrust, and fall from hope.</p>
            <p>

I tell thee in veritye and truth, that as nothing can bee found that doth more manyfest the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse of man, then that manner of multiplying sinnes, when as the Diuine benefittes are incessantly powred vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: so also there is nothing founde, wherein the greatnesse of the Diuine goodnesse doth more appeare, then in this, that God doth without ceasing showre downe his benefittes vpon him, that blusheth not without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to offend him.</p>

            <p>For if wisely and prudentlye thou knowest to vse the daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and pernitious taste of sinne, as some poyson, thou mayest make a medicine of it, by ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp from it to that supreme goodnes, which with so great benignity suffereth thy sinnes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they are so many, and so great, that thou who committest them art not able to beare them, and although thou art wearye in bearing them, yet God is not wearye in pardoninge of them.</p>
            <p>Therefore let the bitter pilles bee gilded ouer with the honnye of this consideration, that the too much bitternesse which is in them, may not bee tasted. Which if it be done, thou shalt manytimes tast greater sweetnes
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:9372:87"/>
by the consideration of this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, then bitternesse by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thine owne wickednes. Wherefore in this case thou must doe that, which a faithfull seruant doth, who albeit he be rude and negligent, yet he hath a good and gratious Lorde, if he commit a fault; on the one side he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to tremble for his offence, but on the other side he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth that hee hath a Lord full of clemency, who so often hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned his offences, thereupon he hopeth, that with the same cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency he was woont to forgiue his former trespasses, he will also now winke at these present. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he doth call to minde these things, he turneth the feare and griefe, which the memorye of his sins brought forth, into ioy, which he feeleth by the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the goodnes of his Lord.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:9372:88"/>
Thy consideration ought to bee like this, as often as too much sorrow for thy sinnes doth afflict and oppresse thee: for thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, of poyson thou shalt make for thy selfe a preseruatiue and a remedy against poyson, and thou shalt pul out the eies of thine enemy, and kill him with his own sword, and thou shalt take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of greater strength and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of those same things, which were woont to bee the causes of greater feare and trembling. If thou draw thy water thorow this channell, thou shalt water two excellent vertues, charity and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: whilest of the sinne, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which thou diddest fall, thou takest occasion to humble thy selfe, more manifestly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging thine owne misery: and to loue him with a more ardent loue, vpon whose goodnes thou
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:9372:88"/>
doest so greatly trust, &amp; certainly perswadest thy selfe that he will pardon and forgiue thy sins.</p>

For as Deuotion is a very delicate thing: so it is obscured and lost by a light and little matter. For if the morning Sun beames did hinder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Saint <hi>Anthony:</hi> howe much more shall the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet cogitations of seeking and keeping earthlye goods hurte, which haue well feathered win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges swiftely to flye out of our sight?</p>

            <p>IN like manner it is a great, and a very vsuall impediment vnto Deuotion, oftentimes to interrupt and break off the threed of good exercises without a lawefull cause. For wee must
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:9372:121"/>
know, that among all the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note place="margin">Our heart is easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined vnto euill, but hardly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good.</note> of mans heart, one of the chiefest is, that as it is prompt and inclined to all euill, so it is remisse and slowe vnto any good. For in euill no other thing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to inflame our heart, yea and our bodye too, but a light and small thought, which by and by vanisheth awaie: but for a good affection, as Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, wee must search heauen and earth, and desire ayde of all thinges, which are giuen vnto vs of God. Of man it is saide, <hi>That he is a winde that passeth and commeth not againe:</hi> For with <note place="margin">Psal. 78.</note> great facility he goeth after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and corruptible thinges; but he returneth not againe from them, without great difficultie.

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:9372:121"/>
nor admire any more. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee must labour with al our strength, that Deuotion may be preserued: for as it is a very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie matter to loose it, so it is a most difficult thing to recouer it being lost.</p>
            <p>Wherefore not without cause we say, that it is a great impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this busines, if the threed of good exercises be broke of.

For experience it selfe teacheth, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a man hath at any time lost the vse of Deuotion and the feruour of the spirite, what great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

let him be thorowly and for euer admonished, that most diligently he preserue so great benefits and blessings, least vnluckily hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine relapse into the like mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as the interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this exercise doeth very much hinder Deuotion: so on the other side, the continuall vse of it <note place="margin">Continuall vse of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth encrease it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Similies.</note> is very conducent to the attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it. The tree that is wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in due season, doth encrease, and bringeth forth fruit: The childe that hath milk, and breasts ready to giue it sucke, when it desireth, groweth and waxeth bigger. A student in the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sciences, if he often repeate his lecture, and diligently fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the schoole of his May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, in a shorte time commeth to the perfection of the Artes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee studieth: so on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

part, hee that often and much intermitteth and breaketh off his study, eyther very late, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer becometh learned. For when after a certaine time he returneth againe to his study, hee hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten those thinges, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had learned: and so still in beginning hee consumeth his age, and spendeth his time.</p>
            <p>It is true, that when the delay and intermission is short, or for some godly &amp; lawfull cause, that God doth sooner restore that was lost. Hence it is that a faithfull and an obedient seruant some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times feeleth his praier doubled, after that he hath performed his obedience. But this is without controuersie, that the perfect in this intermission walk with lesser <note place="margin">Intermissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth lesse hurt the perfect then the vnperfect.</note> daunger, then those that are yong beginners: for these are those that are of the poorer sort, and are

more hungry, if they labour not euery day, they haue not to eate: But those that are richer &amp; more perfect, alwaies haue substance in themselues, by which they can for a time continue theyr e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, albeit they gaine no further matter. Therefore I thinke that this is one of the cheefe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces betweene the perfect and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, to wit, that the perfect are as trees planted in a moyst and fruiteful ground, which although they be not watered, by the space of certain daies, yet they preserue their greenenes, and bring foorth fruite: but the vnperfect are like trees standing in a dry and sandy earth, vpon which if water be not dayly powred, all the beauty and strength, which they had, perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: whereby it manifestly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that they wanted sap &amp; moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Therfore let him that is desirous of Deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continue &amp; perseuere in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious &amp; godly exercises, &amp; let him compose his life after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a wel ordred clocke, doing all things in due time, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much as lyes in him, that the threed &amp; continuance of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion be not broke off.</p>

This is that Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth <note place="margin">In his Epist to Laeta.</note> vnto a certaine Virgin, saying; Let the fare of a Virgin be a few hearbes, and sometimes a few small fishes. Let her so eate, that she may alwaies be hungry, that foorthwith after meate she may bee able to read, and pray. The same man also admonisheth that it is better alwayes to keepe <note place="margin">In his Epist. to Furia.</note> this rule in eating and drinking, then sometimes too wide to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the sailes of fasting, so that the body is enfeebled thereby; &amp; by &amp; by after to lose the raines vnto the gullet, that man thereby is in daunger of bursting. The same man also in another place, &amp; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, saith: A spare dyet, &amp; a belly alwaies hungry is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before a fast of three daies, &amp; it is better euery day to take a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, then once to take enough.</p>
            <p>That is the best rayne, which

            </head>
            <p>AN impediment contrary to the former is (as saith Saint <hi>Bernarde)</hi> too much abstinence, and weakenes of body, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer other euill disposition or debility, whether it be hunger or thirst, or colde, or heate, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer other accident. For there is so great society and sympathy between the soule and the body, that when as this is ill disposed, or standeth need of any thing, the other cannot lift it selfe vp free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inough to contemplate and meditate on heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things with quietnesse and tranquilitye: for
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:9372:132"/>
the loue of her friend doth call her away and doth disquiet he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, and calleth her thither, where it is greeued: neyther granteth her leaue to attend any other busines, vnlesse God of his especial grace doth dispence with it: as many times he is wont to doe.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is meete that a Deuout man keep that modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and temperaunce in chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and exercising his body, that it neyther growe grosse nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by superfluous delicates; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that bee weakenes by too much rigour and austerity, that it faint vnder the burden.</p>
            <p>For as we are to obserue in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>harpe, that the stringes be ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stretched too streight, nor loosened too slacke (for then they are eyther broken, or yeeld an vntuned and an vnpleasant sound) so in this celestiall Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:9372:133"/>
it is meet that the body bee neyther macerated by too much hunger, nor fatted by two much plenty: for both of them bring very much hurt to this exercise. For this cause God commaunded in the old law that salt (by which we vnderstand discretion) should be spinkled vpon al the sacrifices, that he might insinuat, that none of our sacrifices (although they be great) are acceptable vnto him vnlesse they be seasoned with salt, that is, with the sauour of discrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But because it is a hard thing to keep a meane, and the fleshe doth alwaies seeke it selfe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is necessary, that in these cases a mans own opinion bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies suspected vnto himself: &amp; if we must needs leane to one of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

            <p>FIrst and formost in this place we are to knowe, that God doth not alwaies take comfortes and consolations from his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, because their sinnes and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences haue deserued it: but ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for other causes: Among which this is first and chiefest, <note place="margin">1</note> that the health and life of the righteous may be preserued.

and goodnesse vpon his, that if it should long continue, neyther the feeble bodye could beare it, neyther coulde they remember, what the necessity of their body required: but they would neglect to relieue themselues.</p>
            <p>Therefore our gratious Lorde doth sometimes take from them those consolations and that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall sweetnesse, that they may recure the weakenesse of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and so their life might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued without miracle, which being continued, they at the last might enioy a greater and a more royall crowne.</p>

            <p>It also happeneth that there are certaine religious persons <note place="margin">5</note> found, which alwaies in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner liue in the continuall drynesse of heart, and that not through their owne sault, but because it so pleaseth the Lord, who wil not alwaies bring his elect by the same way, nor saue them after one manner: but after many and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry waies: that so his Wisedome, and prouidence might more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare through those sundrye meanes, which he vseth in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting and procuring the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his elect.</p>

It is written of Saint <hi>Basill,</hi> that oftentimes hee passed ouer whole nights without sleep; for he was very temperate in his dyet.

the smalnes of this volume, it shal be sufficient heere to haue set downe a few of them.</p>
            <p>The first is, that it is manyfest to all men, that the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <note place="margin">1</note> instrument, by which wee may help our neighbour, is true wisedome. But to obtaine this, what is more profitable then the feare of God? then an approoued life? then the dayly vse and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of vertues? or the prayer and the continuall meditation of the diuine law? What is so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and common in the holy Scripture, as that; <hi>The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisedome.</hi> and: <hi>The fulnes of Wisedome is the feare of the Lord.</hi>

            <p>The second reason is: To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert soules vnto God, is a worke <note place="margin">2</note> maruellous excellent and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall: for by this, theyr cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, that liue wickedly, is subdued: and their euill custome, which is little weaker then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that which is more, the power of the deuill, who possess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and most strongly holdeth captiue their harts, are ouercom'd and conquered. That such powers shuld be oppressed &amp; ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, it is necessary that greater po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer &amp; stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth should be present, which is not found vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, but in heauen: which is not so wel got by study, labor &amp; speculation, as by teares, sighings, &amp; the course of a good life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:9372:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Hence it is, that they that are conuerted vnto God, are no lesse the sonnes of teares, then of words: so that prayer hath no lesser part in the conuersion, then the finest oration of a most elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent orator.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as the prayer of <hi>Moses</hi> rather procured the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry against <hi>Amalech,</hi> then all the <note place="margin">Exod. 17.</note> swordes, that were drawen: so also wee muste suppose and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that in this victory the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, sighes, and grones of a true preacher haue no lesser part, then all the other voices and words, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they be ingenious, acute, and eloquent.</p>
            <p>The third reason is, because (as experience witnesseth) me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do <note place="margin">3</note> offend more grossely and foulely by the corruption of their owne affections and passions, then by the ignorance of the truth.

whosoeuer applyeth himself to bridle and restraine others, and to reforme their affections, hee must rather mooue their will, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> instruct their vnderstanding: and therefore all the masters of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence do teach, that there is not <note place="margin">That thou maist moue another, it is necessary that thou be fir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This is that which <hi>Quintilian</hi> saith; The sum &amp; chiefe of this matter, saith he, as far as I can gather, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth in this, that if we would mooue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that we be first mooued our selues. And a little after; The ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to be pronounced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such a minde, which may mooue. For how can it bee, that another should grieue, that heareth, vnles I first greeue, that speak? how shal I incense another to anger, if I my selfe be not angry? how shal ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

To all these another help is ioyned much more wonderfull, that is, the example of his life that preacheth. For there is no greater argument, that that should be beleeued which a man speaketh then that he that speaketh it doe it himselfe; and that his life agree with his doctrine.

            <p>Wherefore seeing that the sanctity of life is also supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Diuine, the righteous are as the tongues and mansions of the holy Ghost, and all men naturally doe reuerence them, &amp; honor them with a worship more then humane, and doe beholde and heare them, not as men, but as Angels; not as inhabitants of the earth, but as Citizens of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,

<pb n="396" facs="tcp:9372:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with so faire an aspect, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth so honest, that one would think that none other thing could be wished, neither that any fraude or collusion was vnder it. And this temptation is so much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by how much he is more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, that is tempted: for by how much hee loueth vertue, by so much he studieth for the profit of his neighbor, &amp; for the common good.</p>
            <p>For euen as nothing is more naturall vnto God, then to do wel vnto all his creatures: so he that participateth more of the spirit &amp; goodnes of God, he is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to doe good vnto others: so that nothing doth beare more rule in the heartes of good men, then an vnpatient and continuall desire to doe good to those that be good, and to succour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them in all things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="397" facs="tcp:9372:207"/>
For this cause that crafty and ancient seducer of man, in this matter hath alwayes bin trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some vnto the righteous: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that nothing is more fit to deceiue them, then that, to which of their owne accord they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. And so we see that many are cast headlong into most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and hard matters, and take such burdens vpon them, which doe exceede their strength and power, and that vnder pretence and colour of this help and ayde.</p>
            <p>Therefore we ought not to take greater heed of any desire, then of this, which doth creepe into our soules vnder colour and show of this good, and of this vertue; for it may procure vnto vs great strife and trouble. Holy <hi>Iosua,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ios. 3.</note> the Angell of God in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, did not credit him before he had asked, Art thou ours? or our

aduersaries? So we ought not to giue credit to euery motion and thought, although it seemeth good: for we know that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of Sathan can transforme himselfe oftentimes into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light, which he doth more often and more vsually in this worke, then in another, because he commeth hither vnder colour of piety, and as though he would inuite vs vnto charity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not without good cause the Fathers in the wildernes sayde, that oftentimes the Diuell doth call a religious man from the exercise of prayer vnder pretence of those things that are good, whilest he perswadeth them that there is a iust and an important cause, why they should do this and that, when in very deede there is none.</p>

For although the Apostles were full of the holy Ghost, yet they put from them all such kinde of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, so that they woulde not make prouision for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the poore. Wherefore in the fourth Councell of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage <note place="margin">In the 4.

            <head>CERTAINE ADMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions to be obserued in this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise against the fraudes and collusions of our auncient enemy. <hi>CHAP.</hi> XLI.</head>
            <p>HEtherto we haue spoken of certaine common tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are wont to molest and annoy them that are at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; now we will deliuer certaine admonitions &amp; instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which are to be obserued in this course. And although we haue set downe certain in the end of the first part of this booke; yet, because they are only put in the end, that they may teach vs to pray, I will set downe others heere, which may
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:9372:215"/>
lay open the deceipts and fraudes of our enemy the Deuill, who many wayes is wont to deceiue those, that walke in this way, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning good medicines into pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent poysons, and to shipwracke them in the very hauen.</p>
            <p>Therefore first of all let vs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose, that nothing can bee <note place="margin">There is nothing so good, but it may be abused by the malice of man.</note> found in this world so good and profitable, but that by mans ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiousnes it may be abused vnto euill. Wherefore euill men take occasions to perseuere in their wickednes of the very goodnes and mercy of God, and of the passion of Christ. Neyther onely do they take occasions of these things, but also of vertue hir selfe, which no man can abuse, follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing their own affections, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by oftentimes they take oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to offend. For we see ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men that of fasting, abstine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:9372:215"/>
knowledge, chastitie, and such like vertues, do take an occasion to be prowde, and to presume great things of themselues: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that a matter and an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of mischiefe and euill, which of it selfe is an excellent and an honorable good. Wherefore S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayth: As I very well vnderstand that chastity is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent good, so I feare the theefe of pride, least he steale away that which is good.</p>
            <p>Therefore I do not so greatly maruell, if the vertue of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be sometimes vnprofitable to some man, or if it doth bring dammage vnto him, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how to vse it conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently. But as it is an intollerable madnes to leaue the vertue of Chastity, or any other vertue or science, for none other cause, but because certaine abuse it, and by
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:9372:216"/>
it are proudely puffed vp; so also is it a foolish thing to relinquish meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for the abuse of some. For there is nothing vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which we may not abuse.</p>
            <p>That we may vnderstand this the better, we must know that there is not any vertue, which hath not by it some vice, carying <note place="margin">Euery ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue hath some vice annexed vnto it, which hath a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of vertue.</note> a show &amp; a resembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of vertue. For wisedome hath vaine science bearing a show of true wisedome: Iustice hath crueltie; Fortitude rashnes; Liberality prodigality; Humilitie cowardice; Affability lightnes; hope presumption; zeale vnaduisednes; feare distrust; &amp; so in the rest; so that as in all things as well artificiall as naturall there are found some true, and some seeming so, but are not so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede: for there is both true gold and that which is false; lawfull money, and counterfet coyne;
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:9372:216"/>
true gemmes, and false gemmes: so also among vertues, some are true, and some that appeare to be so, but are not so in truth.</p>
            <p>This therefore is the greatest difficultie, which is found in the way of vertue, which is wont to minister matter of errour vnto yong beginners, and to those that are not well exercised: for many embrace vice for vertue, as we dayly see that men are deceiued, receiuing counterfet coyne for that which is true, by reason of the likenes it hath with it. This is that which the Apostle sayth; <hi>That the Angell of Sathan doth many times transforme himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Angell of light:</hi> for so doth he oftentimes deceiue vs, obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vice vnto vs. being coloured with a semblance of vertue. But as we sayd before, that as it is an euill thing for a man to withdraw
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:9372:217"/>
himselfe from the exercise of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, because he is fearefull to fall into vice: so also is it dangerous to desist from the duty of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: but the vices and dangers are rather to be feared, which may arise from this abstaining. For it is manifest, that there is not any state, nor any maner of liuing found in the world, which hath not some danger annexed vnto it: wherefore all our life may not vnfitly be called one danger and one continuall temptation Therefore least any man be blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or deceiued of himselfe, it shall be profitable to shew as it were with a finger all kinde of dangers, deceipts, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, and to admonish what is to be done in each of them</p>

            <head>THE FIRST ADMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the dignitie and fruite of vocall prayer. <hi>CHAP. XLII.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>LEt this then be the first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition: they that haue mentall prayer in estimation, let them take heed that they do not contemne vocall prayer, or reiect it as vnprofitable: because it is <note place="margin">Whether vocall prayer differeth from men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall prayer.</note> manifest, that for the very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the vertue, there is no difference betweene this and that prayer. For to call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God with the heart only, or with the heart and the mouth together, doth make nothing for the efficacie of prayer. For to adde to the voyce of the heart the voice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth, which God hath created, that he
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:9372:218"/>
may be praysed and glorified by it, how can it be, that it should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate any thing from the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the work, or should import any essentiall difference? Euen as there is no essentiall difference betweene the confessions of him that speaketh, and him that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the same thing; so also prayer, which is a confession of the diuine praises, or (that I may speake more properly) a certaine petition of God for some neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary thing: whether this petition be made with inward words, or with outward, which are the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of internall things, there can be found no essentiall difference betweene this and that. This ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of praying is profitable to stir vp deuotion, and to inflame the heart, especially when it is luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme, &amp; dispersed, and therfore vnfit by his own strength to fly or
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:9372:218"/>
to swim: for the sweet &amp; deuout words, and the graue sentences, which are found in it, are very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to do this, if they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated with humilitie and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For this cause the words of God are called fyre in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; <note place="margin">Why the words of God are called fire.</note> for they haue vertue to warme our hearts, and to kindle in them the fyre of diuine loue. Furthermore, voyces haue (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when diuine Psalmes are sung) a certaine naturall force to beget deuotion, as Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> testifieth, who hearing the melodious Psalmodye of the Church, sayth, that he was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully inflamed within. Besides there are many men of that spirit and complexion, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for one mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t kepe their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fixed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God: for whom this manner of praying is most fitt, that by it (following the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:9372:219"/>
sense and style of the words) they may attend in heart vpon God, and talke with him. For seeing that they cannot speake vnto him with their own words, and open their owne necessities vnto him with fit words, it is a very good help for them, if they be suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the words of holy men, and that their spirit and deuotion be ruled by them, that by this manner they may more fitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their wants vnto God. In this place deuout Christians are to be put in minde, that making a prayer, they do it with as much deuotion and affection, as lieth in them: for hereupon depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth all the fruit &amp; efficacy of prayer. For in the eares of God, as <hi>Bernard</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Bernard in certaine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>entences.</note> saith, a vehement desire is a great clamour; but a remisse intent, is a submisse &amp; low voice: for his ears are ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rather to the voice of the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:9372:219"/>
heart, then to the voice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body.</p>
            <p>By this it may be vnderstoode how barren and fruitles the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of certaine men are, as wel ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical as temporal, who with such hast and swiftnes doe runne ouer their praiers, that they seeme not at all to talke with God. For they would not deale so vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly and coldly with men, if in good earnest they would obtaine any thing of them, for as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>The poore speaketh with prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pro. 18.</note> 
               <hi>but the rich answereth roughly.</hi> For he that plainely acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his owne want and misery; &amp; desireth seriously to be helped in his need; as he desireth it with all his heart, so he prayeth with al his heart, &amp; with the Prophet calleth with strong crying, saying: <hi>I haue cryed with my whole heart, Lord heare me.</hi> I would to God that men would vnderstand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:9372:220"/>
when they pray, to whome they speake, and what busines they haue in hand. For if they vnderstoode that they had speach with that supreame Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, in whose presence the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels tremble, and that they haue to deale with him about weighty and important busines, to wit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the remission of sinnes and the saluation of their soules, their eyes would be opened, and they would see that it is vnseemely, yea that it is vniust that they should so negligently conferre with such a Lord about so great and weighty matters, and to speake to him after that manner, that they would not speake to a seruant, if they would haue him to regard that they say.

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:9372:220"/>
in their prayer feele a dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; a certaine dulnes of mind, that praying only with their lips, they do not marke what they say, nor to whome they speake; the reason is, because oftentimes they haue vsed so vnreuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to come vnto prayer without any care or premeditation. Therfore it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to be vigilant in all our actions, but especially in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: for albeit that euery hour, and in all places, as <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, the eies of the Lord do behold vs, yet <note place="margin">Bernard in his epistles.</note> most especially in prayer: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we are always seene yet then especially when we speake vnto the Lorde, and shewe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues face to face. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place: It is a danger, if the <note place="margin">In his 4 sermo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:9372:221"/>
Because a feareful prayer doth not pierce heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for immoderate feare doth pluck back the minde, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praier cannot ascend, much lesse pierce. A luke warme prayer doth languish and faile in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending, because it wanteth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.

This saith he. But those that either will not pray at all, or that will not pray otherwise then we haue said, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is, with too much haste, negligently &amp; carelesly, let them not take it in ill part, that this is said vnto them: for by this meanes their coyne is become base, &amp; the worth of it is diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and not set by.</p>

prayer is the fountaine of good desires: for there by reason of the consideration of the perfections and blessings of God, the fyre of charity burneth, from which the sparks of good desires arise: yet a man must not too much trust these desires, running headlong after all those things he desireth, not doing that before, which <hi>Iohn</hi> admonisheth, <hi>Beleeue not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery spirit, but try the spirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

            <p>Therefore we must know, that as nature, which hath giuen to man affections and appetites to the preseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ofhis naturall life, hath also giuen him reason, that he may rule &amp; moderate them (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

            </head>
            <p>THe louer of deuotion is fiftly to be admonished, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though prayer be an excellent vertue (for by it we obtaine the spirit of God, &amp; his grace, which is the fountaine of all our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings; and with it many vertues do concurre, as we sayd before) yet for all this a man must not so desist and leaue off, but he must also bestow his strength &amp; might to compasse other vertues, as wel that he may satisfie his duty, to
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:9372:230"/>
which he is bound, as that by litle and litle he may get an habit of them. For although the feruour of charity is a great pricke vnto deuotion: yet notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding this feruour being somewhat slacked, which oftentimes comes to passe, forth with naturall appetites &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections do arise, and begin to lift vp their heads, vnlesse they be bridled by the continuall exercise of vertue, so <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> they headlong cast a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into many infirmities &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities. Therefore it is necessary, that besides the helpe we haue of prayer, that we be also ayded of the actes &amp; exercises of vertue, <hi>y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> by vse and continuance in them, by litle and litle we may get vnto vs an habit, and so the affections and perturbations of our minde may be restrained, that we may haue the exercise of vertue not only for the delight of Deuotion,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:9372:230"/>
but also that by the customary vse of vertue, passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s may be subdued.</p>
            <p>But if a man in the execution of these works, especially in <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> works of mercy be somtimes distracted and disturbed, and as it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken of the spirit, let him not for this discourage himselfe, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let him thinke, that he hath lost any thing in this busines, or that he shall bring forth greater fruite in an other exercise: as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinke, who know not in what thing true vertue consisteth, both because it is not to be maruelled at, if we be troubled being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with many businesses: and also, because that which is sweete, is not alwayes wholesome, yea many times the contrary happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. For we see that it doth no lesse profit the sicke to eate with <note place="margin">A Simily.</note> loathing and abhorring, then it doth the sound to feede with

            <p>They are much deceiued, that do iudge of the dignity of works by the taste, and by the sweetnes: and it oftentimes hapneth that such do not worke for that end, that they ought to worke for, that is, that the will of God might be done, but that their owne may be done: not that they might loue and seeke God, but that they might seeke themselues.

            <p>THe eight admonition is, that with all endeuour we flye from the too much familiaritie as well of men, as of women: yea, although they be religious and spirituall: for it often commeth to passe, as one saith, that spiritual loue is changed into carnal loue, for the similitude and likenes of the one with the other.</p>

               <note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> 
               <hi>my word, and my Father will loue him, and we will come vnto him, and will dwell with him.</hi> And a little before; <hi>He that hath my commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and keepeth them, is he that loueth me.</hi> Hence it is, that perfect loue and perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience seeme to be one and the selfe same thing: for he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, cannot but do that, which he commandeth, whome he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth; but he that hateth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Therefore to this kinde of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, mortification, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of our owne will before all things is required. For euen as a <note place="margin">A Simily.</note> yong set or slip cannot be grafted into a tree, vnlesse first that branch be cut off, into whose place it is to be inserted: so the diuine will cannot be grafted into our heart, vnlesse first our owne will be lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away; for these two wills are contrary one to the other.

For which cause all the Saints haue made an especial account of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification: for it is the first gate and entraunce vnto all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
            <p>This is that crosse, which our Sauiour so greatly commendeth in the Gospell, vpon which all our inordinate affections are to
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:9372:256" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be crucified, as al they haue done, and doe, of whome the Apostle speaketh; <hi>They that are Christes,</hi>

            <p>Seeing therfore that this crosse is of so great weight and mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and so abhorred and hated of our flesh: and seeing that those things which are so hard and difficult, cannot bee performed without great strength and fortitude: and seeing that vnsauery relishes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be got downe without some sauery sauce, therfore praier is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, in which both things are found. For by prayer wee obtaine <note place="margin">What we obtaine by prayer.</note> fortitude and courage to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Amalech</hi> our enemy: &amp; by prayer the diuine grace is bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon vs, which alone can do al things: in it charity is kindled and exercised, which is the mother of all vertues, &amp; by this our eyes are

            <p>For this cause prayer is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly commended of all the Saints: not onely for that, which it is in it selfe (although it be an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall acte of Religion) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and that cheefly, for the great helpe and ayde it bringeth to them that endeuor to the foresaid end.</p>

If any man therefore should be frequent in prayer, and yet disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and lose in manners, neyther endeuour himselfe vnto vertuous actions, hee should not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from one that is sicke and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound, who alwaies vseth medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and yet is neuer the better, but still continueth in the same infirmity: he is wretched &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable after a double manner; first by reason of the griefe &amp; vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the infirmity, &amp; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because of the continuall hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and annoyance of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>

               </hi> way, seeking for a vent, &amp; neuer resteth, vntil it hath satisfied the lust. Therfore it is very well said of a certaine <note place="margin">Nature is subtill.</note> Doctor, that nature is subtill, and in all things seeketh her selfe: yea in those men, that are more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and Diuine.</p>
            <p>And rightly he calleth her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, because with great modestie, so that she is not perceiued, shee entreth where she listeth: and insinuateth her selfe, whether she is not called; that she may search, if she may finde ought, that may bee either pleasant or profitable vnto her, which she may enioy, or which she may rest in.</p>

Hence the greater part of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors arise, which are wont to meete with vs in this way. Hence first ariseth the corruption of the intent of the good works we do: the onely and principall ende of which is God: our sensuall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite doth contrary and gaine-say this ende, which alwaies seeketh something, wherein to delight it selfe. And this is a principall and a cheefe thing, that doth corrupt al our workes, and causeth, that the Water is not altogether pure.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that many liue in errour, thinking that they haue done many good workes, in the ministery of the Lord: which when they come to be examined at the strict iudgement of God, it presently &amp; plainly appeareth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it was not pure gold, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they brought, but mingled with drosse, and
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:9372:259" rendition="simple:additions"/>
full of the mud of theyr owne loue.</p>
            <p>From this fountain it also sping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that many in the exercises of prayer, of reading, &amp; meditation, &amp;c. do hunt after nothing els, but delight, and a certaine spirituall ioy, and in this they place the height of their desire: perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues, because it is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall delight, that they are now in a safe hauen, and that there cannot remaine any daunger, but in a carnall delight, they doe not marke, that selfe loue, that spirituall gluttony, coueteousnes, and such like affections, may also haue place heere, as a certaine Doctor saith: &amp; perhaps so much the more, as these delightes are greater, and more desired.</p>
            <p>At the least this is certaine, that the roote of all this euill is the loue of our selues, which hath an

But before all thinges let him dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently consider, whether the loue of honour, of pleasure, of the worlde, and of such like affections bee killed and mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, and according to the rule, that euery one shall finde in himselfe, let him so iudge: and not according to the quantity of sweetnes, which he shall feele in prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:9372:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But if we would attaine vnto <note place="margin">Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie.</note> our true end indeed, it ought not to be sufficient vnto vs, to haue looked vnto prayer: but it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so requisite, that with one eye, and that with the best, we haue a regard vnto mortification, and with the other vnto prayer. If we will doe this, at the length wee shall come vnto true contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Otherwise prayer will profit nothing without mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: neither can perfect mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification be had, without the help of prayer.</p>
            <p>For prayer and mortification are as two sisters, one of which doth help the other in all thinges, that are to be done.</p>
            <p>Which two vertues were figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">The two Alters in the temple of salomon what they signifie.</note> and pointed at by those two Alters, that were in the temple of <hi>Salomon;</hi> vpon one of which, sacrifices were alwayes offered;
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:9372:267"/>
and vpon the other nothing but incense.</p>
            <p>By the Alter of Sacrifice, on which diuerse liuing creatures were daily killed and sacrificed, mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is vnderstood, whose duety it is, to sacrifice and cut off the heades of our appetites: By the Alter of incense, prayer is meant, which like incense kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by the Diuine loue, doth as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend out of our hearts euen vp to heauen, &amp; there doth deale with God about the dispatch of our busines.</p>
            <p>He therefore that after this manner desireth to bee the Temple of the liuing God, let him haue in his Soule these twoo Alters: one is his superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our part, where alwayes may fume the incense of prayer, and meditation, that that of the Psalmographer may be fulfilled:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="516" facs="tcp:9372:268"/>
               <hi>O how loue I thy law, it is my</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> 
               <hi>meditation continually.</hi> The other in his inferiour part, where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hee may offer Sacrifices of his concupiscences and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites; that that of the Apostle may bee done; <hi>Mortifie your members which are on the earth, fornication, and vncleannesse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordynate</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Colos 3.</note> 
               <hi>affection, euill concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence and coueteousnes which is idolatrie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that myrrh, of which the Spouse speaketh in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: <hi>I will goe,</hi> saith shee, <hi>into the mountaine of myrrh, and to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cant. 4.</note> 
               <hi>the hill of incense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as by incense prayer is vnderstoode, so by myrrh mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is meant: which is most bitter vnto our taste, but most precious in the sight of God, and of moste acceptable sauour. Neyther doth it want a mistery,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:9372:268" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that myrrh is attributed to the mountaine, and incense to the hill: perhaps that it might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated, how mortification is farre more excellent then prayer, as well in difficulty, as in dignity. For as an vniuersall mortifying of all our appetites is more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult <note place="margin">Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult.</note> then prayer, so also it is more excellent and more necessary. And as the hill is the way vnto the mountaine, and the meanes to ascend vnto it, so prayer is the way, and the ascending to mortification. Therefore the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God is to be admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, that the more sweetnes he feeleth in prayer, the more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully he prepare himselfe vnto greater troubles: considering that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t is meete and requisite, that he suffer for that Lord, by whom he hath bene dealt with so louingly &amp; so tenderly: and let him weigh
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:9372:269"/>
and marke that these consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which are giuen vnto him, are but breathings bestowed vpon him to this end, that with greater cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage he may returne into the field.</p>
            <p>And we are faithfully to marke and consider, that at that very <note place="margin">Christ in the glory of his tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration did speake of his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> time, when the Lord was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured vpon the mount, when his face did shine like the Sunne, and his garments were as white as snow: I say that at that very time, in the midst of so great ioyes he spake of those things, which afterwards he was to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer at Ierusalem. What? had the busines of his passion any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship or participation with his transfiguration? If musick be vnseasonable in the time of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; shall not mourning in like manner be vnseasonable in the time of musicke, and publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing?
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:9372:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Truly this hath place at the feasts and meetings of this world; but not in diuine solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, where consolations are giuen for tribulations: rest for torment; and for the crosse trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration. So that as often as the seruant of God feeleth any comfort, let him assuredly know, that he is cited, and prouoked vnto a new combat: and as these consol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tions doe binde a man vnto tribulations; so wee must thinke, that wee are called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tribulations, as often as wee feele that wee are comforted. Therefore as a diligent and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ueller, that entreth into an <note place="margin">A Simily.</note> Inne, that he may breake his fast, eateth, and withall is carefull to make an ende of the voyage he hath taken in hand, so that although his bodye be in the Inne, yet his heart and minde
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:9372:270"/>
is about his iourney: so also the seruant of God, when he goeth to pray, let him on the one side enioy celestiall sweetnes, and on the other side let him purpose to beare troubles and molestations for his loue, of whome he is so much made of, and who will not haue any one to eate his bread, but in the sweate of his face.</p>
            <p>Let this then be the ende and scope of this busines; that before all things we write in our hearts these wordes of our Sauiour: <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himselfe, and take vp his crosse</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke. 9.</note> 
               <hi>dayly, and follow me.</hi> And because this crosse can hardly be taken vp, vnlesse we be helped by the fortitude and alacrity of prayer: therefore we betake our selues to this vertue, as to a most faithfull guide, which doth bring vs to this ende. Therefore that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,

            <head>THE FOVRTEENTH admonition, that sometimes we must pray longer, then at other some. <hi>CHAP. LVI.</hi>

            <p>VVE sayd before that the seruant of God ought to set downe vnto himselfe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine times to pray in, as we reade that <hi>Daniell</hi> did in times past, <note place="margin">Dan. 6.</note> who thrice a day prayed vpon his knees.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Dauid</hi> did the like, it is manifest by that which hee sayeth; <hi>In the euening and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 55.</note> 
               <hi>and at noone day will I pray, and that instantly, and he shal heare my voyce.</hi> Now let vs adde
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:9372:276"/>
besides the ordinary time of euery day, that a man ought at certaine howres, (all other busines set apart, although it be spirituall) wholy to giue himselfe vnto prayer and meditation, and that more plentifull foode bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon the soule, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre that, which was consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by dayly defects, and that strength may be gotten to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede further. For as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world besides their <note place="margin">A Simily.</note> dayly repast, haue their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary feastes and bankets, in which they are wont to exceede the manner of other refections: so it is also behoouefull, that the righteous besides theyr dayly prayer haue their feasts and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bankets, in which theyr soules may feede not measurably (as at other times) but may be filled and stuffed with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:9372:276"/>
sweetenes, and with the plenty of Gods house.</p>
            <p>We see that nature is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the deaw, that in the <note place="margin">A Simily.</note> night time falleth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, but also now and then it rayneth, and that plentifully, not for a weeke, but oftentimes longer; for so it is necessary, that the heauens should be now and then more liberall towardes the earth, and should so glut it, that neither the sunne, nor the winde may make it dry: So also our soule besides the common and dayly deaw, ought to haue certayne peculiar tymes, in which our eyes may do none other thing, then showre downe most plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull teares of deuotion; by which our soule may be so filled with the vertues and iuyce of the holy Ghost, that all the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and all the windes of
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:9372:277"/>
this world may not dry it.</p>
            <p>Albeit this course is lawdable at any time, yet especially at the chiefe solemnities and feasts of the yeare: neyther is it lesse ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarye in the time of trouble, or after deliuerance from some offence, or after disturbance in some ouerth wart busines, then the recreation and refection of the body is necessary after long infirmitie. For otherwise a man cannot turne vnto himselfe, nor be renewed, vnlesse he bestow as much time vpon his returne into the way, as he spent, when he went out of the way: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seeing that wee knowe that Deuotion is of the nature of those things, which are easily lost, but being lost, are hardly recouered.</p>
            <p>Of what weight this busines is, no man can easily declare; for
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:9372:277"/>
it may be that at one of these times greater giftes and graces may be receiued, then at any other time. And according to the iudgement of the diuines, any one act done with feruour, and earnest zeale, doth more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease charity, then many done with numnes and feeblenes. If this haue place in other actes of vertue, certainely it shall also haue place in prayer, which doth more traffick with God by the way of mercy, then by the way of iustice: and therefore it may be so feruent and so zealous, that it may obtaine more in one day, then that which is feeble and dull can obtaine in many. Such was the prayer of <hi>Sara</hi> the wife of <note place="margin">Sara, the wife of Tobias. Tob. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Tobias,</hi> who for three dayes and three nights, did neither eate nor drinke, but continuing in prayer, intreated the Lord with teares.

The third day, when she percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that her prayer was heard, she gaue thanks vnto God for her deliuerance.

            <head>THE SEVENTENTH admonition, that this exercise is not to be taken for an Arte, or vsed as an Arte, but to be done with great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence. <hi>CHAP. LIX.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe louer and embracer of Deuotion is also in this place to be admonished, that all that hath hetherto beene spoken to stirre vp Deuotion, is as a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue to prepare man to receiue the diuine grace: by casting away all trust in his owne strength and merits, and by reposing it in God alone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="556" facs="tcp:9372:288"/>
I say this; because there are many men, who of all these rules and instructions do make an arte, supposing, that as he that learneth an arte, if he will obserue his rules, becommeth a cunning workma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so also they thinke that hee, that well obserueth these our rules, shall obtaine that hee desireth by the vertue of them: not mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this is nothing else, then to make an arte of grace, and to attrybute that to the rules of humane arte, which is the pure gift and mercy of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The Doctrines of certaine spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bookes written as well in prose, as in verse, haue giuen occasion of this error: which do so exceedingly commend their rules and their manner of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that some thinke, that by the benefit of them, they may obtain
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:9372:288"/>
that they desire. None otherwise then an Alchimist, teaching to <note place="margin">A Simily.</note> make chimicke gold, who reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his scholler this or that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and sayth thou shalt thus and thus prepare it, and by and by thou shalt haue pure gold: so these men say, doe this and that, speake after this manner and after that, and by and by thou shalt haue the loue and grace of God. This manner of teaching is starke naught, and farre different and dissonant from the style and grauytye of the holy Doctors: and also vnworthy the honor of the diuine grace.</p>
            <p>For seeing that this whole busines is grace and the mercy of God; it is meete, that it be handled not as though it were of arte, but of grace: that by this manner man knowing what hee asketh, he may knowe, that
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:9372:289"/>
the cheefest meanes, by which he ought to dispose himselfe vnto this busines, is lowly humility, and the knowledge of his owne misery, with a most firme hope of the Diuine mercy: that by the knowledge of them both, teares may trickle downe, and prayers proceede: by which man being wayted vpon, hee may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the gate of humility, and receyue that hee desireth by humilitie, and gyue GOD thankes with humilitie: not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any trust, eyther in himselfe, or in his exercises, or in hys workes.</p>
            <p>Which although it bee true, yet this admonition and doctrine doth not exclude our labours, or that which we ought to doe. For although he that planteth, and he that watereth, is not the same that he is that giueth the increase
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:9372:289"/>
who is God: yet hee willeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse that wee should plant and water, that hee may giue the increase. No man doth doubt, that any thing doth so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a guide and counsell, as a spirituall life: especially in the ioy and consolation of prayer; which as it is more delicate and diuine; so also it requireth more counsell and more instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>And as it is vnmeete and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust, that the exercise of prayer should bee taught as an Arte, least grace bee impayred and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: so also man is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished of all those thinges, that are necessary, least he stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fall in this way. For wee see some that after many yeeres dooe lyttle profit in this exercise, and others that passe theyr time ouer in recyting a
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:9372:290"/>
number of vocall prayers, who verye sildome dooe seriouslye thinke of, eyther that which belonges vnto God, or that which themselues speake. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Reader was to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished of both, that his labours may be more fruitefull.</p>

            <p>But when they haue once made some proceeding and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, it is not needfull, that they shoulde alwayes treade in the same path, but it is meet, that they go, whether the holy Ghost doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>eade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who is wont to remoue his schollers from a lower forme to a higher. Therefore there are some, that leauing those consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations doe proceede to the meditations of diuine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the wonders of God, of his benefits, and in the meditation of them do dayly more and more profit, and encrease in his loue, who is infinitely good, the

giuer of all goodnes, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull in all his workes. There be others, that giue themselues to the meditation of the holy Scripture, which is the Ocean of infinite wonders and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, as many of the holy Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did, and many of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the wildernes.</p>

            <p>For if a man will open hys eyes, and will diligently looke into and examine his owne life from the beginning to the end from his conception and naty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity euen to this day, hee sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>This is the moste perfecte estate of contemplation; to which we must alwayes aspire, in which a man doth not seeke as in the way, set on by the meditation of loue: but in which as in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try he doth now enioy his desired loue, being nowe found, and in this he resteth as in his end, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
