            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GReat are the Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of <hi>England,</hi>
and many are the
Miseries which are
like to ensue and
befall this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
unlesse a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Alteration of Unity and Peace be
knitted betwixt the Head and the Body,
for want of which, this Kingdome is
like to suffer, and will be become a scorn
to forreign Nations.</p>
            <p>The Kings Majesty hath declared, that
unlesse the <hi>Parliament</hi> will give him Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
against Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> and divers
others which have not obeyed His spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65474:3"/>O what a sad and lamentable Ditty is
this to sound in the Ears of the poore
subject, <hi>That His Majesty is intended and
fully Resolved to take Armes against His
Parliament, whose vigilancie and care hath
alwayes bin very great, both for the defence
and safeguard of His Majesties Royall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the Peace and Liberty of the poore
Subject, not having the least thought of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
His Majesties Honour and Dignity
from him, but to establish and enact it farre
greater then any of his Predecessours ever
had.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But his Majesty being incensed against
them by the Evill Counsell which are
now lurking about his Royal Court, hath
set down his full Resolution and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to set up his <hi>Standard</hi> neer <hi>N<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

vowing to have Justice against those
which did oppose His Sacred Majesty,
keeping him forth by violence from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into his own Tovvn, which His
Majesty took to be a great Affront against
His Royall Person, and a great Disgrace

his Resolution against the said Parties,
that Justice shall immediatly proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, which if it be denved, His
Majesty hath vowed He will take them
by force, or else lose his own life therin,
being resolved to adventure His Royall
Person in such an Honourable Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.</p>
            <p>Moreover, His Majesty sent about 1000
men into <hi>Newcastle,</hi> the information and
Report wherof were related to the High
Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> it is thought that
His Majesty is Resolved to set up His
<hi>Standard</hi> there, if any such occasion be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neverthelesse, his Majesty doth Declare,
that if the Parliament will revoke their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Orders concerning all Leavies, and the
disposing of the Militia, and give His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
Iustice against those that detain his town
and Fort from him, he is content to lay down
his Armes.</hi>

            <p>It hath bin a long while reported, that
the <hi>Danes</hi> hath bin divers times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to Assist His Majesty, yet it hath
<pb facs="tcp:65474:4"/>
proved false and contrary; But now it
proves too true.</p>
            <p>For it is credibly reported, that the
King of <hi>Denmark</hi> having received intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
from His Majesties Court at <hi>York,</hi>
the Differences betwixt His Majesty and
the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that the King were
Resolved by force of Arms to take Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
against Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> and the rest
of those which would not obey His spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Command, the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi>
taking it into consideration, making His
Counsell acquainted vvith it, thinking
that it would bee an ingratefull part of
Him not to assist His Majesty with vvhat
Forces he could conveniently raise, Hee
referred it to His Counsel, and after some
Debate, they concluded that there should
be a fleet forthvvith Rigged and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
