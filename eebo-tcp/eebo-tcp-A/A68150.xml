            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Timo. 3.16.</hi> Which to know, is the firſt and chiefeſt poynt of all ſaluation, as <hi>Iohn 17.3. This is eternall life, to know the Father, and him whom he hath ſent, Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> Which muſt be obteined by the true vnderſtanding of the Bible, as <hi>Iohn 5.39. Search the Scriptures, and in them ye ſhall find eternall life.</hi> Some will ſay, it is enough to know <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified. <hi>Pilate, Herod,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> the traytor, knew that; yet went to eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Wherefore ſaluation conſiſteth not in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward knowledge, but in renewing the ſpirit of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; which ſtandeth firſt in the knowledge and feare of God; then in the knowing of our ſelues: which are the firſt two ſteps to ſaluation. For true Knowledge is the mother of Godlineſſe: and as the Eye is the light of the Body, ſo is Vnderſtanding the light of the Minde. This a man hauing truly learned, he is to meditate of the graces of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> offered vnto vs by his Word.</p>

God to eſteeme him without mercie, then in any other ſinne we commit againſt Man.

For it is not onely required of a man to eſchew euill, but withal to do good: to flie dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if we will enioy the light: to follow the right way, if we will not erre: to auoy de the myre &amp; durt, if we will be cleane and without ſpot: and forbeare to be euill, if we will begin to be good. For it is not enough for a Valiant man to doe what he may, but alſo he is bound to attempt nothing but what he ought. And as repentance is the fruit of godly ſorrow; ſo thankfulnes to God for deliuerances from like trials, proceedeth from Repentance: Therefore <hi>Kenan</hi> the <hi>Contrite,</hi> nameth his ſon, <hi>Mahalaleel, <hi>My praiſe God:</hi>

                  <p>IT was on Fryday, the ſixt day; the day of <hi>Adams</hi> creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the time of eating: For we doe not read that euer <hi>Adam</hi> did eate, before he did eate of the forbidden fruite. Therefore when by the ſtorie, the time of eating cannot be ſeperated in time, reaſon ſheweth vs to ioyne them in time: For, <hi>Satan was a murderer from the beginning;</hi> and wee
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15591:15"/>
muſt bring it from the beginning as neare as can be, not croſsing any Scripture. The ſearching of this matter, is not of ſmall importance: For from the true vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Creation, we ſee the clearenes of the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and not marking the Creation aright, is the cauſe of much folly: and they that miſſe of the lawes of Creation, are ſure to miſſe of the lawes of Redemption: and <hi>Moſes</hi> making mention of many Times, hee would not haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the time of the Fall, except it had been done pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the Creation; therefore <hi>Adams</hi> fall, muſt needs be layd as neere the beginning as may be, not croſsing the Storie. The bare Narration ſheweth, that no famous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on went betweene the Commandement and the Fall. And the ſhortneſſe of the time, doth ſhew the force of the Aduerſarie. Beſides, it is a great ſinne to ſay, that any man, except <hi>Chriſt,</hi> could fulfill perfectly any one poynt of the Law: for thereby we darken the glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and prooue him not to haue performed the whole Law.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> had continued vntill the Sabaoth in his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, no doubt he would haue kept a perfect Sabaoth. And if he had kept a perfect Sabaoth, he had performed ſome part of the Law, and thereby been partaker with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the worke of our Redemption.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if <hi>Adam</hi> had continued in the image of God, which is in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, vntill the Sabaoth, he would haue performed the ordinances of the Sabaoth; which was, to eate of the <hi>Tree of life:</hi> for God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his fall, ſetteth <hi>Cherubins</hi> to keepe the way of the <hi>Tree of life,</hi> leaſt <hi>Adam</hi> eating, ſhould liue for euer. Whereby it appeareth, that if he had eaten thereof before, he had not fallen. Therefore it cannot be, that <hi>Adam</hi> continued per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnto the Sabaoth.</p>
                  <p>And further it is written, Pſal. 49.20. <hi>Adam beeing in honour, continueth not one night, but is like to the Beaſtes that periſh.</hi>

                  <p>And in the ſtorie of the Creation in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> preſently after the fall, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh of the Redemption.

And wherefore ſhould all the actions of the Redemption be accompliſhed in ſuch rareneſſe, except to be anſwerable both to the fall, and to the time of the fall? Wherefore it is needfull we ſhould know our thraldome, if we will receiue comfort by the Redeemer, thus.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Reſtorer, was borne of a Virgin: Why? Becauſe by a Virgin, deſtruction came to the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> compareth <hi>Eue</hi> and <hi>Marie</hi> togeather thus. <hi>Eue</hi> being a Virgin, hearing the wordes of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and beleeuing them, brought foorth Death.

                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, why ſhould <hi>Chriſt</hi> die on the ſixt day, rather then on the fifth, or fourth? And why was there darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vntill the coole of the day, rather then till the Sunne ſetting? But to make the Redemption anſwerable to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part of the Fall: becauſe God, according to the ſecret counſell of his owne will, before the foundations of the earth were layd, would make the art of Saluation ſo eaſie, and the harmonie of the Bible ſo tunable, that no muſicke

to be imbraced of all, ſeeing it ſtretcheth to the ſaluation of all. It appeareth hereby, that the godly Fathers in aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time, had wonderfull regard in naming their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

                  <p>From <hi>Mahalaleel</hi> we are taught, to <hi>Prayſe God</hi> aright; that is, in ſinceritie of ſpirit, with ſounde knowledge grounded vpon the trueth of his word. <hi>David</hi> knowing that prayſe giuing to God, is not onely required at our hands, but alſo at euery creatures in their kind: biddeth the whole courſe of Nature, <hi>Prayſe the Lord.</hi> And in <hi>Pſalm. 47.6.</hi> hee ſayth: <hi>O ſing prayſes, ſing prayſes vnto our God: O ſing prayſes, ſing prayſes vnto our King: for the Lord is high, and to be feared: Hee is the great King vpon all the earth, ſing prayſes therefore with vnderſtanding.</hi> Hee ſheweth vs a reaſon in the <hi>19. Pſal. 1.</hi> when he ſayth: <hi>The Heauens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glory of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his handie worke. One day telleth another, &amp; one night certifieth another, &amp;c. Therefore, let the wordes of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be alway acceptable in thy ſight, O Lord my Locke, and my Redeemer.</hi> Whereby we are taught, that the true prayſe of God, conſiſteth not onely in outward acknowledging of his workes, and his iudgementes, (for that the wicked are often times compelled to confeſſe, as <hi>Pharaoh, Nebucad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netzar,</hi> and others;) but we muſt prayſe God ſo, as that all our thanks, and all our actions, may tende to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of the Redemption by Chriſt. For ſo doth <hi>Dauid</hi> In this <hi>19. Pſalme,</hi> hee beginneth with the Creation, and endeth with the Redemption. Let vs therefore with him alſo ſay, <hi>Pſal. 103.1. Prayſe the Lord, O my ſoule; and all that is within mee, prayſe his holy name; which forgiueth all thy ſinne, and healeth all thine infirmities: which ſaueth thy life from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and crowneth thee with mercy and louing kindneſſe.</hi> And
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15591:23"/>
                     <hi>Pſalm. 105.1. O giue thankes vnto the Lord, and call vpon his holy name, tell the people what thinges hee hath done. O let your ſonges be of him, and prayſe him, and let your talking be of all his wondrous workes. Reioyce in his holy name: Let the heart of them reioyce, that ſeeke the Lord. O ſeeke the Lord and his ſtrength, ſeeke his face euermore.</hi>

                     <hi>Methuſhelah</hi> died, being 969. yeares old, (<hi>Sem</hi> being 98.<note place="margin">1656.</note>) the ſeuenth that died after <hi>Adam,</hi> as his father <hi>Henoch</hi> was the ſeuenth that was borne after <hi>Adam.</hi> He died but a few daies before the Flood, to ſhew that hee being a iuſt man, kept away the Flood, and lacked but 31. yeares of 1000. Now it is not to be vnderſtoode that he liued full 969. yeares, for hee liued but a few dayes of his laſt yeare. For if his yeares be caſt, you ſhall ſee he dieth in the yeare of the Flood. The Flood came not in the firſt month, becauſe <hi>Methuſhelah</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liued. The tenth day of the ſecond month the Flood came, <hi>Methuſhelah</hi> was dead before that time. His dayes were the exact rule of the Flood, for ſo long as he liued the waters could not ouerflow the earth: hee beeing dead, the waters might aſke God whether they ſhould now worke vengeance to the wicked? No ſaith God, <hi>Noah</hi> ſhall mourne him a month, as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> mourned <hi>Iacobs</hi> death: afterwardes, this month of ſorrow beeing ended, then they demaund of God againe, whether now the wicked ſhould bee ouerwhelmed with waters? God anſwered, no: for <hi>Noah</hi> ſhall haue a Sabaoth of preparation. This being finiſhed, the Flood couereth the face of the earth.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:15591:27"/>
old, and that afterwards, God ſaith, <hi>The daies of all fleſh ſhalbe an hundreth &amp; tweentie yeares,</hi> then <hi>Noah</hi> at the flood muſt be 620. yeares, for put 120. to 500 and you haue 620. but his age at the Flood is but 600. Therfore ſome thinke that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Chronicle is falſe, or elſe the 20. yeares were ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened: like as it was in <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> ſtraytes, leaſt no fleſh ſhould be ſaued. To anſwere this doubt, we muſt obſerue, that it is no reaſon in diuinitie, that becauſe a matter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, or is made mention of in a Chapter afterwards, that the time therefore of that ſtorie or action followeth the Chapters or actions going before; for this is but a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of methode: For <hi>Moſes</hi> in penning the Scriptures, vſed this order. He layeth downe things of like nature to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as Genealogies together, &amp; ſuch like, though they differ in time; becauſe elſe he ſhould make often repetion of the ſame thinges. The obſeruation of this, cauſed the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> to ſet downe this Rule, that <hi>Moſes</hi> in penning his Storie, doth not regard the circumſtance of firſt &amp; latter. To weete, hee doth not ſet downe that in the firſt place, which is firſt in time; and ſo that which is latter in time, afterwardes; but ſometimes that which is latter, in the firſt place; and that which is firſt in time, in the laſt, as the neceſsitie of the narration giueth occaſion. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus made plaine, the doubt is eaſily diſcuſſed; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>Noah</hi> 620. yeares old at the Flood, neither are the yeares of the Flood any thing ſhortned, but the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is altogeather true. For if we referre the 120. yeares of the Flood, 20. yeares before that Chapter in which it was ſayd <hi>Noah</hi> was 500. yeares old, and begot <hi>Sem, Cham,</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> then doe we make all thinges agree, without croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one another: and this of neceſsitie wee muſt needes doe: For ſeeing God hath layde downe the generals in proper and plaine termes, we muſt ſo caſt the particulars, that they may make the generall true, and no way alter it. Beſides, we haue a like example: for although all the liues
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15591:28"/>
and deathes of the Fathers before the Flood, are reckoned and ſummed vp togeather in one Chapter, wee muſt not thinke that all their liues are precedent to the Chapters following. For the Chronicles ſheweth that <hi>Lamech</hi> liued 5. yeares before the Flood, and <hi>Methuſhelahs</hi> death and the beginning of the Flood, are very neare: Euen ſo heere this ſentence of the 120. yeares, is to be counted before the fifth Chapter wherein <hi>Noahs</hi> age is reckoned: and for the ſhortning of the dayes in <hi>Ieruſalems</hi> beſiedging, the holy Ghoſt ſayth, it ſhall be ſo; but for the ſhortning of the dayes at the Flood, we haue no ſuch warrant in <hi>Moſes:</hi> Therefore we are not to beleeue it.</p>

                     <note place="margin">1536.</note>Cxx. yeares begin Gen. 6. In which the ſpirit of Chriſt preached while the Arke was in making.</head>
                  <p>VPon this ſentence, there dependeth a great queſtion, whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſcended into Hell in his humane ſoule. The cauſe why this queſtion is neceſſarie to be handled, is becauſe diuers of the auncient Fathers hold opinion of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> diſcent into Hell in his humane ſoule: Whoſe opinions hauing been ſo ſuperſtitiouſly receiued, haue drawen others of latter time, into the like errours. But if men would follow the plainnes laide downe in the Bible, and with humilitie ſearch it, auoyding curioſitie, they need not trouble themſelues with the errours of the Fathers. The wordes of the text. 1. <hi>Pet. 3.18.</hi> are theſe <hi>Chriſt was dead concerning the fleſh, but was quickned by the Spirit. By the which he alſo went and preached to the ſpirits in priſon, which in times paſt diſobeyed, when once the long ſuffering of God abode in the dayes of</hi> Noah, <hi>while the Arke was in making.</hi> Now the words whereupon this error is grounded, are theſe. <hi>Chriſt being dead as concerning the fleſh, went and preached to the ſpirits in priſon.</hi> Vpon this they gather, that the ſpirits menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned there, are meant thoſe in Hell: <hi>and went and preached,</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:15591:28"/>
that is, after hee was dead. But if wee compare theſe words with the reſidue, and conſider the time when this preaching was, we ſhall ſee Saint <hi>Peter</hi> meaneth nothing leſſe, than the deſcending of Chriſts ſoule into hell. For firſt, the text ſaith, <hi>Hee went and preached by the ſame ſpirit by which he was quickned.</hi> This ſpirit is of neceſsitie the Godhead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For what ſpirit was there that could looſen the ſorrowes of death that they ſhould not hold him, and raiſe Chriſt from the dead, but the Godhead of Chriſt? Then the ſoules of all men, Godly or vngodly, being immortall, cannot die; and therefore this quickning, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant of his humane ſoule, for it needed none. Beſides, we muſt conſider to whom Saint <hi>Peter</hi> wrote, to wit, to the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Now ſeeing Chriſt taught nothing but <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and the Apoſtles nothing but what they learned of Chriſt; with what conſcience could Saint <hi>Peter</hi> write a ſtorie to the <hi>Iewes</hi> of the ſeueere iuſtice of God, which was neuer in <hi>Moſes?</hi> for <hi>Moſes</hi> neuer mentioneth Chriſts deſcent into Hel, there to cauſe the wicked to be more tormented. Therefore ſeeing this old opinion gathered out of the workes of the fathers, and bred by them, maintaineth manifeſt abſurdities, we muſt ſeeke for another expoſition. If we conſider the old Teſtament, we ſhall find that <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in the booke of <hi>Iob.</hi> preacheth the ſame doctrine that S. <hi>Peter</hi> doth, and therefore will ſerue for an expoſition. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> reſoneth with <hi>Iob</hi> thus: Haſt thou, O <hi>Iob,</hi> marked the way of the world wherein wicked men haue walked, which were cut off by time, and whoſe foundation was couered with waters, which ſaid vnto God, depart from vs? And yet what could he doe more for them? he filled their houſes with good thinges, yet they refuſed the way of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie. So S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, that the ſpirit of God went in like manner, as he is ſaid to come downe at the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Babell</hi> by confounding their tongues, and when
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15591:29"/>

Surely, anſwereth <hi>Iubal,</hi> I will tell you ſtrange thinges: Seuen of my beſt Rammes, and ſeuen of my beſt Ewes ranne from my flocke right-foorth to the Arke, &amp; there they went in. And an other ſtanding by, replyeth: I am ſure I can tell (ſayth hee) as great a maruell as this: for comming by a Wood, I ſaw a fearefull Lyon and a fierce Lyoneſſe, and they went as gentlely by me as two Lambes, not offering to doe me any hurt, and came to the Arke, and there were Plankes ſet, and they went in. Yea ſayth an other, I ſaw a huge Beare doe the like. And ſo they might ſpeake of the reſt of the Beaſtes This might driue them to an amazed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but this could not ſaue them. And hereby it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, that it is not in our power to repent when we liſt: for this is not repentance, to be ſorie for our ſinnes, (there is no man ſo wicked, but hath done ſo,) There muſt be

alſo a turning to God; which is neuer, except we be lightned by his ſpirit. The Lord vſeth firſt to offer mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; which if it be contemned, be hardeneth our heartes, that thereby we may be made more fit for his iudgments.</p>

dayes had paſſed before the Flood: for the Seuen and Fortie day (I meane the Seuenteeth day of the Second moneth) the Flood began. Ioyne One Hundred and Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with Sixe and Fortie, they make plainely One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred nintie and Sixe dayes, which diuided by Thirite, leaue Sixe exact moneths, and the Seuenteenth dayes of the ſeuenth Moneth in which <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth, that the Arke reſted.

Moreouer, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate expounder of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſhall find 365. dayes in the yeare of the Flood; thus. The firſt day of the tenth Moneth, 271. dayes from the beginning of the yeare, the toppes of the Mountaines were deſcouered: <hi>Noah</hi> tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried yet 40. dayes: When 311. daies were paſt, then he ſent foorth a Rauen, which houered a long time, he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not the time, but as 7. vpon 7. in the Doue is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: ſo 40. vpon 40. is here to be vnderſtood.

                  <p>The reaſon why they might eate Fleſh after the Flood, and not before, may be, becauſe the dayes of man being ſhortened at the Flood halfe in halfe, the bodyes of men were afterwards of a more weake conſtitution: and then you read firſt of planting of Vines for Wine, which was added to be an helpe in digeſtion, to the ſtrengthning of the body, and quickning of the vitall ſpirits, as in <hi>Pſalm. 104.15.

                  <p>This <hi>Canaan</hi> had eleuen Sonnes, and himſelfe made the twelfe; and his Countrie was called <hi>Canaan,</hi> which once was <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> And as <hi>Paradiſe</hi> to <hi>Adam</hi> reſembled the ſtate of Heauen: ſo did the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the <hi>Iewes:</hi> for it was a Land abounding with all good thinges.

vnto him, Get the out of thy Country, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy kindred, &amp; come into a Land that I ſhall ſhew thee.

Yet God promiſed, that hee would giue it him to poſſeſſe, and to his ſeede after him, when as yet he had no Childe.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>Beleeuing in God, it was counted to him, for righteouſneſſe.

                  <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Act. 17.</hi> reaſoneth with the men of <hi>Athens</hi> thus. You <hi>Grecians,</hi> you are of <hi>Iapheth,</hi> &amp; that your Countrey is <hi>Ionia;</hi> and yee are the Sonnes of the earth. Be it knowne vnto you, that God at the firſt, made all mankind of one blood, to dwell on all the face of the earth, and aſsigned the ſeaſons which were ordained before, and the boundes of their habitations: for he deuided vnto them the Land, according to the number of the Sonnes of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Now ye <hi>Heathen,</hi> your owne Poets ſay, yee are the generation of God: and wee may obſerue that in all the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes,</hi> there is a great preuiledge laid downe for the <hi>Heathen:</hi> and it is ſayd by ſaint <hi>Paul,</hi> God which iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the wicked euen <hi>Abram</hi> being an Idolater, The <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> are no worſe, therefore they haue no cauſe to deſpaire, And where it is ſaid in this ſtorie of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke his father &amp; his fathers houſe: Saint <hi>Steuen Act. 7.4.</hi> ſheweth, that it was at the time his father was dead, for otherwiſe it had been an hard example, and Gods acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt bee ſo wiſely diſpoſed, that the verie <hi>Heathen</hi>

muſt acknowledge them to be iuſt, which they would not haue done if he had left his father, he being aliue.</p>
                  <p>It is further added, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was rich, hee was of behauiour quiet: for to auoide ſtrife and contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Shepheards &amp; the Shepheards of <hi>Lot,</hi> he willed him to chooſe whether he would take to the right hand or to the left. <hi>Lot</hi> choſeth the beſt for eie ſight, though by the cloſe counſell of God ordering his choiſe, it prooued farre contrarie</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> was politique, for he had 318.

                  <p>Hee was a ſtately man, and couragious, and had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of life and death, els could hee not haue kept ſo many in good order.

                  <p>IT is a queſtion who this <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> ſhould bee. It is moſt certaine it is <hi>Sem</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Noah:</hi> Which may be gathered from the circumſtance of the Storie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing modeſtly expounded. <hi>Heb. 7.1.</hi> This <hi>Melchiſedech king of Salem, mette Abraham as he returned from the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Kings, to whom alſo Abraham gaue tithes of all thinges:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15591:45"/>
firſt he is called by interpretation,</hi> King of Righteouſneſſe: <hi>and after that, King of Salem, that is to ſay,</hi> King of Peace: <hi>without Father, without Mother, without kindred; and hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beginning of dayes, nor end of life, but is likened to the Sonne of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee was <hi>Without Father, without Mother,</hi> when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> met him, fiue ages after <hi>Babels</hi> building, <hi>Abraham</hi> being aliue; he was vnknowne of his owne kindred. Hee had no end of life in the old world, for hee liued through the Flood: and no beginnig of dayes in the new world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> in reſpect of his <hi>Godhead,</hi> had no Mother: and in regard of his <hi>Manhead,</hi> he had no Father.</p>
                  <p>Surely our men be very vnaduiſed, that becauſe <hi>Caluin,</hi> and a few <hi>Gretians,</hi> doe ſtagger in this opinion whether <hi>Sem</hi> ſhould bee <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> therefore they will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the truth hereof, as though they ſhould be a rule of truth vnto them. But to anſwere them: firſt the conſent of all the <hi>Iewes</hi> is, that <hi>Sem</hi> is <hi>Melchiſedech:</hi> and if he be not, then let vs ſee what inconueniences will follow.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, hee muſt be a godlier man then <hi>Sem,</hi> that croſſeth <hi>Sems</hi> bleſſing, <hi>Bleſſed be the God of Sem.</hi> Beſides, it ſtands not with Religion, that any man ſhould bee rare in the higheſt degree, no prophecie going before it to warrant his rareneſſe. But this is the cauſe why men be deceiued. The <hi>Grecians</hi> erre in this, and are the cauſe why others haue erred. It was not poſsible for them to know the truth thereof: for the <hi>Iewes</hi> appoynted by <hi>Ptolomeus Philodel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> to tranſlate the Bible, ſeeing there was ſuch difference of the birth of men after the Flood, both in compariſon with thoſe before the Flood, and thoſe after, that their ſtory might not be flouted of the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> adde of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe 1500. yeares to the Fathers after the Flood; for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Terah</hi> begot <hi>Abraham</hi> at 130. And becauſe <hi>Sem</hi> begot <hi>Arphaxad</hi> at 100. yeares old, to euery one where wanteth an hundred, they put in an hundred: as, <hi>Arphaxad liued</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:15591:46"/>
35. <hi>yeares, and begot Selah,</hi> They tranſlate, <hi>Arphaxad liued</hi> 135. <hi>yeares, and begot Selah;</hi> and ſo in the reſt: by which reckoning, <hi>Sem</hi> is dead before the time hee ſhould meete with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Ierom,</hi> accquainted with the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> dealings, knew that their conſent was, that <hi>Sem</hi> was <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and ſo he affirmeth. Beſides, it is not likely that any of <hi>Chams</hi> houſe ſhould be like to the Sonne of God, being a curſed generation. Againe, if it be obiected that <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not call <hi>Melchiſedech Sem,</hi> and therefore it is likely hee was not <hi>Sem:</hi> this obiection is thus anſwered. <hi>Moſes</hi> penneth his ſtorie ſhort, becauſe he knew all the <hi>Iewes</hi> were acquainted therewith. And as for the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> ſetting him downe to bee without Father, without Mother, we muſt conſider in what ſence &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he ſpeaketh: for ſeeing it is added by <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedechs</hi> ſtorie, that he was king of <hi>Salem;</hi> and it is not poſſible for a king to be borne without Father, without Mother; and it was neuer the meaing of the holy Ghoſt, to croſſe the courſe of the creation: therefore we muſt looke for ſome other expoſition, then that which the bare litterall ſence will afford vpon the firſt ſight. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> meaning: He was now to call to the <hi>Iewes</hi> minde, one who in their ſtorie was a figure of the <hi>Meſsias.</hi> Now ſeeing <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Sauiour of the world, as he was God, had no Mother, and as he was man, no Father; therefore to make this plaine, that is, to make <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> a figure anſwerable to this truth, he ſo ſpeaketh of him, as if he were without Father or Mother, becauſe he reſembled the Sonne of God. Now the author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> might verie ſafely vſe this kind of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For <hi>Sem</hi> being borne before the Flood, and in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> time being a Grandfather of eight degrees, muſt needes be thought to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Souldiers, to bee without Father, without Mother, who had neither beginnig of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15591:46"/>
daies, nor end of life. So that a ſouldier of <hi>Abrahams</hi> campe might aske ſome one of <hi>Canaan:</hi> Good-man of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who is this goodly Old man with a hoarie beard? Hee would anſwer thus: Hee is called the <hi>Iuſt King,</hi> and his Towne is named the <hi>Quiet towne:</hi> For when all the other Kings his neighbours are at variance, he onely liueth in peace. And when <hi>Elam</hi> ouercame fiue Kings, no man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him any violence. We haue in euery Village a ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall God: but he ſacrificeth to the God (as he ſayth) that made vs, &amp; them. And marke what I ſhal tell you: When he offereth an Oxe or a Ramme to his God, which (he ſaith) made the heauens and the earth, fire commeth from heauen to conſume it: and hee ſeemeth to be ſo ſtrong, that none of vs ſhall liue to ſee his dayes. In this reſpect therfore the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> affirmeth that he was without father, without mother, who hath neither begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of dayes, nor end of life. For in proper ſence it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true.</p>

Jſmael</hi> laughed, as flouting at <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke,</hi> as though hee were ſuch a goodly fellow in whom the Promiſe ſhould be eſtabliſhed. You haue this Storie renewed againe in the New Teſtament: For the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſayth vnto <hi>Marie; For with God nothing is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Elizabeth</hi> commeth to ſalute <hi>Marie,</hi> and ſhe ſayth, <hi>Bleſſed is ſhe that beleeueth: for thoſe thinges ſhalbe performed, which are told thee from the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſayd of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that hee laughed when the Angell promiſed he ſhould haue a Sonne; thereby ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his reioycing. <hi>Iſaacks</hi> life was anſwerable to this ioy: for he had no affliction in <hi>Canaan;</hi> onely he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to goe to <hi>Abimelech</hi> King of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and dwelt in <hi>Gerar,</hi> where he was ſomewhat iniured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> praying for <hi>Iſmael</hi> that God would bleſſe him, he ſayth, <hi>I will make of him a mightie Nation: but in</hi> Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is written, that</hi> Abraham <hi>had two Sonnes: one by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, and one by a Free woman: But he which was of the Seruant,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:15591:48"/>
was after the Fleſh; and he which was of the Free woman, was by Promiſe: which thinges are ſpoken by an allegorie. For theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are the two Teſtaments; the one which is</hi> Hagar <hi>of Mount</hi> Sinay, <hi>for</hi> Hagar <hi>or Mount</hi> Sinay, <hi>is a Mountaine in</hi> Arabia, <hi>which gendreth vnto bondage, and it anſwereth to</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>which now is, and ſhe is in bondage, with her Children. But</hi> Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>which is aboue, is free, which is the Mother of vs all: for we are after the maner of</hi> Iſaacke, <hi>children of the Promiſe. But as then hee which was borne after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was borne after the ſpirit: euen ſo is it now. But what ſaith the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Put out the Seruant &amp; her Sonne: for the Sonne of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant ſhall not be heire with the Sonne of the Free woman. Then we are not Children of the Seruant, but of the Free woman. Gal. 4.21.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2113. <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> are expelled <hi>Abrahams houſe. Gen. 21.10.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was ſayd vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that his Seed ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in a Land that is not theirs 400. yeares, and ſhould ſerue them, and they ſhould intreat them euill. Now if we reckon the time of the abode of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egipt,</hi> wee ſhall finde it but 215. yeares; for <hi>Iacob</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into <hi>Egipt</hi> 185. yeares after the Promiſe of the 400. yeares: So that they were not in <hi>Egipt</hi> full 400. yeares; but they were afflicted firſt and laſt 400. yeares: For <hi>Iſmael</hi> the <hi>Egiptian</hi> flouteth <hi>Iſaacke,</hi> and beginneth the 400. yeare. And <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the <hi>Egiptian</hi> in the end of 400. yeares, afflicteth the Seed of <hi>Iſaacke.</hi> And as the Seed of <hi>Sem</hi> were afflicted by <hi>Cam</hi> 400. yeares; ſo afterwardes about that time, were they alſo afflicted by <hi>Iaphets</hi> ſeede ruling in <hi>Egipt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be obiected, How is <hi>Iſmael</hi> an <hi>Egiptian,</hi> ſeeing hee is of <hi>Abraham?</hi> Hee is by the Mothers ſide an <hi>Egiptian,</hi> for <hi>Hagar</hi> was of that Countrie: and by this expoſition,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:15591:48"/>
it falleth out to be true. We haue for to warrant this, the like in the Storie of the <hi>Kinges,</hi> where one beeing an <hi>Egip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> is called of the Kinges ſeede, becauſe one of his Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors marryed with a wife of <hi>Iuda.</hi> This Storie is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>1. Chro. 2 34.</hi> it is thus ſayd: <hi>Sheſan had no Sonnes but Daughters, and Sheſan had a ſeruant an Egiptian named Iarchthang, &amp; Sheſan gaue him his Daughter to wife.</hi> In <hi>2. King. 25.22.</hi> after that the King of <hi>Babel</hi> had ouerthrowne <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> he left people in the land of <hi>Iuda</hi> to till the ground, and to exerciſe manuall trades, which were made tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and he ſet <hi>Gedoliah</hi> ruler ouer them. Then came <hi>Iſmael</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nethaniah</hi> to <hi>Gedoliah</hi> to <hi>Mizpah,</hi> and <hi>Gedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah ſware vnto them, that they ſhould not feare to ſerue the King: for by that meanes it ſhould be well with them, &amp; they ſhould dwel with them in the Land: But in the ſeuenth moneth, Iſmael the ſonne of Nethaniah the ſonne of Eliſhama of the Kinges ſeede, came and ſlew Gedoliah, and he died.</hi> Heere <hi>Iſmael</hi> which was by his Fathers ſide <hi>Iarchthange</hi> an <hi>Egiptian,</hi> is called of the Kinges ſeede, ſixteene ages after; becauſe his aunceſtor <hi>Iarchthange</hi> married one of <hi>Iuda.</hi> And ſurely it is likely by this, that the Kings ſeede was wonderfully decayed,<note place="margin">1. Chro. 2.35 Ier. 41.2.</note> when as one by an <hi>Egiptian</hi> (his great Grandfather, hauing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly married in <hi>Iuda</hi>) ſhould be called of the blood Royall. And without queſtion, <hi>Sheſan</hi> was very wicked in deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the glorie of the Tribe of <hi>Juda,</hi> which he openly ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed when he married his Daughter to an <hi>Egiptian.</hi> His name in <hi>Hebrew</hi> anſwereth to <hi>Iſmaels</hi> manners afterwards: for the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> affirme, that <hi>Iarchthange</hi> is ſo harſh and lothſome to be pronounced, as no word of like tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue. So likwiſe <hi>Iſmaels</hi> manners are as deteſtable as the earth can afford. Thus you ſee how <hi>Iſmael Abrahams</hi> ſonne, may rightly be called an <hi>Egiptian.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sara</hi> reaſoneth with <hi>Abraham,</hi> concerning the ſending away of <hi>Hager</hi> and <hi>Iſmael:</hi> ſhe might haue great cauſe to be grieued at the flouting of <hi>Iſmael;</hi> for we may imagine
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:15591:49"/>
her to haue vſed ſuch like ſpeaches as theſe; I haue been content to haue gone with you from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> from my Fathers houſe, and mine owne kindred: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the tediouſneſſe of the trauell, I haue ſuſteined great vexation and diſquietneſſe, by the feare which I might haue, when you went to fight with the foure Kinges. For my behauiour towardes you, it hath alwayes been pleaſing: My ſelfe being barren, I gaue you my Mayde, that yet by her I might haue children: for this, euen <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> deſpiſeth mee. It had been better forme to let <hi>Eliazar</hi> of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> haue enioyed the Bleſsing: Now God hath ſent me a Sonne, ſee how he is flouted. Surely, if you doe mee right, and that which appertaineth to iuſtice, you muſt driue out this Bondwoman and her Sonne: for this Sonne of the Bondwoman ſhall not be heire with my Sonne <hi>Iſaacke.</hi> This dealing of <hi>Sara,</hi> God approoueth, and willeth <hi>Abraham</hi> to heare her voyce, though it ſeeme grieuous to him.</p>
                  <p>Heere we may ſee by the mocking of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> that the wicked euer perſecuteth the godly. <hi>Aſa</hi> maketh a Law, that whoſoeuer will not ſeeke the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhall be ſlaine. The wicked make as ſeueere Lawes. But heere is the difference; the Lawes of the godly are ſo reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that euery one may ſee preſently the equitie of them: on the contrarie, it is enough in the Lawes of the wicked, That it is the Kinges pleaſure; or, that it ſatisfies their Humors.</p>
                  <p>To returne, wee may geſſe that <hi>Iſaacke</hi> was fiue yeares old when <hi>Iſmael</hi> mocked him: for otherwiſe <hi>Iſaacke</hi> could not haue perceiued it. <hi>Iſmaels</hi> flouting might be after this ſort; Is this hee that ſhall haue the Promiſe, in whom the Nations ſhall be bleſſed? a goodly one, I warrant you: What continuance or ſtrength can there be in him, ſeeing at the time of his birth, his father and mother were very old, and decayed in ſtrength; and yet when hee is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:15591:49"/>
there muſt be great Feſting and iolly cheare? If we conſider what an offence it is eſteemed, if one being a Subiect, or otherwiſe inferiour, ſhould contumeliouſly and deſpightfully taunt and vpbraide the Heire appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to a Kingdome, wee will thinke this an iniurie not ſufferable. If we obſerue the time when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> which was about Eaſter; and that this time of flouting, &amp; that time, maketh 400. yeares, we ſhall find that this mocking was likewiſe about Eaſter.</p>

                     <hi>Eſaus</hi> deſcription is thus layde downe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Eſau</hi> was a <hi>Hunter,</hi> liuing like the Ruffians and Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of our time: Hee ſelleth his Birth-right for a meſſe of Pottage; for <hi>Iacob</hi> would not giue it vnto him, except <hi>Eſau</hi> would firſt ſweare to ſell him his Birth-right. Sayth <hi>Eſau,</hi> I am contented; for it will be ſo long ere it will be enioyed, that I, and my Sonnes Sonne, ſhall be dead firſt: So with an Oath he ſold <hi>Iacob</hi> his Birth-right: therefore he was called <hi>Edom, <hi>Redde Pottage.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>No doubt <hi>Jſaacks</hi> men knew this to be a rare Bleſsing: and ſeeing he had deſpiſed it, they muſt needes, when ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they called him <hi>Edom,</hi> keepe his wickedneſſe in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie: for by this ſale, he deſpiſed <hi>Noah, Som, Heber,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all his victories; in the fayth of which Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>Abraham</hi> ouercame ſo gloriouſly. This is the firſt combat by which <hi>Iacob, <hi>a Heeler,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The whole poſteritie of <hi>Eſau</hi> bare the name of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie: hee thought it a long time to the performance of a Promiſe to be accompliſhed almoſt 400. yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ayming (like a prophane worldling) at the outward Inheritance of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and not reſpecting the Bleſsing of the ſpirituall <hi>Salem.</hi> Hee was the eldeſt, and extreame wicked; notwithſtanding he was the Sonne of a righteous Father; to ſhew that the ſinceereſt nature of the godlieſt men, is extreame wicked. Hee was to <hi>Iacob,</hi> as <hi>Kain</hi> to <hi>Abel,</hi> and as <hi>Iſmael</hi> to <hi>Iſaacke.</hi> And as in his owne perſon hee perſecuted and ſought the death of his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:15591:52"/>
brother <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſo his poſteritie were continuall enemies to the ſeed of <hi>Iacob.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ameleck</hi> of <hi>Eſau</hi> lay in waite for the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they went out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> to deſtroy them: but God commaunded them to put out his name from vnder Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Wicked <hi>Haman</hi> would at once haue deſtroyed all the <hi>Jewes:</hi> but hee, and his ten Sonnes were hanged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Haman</hi> was of <hi>Agag</hi> the <hi>Amalekite</hi> of <hi>Eſau.</hi> In him is performed a Prophecie in <hi>Numb. 24.20. Amaleck is the beginning of Nations, but his latter ende ſhall periſh vtterly. Herod</hi> of <hi>Edom,</hi> likwiſe ſeeketh to put <hi>Chriſt</hi> the true <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to death: wherein you may ſee the malice of <hi>Eſau</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue euen till <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eſau</hi> was hated of God before he was borne: therefore whatſoeuer he did, it turned ſtill into a curſe vnto him. Hee prepareth Veniſon for his Father, and the whiles lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the bleſsing of eternall Life. Hee would pleaſe his Father by marrying into <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſtocke, and marryeth <hi>Iſmaels</hi> Daughter: Hee wept for the Bleſsing, but found no place of repentance, though hee ſought the Bleſsing with teares. In like ſort is the repentance of euery wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, when hee is touched with the conſcience for ſinne, hee will then acknowledge his ſinne, and with teares ſhew foorth ſorrow for his tranſgreſsions; but through the hardneſſe of his heart which can not repent, <hi>hee returneth</hi> (like to <hi>Eſau) to his vomite againe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And further, we are to note in this Storie, how <hi>Eſau</hi> by haſte, not willing to ſtay for the Promiſe till the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, felt the heauie iudgement of God: wee haue the like example of this haſte. &amp; the like puniſhment, in <hi>Saul. Samuel</hi> annoynted <hi>Saul</hi> King, and willed him to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and to ſtay for him ſeauen dayes till hee come. <hi>Saul</hi> tarryeth ſeauen dayes according to the time appoynted, but <hi>Samuel</hi> came not; therefore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſcattered: <hi>Saul</hi> ſeeing the peoples mindes ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15591:52"/>
that he might vnite them againe, offered a burnt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. Then came <hi>Samuel,</hi> and rebuked him, ſaying: <hi>Thou haſt done fooliſhly, thy Kingdome ſhall not continue: the Lord hath ſought him a man after his owne heart.</hi> Thus haue you the like example, both for ſtorie, and prophecie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>IAcobs</hi> Storie will appeare the better, by declaring <hi>Eſaus,</hi> euen as contraries are ſet togeather, that thereby euery one may ſhew the clearer.</p>
                  <p>His name ſignifieth <hi>Supplanter,</hi> or <hi>Heeler;</hi> and all his life ſheweth him to be contrary to <hi>Eſau.</hi> The one an image of al Impietie: the other, a mirrour of al Godlineſſe. The one, a Perſecutor: the other, perſecuted: The one, a deſpiſer of Grace; the other, an imbracer of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>You haue from the Creation to <hi>Iacob,</hi> two and twentie Fathers; anſwerable to the two and twentie Letters in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue: So <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in <hi>Ankorato</hi> handleth them.</p>
                  <p>Thus by compariſons, God maketh his dealinges eaſie to be kept in memorie. <hi>Iacob,</hi> though the two and twenty from <hi>Adam,</hi> yet the third Seuenth of thoſe that were borne after <hi>Adams</hi> creation.</p>
                  <p>Now the Chronicle is ended for particular liues: for after <hi>Iacobs</hi> Storie, the Scripture containes whole Stories of whole States and Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Noah</hi> is the tenth from <hi>Adam, Abraham</hi> the tenth from <hi>Noah, Iacob</hi> the twelfe: ſo you haue the two and twentie. The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> admire the patience of God, that ten whole ages God gaue them to repent; and yet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſayth, <hi>That the Lord looked about, and ſaw that there was none good vpon the earth.</hi>

                  <p>The ſeuentie Interpreters tranſlating the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into <hi>Greeke,</hi> thruſt in one <hi>Kenan,</hi> whoſe name is not in the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> If the reaſon be demaunded why they did ſo? this may be anſwered. The 70. Interpreters knew,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:15591:53"/>
that a great deale of wiſedome was contained in the compariſon betweene the two &amp; Twentie Letters of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, and the two and Twentie Fathers.

Now <hi>Beza,</hi> to the end ignorant men ſhould not ſtagger by finding him in <hi>Luke</hi> which is not in <hi>Moſes,</hi> leaueth him out: and this may <hi>Beza</hi> do wel enough; for any one may know, that S. <hi>Luke</hi> neuer meant, that <hi>Arphaxad</hi> begat <hi>Kenan,</hi> ſeeing that hee addeth, <hi>being, as men ſuppoſed, the ſonne of Arphaxad,</hi> to wit, of thoſe men that knew not the meaning of the Tranſlators. Beſides, <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> being a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and being acquainted with the <hi>Greeke</hi> Tranſlation, yet concludeth the Fathers vnder the number of Two and twentie.</p>

                     <hi>Iacob</hi> is called, <hi>The beloued of the Lord,</hi> before hee was borne: in which he is anſwerable to <hi>Dauid,</hi> whoſe name ſignifieth <hi>Beloued:</hi> and to our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of whom it was ſaid, <hi>This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>

                     <hi>ISaacke</hi> is blinde, <hi>Sem, Heber,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> being dead, onely <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> aliue to enioy the Bleſsing after <hi>Iſaacks</hi> death. Now if we examine the ſequell, we ſhall ſee that if <hi>Iſaacke</hi> had not been blinde, hee would for his part, haue brought deſtruction vpon the whole eart; for hee would haue bleſſed <hi>Eſau,</hi> who vpon any occaſion would
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:15591:53"/>
haue ſould it; and beſides, being verie wicked in deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, would haue brought the heauy wrath of God vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his poſteritie for diſobedience. Therefore his blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was a great bleſsing, euen as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Eueriething turneth to the beſt, to the children of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſaacke</hi> willeth <hi>Eſau</hi> to goe and kill him ſome Veniſion, that his ſoule may bleſſe him before he die. So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets vſe to deſire meate before they prophecie, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refreſhed, they may be the fuller of ſpirite and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> diſpute from this place, whether <hi>Iſaacke</hi> was growne into pouertie: Some thinke hee was, by reaſon of the famine which fell in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and becauſe the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> kept not couenant with him, for which cauſe, <hi>Sampſon</hi> afterwards taketh occaſion to plague them, and that iuſtly: <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> is of this opinion. <hi>Rebecca</hi> ſhe heareth this Commandement of <hi>Iſaacke,</hi> &amp; knowing that ſpeedineſſe in deſpatching, is oftentimes a great cauſe of aduantage, willeth <hi>Iacob</hi> to goe and fetch a Kid, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhe might make pleaſant meate for <hi>Iſaacke. Iacob</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, ſhe comforteth him: for ſhe had her warrant from God, that the elder ſhould ſerue the younger; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhee boldly aduentureth. Hee commeth to <hi>Iſaacke,</hi> who ſuppoſeth him to bee <hi>Iacob</hi> by his voyce, but feeling the roughneſſe of his handes and necke, is perſwaded that it is <hi>Eſau,</hi> and bleſſeth him. When he was bleſſed, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>Eſau</hi> with his veniſon, and prayeth his Father to bleſſe him. <hi>Iſaacke</hi> was now aſtonied to thinke of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie. His ſpirite muſt needs be full of feare, to thinke how hee whom he would haue bleſſed, the Lord would not chooſe. <hi>Iſaacke</hi> therefore ſeeing the euent, acknowledgeth the election of God in <hi>Iacob,</hi> and concludeth that he ſhall be bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>Now heere is a queſtion to be handled; when <hi>Iacob</hi> ſayth: <hi>I am thy ſonne Eſau:</hi> and <hi>Iſaacke</hi> anſwereth: <hi>It is Iacobs voyce:</hi> Whether <hi>Iacob</hi> doth lie or noe. This anſwere
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:15591:54"/>
of <hi>Iacobs,</hi> if we expound in the beſt ſence, is no lie: for then it is no more but a kind of ſpeach, called <hi>Ironia.</hi> So God ſpeaketh in <hi>Gen. 3.22. Behold, the man is become as one of vs, to know good and euill.</hi> So <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Goſpell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to his Diſciples, and finding them aſleepe, ſayth, <hi>Sleepe hencefoorth.</hi> Wee may anſwere it further, thus: <hi>Iacob</hi> in reſpect of the purpoſe of God, which choſe him for the bleſſed, might very well be called the onely Sonne. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in regard of ciuil right, now he was his eldeſt Sonne, ſeeing he had bought the Birth-right of <hi>Eſau.</hi> Whether it were a lye or no, we will leaue it to God: and we can not altogeather condemne this anſwere, ſeeing God approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it by giuing <hi>Iacob</hi> the bleſsing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth, When men are dead, we cannot aske them what they meant: Therefore wee muſt expounde their ſpeaches and their actions, to the beſt meaning. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wordes are not alwayes to be taken in proper kind of ſpeaking; for <hi>Abram</hi> defendeth himſelfe, that <hi>Sara</hi> was his Siſter, to wit, the Daughter of his Father, but not the Daughter of his Mother. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſweareth, <hi>By the life of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh:</hi> if you take the words as they lie in proper ſence, he ſinned greatly, and was euen for his oath, the worſt of all <hi>Iacobs</hi> Sonnes. But <hi>Salamo-Iirkie</hi> expoundeth him thus: <hi>By the life of Pharaoh you are Spies,</hi> that is, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> life is a Wormes life, which in account is no life: euen ſo are ye no Spies in truth, though you may ſeeme ſo to be. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Huſhas</hi> anſwereth <hi>Abſalom;</hi> for when <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſaw <hi>Huſhai Dauids</hi> Counſeller, he asketh him, <hi>Is this thy kindneſſe to thy friend? Why wenteſt thou not with thy friend?</hi> meaning <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid. Huſhai</hi> anſwereth, <hi>Nay, but whom the Lord and his people, and all the men of Iſrael choſe, his will I bee, and with him will I dwell.</hi> This ſentence hath a double meaning; either that he meant to ſerue <hi>Abſalom,</hi> or King <hi>Dauid.</hi> Therefore, when things are ſpoken doubtfully, we muſt marke how men may in wit expound them.</p>

His ſinne againſt the <hi>Sichemites</hi> was exceeding great: and ſeeing hee neuer ſhewed any ſigne of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, hee was iuſtly cut off from the hope of a Bleſsing. By this wee may learne to reiect the authoritie of the Booke of <hi>Iudith:</hi> Firſt, becauſe ſhee is ſayd to be of the Tribe of <hi>Simeon.</hi> If wee marke this well, wee ſhall ſee how this Booke can not be Scripture; for wee muſt note, that it is no ſmall glory, to haue the ſpirit of God penne a Booke of ones actions. If there be but a ſentence ſpoken in the commendation of any in the Scripture, it is a great weght

of glory. Now if we looke to <hi>Iacobs</hi> Will, and ſee that hee hath a Curſe and not a Bleſsing: and in the courſe of Scripture afterward, no mention of any repentance that <hi>Simeon</hi> and his Tribe ſhewed, nor any zeale of Religion expreſſed, how can this ſtand with <hi>Iacobs</hi> Prophecie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nay, it cleane croſſeth it, and maketh it fruſtrate.
