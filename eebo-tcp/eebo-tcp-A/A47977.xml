         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
FROM A

TO
Mr. Henry Care,
In Defence of the

            <head type="sub">Licenſed July 18. 1688.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO' I know not your Perſon, I am to my Coſt
acquainted with your Pen; and, to be plain
with you, begin to diſcover you are a ſort of I
cannot tell what, nor knows a Man where to
have you: So in fine, do you ſee, it will be hardly
worth while to pay a Peny and Poſtage any longer for your
Weekly Paper, eſpecially for a Man in my Circumſtances,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29410:2"/>
who am but a Country Curate at Twenty Nobles a year Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary.
'Tis true, I ſerve in a large Pariſh, but to my ſorrow
ſituated in ſuch a wholſom Air, that the People are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Immortal; ſo that a Tale of a Funeral amongſt them
begins with, <hi>Once upon a time there was ſuch a Man, who
died,</hi> &amp;c. Then for their Children, they ſeldom or never
make them Chriſtians, not ſo much for Conſcience-ſake, as
to hinder me of my Dues. And for Weddings, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries
have all the Cuſtom; wherefore my Perquiſites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
totally in telling News at ſeveral Tables for my Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
I am horribly defeated of late by your Proceedings: for,
to be plain with you, I had thoughts your Verity and good
Style had kept company: and tho' you were a little ſharp
upon Topping <hi>Tories,</hi> and laid about you mightily for <hi>Liberty
of Conſcience,</hi> I that have ſo little to loſe or get by that
Matter, did not much regard the Conſequence. Beſides,
being a Bachelor, and can ſpeak <hi>Latin,</hi> I know the worſt
on't at laſt; but to be abus'd with falſe News undo's me,
and, as the Proverb has it, <hi>Puts Water in my Pottage.</hi> For,
to be plain with you, deluded, as it ſeems, by yours and
other Prints, I did verily believe that the Seven Biſhops had
given his Majeſty a certain Petition or Paper about Reading
the <hi>Declaration,</hi> which had made him angry, and that they
were ſent to the <hi>Tower</hi> for Publiſhing it, and refuſing to give
Recognizance to Appear at the Term for ſo doing. This
Matter I told poſitively for Truth, and ſhew'd a Copy of
it in Print, and was heartily welcom to many a good Meal
for my News. And I muſt tell you, there is no Man, tho' I
ſay it, in theſe Parts keeps ſuch a conſtant Correſpondence
for Public Prints as I do, my Name being ſo famous, that
when I was quoted in Matters of that nature, it ſilenced all
Pretenders to Intelligence with an <hi>Ipſe dixit:</hi> But now, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum
horrendum!</hi> what I ſay will go for nothing, ſince thoſe
Reverend, Pious, and Prudent Biſhops, did on their Trials de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the whole Story, nor could it be proved upon them; for
which cauſe the Loyal Jury acquitted them, and the ever
Well-meaning, Honeſt, Godly, and Underſtanding Rabble,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29410:2"/>
Congratulated their Eſcape with Huzza's, Bonfires, Curſes,
Oaths, Healths, Drunkenneſs, Tumults and Roring, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in return from thoſe Peace-making Prelates, Thanks,
Smiles, Prayers and Bleſſings, to the great improvement of
good Manners and Duty in the Nation, no doubt of it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
it is likely more ſtrongly to unite the Mobile into a
practicable Interpretation of thoſe myſterious Doctrins of
<hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience.</hi> Thus wonderful are
the ways of the Wiſe and Great in our Church, being much
above the reach of us little Eccleſiaſtics: For, to my vulgar
Head, this way of Triumphing in the Face of his Majeſty,
might probably induce him to ſuſpect the Integrity of our
Principles, and cauſe him to doubt what uſe may in time be
made of the unintelligible Method we take to expreſs our
unqueſtionable Loyalty.</p>
            <p>But indeed, Mr. <hi>Care,</hi> all the Reflections on the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the Biſhops Applauſe againſt the King's Authority,
cannot make me forget or forgive the Abuſe put on both me
and the Public, by yours as well as other Prints: And I do
poſitively aver, ſince ſuch Apoſtolic Perſons dare not own it,
that ſo Malicious, Seditious, and Unmannerly a Writing, could
never come into the thoughts of any good or honeſt Man,
much leſs of a Chriſtian, and leaſt of all of Chriſtian Biſhops:
No, no, <hi>Shaftſbury</hi> and his Gang of Petitioners never were
Impudent enough to tell their King to his Face, he Acted Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally,
as this Paper pretends to do; and yet, Fool as I am,
I was made to believe it. But what a dull Aſs was I, not to
reflect, that amongſt the whole number of Biſhops, there
could be none found had received ſuch Perſonal Obligations
from his Majeſty, as thoſe Seven, not a Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of them but owing
much more to his Favor for their Advancement, than to all
other Means in the World. Therefore it being impoſſible
that Ingratitude and Diſobedience could ever joyn but in an
Infernal Nature, I might have been confident no vulgar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
could have provoked ſuch Bleſſed Men, to wipe off the
Imputation of <hi>Popery</hi> by Diabolical Crimes. Beſides, had I
known then that Eleven other Biſhops had obey'd the King,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29410:3"/>
and comply'd with their Duty, in commanding their Clergy
to Read his Declaration, how could I have ſuſpected thoſe
Seven ſhould have been guilty of a Schiſm ſo Groſs, ſo Undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and ſo Unmannerly as that would have been? Yet this
improbable Error have you made me guilty of, ſweet Mr. <hi>Care,</hi>
and for the future I ſhall regard you accordingly, I'll aſſure
you. Nay who can blame me, you having made me ſuſpect
Men of their Parts and Piety, ſome being, as is thought, ſo
emulous of Martyrdom, that they wiſh'd the Bonfires for
their Deliverance, had been the Faggots for their Suffering,
tho' at the ſame time in ſeeming compliance with Natures
Frailty, one, the moſt perfect, boaſted out a Farewel Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
on the Text, <hi>Lord let this Cup paſs from me,</hi> &amp;c. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I ſay, had ſuch Exemplary Sufferers Delivered or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
that pretended Paper, they would have Gloried in it
as a good and laudable Action, and never have put the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact upon Proof, and got clear of the Buſineſs that way.
But having done ſo, I defie all them that led me into the Error,
and amongſt the reſt, thou <hi>Harry Care,</hi> with all thy Wit;
and from henceforth muſt declare, that the Libel was the
Production of ſome Traiterous Head, and Enemy to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Repoſe, and the Glory of that King, whoſe Word for
our Security may be entirely depended on, being a Prince too
Intrepid and Brave, to have recourſe to Falſhood for his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
And this too will be my Everlaſting Comfort, that
not an honeſt Man, which impartially obſerves the whole
Proceeding, but will be of my Opinion. And ſo, Mr. <hi>Care,</hi>
if you, or any of your Diſſenting Companions, invented the
Paper, to Divide and Diſgrace our Church, you may take my
good Opinion of you for your pains; for this is the laſt Letter
you are ever like to have from, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
