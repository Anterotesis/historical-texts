            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Esides what hath bin added to this Booke, which is apparent, you shal find two faults especialie amended by this impression. One is the confusion of number. For in a praier sometime the person of one, sometime of many praieng was vsed: which thing, in my iudgement, caused some iar. For the auoiding whereof I haue thought it best to amend that fault, and, I trust with the good liking both of the Autor, and as manie as shal reade them, henceforth to vse altogether the plural number in those praiers which are for euery daie of the weeke: albeit the rest are in the singular number, forasmuch as they are praiers for some speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al persons.</p>
            <p>The other is the difficultie properlie to applie diuers of those textes of scripture placed in the margins. For manie times the places of Scripture were falselie quoted. But now, how soeuer the Compositor haue set them, if you marke the letters of the Alphabet <hi>a, b, c, d,</hi> &amp;c. vsed both in euerie praier, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, they wil rightlie direct thee to the textes.</p>
            <p>Other things besides these are amended, which are needeles to be vttered in this place.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps wil mislike the applieng of praiers vnto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daies: but for that a better some doe both like wel enough thereof, and laude God for this dailie exercise of their faith prescribed; and also because it is not done (as againe in the table to this booke I protest) to tie thee superstitiouslie to our order, I haue nothing varied from the former and first impression in that point, doubting not but thou canst, and wilt vse this booke to thy profit, and be thankeful, Farewel.</p>

            <p>BE it from thy minde (good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to thinke, that, because wee haue applied these praiers vnto certaine daies, we would therefore haue thee to tie thy selfe alwaies vnto the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

But wee wish thee in the feare of God to vse our labors to thy spiritual comfort, and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: and as we haue set downe (as dutie bindeth) a dailie praier, for our dred Soueraigne, and gracious Queene: so we thinke the rest, or the maior part of them, necessarie to be vsed, if they could be, euerie daie. Wherefore, as occasion and time doth offer, praie in the name of Christ, and obserue that order which thou knowest best to keepe thee in the feare, and fauor of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God.</p>
