         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

therfore think it our duty, first to purge our selves of that staine
of <hi>disloyalty</hi> and <hi>disobedience</hi> which the King chargeth us withall.
For they lay it to the charge of some of us at the least, that we
<hi>suspect</hi> our King of being <hi>perverted</hi> in a <hi>Superstitious way of Gods

<hi>name</hi> therin abused by some bad Officers about him. Yea, how
unwilling are we to this very day (notwithstanding the late
Synod so called and confirmed by the King) to conceive the
least sinister thought of him. So as we are apt to thinke that
those <hi>Innovations</hi> brought in since and under his Raigne, have
either crept in by stealth and by degrees without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or been craftily suggested as being no <hi>Innovations</hi> at all,

that thou in thy just judgement restrained and withheld
from us the benigne influence of the Kings heart, and hast so
farre (for a time at least, for our <hi>humiliation</hi>) given him up to be
Seduced by the Prelates and their Romish faction, and to be
guided and led by their Councels, as refusing to hearken to
any true Information of his most loving and loyall Subjects,
<pb facs="tcp:1304:4"/>
(whereof we have had of late lamentable experience) he will
rather hazard all his Kingdomes, then either displease them, or

Now will they say, that the <hi>Discipline,</hi> or <hi>Government of the
Church of England containeth any thing necessary to Salvation,</hi> seeing
herein they joyne it with <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as containing together <hi>all
things necessary to Salvation?</hi> Nay, is not the <hi>Discipline</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
any enemy to <hi>Salvation,</hi> seeing it is altogether <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian,
Tyrannicall,</hi> and a meere <hi>usurpation,</hi> and in the whole
practise of it, and in all the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> against the
<hi>word of God,</hi> and against the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and Practise of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi>
and a most notorious and pestilent <hi>persecuter</hi> of the true
Saints and Servants of God, and a rooter out of all true <hi>Religion</hi>
and <hi>godlinesse</hi> out of the Land. Is it not <hi>Antichristian,</hi> and <hi>usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christs</hi> Throne and Soveraignty over the <hi>Consciences</hi> of his
<hi>People,</hi> which is expresly and directly contrary to the <hi>Apostles
Doctrine,</hi> so as the subjection thereunto is clearely proved by

And for the <hi>Doctrine of the Church of England,</hi> how can
it be sayd <hi>to containe all things necessary to Salvation,</hi> when the most

yet they cannot be sayd <hi>to containe all things necessary to Salvation.</hi>
For onely the <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> which is the onely <hi>ad. quate Rule of

necessary, and so intolerable burthens to mens Consciences?
Yea why doe they force all Ministers to take a Solemne <hi>Oath,</hi>
that they approve these things, as necessary to be observed?</p>
               <p>But neither is this they so urge, a thing in its own nature

sit about it, as about a <hi>Table,</hi> and thus it is rightly and properly
a <hi>Communion-Table:</hi> it is not a <hi>Communion-Cubbord,</hi> or a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
dresser,</hi> to stand <hi>Side-way to the wall.</hi> That's no <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Table.</hi> And consequently such a <hi>standing Sideway</hi> to the

                  </hi> Then we aske thy <hi>Synod,</hi> why they are here so

our <hi>Communion Booke</hi> doth not once name it an <hi>Altar.</hi> How
comes then this <hi>Synod</hi> to be so bold, as to call the <hi>Table</hi> an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
and teach, that it is, and may be so <hi>called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<hi>Table;</hi> though the time is not yet ripe for them, fully to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
themselves, and to display their Roman Colours in open
fields. But for us, we ought not in any sense to call the <hi>Lords
Table</hi> an <hi>Altar,</hi> seeing the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls it onely a <hi>Table,</hi> and
never, an <hi>Altar:</hi> and seeing also it is an easie inducement to

               <p>And the next thing is, <hi>that all that will receive the Communion,
must come up to present themselves before this Altar upon their knees;</hi>
condemning the usuall manner of the Ministers carrying the
<hi>bread and wine about the Church.</hi> But they called this <hi>Altar a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
but even now: and is it so suddainly swallowed up in an
<hi>Altar,</hi> as in stead of sitting about the <hi>Table</hi> (which is <hi>Christs</hi>
own <hi>ordinance,</hi> and the proper use and posture of guests about a
<hi>Table</hi>) now men must <hi>kneele before the Altar,</hi> as before some new
<hi>God-Allmighty?</hi> So as thine <hi>ordinance, ô Lord,</hi> is here quite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and from a <hi>Table-Communion</hi> turned into a <hi>Superstitious
Altar-Service.</hi> Whereas if the <hi>Table</hi> were set in the midst, and
the <hi>Communicants</hi> did come and sit round about it, as many as
could at a time, and so did <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drinke</hi> the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> this
is <hi>Christs</hi> own <hi>ordinance:</hi> but to come and kneele before an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi>
this is not according to <hi>Christs ordinance,</hi> nor is it <hi>aright to
eat the Lords Supper at the Lords Table.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last tging is, after many faire pretences and preambles
(as of the <hi>Church, the house of God, dedicated to his holy worship, to
put us in mind of the greatnesse and goodnesse of his Divine Majesty,</hi>
and the like) the <hi>Synod thinks it very behoofull, that all doe reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and obeysance both at their Coming in, and going out of the
Churches, Chancels, or Chappels, &amp;c.</hi> And the <hi>motives</hi> which the
<hi>Synod</hi> useth to perswade all People hereunto, are sundry. As
1. <hi>It is not with any intention to exhibit any religious worship to the
Communion Table, the East,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or in the Celebration of the holy
Eucharist</hi> (as they call it) rather the <hi>Lords Supper) upon any opinion
of a corporall presence of Christs body there,</hi> &amp;c. Now from these
words (though the <hi>Synod</hi> doe not expressely and directly <hi>Order,</hi>
that men in doing such <hi>reverence and obeysance,</hi> do <hi>set their faces
towards the Altar, East-ward,</hi> where it standeth) yet we learne
plainly their meaning to be so, in that they say, <hi>not with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to exhibit any religious worship to the Communion Table, or

                     </gap> it be not with intention of Religious worship.</hi> But by their leaves,
<hi>Intention,</hi> or <hi>not intention,</hi> so to <hi>bow,</hi> so to <hi>doe reverence to,</hi> or <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
this, or that place, is no lesse, then <hi>flat Idolatry,</hi> whether
it be done to the place it selfe, or thereby to <hi>God.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> will
not be <hi>worshiped</hi> in or by either an Image, or any <hi>representation</hi>
of his Majesty or Divine presence; as <hi>if God</hi> were fixed to this
or that place, all which is forbidden in the Second <hi>Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And being done to the <hi>creature,</hi> as to the <hi>Table,</hi> or <hi>Altar,</hi>
or <hi>towards the East,</hi> being done in the <hi>Church,</hi> which they say is
<hi>the place of Gods worship,</hi> must not all such <hi>externall worship</hi> there

So as here is <hi>flat Idolatry committed</hi> by <hi>authority</hi> of this <hi>holy
Synod.</hi> Or will they call this <hi>adoration</hi> (for <hi>adoration</hi> it is) a <hi>civil
worship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> This is no lesse an <hi>absurdity,</hi> and grosse <hi>profanation</hi> of
things Sacred, to give them a <hi>Civil worship.</hi> Therfore seeing
the <hi>Synod</hi> will needs have a <hi>worship</hi> so <hi>exhibited,</hi> and <hi>this is not</hi>
(say they) <hi>with any intention of a religious worship:</hi> let them tell
us what kind of <hi>worship</hi> they meane. Unlesse their meaning be
this, that it may passe <hi>for a religious worship,</hi> as of the <hi>body,</hi> so the
<hi>intention</hi> of the mind be wanting; that so a man may commit
<hi>Idolatry</hi> not yeelding a <hi>religious worship</hi> to the <hi>creature</hi> outwardly
with his <hi>body,</hi> so as his mind be free from <hi>intention,</hi> that he
meant no harme by it. And the like reason there is for bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or kneeling at the <hi>Communion:</hi> this is a <hi>religious worship,</hi> or
<hi>adoration:</hi> and it is done, as to some imaginary <hi>corporall presence
of Christ</hi> on the <hi>Table,</hi> or to the <hi>Elements</hi> themselves, or to the
<hi>Table.</hi> But to be done as to <hi>Christs corporall presence,</hi> the <hi>Sy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d</hi>
would have that opinion forborne. It remaines then, that the
<hi>adoration,</hi> or <hi>religious worship</hi> to be done, though not <hi>intended,</hi>
either to the <hi>Elements,</hi> or to the <hi>Table,</hi> or to the <hi>Altar,</hi> or to the
<hi>East;</hi> for now all the Communicants are upon their knees all
looking that way.</p>
               <p>But say they, secondly, this <hi>worship</hi> is for the <hi>advancement of
Gods Majesty, and to give him alone that honour and glory, that is due
unto him.</hi> Is it so? And is it not then a <hi>Religious worship,</hi> that is
<hi>so exhibited,</hi> that is <hi>done for the advancement of Gods Majesty, and
to give him alone that honour and glory, that is due un to him?</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this must needs be a <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Divine worship,</hi> and that
<pb facs="tcp:1304:19"/>
in a high degree. And being so, shall the <hi>Synod</hi> be ashamed, or
affraid to allow men an <hi>Intention</hi> of performing this <hi>Religious
worship,</hi> when it is for the <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vancement of Gods Majesty?</hi> Will
<hi>God</hi> accept of a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> that wants a <hi>heart?</hi> Or how is <hi>God</hi>
honoured by our <hi>Service,</hi> when it is done without an <hi>Intention?</hi>
But here is yet a worse matter in it, that marres the <hi>Synods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
for the advancement of <hi>Gods Majesty.</hi> And that is, <hi>All
this worship</hi> (call it what they will) is a meere <hi>will-worship</hi> (of
which before) and so of which <hi>God</hi> saith,<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 15. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>In vaine they honour
and worship me, teaching for Doctrines the precepts of men.</hi> And the
<hi>Synop</hi> cannot but confesse, that all this <hi>Court-Ceremony</hi> is the
upshot of this their <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Constitution:</hi> a <hi>Commandement of
men</hi> therefore: and so abominable in <hi>Gods worship and Service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thirdly, <hi>This</hi> say they (to wit, this <hi>outward reverence in
Gods worship) must needs be pious in it selfe, profitable unto us, and
edifying unto others. Must needs?</hi> Upon what <hi>necessity?</hi> For
first, can that be <hi>pious in it selfe,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath absolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
and condemned, as abominable to be used in his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?</hi>
And such is all invention of man in <hi>Gods worship;</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Secondly, <hi>Profitable to us,</hi> say they. Wherein <hi>profitable to us,</hi>
to disobey and dishonour <hi>God</hi> in our fancifull devises? <hi>Or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi>
in that sense, wherein the <hi>Pharisees taught children to cast
off all honour to their Parents, Saying unto them,</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="margin">Math. 15. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>It is a gift, by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ver
thou mightest be profited by me: and honour not his Father or
his Mother.</hi> So, how can that be<note n="‡" place="margin">Nilutile, quod non hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum est. Cic. Offic.</note> 
                  <hi>profitable to us,</hi> which is disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to our heavenly <hi>Father?</hi> And thirdly, for <hi>Edifying
unto others:</hi> how <hi>Edifying?</hi> Surely no other way, but as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
saith,<note n="§" place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man see thee, that hast knowledge, sitting in the

<hi>be edified</hi> (as the word properly signifieth) that is,
<hi>imboldened to eat of things offered to Idols?</hi> And just such <hi>Edifying
unto others,</hi> is this <hi>will-worship</hi> of the <hi>Synod,</hi> whereby they being

<hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>obeysance</hi> in the Church, that is, <hi>religious worship</hi> to

               </p>
               <p>But Fourthly, <hi>This</hi> (say they) <hi>hath been the most ancient custome
<pb facs="tcp:1304:20"/>
of the Primitive Church in the purest times, and of this Church also
for many yeares of the Raigne of Queen Elizabeth. The reviving ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of this ancient and laudable Custome, we heartily commend to the
serious Consideration of all good people.</hi> How? <hi>Hath this been the
most ancient Custome of the Primitive Church in the purest times,</hi> to
common <hi>Idolatry</hi> with Stocks and Stones? For what were <hi>those
purest times of the Primitive Church?</hi> Were they not the <hi>Apostles
owne times?</hi> Were not <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se the purest times of the Primitive
Church?</hi> And will they, dare they say, or much lesse, can they
prove, that the <hi>Apostles,</hi> or the <hi>Church in their time</hi> used any such
<hi>custome?</hi> Fy for shame, that a <hi>Synod</hi> should dare, without blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to vent such <hi>abominable lyes.</hi> For if they meane it of the
<hi>times of the Church</hi> after the <hi>Apostles,</hi> those certainly were not
the <hi>purest times,</hi> as wherein many <hi>Supersitions</hi> began quickly to
grow up, to strow the way for the coming of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> the
<hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> beginning to worke even in the <hi>Apostles</hi>
dayes.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>Devotion was of ancient custome in this Church also for
many yeares of the raigne of Queen Elizabeth.</hi> That's true indeed;
I my selfe, when I was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad, have seen old women very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant
in such obesances towards the <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>st,</hi> both coming in,
and going out of the Church. They would not misse it. But
ye must undestand this was a place, where they had not Scarce
one Sermon <hi>in Seaven yeares:</hi> So as, it was no marvaile if still
they walked in <hi>darknesse,</hi> when they wanted the <hi>light</hi> to shine
forth unto them in the preaching of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which where
it comes in the vigour of it, drives away all <hi>darknesse</hi> of <hi>errour,</hi>
and <hi>spirituall blindnesse,</hi> as the<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 104. 22</note> 
                  <hi>Sun arising chaseth the wild beasts
into their dennes,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> saith. Insomuch, as we have seen and
known by abundant experience (blessed be our <hi>God</hi>) that in all
places of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> where sound preaching hath been, all
such <hi>Superstition</hi> hath been packed out of the Church. But this
riddance could not be expected for some of the first yeares of
<hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> when the Land was but newly crope out of
<hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Preachers</hi> were but Scarce, and the old race had not,
could not put away the old leaven, or cast off the Slough of
<hi>Popish Superstition.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Synod</hi> saith <hi>truth</hi> in this,
that for <hi>some yeares,</hi> yea in some places, many of the <hi>Raigne of
Queen Elizabeth</hi> (which was towards the beginning of her
<hi>Raigne</hi>) these <hi>Superstitious customes</hi> were in use. And had the
<hi>Royall Chappels,</hi> and <hi>Cathedralls</hi> had as sound preachers in them
usually: as other <hi>Parochiall Churches</hi> in the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> that would
<pb facs="tcp:1304:20"/>
have ript up the <hi>rotten bowels of Popish Supersition,</hi> so fairely
painted over in goodly <hi>Images, Crucifixes,</hi> and the like unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
in those places: there had not by this time remained
one <hi>Romish ragge,</hi> whereof this <hi>Synod</hi> might make a <hi>coat</hi> for the
<hi>Church of England</hi> now to be fashioned by.</p>
               <p>But now the <hi>Coat is made up,</hi> all the Skill will be how to
perswade this <hi>whole Church</hi> to put it on. Yea it is so <hi>little</hi> and
<hi>strait,</hi> as being measured and <hi>patternd</hi> by <hi>two or three Chappels,</hi>
and a few <hi>Cathedralls,</hi> it wilbe very hard to force it upon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
broad backe,</hi> without extreme <hi>pinching</hi> of it, or <hi>tearing the
Coat.</hi> Now for this, in the last place, this <hi>Courteous and kind Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi>
wheras it might command, is pleased to stoop so low, as to
<hi>intreat,</hi> yea <hi>heartily</hi> to <hi>intreat,</hi> againe and againe: <hi>We</hi> (say they)
<hi>heartily commend this to all good and well affected people, members of
this Church,</hi> &amp;c. And a little lower againe: <hi>The reviving of this
ancient and Laudable Custome, we heartily commend to the serious
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nsideration of all good people.</hi> And for this, reason perswades us
to beleeve, that the <hi>Synod</hi> is <hi>cordiall</hi> in redubbling such <hi>hearty
Commendations</hi> of such <hi>Romish reliques</hi> and so <hi>Laudable Customes,</hi>
to <hi>all good people.</hi> First, because <hi>good people</hi> will not easily be
drawn to such things, without some strong <hi>motive,</hi> nor with
that, neither. And secondly, could their <hi>hearty Commendations</hi>
prevaile in this, it would greatly conduce to a speedy making
up of that <hi>Reconciliation</hi> between the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and of
<hi>Rome,</hi> so greatly desired and laboured in the <hi>Primates Late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
the <hi>President</hi> of this <hi>Synod.</hi> Who tells us there more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what we may understand here by <hi>Commending;</hi> for (saith he,

their <hi>hearty Commendations</hi> of this brave piece of Service. But
why should now this Spirit be conjured up againe, or this dead

Close, saying, <hi>In the practise, or omission of this Rite, we desire that
the rule of Charity prescribed by the Apostle, may be observed, which
is, that they which use this Rite, despise not them who use it not, and that
they who use it not, condemne not those that use it.</hi> O Lord God,

                  <hi>how long shall the wicked blaspheme thy Name? For ever?</hi> Can
they not be content to abuse thy People, in leading and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them into all manner of <hi>Superstition,</hi> but they must usurpe
the <hi>Apostles</hi> rule, and pervert it to the maintenance of such blind
and damned <hi>Rites?</hi> The Rule of the <hi>Apostle</hi> is for the use of
things in their own nature <hi>indifferent,</hi> as <hi>eating,</hi> or <hi>not eating,</hi>
wherein <hi>Charity</hi> is to preserve <hi>peace:</hi> but it gives no countenance
at all to things altogether <hi>unlawfull</hi> in themselves, and no way
<hi>indifferent;</hi> as before. And had these men true <hi>Charity,</hi> they
would be so farre from pressing these things to a generall use,
as they would rather altogether suppresse them where they are
used, as being a <hi>Stumbling blocke</hi> to the whole Land, upon the
which, if not removed, the whole Land must stumble and fall.
And therefore had this <hi>Synod</hi> had any one sparke of an <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

would in the first place have rather observed the <hi>Apostles</hi> Rule,
<hi>for a man not to put a stumbling block, or an occasion to fall in his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
way:</hi> then breaking this Rule of <hi>Charity,</hi> have abused the
<hi>Apostles</hi> words, to prescribe to a whole Land a Rule of false
<hi>Charity.</hi> But to thee, <hi>O Lord,</hi> doe we commit the <hi>judgement</hi> of
this whole Cause, which we can doe no more, nor lesse but

against <hi>truth,</hi> and obligeth to sweare a falsehood, <hi>viz. that the

which is not true of <hi>Chancellours, Commissaries, Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

as appeares in the 7<hi>th</hi> particular: It's against <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,</hi>
because both the <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are perjured by it, as hath formerly bin shewn; and it's
a swearing up a <hi>corrupt,</hi> if not an <hi>Antichristian Government</hi> over
the People. Besides this <hi>Oath</hi> is backed with <hi>severe punishment.
Refusall</hi> of it brings <hi>Deprivation, ab Officio &amp; Beneficio.</hi> Hence
many that are poore and weake it's to be feared) will take the
<hi>Oath, reluctante conscientia,</hi> and to save their Livings, forsweare
themselves.</p>
               <p>9. This <hi>Oath</hi> is full of <hi>ambiguities.</hi> The Doctrine of the
Church is not clearely known, the Homilies have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd.
The <hi>Articles</hi> are challenged by the <hi>Armi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to be for them. It's doubtfull to us whether a great part
of <hi>Scripture</hi> be not excluded as <hi>unnecessary,</hi> because much of the
<hi>Scripture</hi> is neither verbaily expressed, nor vertually included
in the publique <hi>Declaration</hi> of the Doctrine and Discipline of
<pb facs="tcp:1304:27"/>
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and that they are said to containe all
things necessary to <hi>salvation:</hi> we are doubtfull of the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
because much depends upon the <hi>interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,</hi>
which is unknown: and yearely differing <hi>Articles</hi> are
composed for <hi>Visitations.</hi> And although a generall standing
Book of <hi>Articles</hi> be promised for the whole Kingdome, yet
three yeares liberty is reserved for <hi>alteration,</hi> and who can say
he knoweth what the Discipline is. We doubt whether the
<hi>Oath</hi> doth not suppose some Popish Doctrine established. We
know not in what sense those words <hi>by right it ought to stand,</hi> are
to be taken. This word <hi>jus,</hi> or <hi>right,</hi> is a word equivocall. There
is <hi>jus Divinum,</hi> and if we sweare in this sense, then we sweare
<hi>Deanes, Archdeac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> and the <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to stand <hi>jure divino.</hi> There is
<hi>jus Ecclesiasticum,</hi> and if we sweare in that sense, then the <hi>Prelates</hi>
will not be our Friends, because we sweare <hi>divine right</hi> from
them. There is <hi>jus positum,</hi> and if we sweare in this sense, then
the Hierarchie must loose both <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall right.</hi> It
being thus, who can sweare without <hi>equivocation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, no man taking this <hi>Oath</hi> can well acquit himselfe of
<hi>perjury,</hi> for if he take it in the plain <hi>common sense</hi> and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the words, yet there must be some <hi>mentall reservation</hi> in
the words <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>equivocation</hi> in the minds of Hyerarchicall
men touching those words <hi>by right:</hi> for though they should
venture to sweare <hi>Prelates</hi> into a <hi>jus divinum,</hi> yet they dare not
sweare <hi>Deanes</hi> and <hi>Archdeacons</hi> into it, and so must sweare in a
double sense, and <hi>perjure</hi> themselves But all this may be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by our own <hi>interpretations</hi> and <hi>protestations.</hi>
