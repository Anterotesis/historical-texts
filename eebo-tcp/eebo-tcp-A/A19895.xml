            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(good Sir) that
hard or read that decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
made at Paules
Crosse the 9. of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
1588. in time of
Parlament, by RICHARD
BANCROFT, D. of Diuinity, and chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine,
&amp;c, (as he will needs be styled) and
afterward enlarged by him, and set forth
in print, may easily perceiue that (small
regard had to godly edifiyng, by the right
cutting of that worthy text of Scripture.
<hi>Beleeue not euerie Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> 1. IOHN. 4.
1. which then hee tooke to entreate) he
made the whol drift of his speach, to serue
his intended turne, for a bitter inuection
against the godlie brethren of Englande,
who vrge Reformation of that Churche,
and chiefly, the remoouing of that heauie
<pb facs="tcp:21263:3"/>
bondage of Antichristian gouernment by
loftie Lordes, wrongfully called Bishops,
(an hurtfull relicke of Romish confusion)
&amp; restoring in the place thereof, the ioynt
administration of Christian Discipline by
the Ministers and Elders of the Churche,
which is most clearely prooued by them
and others, to be established by the word
of GOD, to continue to the comming of
the Lord Iesus Christ: whose godly ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
when for a while he hath laboured
to improoue, after his maner, hee leaueth
the matter in question at last altogeather,
and setteth himself against theyr persons,
and trauaileth with tooth and naile (as
they say) to bring them into extreame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
with the supreme Magistrate, as men
who by this their new gouernment (so it
pleaseth him to speake of it) intend no les
matter then hie Treason and rebellion, by
ouerthrowing her Majesties authority in
Ecclesiasticall causes, and highly deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thereby, to her supreamacie in that
case, to the apparant indangering of her
person and state in the end, except good
order bee taken with the matter in time:
Then the which, what can bee more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
affirmed, and more woorthy of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
<pb facs="tcp:21263:3"/>
punishment, if it be true.</p>
            <p>But how doth he prooue all this geare
I pray you? euen from his owne feare for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
which riseth vpon his falsly conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured
suspicions, without al groundes of
truth, to wit, that as outlandish meanes &amp;
practises haue bene traiterous and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious,
in erecting and establishing of this
new gouernement (as he speaketh) so hee
feareth, that they, who so exactly, and
with such hoat persuit, follow the outlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
preceptes in this case, will fall to the
same meanes in England, pag. of his book
83. 84. and least his credite should come
in question, for abusing his auditors with
vntruthes in this matter, he wil not seeme
to speake any thing without his warrand:
and therefore finding nothing to charge
the good breethren at hoame withall in
this case: (such is the mercy of GOD to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them, that the very aduersarie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
seeking matter of accusation against
them, can finde no hole in their coat, doe
his best, but by his vnwilling silence, is
compelled, in a manner, to iustifie their
dewtifull modestie, in seeking Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hitherto.) Not being able then I say,
to finde any thing against the brethren of
<pb facs="tcp:21263:4"/>
Englande in this case (for otherwise they
shoulde haue heard of it, ye may bee sure)
he raungeth abroad, and as a stranger cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in an other Commonweale, making
choise, especially of Scotland, hee setteth
vpon it with al his maine, assuring himself
of sure proof of his purpose from thence,
Pag. 72. In doing whereof, as he most out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously
vpbraideth our whole Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
&amp; Christian Discipline of our church,
with a cartful of calumneis, vtered against
them both: So he cannot refrain himselfe
from most reprochfull slaundering of the
K. Majestie himselfe, as after shal be seen,
and disdaineful contemning of the whole
inhabitants of the land. A perrilous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
(whose Chaplaine so euer hee be) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the happie amitie between the two
Realmes, especially now, in these daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
daies, wherein our common peace is
so highly indangered, aswel by the dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticque
male-contens and conspirators at
home, as by the forraine detected enemy
abroad: good men in the meane time pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
as it were, and chiefe intertainers
thereof, daily waxing fewer and fewer in
both the lands.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse, so egar is the man in the
<pb facs="tcp:21263:4"/>
matter, that before hee will not bring his
stick to the fire, he will not spare to speake
euil, euen, of those things which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not, and verye boldelye, though most
rashly, builde vppe an vglie heape of most
slanderous accusations against our sayde
Church, and that vpon the false testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the friuelous reports of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and chiefly of two, the very bare naming
of whom, where they are knowne, is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ynough of it selfe, to discredit what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
is alleadged in their names: For as
touching the former of them, corruptlie
and falslie called Bishop of S. Androis,<note place="margin">P. Adamson</note> it
is much better that the legend of his leud
life bee buried in eternall obliuion, then
that Christian eares should bee polluted
with the vnsauorie mention thereof. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it is not hard to gesse, the whole

bee knowen by his clawes) by one spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>

action. For what will that man be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to doe, that durst father his owne
forgerie vppon the Lords lieuetenant the
K. Majestie himselfe, and that in a matter
of no lesse importance, then the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the meaning of some acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which howbeit it was but his own
<pb facs="tcp:21263:5"/>
declaration (as his Majestie hath plainely
witnessed by his own hand writ yet extant
to be seene) and not the Kings. Yet durst
he bee bolde to giue it out in the Kinges
name, as though, hee had beene the verie
vndouted author therof: If this be not to
play the falsarie forger, &amp; that in the hiest
degree, let the Chaplain himself be judge.</p>
            <p>But here hee will replie, that this is but
our Ministers affirmation (who saith hee,
page 75. dare say what they list.) Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
as the declaration is the Kings: so,
as for the King, he is not altered. <hi>Ictus pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scator
sapit, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby he will not only
haue that counterfeit and bastard decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
bound on the Kinges backe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will or not: But before it shall not
be so, he dare be bold, in the same page a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
cited, to charge his Majestie with
deepe dissimulation, while in effect, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
that howbeit the king by his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
speaking, and actions, would seeme
to approoue the present exercise of that
same discipline, which so flatly is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in that foresaid declaration: yet hee
doth not approue it in hart, because (saith
the Chaplaine) hee is not altered, to wit,
from that thing which he would haue him
<pb facs="tcp:21263:5"/>
to haue set downe in that declaration, flat
contrary to his present practise, allowing
it after al the waies foresaid. In the which
saying, hee necessarily dooth implie deepe
dissimulation to be in his Majestie, while
hee will haue him to condemne that in
heart, which in deed so manifestly he doth
allow: let it be judged then, whether it be
our ministers that speak as they list, or he.</p>
            <p>It had become his person and place to
haue spoken &amp; written, at the least, more
reuerently of his Majestie, how vncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
so euer hee had judged of him in his
mind: yea, charitie would haue made him
thinke with himselfe (if there had beene a
sponke thereof within him) that nowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of perfect age, and yeres of discretion,
he is christianlie mooued in singlenesse of
hart, by his auctority to approue that chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stian
discipline, which nowe he cleerely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be so well warranted by the worde
of God, which perhaps in his minority &amp;
none age (being misled by crafty men) he
did not so perfitly vnderstand. But let not
his maiestie, nor any prince, looke for any
better dealing at the handes of any of his
coat, when their honor, &amp; these mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
come into their way to be ballanced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21263:6"/>
But God be praised, it hath pleased his
maiestie, not to winke at this malapert ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
but to note it with a coale, to their
confusion that allowed of that lye, while
by his owne hande writ, set downe in the
margent of BANCROFTS book, page fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
iust ouer aboue these his most impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
assertions. <q>For the K. he is not alte|
red: <hi>Ictus Piscator sapit.</hi> his crown &amp; their
soueraignty will not agree together,</q> most
plainely hee declareth the singlenes of his
hart in this behalf, flat co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
assertions in the words following.</p>
            <p>MY SPEAKING, VVRITING, AND
ACTIONS, VVERE AND ARE EVER
ONE, VVITHOVT DISSEMBLING,
OR BEARING VP AT ANY TIME,
VVHAT EVER I THOVGHT.</p>
            <p>Whereby, as he purgeth him selfe of al
dissembling in times past, so hee protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that his speaking, writing, and actions
in approuing the present exercise of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
are fully agreeing to his thought &amp;
minde, and therefore hee concludeth in
these wordes following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo</hi> CASTS THE LIBEL, <hi>nequid asperius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is as much to say, as, wherefore
the D. assertions are vntrue, to vse no
<pb facs="tcp:21263:6"/>
rougher tearmes, which after his accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
maner, is subscribed as followeth:</p>
            <p>I. R. That is, <hi>Iacobus Rex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which wordes vttered in Scottish after
this sorte, if the Chaplaine shall goe about
to misconstrue, or wrangle from this his
true meaning, his M. hath faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to giue him such a categoricke, and
simple answer by a plain lie in round eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
as shall make him, and al his maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in this cause, to be ashamed that euer
they medled with this matter. Thus god
recompenseth the foolish, while hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
deceite to returne into the harte of
them that forge euil.</p>
            <p>And touchinge that truthles TVRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NVS,
of whome the Chaplain had the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
of this pagean: he is presently as far
out of his maiesties fauour (let the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
of England trust the intelligence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
by him to them of the contrary, so
much as they lift) as euer before he semed
to be in it. But whether he shal receaue the
like recompense in the end, that that his
predecessor did, at the the handes of that
worthy emperor Alexander Seuerus, while
being fastened to a stake, the cryer stoode
thus crying to the people, smoke he solde,
<pb facs="tcp:21263:7"/>
and with smoke he is punished, it resteth
to his maiesties discretion to consider.</p>
            <p>But yet I thinke that soe the Chaplaine
will not let goe his holde: but wil alledge
that in noe wise hee is to bee blamed for
building vppon the testimony of this his
author, in that declaration at least (what
euer the man be otherwise) seeing, so pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
&amp; vniuersally, in a maner, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by many of his betters, for the K.
owne declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in so much, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
again, &amp; reprinted with a most odious
preface at London, without any controle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in so far as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerned vs, red, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly by many, &amp; vigilantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated
to the view of som chief persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the state, who were made so to like
of it, &amp; to thinke it to be of truth, like to
som new gospel, that som, not of the most
inferior of such, whoe are called children
of the most high amonge them, haue not
spared, as we heare, to take boldnes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
of late, in their publict Iudiciary trials
reprochfully, to vpbraid our countrimen,
in the persons of such as were tried before
them, comparing them to Scottish men,
who when the K. proclaimed a feast, wold
needes haue a fast, or contrariwise, when
<pb facs="tcp:21263:7"/>
the K. wold haue a feast, they proclaimed
a fast, alluding to that false narration, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the banketting of the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour,
set downe in that counterfait
declaration. And last of al, for the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
triumphing memory thereof against
vs, it was insert, worde for worde, in the
Chronicle of England, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>piled by HOLIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHED,
and published to the posteritie in
print. To the which I answer, that as the
multitude of offenders authoriseth not
an errour: so he shoulde not haue follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a multitude to doe euill, much lesse
shoulde hee haue added euil to euil, and
done worse then any that went before
him: but before the publishing of so
waighty a matter after such a maner, hee
should without partiality haue examined
the truthe of the thing to the bottome:
and not otherwise so impotentlye haue
suffered him selfe, to haue bene caryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
through the apish Imitation of men,
perfitly knowne to him to be partially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in this case: yea, and to speake fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
howbeit the most part of the things
contained in that slanderous libel, after
due trial, had bin founde true, yet charity
would rather haue buried, euen, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb facs="tcp:21263:8"/>
of sins, then so bitterly haue blown
abroad some ouersights, to the reproch of
a whole reformed church. What could the
veriest Papist of them al haue done more?</p>
            <p>But what should be said to a bellie that
hath no eares, that poore DEMAS (if he
be no woorse) hunting appearandly for
promotion to some Prelacie (as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is) is so incorporate with that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of climers to preferment (as they call
it) and imbracers of this present worlde,
that he is as corrupt, &amp; partial in this case,
as the proudest of them: so that of one,
ye may learne all: Otherwise, if there had
bene but a sponke of sincere judgement in
him: as worthelie hee might haue suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
that marueilous heape of most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
accusations, to haue bene incredible
in a Churche, namely, where so long the
truth hath beene sincerely preached and
professed: So, he needed not to thinke it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
strange or new thing, for crafty miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
hauiug credit in Court, and church,
to finde the meanes many times, to abuse
the names of Princes and excellent men:
yea, and of God himselfe, as cloakes to
couer their diuelish, and naughty deuises.
Whereof, let these examples be witnesses,
<pb facs="tcp:21263:8"/>
to wit, of IOAB, IES ABEL, HAMAN,
GEHASI, the old Prophet of Bethel, and
all the false Prophets, false Apostles, and
false teachers that euer spake, or speak the
vision of their owne heart, and not out of
the mouth of the Lord: and who ran and
runne when the Lord hath not sent them.</p>
            <p>And last, touching the printing againe
and reprinting of that forged declaration
at London, and ioyning it to the chronicle
of England, where through some, whome
the Lorde hath called Gods, thinking all
cock sure, take occasion of vpbraiding the
Ministerie of our Countrie when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them: As these shall die ignominious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
like men, except they repent: So, what
honour those haue procured thereby to
their Country, &amp; what credit to the chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
therof, let them brag of it, when the
vprightnes of our cause sufficiently clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by this and the like writings, shall iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
it selfe to their faces, and the true
storie thereof, that shall remaine registred
to all posterities, shall witnesse the honesty
and duetifull dealing of our Church in al
things, to their shame.</p>
            <p>Thus much then being spoken, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the former of the Chaplains two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses:
<pb facs="tcp:21263:9"/>
let vs nowe come to the other, his
inconstant Countrey-man (as hee descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
him,<note place="margin">R Browne</note> for as for mee, hee shall bee no
woorse, then he himselfe maketh him) the
naming of whome, belike, might doe his
cause more harme, then his testimony can
doe it good, and therefore he contenteth
him self, with a very slender description of
him: so that not without a note of reproch
in the end he sendes him packing in these
wordes following. <q>This mans opinion
heerein (saith he) I knowe wilbe greately
contemned, because I thinke hee hath bin
of an other judgement, &amp;c. Howebeit let
him finde what fauour at their handes he
shall: I must indeede confesse, that if this
matter had onely depended vppon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
or opinion: I would not at this time
haue made mention of him.</q> Wherby you
see what a wethercock he maketh of him,
and howe rediculously he leaueth him, to
beg credite where hee may finde it, for he
can giue him none. Here I omitt to make
mention of the Iar, that is fallen out since
betweene our Chapleine, and his subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
witnes, for that, that vpon no fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of recompense, hee coulde procure
newe furniture at his hands, of some more
<pb facs="tcp:21263:9"/>
particular matter against the newe onset,
that with long preparation he hath inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
against vs: Seeing then, that no mans
pen nor tong can more discredite this his
second witnes, then he doth him self (part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the wordes aboue rehearsed, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the D. words following in his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
where he flatly again maketh him
to be of a changeable humor.) If he drink
no better by his meanes, then hee hath
brewed, let him blame himself, vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that euil aduise is worst to the adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser:
I will not speake at this time of the
shameles falsehoode that is alleadged out
of the testimonye it selfe, which whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it shalbe particularly examined, will
make the D. repent that euer hee cited
such a testimony, &amp; specially, where most
impudently it is affirmed, that hee hath
knowne the Kinge in greate danger, and
feare of his life by their lordly Discipline,
the contrary whereof, as it is cleerely kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
to al the worthie persons, Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
of England, who haue had their long
residence here amonge vs, and priuate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of al our affaires, after an other
manner, then euer his wandring witnesse
coulde attaine vnto: so is it many wayes
<pb facs="tcp:21263:10"/>
affirmed by the K. himselfe, and daylie
experience, God be praised, doth confirm
the same.</p>
            <p>Both the Chaplaines authors then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such prettie fellowes, as hath bin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
I trust it be not hard to bee seene,
how little credit is to bee giuen to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
grounded vppon their railing
reports (to leaue the demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stration of the
falshood of the matter vttered by them, to
the owne time and place.) For he should
haue considered, that of how little credit
soeuer he was himselfe, yet it behoued his
witnesses to be free of infamy, according
to the saying, a Proctor may be infamous,
but not a witnes. But it seemeth, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was not greatly careful of his own
name, who would repose vppon the crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
credits of such defamed persons, in so
waighty a matter, or els he thought (as
GYGES did, by means of his ring) to walke
inuisible, as in a cloud, that none could or
would espy his nakednes. But good man,
he is far deceiued, as by the answere to his
seuerall asseuerations (if neede be) more
throughly &amp; sensibly he shall vnderstand.</p>
            <p>It is easie then to be seene, how far short
the Chaplaine hath come in probation of
<pb facs="tcp:21263:10"/>
the alleadged treasonable outlandish pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
of men of the new gouernment (as
scoffingly he calleth the vrgers of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation)
whereof he would seeme to take
such feare, that except good order be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to preuent the like at hoame, thinges
will grow to some extremities, pag. of his
booke 83. And therefore I trust the Q. M.
and her honorable Councell, will see this
surmised proposition of danger of outlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
practises, by the meanes of Christian
Discipline, to be somwhat better proued,
before they will feare any danger to insue
to their state through the same: yea, and I
thinke, if they knew, but euen so much, as
heere truly I haue set downe to you (Sir)
in this short discourse, touching this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as the cause of christian disciplin shuld
euen be the better liked of them all, seing
it, &amp; the fauorers of it, to be so shamefully
belied: So the D. patrons in this case, shuld
pride themselues but a little, of that slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
declamation, &amp; thinke them and
their cause but smally beholden vnto it,
what euer hath bene their opinion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
before.</p>
            <p>For let any wise man iudge, if one eg can
be more like another, then the D. maner
<pb facs="tcp:21263:11"/>
of reasoning is to that forme: that REHVM
SHIMSHAI, &amp; the rest of the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bejond the
riuer, vsed in a letter to K. ART AHSHASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TE,
for hindering the building of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
EZ. 4. saue only, that the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of
them beyond the riuer, was found to be in
the authentik bokes of the chronicles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as was alleadged by them: &amp; our
chaplains argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t leaneth only vpon the
counterfeit, &amp; forged chartales of known
and confessed infamous persons, &amp; a false
Chronical grounded thereupon. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if their authentike books of Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
did not truly conuince Ierusalem to
be a rebellious citie to kings and prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
of what force should this Chaplaines
infamous libel be (I pray you) against the
good brethren of England, to proue that
they will be rebellious to their Princes, if
that christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> disciplin be admitted to haue
place within that land? For as Ierusalem
was not a rebellious citie to kings &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
indeed, howbeit the books of their
Chronicles did beare so: So the exercisers
of christian discipline in Scotland, are not
necessarily to be accounted rebellious to
the K. for exercising of the same, howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it,
the bookes of the register of the acts of
<pb facs="tcp:21263:11"/>
Scotland did containe the same. Howe
much lesse then, ought false surmised for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries
of known infamous men haue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
in that case?</p>
            <p>And if the enuy of the sect of the Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
vrged by prophane TERTVLLVS, is
not sufficient to beare downe PAVLE, as a
seditious mouer of the people, because he
professed, preached, and followed Iesus of
Nazaret, whom the Iewes most iniustly &amp;
wickedly slewe, as a seditious person, and
blasphemer, by the meanes of two sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borned
false witnesses, Why should the
good brethren of England, that seeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
be charged with a mind here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
of sedition, by the meanes of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
because the Church of Scotland, in
respect of the same Discipline exercised in
it, is vniustlie, condemned of sedition, by
the hie Priests of our daies, two false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
being alleaged for that purpose, by
their TERTVLLVS at Pauls Crosse? I see no
reason why they should. Let not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
be odious, because, I compare not
the persons in themselues, but in the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
which haue their own likenes &amp; agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in some proportion. I haue insisted
the more in this matter, bicaus, your cause
<pb facs="tcp:21263:12"/>
and ours, are most neer linked togeather.
For the aduersaries would terrifie her M.
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> admitting of christian discipline with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
her realm, for fear of like inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to fal out therby to her quiet gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
which are falsly alledged to haue fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
out by the same, to our K. &amp; state. How
be it, it be not good logicke, to charge the
good cause of discipline, with any infamy,
by reason of the faults of the Ministers &amp;
fauourers thereof, yea, euen put case they
were sufficiently proued, seeing that is but
a sophisme from the person to the cause,
(as they say) How much lesse then, ought
it to be condemned, when the aduersaries
ar not able, do their best, to blot euen the
persons, by accusing of whom, they labor
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne the cause. But I perswade my
selfe, that all this their paralogizing, and
false maner of reasoning shal helpe them,
and hurt vs as little in the ende, as the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry
of REHVM and his companions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the riuer, helped their cause, &amp; hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the bulding of the Temple: &amp; as the
smooth Rhetoricke of TERTVLLVS, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
not against PAVLE, no more shall
their course alwaies preuaile against the
good cause in Englande. Wherefore, let
<pb facs="tcp:21263:12"/>
GAI and ZACHARIAS do their parts faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and without fainting, exhort al men
acording to their callings, to further this
holy building, not doubting, but God in
his time, shall mooue DARIVS fully to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorise
the building of Ierusalem: howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it,
through the injury of these daies, men
may bee forced to leaue of building for a
season: And let PAVL stand stoutly to the
defence of his iust cause, saying confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
Neither can they prooue the thinges,
whereof now they accuse me. Act. 24. 13.
And TERTVLLVS, &amp; his maintainers shall
finde themselues disappointed, and PAVL
by little, and litle, shal grow to some grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
liberty, and his cause shall preuaile in
the end.</p>
            <p>But nowe let vs come, accordinge to
your desire, to the causes why that decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of D. BANCROFTS, so far as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Scotland, is not answered, wherein
howbeit I am not to prejudge the church
of Scotland, yet for your further satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I haue thought good to set downe the
causes of the delay, so far as euer I coulde
learn or perceiue. And first you may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
that it was not for lacke of habilitie
in the meanest of a thousand in Scotlande
<pb facs="tcp:21263:13"/>
to haue confuted that calu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nious chartale,
fraughted with as many lyes almost, as it
hath lines,<note place="margin">I. W.</note> that it was not answered: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
it pleaseth som of your grand DD.
(very learned men,<note place="margin">T. C.</note> ye may be sure, if they
be not far deceued) reprochefully to point
out some of our wel approoued brethren,
and especially one, by the note, of like an
vnlearned, yea then, a very vnlerned Scot:
Whome yet notwithstanding they neuer
hard nor sawe, more then D. BANCROFTE
did heare and see the Church of Scotland,
and the things wherewith most rashly hee
doth charge it: But who is so bold, as they
say, as blind bayard. Yet if any ARISTAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHVS
among them, hath taken occasion
of the writing of anye brother here, so to
speake, let it bee judged by the learned,
what iust cause he had so to do: &amp; I doubt
not, but he shalbe found to haue had litle
learning, and lesse conscience in so doing,
which is spoken, not so much for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of any man at this time: as to note
the disdainefull contempt of these hauty
persons. For he must be of very rare lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as not a few can beare me witnes, in
whom this sort (for I speake not of all) of
the generation of Bishopists will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb facs="tcp:21263:13"/>
any learning to be, if once directlie
and seriously, he oppone himselfe to their
pride: For as there is nothing, wherin they
commonly boast them selues more, then
in the beard, &amp; shew of learning: as thogh
who forsooth but they onely: So is there
no shaft that oftner flieth out of their bag
against others, then the boult of lack lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Howbeit, if it were not for auoiding
of vncomly, and vnchristian rendering of
reproch, for reproch, it were no hard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shortly to decipher the profound sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of those two especially, who were
chief authors of that reproch, &amp; to let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vnderstand, of what form &amp; classe among
the learned, learned men indeede, did
euer esteeme them to bee, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
all the windye volumes written by
them: For <hi>Scribimus indocti doctique, &amp;c.</hi>
Howbeit, yet I deny not so much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
vnto them otherwise, as shall bee a
witnes against them, if they vse it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
&amp; as might profit the Church in some
measure, if they had grace to imploy it to
the right end.</p>
            <p>But to returne to our purpose, as the
answer was not delaied, for lacke of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
qualified men amongest vs for that,
<pb facs="tcp:21263:14"/>
&amp; for a greater purpose, God be praised,
if need be: so it was thought needles, &amp; su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous,
here amongst our selues, where
the truth of those things alledged in that
Pamphlet were so clearly known, as there
needed no other confutation of them,
then the shamelesse impudencie of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
And as for the answere, in respect
of others, it was delaied first, as I take it,
for auoiding of vnhappy contention, that
is woont to arise vppon suche occasions,
wherby it might haue come to passe, that
daungerous alteration might haue bene
wrought betweene the two Realmes, as a
godly and wise man of yours, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the discretion of our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that case,
did not conceal, in a letter written to som
of good account in our Countrey, not
long ago. For the firebrand of selfeloue,
and great ardency of men, in defending
their owne sayings &amp; doings whatsoeuer,
suffereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not many times, so much to
regard the truth and peace of the church,
as their own stincking estimation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
there is too great proofe in manifolde
lamentable examples, aswell of antiquity,
as of our own daies, both far and neer, to
the timely admonition of vs all, if adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly
<pb facs="tcp:21263:14"/>
we consider of the counsaile of gods
spirite, saying: <q>The beginning of strife, is
as one that openeth the waters,</q> therefore
or the contention be meddled with, leaue
off: Which howbeit more fitly, it may be
applied to the aduersaries (in this case)
the persuers then to our Church, yet no
man I trust, can blame the Ministerie of
Scotlande, to regard it greatly, so long as
there is any hope that the truth, and their
innocencie may be in faftie without their
answere: otherwise, they are not ignorant,
that, there is no les danger, alwais to keep
silence, then neuer, as HILARIE speaketh.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the answere was deferred, as
I take it, in hope of due redresse to be put
to that offence by the Q. M. and her
Honourable Counsaile, who our men
thought (as they thinke yet) esteemed so
of their friendship, that they wold not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them to lie vnder any opprobrie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remooued,
so farre as lay in them, neither
would suffer them to receiue any iniurie
vncorrected, at the hands of any whome
they might command: For there are not
many years past, since it plesed her M. not
without signification of a thankful mind,
by her letters, to acknowledge the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb facs="tcp:21263:15"/>
of Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by name, to be hir most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
&amp; trusty frends in Christ (as yet God
be praised they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue to this day, which
is not vnknown to her M. &amp; faithful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers)
in regard whereof, they yet expect
the due amendement of that wrong, and
that so much the more, as they haue bene
put in hope thereof, from thence by writ,
purposly written to that effect, from some
great personages, who, howbeit nowe
they rest from their labours (to the no
small forewarning of the present state of
Englande, if the matter be well marked)
yet our men think, that they shal not lack
such fauour in that Counsaile, as shal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
redresse of that iniury in due season,
in respect of the good opinion they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
(and that euen by writ of late)
her Majestie and Counsaile, yet retaine of
the Ministery of Scotland, &amp; their christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
friendship toward them, &amp; that estate.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and last, a secret bridle of God
(who ruleth the actions of men acording
to the dispensation of his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from answering, for causes known
onely to himselfe, as they so sensiblie in a
manner haue perceiued (especially they,
who were priuie to the matter) that the
<pb facs="tcp:21263:15"/>
knowledge thereof, may sufficiently satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the minde of any modest man, who
wil acknowledge the prouident dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God to be such, as howsoeuer the
heart of man purposeth his waye, yet the
Lord doth direct his steps.</p>
            <p>This much I thought meet (good Sir)
to impart vnto you, touching the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
rashnes of D. BANCROFT, in slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our whole Church so vnaduisedly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
such a publicke manner, and that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the naked reportes, of two such infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
witnesses (partlye, by manifest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of trecherous dealing in one
of them, and partly by his owne confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
touching the other) as are not to haue
credite against any particular Christian,
much les, against a whole Church, a King,
and a Realme: As also touching the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the deferring of the answere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
so far as I vnderstand, which things,
if they were known to the D. and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices,
(but euen as heere rudely they are
set downe) they might peraduenture let
them haue experience (which is a fooles,
though not a foolishe maister) that they
haue run to far headlong into these slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
and new deuises: and so hearafter
<pb facs="tcp:21263:16"/>
might learne more aduisedly and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie,
to deale with their neighbours and
brethren, who haue deserued no suche
things at their hands: Yea, it is very like,
if these same things were read, or summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
and shortly reported in her Majesties
hearing, either by your selfe, or som other
good Christian, who hath credite and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
about her royall person (For alack
good princesse, the trew report of things,
especially in these &amp; the like maters, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
seldome to her eares, a common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie
of princes, whoe commonly of all
others in the world, are most destitute of
faithful persons aboute them, trewlie and
without flattery to informe them of the
truth of matters as they are in deede.) If
these things, I say, were truly known to her
M. I surely perswade my selfe, that those
lordly brethren of DIOTREPHES, who rule
or rather tyrannise aboue their brethren
with violence &amp; cruelty, should be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charmed from authorising such rashe
libertie of publicke rayling, and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of a whol neighbour church, which
alway hath so well deserued of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state of Englande, and their proude
hornes should be hastely hamered downe,
<pb facs="tcp:21263:16"/>
that they should not be able hereafter, to
thrust with side and shoulder, and push all
the weake with their hornes, til they haue
scattered them abroad, and to make such
hauocke of the Churche, by a disguised
persecution, as presently they doe: Yea
this much at least, I doubt not shoulde be
graunted, that (all bitter inuection and
persecuting of the good brethren of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
that are of the same judgment with
vs,<note place="margin">A louing chalenge of disputation,</note> surceasing) the controuersie should
be decided by the word of God in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
assemblie, and brotherlie conference,
appointed by the supreme Magistrates to
that effect: Otherwise, if this come not to
passe (which God forbid) as we must not
cease to commend the troubled estate of
those our christian brethren, to GOD in
our priuate and publicke praiers, so must
we not leaue the iust defence of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
cause of Christian Discipline, which
(touching the substance thereof, whiche
chiefly is in controuersie) hath no les war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
to be continued perpetually within
the Church, vnder this precept of Christ,
feede my sheepe, then hath the preaching
of the worde, and ministration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and so consequently floweth
<pb facs="tcp:21263:17"/>
no more from the authoritie of the Ciuill
Magistrate then they doe, whateuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
professours in worde, but not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters
of the yoake of Christ on their
neks indeed, cry out to the contrary. This
much (good Sir) I thought good by writ
to answere to your letter, after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
here before set downe, both to satisfie
you and others, touching this matter in
some measure, which if it shall seeme good
to you, ye, either by your selfe, or by some
other, may briefly impart vnto her
