            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Riding Tryumphant on his Milk white Steed,</l>
               <l>This Prince ſhall Cure the Nations that now bleed:</l>
               <l>Envy and Malice ſhall fall down before him,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Blackmore</hi> and the <hi>Indian</hi> ſhall adore him!</l>
               <l>Into his Fold all Nations he will gather,</l>
               <l>Our Noble King ſhall be a Nurſing Father:</l>
               <l>Sweet Peace o're all the Earth ſhall then be ſown,</l>
               <l>Stiff-neck'd Rebellion ſhall no more be known;</l>
               <l>Both King and Subject in one Yoak ſhall draw,</l>
               <l>The Princes Will ſhall be the Subjects Law:</l>
               <l>The Prince with ſuch Commanding Love ſhall ſway,</l>
               <l>The People will take pleaſure to obey:</l>
               <l>They ſhall rejoyce when they do underſtand</l>
               <l>All Arbitrary power is in his hand:</l>
               <l>A full Confinement is full Liberty,</l>
               <l>And when they moſt are bound, they are moſt free:</l>
               <l>No Council to Direct his Juſt Commands,</l>
               <l>For Wiſdom always at his Elbow ſtands:</l>
               <l>No heavy Tax can move the Peoples Gall,</l>
               <l>For they are willing to ſurrender all:</l>
               <l>Both Prince and People ſit upon one Throne,</l>
               <l>For Prince and People perfectly are one:</l>
               <l>Full Union and Communion here we find,</l>
               <l>One Life, one Love, one Soul, one undivided Mind:</l>
               <l>But e're this come to paſs, we clearly ſee</l>
               <l>Diſturbances in every place ſhall be;</l>
               <l>The Elements ſhall quarrel with each Star,</l>
               <l>Dame Nature with herſelf ſhall be at War:</l>
               <l>The whole Creation that hath bin accurſt,</l>
               <l>Shall fall into a <hi>Chaos,</hi> as at firſt:</l>
               <l>In all the World there will be ſtrong Deluſion,</l>
               <l>Darkneſs and Death, Confuſion on Confuſion:</l>
               <l>When this Black Cloud is o're, what will enſue?</l>
               <l>The Maſter Builder will Build all things new,</l>
               <l>When this old Houſe is burnt that's made of Clay,</l>
               <l>Hee'l Build a Pallace that ſhall ne're decay:</l>
               <l>The Soul, in fine, being Purged from Droſs and Tin,</l>
               <l>Shall now ſpring up a Glorious Cherubin.</l>
               <l>A New Sun in the Firmament ſhall riſe,</l>
               <l>Whoſe Glorious Beams ſhall dazle Mortal Eyes!</l>
               <l>The Stars ſhall be refin'd which now we ſee,</l>
               <l>And this dull Lump a Paradice will be,</l>
               <l>Throu Storms and Tempeſts we no more ſhall paſs,</l>
               <l>For we ſhall Sayl upon the Sea of Glaſs:</l>
               <l>New Stars, new Planets guide the Heavenly flore,</l>
               <l>Such as by Men were never ſeen before:</l>
               <l>The little Birds on every Bough ſhall Sing,</l>
               <l>No Winter but an Everlaſting Spring.</l>
               <l>Freſh flouriſhing Youth ſhall every thing reſtore,</l>
               <l>Old Age is paſt; and Man ſhall Dye no more;</l>
               <l>Sickneſs and Sorrow are for ever fled,</l>
               <l>All Tears are wip'd away, and Death is dead.</l>
