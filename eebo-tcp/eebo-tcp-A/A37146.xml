            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But this, <hi>My LORD,</hi> is not the only Title you have to our Thanks and Praiſe; the great hand you had in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the happy <hi>Revolution,</hi> and the Share you have had in almoſt all the Actions of our great Monarch ever ſince, are what ought to make you ever dear to <hi>England,</hi> and almoſt all the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi>

and Sieges, you have ſhar'd in all the Fatigues of ſo many Campagnes, and have been a conſiderable Actor in His moſt Happy and Succeſsful Enterprizes.</p>
            <p>In Peace, Your <hi>EXCELLENCY</hi> has had the Miniſtry of the moſt Important Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE onely occaſion I have for a Preface is to give the <hi>Reader</hi> ſome Satisfaction for the coming out of this Hiſtory ſo late; and the Reaſon in few words is, that I could not get the ſeveral Lines of Battle of the <hi>French</hi> Armies in <hi>Flanders</hi> the laſt Year ſoon enough, having receiv'd them from <hi>France</hi> but in the <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Holidays; beſides ſeveral Memoirs from <hi>Holland,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly about the Electors Motions the laſt Campagne, which I got about the ſame time, and which were abſolutely neceſſary for the compiling of this Work: And when I have told the <hi>Reader,</hi> that I have Compos'd it ſince the beginning of <hi>January,</hi> I believe he will be ſatisfied that I have made ſome diſpatch in the Publiſhing of it.</p>
            <p>I muſt deſire the <hi>Reader</hi> to obſerve, that, whereas I have intimated in the Body of this Account, that Penſionary <hi>Hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> his Journey from the <hi>Hague</hi> to the Camp the laſt Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne, might have been to open a way for the Conferences between the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> and the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers,</hi> becauſe they happen'd two or three dayes after; upon good information I find that the firſt overture was made by one Monſieur <hi>de Gy,</hi> Brother or near Relation to Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi>'s Maſter of the
<pb facs="tcp:95917:5"/>
Horſe, who paſſing through the Marechal <hi>de Boufler</hi>'s Camp, the Marechal deſir'd him to make his Compliments to My Lord <hi>Portland,</hi> and to let him know that he was very deſirous to Embrace him, which Monſieur <hi>de</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">He is ſince made Town Major of <hi>Mons</hi> for this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note>

            <p>I have no more to deſire of the Reader but to take Notice that this <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> as well as all the former, goes by the old or <hi>Julian</hi> Account obſerv'd in <hi>England;</hi> and to Correct the few Errours of the Preſs he may meet with, the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable being inſerted here below.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF THE Campagne IN FLANDERS, For the Year 1697.</head>
            <p>HAving given the Publick an Account of ſeveral of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Campagnes, in which the Reader could find but little pleaſure beſides the ſatisfaction of knowing the Truth of ſeveral Matters of Fact in the Tragical Scenes of the moſt Tedious, Cruel and Deſtructive War that has been known for many Ages in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> if we conſider the Univerſalneſs of its Extent with the Duration of it; and wherein his Thoughts could be entertain'd with nothing but Toilſom and Fatiguing Marches and Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marches between Oppoſite Armies, ſome to Execute, others to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95917:6"/>
Fruſtrate Deſignes, and others barely to ſubſiſt at the Coſt and Charges of the Poor Husbandmen, and of a Miſerable Countrey. (For what elſe makes up the Subject of ſuch Hiſtories, can contain little beſides the unwelcom account of the Effuſion of but too much Chriſtian Blood in Cruel Battles, Bloody Sieges, and Barbarous Bombarding, Burning and Deſtroying of Towns and Villages, ſome to ſatisfie and others to withſtand the Ambition of Princes) I have thought I could do no leſs than bring thoſe Accounts to that happy Period we find in the preſent Bleſſings of a General Peace; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when for this very reaſon the Hiſtory of the laſt Campagne muſt yet be the moſt acceptable that has been given to the Publick concerning the late War.</p>
            <p>I muſt Confeſs nevertheleſs that little can be ſaid in this Relation to the Advantage of the Allies; for the moſt that could have been expected during the laſt Campagne from them, conſidering how much they were over power'd of the <hi>French</hi> by the ſeparate Peace of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> had been to have ſtood effectually upon their Defence; which I believe could yet have been done, if the <hi>Germans</hi> had taken the Field as early upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> as we did in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or that the <hi>Spaniſh Government</hi> were capable of any manner of Vigour to have provided by times for the Defence of <hi>Barcelona</hi> (the only place they had to look after in <hi>Catalonia)</hi> by which they could have baulk'd at once the whole deſignes of the <hi>French</hi> for the Campagne on that ſide: However, this very thing includes more Real Glory than all the Triumphs and Victories our Great Monarch could have reap'd in the Bloody Fields of War; (beſides the great Happineſs it is attended with for all his People) that at the End of it we can ſee the moſt Formidable Power of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> a Power, that for many years had reſiſted the Confederate Attempts of moſt of the Princes and States of <hi>Europe,</hi> a Power, that ſeem'd to have tir'd the Allies more than it ſelf by a long and expenſive War; a Power, that with all theſe Advantages, deſign'd no leſs than our Kings Ruin, with that of our Religion, Lawes and Liberties, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to ſeek Peace with us, and yield to his Majeſty the juſt and quiet poſſeſſion of the Crown's he wears, to the great Comfort and Happineſs of His People under his Eaſie and Auſpicious Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, with the ſecurity of all that can be dear to a Nation, muſt promiſe us all the Bleſſings, that can be expected from Peace
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95917:6"/>
abroad, and a great and flouriſhing Trade at home: And that even all the advantages which this great and formidable power has had over the Allies in the Courſe of the laſt Campagne have only ſerv'd as a means to procure it a quicker and more ſpeedy accommodation with them, inſtead of prolonging a then unſucceſsful War on their ſide. This is what I am now to Relate, and which muſt give much more Satisfaction to the Honeſt Reader, than if I were to ſpeak of Battles won and other Warlike Triumph's and Victory's; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Subject which, without any farther preface, I ſhall enter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon.</p>
            <p>The Campagne of 1696. had produc'd nothing extraordinary, beſides the extraordinary, though not new, proceedings of the Court of <hi>Savoy</hi> in making an underhand Treaty with <hi>France</hi> ſeparate from the Allies, expreſly contrary to the Tenour of the Offenſive and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive Alliance the Duke had enter'd in with them, beſides other Obligations he had to them. And though the Conditions offer'd him by the <hi>French</hi> were very Advantagious, yet it has ſo evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd ſince, in the whole Courſe of Affairs, that <hi>France</hi> wanted Peace, (all its Succeſſes during the laſt Campagne having been made uſe of to no other purpoſe than to oblige the Allies to this very thing) that we need not doubt but the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would at leaſt have had as good Terms in a general Treaty, and the Allies certainly much better, when <hi>France,</hi> by the diverſion of the War of <hi>Italy,</hi> would have been fruſtrated of thoſe Succeſſes it has had in <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> which have inabled it in a manner to give the Law in the General Treaty of <hi>Ryſwick.</hi> But 'tis not the firſt time the Court of <hi>Savoy</hi> has made uſe of ſuch Politicks; we ſhall find the ſame Management in the War about the Succeſſion of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the putting of <hi>Pignerol</hi> in the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> contrary to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Quieraſque,</hi> which place has now been reſcued out of their hands by the very ſame Methods; when (as the event has ſhew'd it) 'tis plain enough he could have had the ſame Condition by ſticking to the Obligations of the Offenſive and Defenſive Alliance and leaving things to the fair and juſt Iſſue of a General Treaty: And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this ſeparate Treaty, 'tis the Opinion of ſeveral people, that <hi>France</hi> would not have been much the better for it, but certainly <hi>Savoy</hi> much the worſe, if the Emperour and King of <hi>Spain</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the War in <hi>Italy,</hi> as it ſeems to have been their Intereſt, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95917:7"/>
at a time when there were Overtures of a General Peace: The moſt that <hi>France</hi> could have done in ſuch a Caſe would have been the taking of <hi>Valence;</hi> whereas the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have had the whole Winter before them in putting the <hi>Milane's</hi> in a poſture of Defence, in getting Forces from the Empire, and increaſing their own Troops by the help of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> who, tis to be preſum'd, would have given the ſame aſſiſtance, upon the account of <hi>Milan</hi> as they had done before to the Duke of <hi>Savoy:</hi> By this means <hi>Italy</hi> would have had a greater ſhare in the Burden of the War, and whatever Succeſs the <hi>French</hi> could have propos'd to themſelves the Campagne following on this ſide, yet 'tis evident that <hi>Spain</hi> would have had this advantage by it, that it would have ſav'd <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and warded that great blow it has receiv'd at home; and the Allies would have been able by the diverſion of <hi>Italy</hi> to have acted offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively both upon the <hi>Rbine</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi> Theſe were the viſible Conſequences of a War in <hi>Italy;</hi> and therefore becauſe the Emperor and King of <hi>Spain</hi> agreed to the Peace on that ſide contrary to their Intereſt and that of the Allyes in General, ſeveral perſons begun to ſuſpect the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Princes as if they had a deſign to leave the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> in the Lurch, and the Bigots of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> fed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with hopes of a Religious War in which they thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than the Extirpation of what they are pleas'd to call Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. But the Emperour and King of <hi>Spain</hi> could not be impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by this pretext of Religion, they knew very well, that if <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> had been left ingag'd in a War with the <hi>French</hi> King, all the advantages he would have had by it would onely have made more firm and laſting Fetters for themſelves; and 'tis therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Emperour and King of <hi>Spain</hi> joyn'd in this Peace of <hi>Italy</hi> at the Popes moſt earneſt Sollicitations, who though his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſignified little on the other ſide of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> yet was very deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of ſeeing Peace at his own doors, and us'd conſequently all his Induſtry and Intereſt to bring it about. And if ſuch were the vain and groundleſs hopes of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Bigots abroad, our <hi>Jacobites</hi> were no leſs elevated at home upon this ſeparate Treaty of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the conſequent Treaty for the Peace of <hi>Italy;</hi> they could imagine no leſs than that the <hi>French</hi> King would force every one of the Allies in the Continent of <hi>Europe</hi> one after another to make up an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, and thus, that nothing would remain for him but to deal with <hi>England,</hi> and bend all his Forces upon it for the reeſtabliſhment
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95917:7"/>
of the late King; But they both have been very much deceiv'd in the event, which does now convince the World, that the <hi>French</hi> King aim'd particularly at coming by this means the ſooner to a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace with all the Allyes, and to have ſo much the better Terms for himſelf.</p>
            <p>And indeed, at that very time that theſe things were Tranſacting in <hi>Italy</hi> ſo much to the prejudice of the General Intereſt of the Allyes, the <hi>French</hi> King had an Agent in <hi>Holland</hi> to make overtures of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace; and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> made uſe of this very pretext to excuſe the Treaty he had made apart with <hi>France,</hi> in his Letter to the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourgh;</hi> he was jealous, or rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſo, of the <hi>States</hi> having receiv'd an Agent from <hi>France</hi> to treat with them, and therefore he thought that he might very well treat for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Callieres</hi> (as we have ſaid it in our precedent <hi>Hiſtory)</hi> had come to <hi>Holland</hi> with a paſſe from the <hi>States</hi> at the very open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Campagne, and reſided privately at <hi>Delft</hi> the whole Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to negotiate Affairs with ſome of the <hi>States</hi> Miniſters in order to come to a General Treaty; this occaſion'd ſo many Journeys which Monſieur <hi>Dyckvelt</hi> made between <hi>Holland</hi> and the Camp in <hi>Brabant</hi> to give an account to the King and receive His Majeſty's inſtructions; But whether the uncertain ſtate of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Health, who had a moſt dangerous fit of ſickneſs the latter end of the Summer, made the <hi>French</hi> delay and ſpin away time in their Offers, or that the Imperialiſts and <hi>Spaniards</hi> were unwilling to hear of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing things no farther than the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> Mediation was not accepted in due Form by the <hi>French</hi> King and the Congreſs of the Allies at the <hi>Hague,</hi> till the Campagne was over, or rather till the beginning of the Winter; upon which the Baron <hi>de Lillienroot</hi> the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Miniſter at the <hi>Hague</hi> receiv'd full powers from <hi>Stockholme</hi> to manage the Mediatour's part in the Congreſs that ſhould be held for the concluding of a General Peace between <hi>France</hi> and the Allies. Things being brought thus far to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Treaty, the ſeveral Princes concern'd begun to appoint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors and Plenipotentiaries for it, of which I ſhall onely mention the Principal: On the Emperours ſide were nam'd the Count <hi>de Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz</hi> his Ambaſſadour and Plenipotentiary at the Congreſs of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies at the <hi>Hague,</hi> Count <hi>Straatman,</hi> and the Baron <hi>de Zeilern:</hi> On his Majeſty of Great <hi>Britains,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> my Lord Viſcount
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95917:8"/>
               <hi>Villiers</hi> (now E. of <hi>Jerſey)</hi> His Majeſty's Ambaſſador to the <hi>States</hi> and Plenipotentiary at the Congreſs of the Allies at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and Sir <hi>Joſ. Williamſon,</hi> to whom was joyn'd afterwards in Commiſſion, as third Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary Ambaſſador my L. <hi>Lexinton</hi> His Majeſties Ambaſſador at <hi>Vienna,</hi> as 'twere proviſionally; for during the whole Congreſs he did not leave the Imperial Court. On the <hi>French</hi> Kings behalf were nam'd M. <hi>de Harlay Boneuil,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Courtin,</hi> who not being able to attend upon this great imployment by reaſon of his great age and a blindneſs that ſeiz'd him immediately after his Nomination, Count <hi>de Crecy Verjus</hi> was appointed in his ſtead as ſecond, and the third Monſieur <hi>de Calliere</hi> before hand in <hi>Holland</hi> as his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty's Agent to make the Overtures of a Treaty. On the behalf of <hi>Spain</hi> were nam'd Don <hi>Barnardo de Quiros,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Ambaſſadour to the <hi>States General</hi> and Plenipotentiary at the Congreſs of the Allies at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and the Count <hi>de Tirimont,</hi> to whom the Elector of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> joyn'd the Baron <hi>de Preylmeyer</hi> to take care of his own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intereſt. For the <hi>States General</hi> were nam'd Meſſieurs <hi>Boreel, Dyckvelt,</hi> and <hi>Van Haren;</hi> all theſe had the Character of Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours Extraordinary and Plenipotentiaries, as well as the Mediatour. The reſt I ſhall leave to thoſe who write particularly the Account of the Negotiations of this <hi>Peace</hi> to account for.</p>
            <p>After the accepting the Mediation of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the naming of Plenipotentiary Ambaſſadours by the Chief Powers concern'd, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Callieres</hi> who hitherto had kept up very privately in <hi>Holland</hi> and moſtly at <hi>Delft,</hi> took upon him the publick Character of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Miniſter, and had very frequent Conferences with the Miniſters of the <hi>States</hi> in the preſence of the Mediatour, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly among themſelves to ſettle the Preliminaries, in order to come to a place of Treaty. Monſieur <hi>d'Avaux</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour at <hi>Stockholm</hi> had made ſeveral offers to the Court of <hi>Sweden</hi> in order to open the way to a General Treaty by the Mediation of that Crown, not onely during the Campagne of 1696. but alſo, in the Winter 1694. which the Allies pretended to have been more advantagious, than thoſe given by Monſieur <hi>de Callieres</hi> at the <hi>Hague;</hi> This created ſome conteſt about ſettling the Preliminaries, and therefore retarded that Buſineſs for ſome time; however the <hi>French</hi> Court having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon Monſieur <hi>de Callieres</hi> offers as the onely authentick ones, the Preliminaries were at laſt agreed upon and ſign'd by

            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Callieres,</hi> having communicated his full power from the <hi>French</hi> King for this purpoſe to the Mediatour, did declare in the <hi>French</hi> King his Maſters Name, that in order to a General Treaty of Peace, his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty Conſented and Agreed,</p>

            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Callieres</hi> having made the ſaid declaration to the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour in the preſence of Monſieur <hi>Dyckvelt,</hi> they went afterwards to the Sieur <hi>Boreels</hi> Houſe, who, becauſe of his indiſpoſition could not come to the Mediatours as it had been agreed, and the Mediatour having follow'd them thither, Meſſieurs <hi>Dyckvelt</hi> and <hi>Boreel</hi> did: ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to him in Monſieur <hi>de Callieres</hi> preſence that they had agreed, that upon the Concluſion and Signing of the Peace, the Moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King ſhould Recognize the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> for King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> without any Difficulty, Reſtriction, Condition or Reſerve; which Monſieur <hi>de Callieres</hi> confirm'd to the Mediatour in the name of his Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, all which was accordingly Enter'd and Sign'd by the Mediatour in his <note n="*" place="margin">A Signing Book kept by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.</note> 
               <hi>Protocol</hi> the 31th. January. 10th. February, 1697.</p>
            <p>Moſt people, eſpecially thoſe who are Well-wiſhers to the Kings Perſon and Government, expected that His Majeſty ſhould have been
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95917:9"/>
acknowledg'd by the <hi>French</hi> for King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in the Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries, as a neceſſary ſtep without which no General Treaty could be thought of, wherein His Majeſties Ambaſſadours ſhould not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the <hi>French</hi> as Ambaſſadours from the King of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> Court would not yield to this Point, becauſe if the Treaty ſhould break off, yet the King would gain thereby the onely difficulty that was to be regulated between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> the other difficulties being but inconſiderable and eaſily accommodated, and therefore offer'd that it was ſufficient (ſeeing the caſe was ſo) that His Majeſty ſhould be acknowledgd for King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> at the Concluſion and Signing of the Treaty. His Majeſty preferring the Peace and Quiet of <hi>Europe</hi> to what at the bottom was but a meer Formality, Conſented that the Negotiations ſhould be manag'd this way, being ſatisfied with the Guaranty of <hi>Sweden</hi> upon this point in the Preliminaries: And notwithſtanding that the <hi>French</hi> King did not acknowledge His Majeſty till the Signing of the Peace, yet the whole Treaty was ſo manag'd at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> that our Ambaſſadours and Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries met with nothing that might derogate in the leaſt from the Honour due to Miniſters of that Character from the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> However his Majeſties Domeſtick Enemies had ſome hopes upon this account, and they thought themſelves in no ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by it. As for the Imperial Miniſter, the Count <hi>de Caunitz,</hi> he was not preſent at the Signing of the Preliminaries, becauſe the <hi>French</hi> allow'd no other Conditions in them for the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> but thoſe of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> which had been proteſted againſt in due Form by the laſt Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and which neither the Emperour nor the preſent Duke could ever accept of.</p>
            <p>Affairs being brought thus far towards a General Treaty as to have the Preliminaries Sign'd by the Mediatour, no other difficulty remain'd to hinder the opening of the Congreſs but the agreeing upon the Place of Treaty. <hi>Breda, Maeſtricht</hi> or <hi>Nimeguen</hi> were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times propos'd by the <hi>French,</hi> other people talk'd of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> the Imperialiſts were for having the Congreſs in <hi>Germany</hi> either at <hi>Cologne</hi> or <hi>Aix la Chappelle,</hi> but the Emperour was very backward in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf upon this Article; his Miniſter ſtill inſiſted at the <hi>Hague</hi> to have the Buſineſs of <hi>Lorrain</hi> put in a way of accommodation before the Place of Treaty was nam'd; for, though the <hi>French</hi> made no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther overture in the Preliminaries for the Dutchy of <hi>Lorrain</hi> but the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> yet <hi>France</hi> gave hopes of better Conditions
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95917:9"/>
for that Duke when-once it ſhould come to a Treaty; the Imperial Court would have had theſe Conditions explain'd in the Preliminaries, but <hi>France</hi> would not conſent to it: Theſe Conteſtations took up a great deal of time, and prov'd a great obſtacle to the agreeing upon a Place to Treat in; In the mean while the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> pitch'd upon a place of Treaty, which I dare ſay is the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that can be met with in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> for ſuch a Buſineſs, and that was His Majeſties Royal Palace at <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> ſo ſituated that it has the advantage of two large and populous Towns juſt by it, being not above an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile from the <hi>Hague,</hi> and two from <hi>Delft;</hi> where conſequently the Ambaſſadors on both ſides could Lodge themſelves conveniently without being preſs'd for Scarcity of Lodging, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon in the Exceſſive Rates of Houſes, both which inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies muſt have been the Conſequence of having the Treaty in any one Town of <hi>Holland</hi> beſides, or <hi>Germany,</hi> and were ſufficiently felt in the Congreſs of <hi>Nimeguen:</hi> Beſides, the <hi>French</hi> were to come from <hi>Delft</hi> to <hi>Ryſwick</hi> one way, and the Allies from the <hi>Hague</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly oppoſite, ſo that no unlucky meeting of Coaches, and wrangling for precedency could ever happen to interrupt the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations.</p>
            <p>This Palace is call'd the Houſe of <hi>Newbourgh,</hi> built aſide of the Village of <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> about two Bowes ſhot to the Weſt, by <hi>Frederick Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> His Majeſties Grandfather, and is a Fabrick of Modern Architecture, onely a little too low, conſiſting of three <hi>Pavillons</hi> or Piles of Buildings upon a Line, joyn'd together by two Galleries, all of Free Stone and of an equal Height; the Front of the Houſe looks to the <hi>Hague</hi> Northwards, and the back with the Gardens towards <hi>Delft</hi> Southwards, and therefore it afforded all the Accommodations that could poſſibly be deſir'd for a Congreſs to Negotiate a Peace; an Apartment in the Center for the Mediator, and one upon the Right and another upon the Left for the two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Parties, whereby no manner of Diſpute could happen about the going out or coming in, and ſuch other accidents which it has been very difficult to Regulate in other Places. Moſt of the Allies agreed immediately that a Palace ſo conveniently ſituated, and having ſuch Accommodations to prevent any differences about the Ceremonial, ſhould be the Place of Treaty, and accordingly His Majeſty order'd it forthwith to be Repaired, and the <hi>States</hi> had it handſomly Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd for ſuch an occaſion; and certainly it could ſignifie no leſs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95917:10"/>
than a good Omen to his Majeſties Affairs, that after ſo long and cruel a War, wherein the <hi>French</hi> had done whatever lay in their power to diſpute his poſſeſſion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne, yet at laſt they very willingly came to Treat of Peace in his own Houſe.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe advances were making towards a General Treaty, there were no leſs preparations in the Frontiers between <hi>France</hi> and the Allies than if it had been the very middle of the War; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed 'tis very neceſſary to be more cautious than uſual in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, becauſe the Succeſſes of War have then a very great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Negotiations of Peace and muſt give him that is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Field conſiderable Advantages in it, to which he could not pretend before; and therefore 'tis a certain Maxim, that all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments concern'd, muſt during ſuch Treaties, rather increaſe than ſlacken their Warlike preparations, and that the onely way to make an Honourable Peace is with the Sword in one's hand and not in the Scabbard. The <hi>French</hi> according to this Principle were reſolv'd to make the beſt uſe they could againſt the Allies of the advantage they had over them by the ſeparate Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Allies on their ſide were providing for a vigorous defence, eſpecially in <hi>Flanders</hi> and upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in order to fruſtrate the deſigns of the <hi>French</hi> King, who endeavour'd to bring down all his Forces that way; and for that reaſon many Intreagues and ſecret Negotiations were carried on at <hi>Rome,</hi> and between <hi>Turin</hi> and <hi>Milan</hi> to compaſs a Neutrality in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia,</hi> which <hi>France</hi> was very deſirous of, and therefore offer'd upon ſuch a Conſideration to reſtore to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> all the Towns and Places which had been taken on that ſide ſince the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen;</hi> but it was at laſt refus'd by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Council, as a thing which might endanger the whole Loſs of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> beſides other more fatal Conſequences to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and to the Liberties of <hi>Europe</hi> in General: But when all is done, I do not know what harm could have happen'd to the Allies by this Neutrality, if <hi>Spain</hi> could have been inabled thereby to have kept as good an Army for the defence of <hi>Flanders</hi> as it had in <hi>Catalonia;</hi> I am ſure the Allies would not have been the weaker for it this way, and the Frontiers they had to defend would then have been brought within a mutual Defence and Communication, the want of which has been the reaſon that the <hi>French</hi> have ſtill acted as they pleas'd both in <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Catalonia,</hi> eſpecially in the Campagne of 1696, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that in the whole they were not ſtronger than the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95917:10"/>
Allies. But ſo much Vigour was not to be expected from <hi>Spain,</hi> or elſe <hi>France</hi> would not have propos'd it, and therefore the Allies had all the reaſon in the World to oppoſe that Neutrality; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the Troops it had to ſpare in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſince the Peace on that ſide, were altogether ſunk to the Allies, and ſerv'd onely to make the Ballance fall with ſo much the more weight for the <hi>French,</hi> as the Scale on our ſide was ſo much the lighter without them. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reaſon there may be to complain of the Weakneſs of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> proceedings during the whole War, yet their Fidelity to the Allies in refuſing this Neutrality offer'd by the <hi>French</hi> in ſo neceſſary a conjuncture for them, deſerves a Commendation; and if their Efforts had but in the leaſt anſwer'd their Honeſty in continuing the War on that ſide, it may be preſum'd that the <hi>French</hi> would not have taken <hi>Barcelona.</hi>

            <p>This obſtinacy of <hi>Spain</hi> in rejecting the Neutrality offer'd for <hi>Catalonia</hi> quite alter'd the Meaſures of the <hi>French</hi> for the operations of the following Campagne, and whereas they deſign'd to bend all their Forces upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> and in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to bring for that end all the Troops that had ſerv'd under <hi>Catinat</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> upon their Frontier this way, they were now oblig'd to ſend a great Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them to Quarter in <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Provence</hi> for the making up of their Army in <hi>Catalonia</hi> the following Campagne; however they brought as many as poſſibly they could of the Troops of <hi>Italy</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and Quarter'd moſt of them between the <hi>Moſelle</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and the reſt in their Frontier towards <hi>Brabant.</hi> The Allies withdrew at the ſame time their Forces out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and having paſs'd ſome through the Countrey of the <hi>Griſons</hi> and others through the County of <hi>Tirol,</hi> came into <hi>Germany</hi> and were all Quarter'd in the Circles of <hi>Suabia</hi> and <hi>Franconia,</hi> except the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Cavalry which March'd into <hi>Bohemia</hi> in order to ſerve in <hi>Hungary.</hi> But this could in no wiſe anſwer the Number which the <hi>French</hi> brought by this Peace to act againſt the Allies in <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> all the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s and the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Troops in <hi>Italy</hi> were wholly loſt to us by it, which amounted to no leſs than 31 Squadrons and 16 Battallions which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had there in the Field in the year 1696, and 17 Squadrons of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and 13 Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions: All the Reinforcement therefore which the Allies got upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> conſiſted of no more than five or ſix Battalions of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, ſix of His Majeſty of Great <hi>Britains</hi> being <hi>Refugies,</hi> four
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95917:11"/>
of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> and two of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being in all about 20 Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, or ten thouſand Men: The Circles of <hi>Suabia</hi> and <hi>Franconia</hi> took our Six Battallions of <hi>Refugies</hi> into their Service for the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne following, beſides ſeveral new Levy's they made for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of thoſe Circles, having reſolv'd together in an Aſſembly of their Deputies to have 60000 Men for their defence; becauſe the <hi>French</hi> threaten'd <hi>Germany</hi> with a powerful Invaſion in the Summer, and to enter it with two Armies to be Commanded by the Mareſchals of <hi>Choiſeul</hi> and <hi>Catinat,</hi> and theſe Circles, if they did not provide for their ſafety, muſt have been the greateſt Sufferers by it. Thus the Allies became near 20000 Men the weaker by the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>French</hi> ſo much the ſtronger, and this chiefly is due to <hi>Spain</hi> in not bringing over their Troops which they had in <hi>Italy,</hi> for the defence of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where a Re-inforcement of ſix or ſeven Regiments onely could have put it in a poſture to have baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled the <hi>French</hi> Deſignes; and notwithſtanding that the Winter was the moſt proper Seaſon for ſuch a Tranſportation, when the <hi>French</hi> Gallies could not keep the Sea, and that they could then have ſlipt them over one after another, yet onely one or two Regiments got this way into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and when the Summer came it was too late.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>Spain</hi> was ſo backward in providing for the defence of <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> the reſt of the Allies were more active elſewhere and eſpecially in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where all poſſible care was taken to oppoſe the deſignes of the <hi>French;</hi> and becauſe their Garriſons were now crowded upon their Frontiers this way, and conſequently that they might have been ſtirring in the Winter if they could have ſurpriz'd us any where, ſo all our Troops Quarter'd in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as <hi>Ghendt, Bruges, Oſtend</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> and thoſe Quarter'd behind the Canals upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey had orders to be ſtill in a readineſs to March upon the firſt Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; which was ſo contriv'd, that in an Flours time the Allarm could be given in all the Quarters between <hi>Ghendt</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> by means of ſeveral Beacons, or Fire-pots which they had ready at every Guard upon the Canals of <hi>Bruges, Oſtend</hi> and <hi>Newport</hi> to be hoiſted up to the Top of a high pole, which Signal was to be taken upon the right and left from poſt to poſt, Cannon being to be fir'd at the ſame time where they had it, or a Volley of ſmall ſhot from the Guard, and the Towns of <hi>Ghendt, Bruges</hi> and <hi>Newport</hi> were to take or give the Allarm by having ſuch Lights upon their higheſt Steeples or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95917:11"/>
Towers, where there is always a Watch Night and Day, and Firing of ſo many Guns. This was the Contrivance of Monſieur <hi>Ivoy</hi> Quarter-Maſter General of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it being made one Night, it was found that the Allarm was given from <hi>Newport</hi> to <hi>Ghendt,</hi> which is fourteen Leagues by the Canals, in leſs than an Hours time. The ſame Method was taken between <hi>Ghendt, Dendermond</hi> and <hi>Willebrook</hi> by Lights and Firing of Cannon, from whence it was to be carried by the Guards upon the Canal to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> all which could be done in Two Hours time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtance of 24 Leagues. This was ſufficient to cover all the Countrey behind the Canals and the <hi>Scheldt</hi> during the Winter, and to hinder our being ſurpriz'd in any of thoſe Quarters; but the great difficulty was about <hi>Namur,</hi> for the Winter was very hard, and the <hi>Meuſe</hi> ſhut up very early with a Violent Froſt, inſomuch that there was no getting of Convoys into the place from <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> by Water; and the Froſty Weather continuing very obſtinate till the Moneth of <hi>March,</hi> all the Waggons between <hi>Liege, Maeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricht</hi> and St. <hi>Tron</hi> were ſummon'd to carry a great quantity of Proviſions and Ammunition into this place, which was happily exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted accordingly before the breaking of the Froſt under a ſtrong Eſcorte compos'd of Detachments from all the Garriſons therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts without any Oppoſition from the <hi>French;</hi> but then as ſoon as the Rivers were open, (and 'tis obſervable that this great and long Froſt went away without a drop of Rain) another great Convoy of all manner of Stores and Proviſions was ſent thither by Water from <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> of which Count <hi>de Guiſcard</hi> Governour of <hi>Dinant</hi> having Notice he drew out ſeveral Detachments of the Garriſons of the <hi>Meuſe</hi> to indeavour to intercept it, with which he came into the <hi>Condros,</hi> but our Generals upon the <hi>Meuſe</hi> were ſo watchful that Count de <hi>Guiſcard</hi> miſs'd his deſign, and <hi>Namur</hi> was ſufficiently provided with all manner of Stores for the whole Summer.</p>
            <p>This is an Abſtract of the moſt material Tranſactions of the Winter, and Spring being now coming on, we were reſolv'd if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, to be before hand with the <hi>French</hi> in the Field, as the onely means to hinder them from making any conſiderable progreſs in <hi>Flanders</hi> with the great and Numerous Armies they were now like to have againſt the Allies: His Majeſty being deſirous to have his own Forces to act under him in <hi>Brabant</hi> with Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> and that the Elector with the Prince of <hi>Naſſau Sarbruck</hi> ſhould

The Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> had then been viſiting the Winter-quarters, when being return'd to his Head-quarter at <hi>Ghendt</hi> the laſt day of <hi>February,</hi> he met with an Order from the Prince to meet him at <hi>Antwerp</hi> the next day, where a great Council of War was held, the Prince of <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Commercy</hi> (who had come from <hi>Vienna</hi> to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> this Winter to Viſit the Prince and Princeſs) the Marqueſs <hi>de Bedmar</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> being preſent, and the King's pleaſure was ſignified by the Prince about the diſpoſition of the two Armies we were to have in the Field the following Campagne, the Exchanging of Quarters accordingly and the providing of things neceſſary for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and the ſame for the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>Flanders;</hi> After this Conference, the Prince, and the Prince of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercy</hi> with the Marqueſs <hi>de Bedmar</hi> went back to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> to <hi>Ghendt,</hi> where he was no ſooner come but he met with another Order to go to <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> being arriv'd the Second of <hi>March</hi> in this Town, a great Council of War was held in the Electors Preſence, and the <hi>Routes</hi> and Quarters were ſettled for the exchanging of the Troops between <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents diſpatch'd accordingly, and Monſieur <hi>Ivoy,</hi> who acted as Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſter General for the Army of <hi>Flanders,</hi> was ſent immediately that very night after the Reſolutions taken in the Council of War, to the Magiſtrates of <hi>Ghendt</hi> and <hi>Bruges</hi> to provide Bilanders, Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons and other things neceſſary for the March of the Troops.

            <p>This was not yet all the Care that was taken for the Safety and Preſervation of this Countrey, it was found that the Line made at <hi>Marykirk</hi> the laſt Year did not ſufficiently cover <hi>Ghendt</hi> with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of the Meadows of <hi>Drongen,</hi> that there was ſtill a paſſage for the <hi>French</hi> between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld</hi> to come and Attack this place, or Bombard it from before the Gates of <hi>Courtray</hi> and St. <hi>Pierre,</hi> that it was therefore neceſſary to make a Line between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld</hi> to render this part of the Town inacceſſible: And to find the ſhorteſt cut that could be between theſe two Rivers,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95917:14"/>
where a Line might be made with the leaſt Expence and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Strength, it was neceſſary to ſtop up the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld</hi> to make an Inundation, and ſee how near they could be brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by it; and thereupon the deſign was to have made a Line juſt between the Inundation of the two Rivers, which would then have been ſhort enough to be defended by a few Forces. The Sluyces were ſtopt at <hi>Ghendt</hi> both upon the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld</hi> in purſuance of this Deſign, and their Effect anſwer'd fully our Expectation; for by this means not onely the Land between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld</hi> was very near overflow'd, and left but a very ſhort ſpace in the higheſt Ground for a Line, but all the flat Countrey between the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and the lower <hi>Scheld</hi> before the Gate of St. <hi>Lievens Houthem</hi> and the Meadows and bleaching Yards within the Ramparts on this ſide were laid under Water. This makes the ſituation of <hi>Ghendt</hi> very advantagious for a good Defence, and yet the <hi>French</hi> took it in the Year 1678. with a great deal of Eaſe, juſt in the very midſt of the Negotiations for the Peace at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> to ſave the Reſtoring of <hi>Ipres</hi> (which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> inſiſted very much upon) by the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Place. It is ſaid that the <hi>French</hi> King had then promis'd King <hi>Charles,</hi> who was Mediatour of that Peace, (the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being very jealous of the <hi>French</hi> Progreſſes ſo near them, and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſſing the King to declare War againſt <hi>France)</hi> that he would not puſh his Conqueſts any farther on that ſide; and when the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour acquainted the King with the Siege of <hi>Ghendt,</hi> his Majeſty relied ſo much upon this Promiſe that he could not at firſt believe it; however the Allies were ſurpriz'd by this Siege, may be, relying too much upon the Conſiderations which the <hi>French</hi> ſhould have had for <hi>England</hi> in ſuch a Conjuncture, and thus neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to provide for the Defence of the Countrey hereabouts more than they would otherwiſe have done, to have a better Army in <hi>Brabant.</hi> But to return from this ſhort Digreſſion, <hi>Ghendt,</hi> with this Inundation and Line before St. <hi>Peters</hi> and the <hi>Courtray</hi> Portes, and the Line of <hi>Marykirk,</hi> would have been cover'd on all ſides from either Siege or Bombarding, except between the Canal of <hi>Bruges</hi> and the <hi>Seheld,</hi> where there was no great danger: But this Deſign went no farther than the Inundation, and the project of the Line was laid aſide: And may be 'twas undertaken onely to give the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector a plauſible pretext to come to <hi>Ghendt</hi> in order to Execute our Deſigns upon the Camp of <hi>Deinſe</hi> without giving any Jealouſie to the <hi>French,</hi> as I am now going to relate it.</p>

The Firſt of <hi>April</hi> the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> leſt <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and came <note place="margin">April.</note> to <hi>Ghendt,</hi> in order, as 'twas given out to ſee the Inundation made about it, and to viſit the other Frontiers of <hi>Flanders.</hi> The Second, his Highneſs took a view of the Waters which now overflow'd the flat Countrey all about <hi>Ghendt;</hi> and the Third, Major General <hi>Dopſt</hi> Quarter-Maſter General of the <hi>States</hi> came there to confer with his Electoral Highneſs about the taking of the Field, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions were made for the ſecuring of the Camp of <hi>Deinſe</hi> the <hi>10th,</hi> in the mean while the Elector deſign'd to go to <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Newport;</hi> but on the <hi>4th.</hi> being inform'd that a great Patrouille of the <hi>French</hi> had been hovering about <hi>Deinſe</hi> as if they had a deſign upon that Camp, it was reſolv'd immediately to ſecure it without any further delay, and a Council of War being held thereupon, orders were ſent that very Night to all the Infantry in Quarters in <hi>Ghendt, Bruges, Oſtend, Damme,</hi> and behind the Canals to March the next day; Monſieur <hi>de Ribeaucourt</hi> was commanded out at the ſhutting of the Gates, with 200 <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe to poſt himſelf at <hi>Petegem</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Lys</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Deinſe,</hi> at Midnight Major General <hi>la Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniere</hi> with a Detachment of 3800 Foot of the Garriſon of <hi>Ghendt</hi> march'd out of poſt himſelf in the Town of <hi>Deinſe</hi> and ſecure that place; a Bridge of Boats was likewiſe order'd to be made at <hi>Marykirk</hi> and another at <hi>Bellem</hi> for the paſſage of the Troops behind the Canal. On the <hi>5th.</hi> the Electors Baggage march'd by times towards <hi>Bruges,</hi> as if His Highneſs would follow ſoon after; becauſe the day before he had given out his Journey for <hi>Newport</hi> upon this day, which, if it had been Countermanded upon the marching out of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Detachement of Horſe and of Major General <hi>la Meloniere</hi> with that of the Foot, would have diſcover'd the Deſign upon <hi>Deinſe,</hi> whereas now it paſs'd only for an Eſcorte to cover the Canal and hinder the <hi>French</hi> from coming near it during the Elector's Journey; His High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs having notice very early in the Morning that the Poſts about <hi>Deinſe</hi> and <hi>Nevel</hi> were ſecur'd, order'd his Baggage to go no farther than <hi>Marykirk</hi> only for a Blind and ſo to come back again, and got on Horſeback himſelf about Seven not to go <hi>Bruges</hi> but <hi>Deinſe</hi> and <hi>Nevel,</hi> where his Baggage follow'd; and all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cavalry had orders to march that way immediately without Baggage under the Command of Monſieur <hi>Auerquerque,</hi> only with two or three dayes Forrage. The 16 Battallions in <hi>Ghendt</hi> march'd the ſame day and incamp'd about half a League of the Town behind the Canal within the Retrenchment

of <hi>Marykirk,</hi> and the 12 Battallions of <hi>Bruges</hi> with that of <hi>Damme,</hi> according to the Orders they had over Night, came this Day and incamp'd at <hi>Bellem</hi> being joyn'd by the Battallions of the Queen of <hi>Denmark, Zeland</hi> and young <hi>Holſtein,</hi> which had Quarter'd upon the Countrey behind the Canal of <hi>Bruges.</hi> The ſame day the Three Battallions in Garriſon at <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and the Three Quarter'd in the <hi>Pays de Nort,</hi> came to incamp between <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Steinbrughe</hi> upon the Canal. The <hi>6th.</hi> the Infantry incamp'd at <hi>Marykirk</hi> and <hi>Bellem,</hi> paſs'd the Canal upon the Bridges made at theſe two Places and came to form the Camp between <hi>Deinſe</hi> and <hi>Nevel,</hi> being in all 32 Battallions; and the Six incamp'd at <hi>Steinbrughe</hi> march'd to <hi>Bellem,</hi> and came to the Camp the <hi>7th,</hi> which was now form'd of 38 Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions with the Right at <hi>Nevel,</hi> where the Elector had his Quarter, and the Left upon the <hi>Lys</hi> at the Church of <hi>Bachtem,</hi> between <hi>Deinſe</hi> in the Front and the Caſtle of <hi>Oydonck</hi> in the Rear: And becauſe the Cavalry could not yet incamp in this Seaſon, all the Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, to fill up the Ground between <hi>Nevel</hi> and the <hi>Lys,</hi> incamp'd with the Companies in half depths, by which means every Battallion took up the ſpace of two from Right to Left, and this Method was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the Elector's Army moſt part of the Campagne follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cavalry having march'd out of <hi>Ghendt</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> to ſecure this Camp till the coming up of the Foot, went back on the <hi>7th.</hi> into the Town, but all the Foreign Horſe upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> pay Quarter'd at <hi>Bruges,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Cavalry Quarter'd upon the Canal, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dragoons Quarter'd between <hi>Ghendt</hi> and the <hi>Sas,</hi> and about <hi>Bruges,</hi> had orders to come and Cantoon in the Villages in the Rear of the Electors Army, between <hi>Deinſe, Nevel, Ghendt</hi> and the Canal, from whence they were to furniſh 500 Horſe and Dragoons daily for the Out Guards of the Army. The <hi>8th.</hi> the Prince of <hi>Naſſau Sarbruck</hi> Velt Mareſchal General of the <hi>States</hi> Army arriv'd at <hi>Ghendt</hi> being to Command the Army under the Elector, and came the <hi>10th.</hi> to the Camp, where he took his Quarter at the Caſtle of <hi>Oydonck.</hi> The <hi>12th.</hi> the Elector with a detachment of 1200 Horſe and Dragoons went to view all the Approaches to his Camp from the <hi>Pays Conquis</hi> as far as <hi>Denterghem, Wouterghem, Gothem, Arſeel, Canneghem</hi> and <hi>Thilt.</hi> The <hi>11th.</hi> all the Horſe and Dragoons Quarter'd upon the Canal of <hi>Bruges</hi> being come to Cantoon behind the Electors Army, the Battallions of <hi>Fagel</hi> and <hi>Reinardt</hi> had orders to poſt themſelves upon this Canal between

               <hi>Ansbeck</hi> and <hi>Bruges;</hi> and the Elector had now 40 Battallions in his Army, 18 Squadrons of Horſe and 33 of Dragoons Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toon'd juſt in his Rear, beſides 24 Squadrons of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe in Garriſon at <hi>Ghendt,</hi> ready to joyn him upon occaſion, being accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this diſpoſition 22000 Foot, 6300 Horſe, and 3300 Dragoons ſtrong, in all 31600 Men for the defence of <hi>Flanders,</hi> which by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of this Camp put us now in a Condition to ſubſiſt on the <hi>French</hi> ſide of the Canal, without being pen'd up behind it as we were the laſt year and ſubſiſting upon dry Forage at the Charges of the <hi>Pays de Waes</hi> and Free of <hi>Bruges</hi> by the Enemies being before-hand with us at this Camp of <hi>Deinſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flanders</hi> being thus very well ſecur'd by the Elector's having the Camp of <hi>Deinſe,</hi> it was neceſſary to take the ſame Care for the Countrey between the <hi>Scheldt</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> where we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to be before hand with the <hi>French</hi> as well as in <hi>Flanders,</hi> but which could not be ſo effectually put in a poſture of defence; the laſt being cover'd by a good Canal from <hi>Ghendt</hi> to <hi>Newport,</hi> but this very weak; becauſe <hi>Ath</hi> and <hi>Audenarde</hi> were now too far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, and in a manner within the very Barriere of the <hi>French,</hi> ſince they had <hi>Mons, Charleroy</hi> and <hi>Courtray.</hi> The moſt that could be propos'd to be done on this ſide was to ſecure <hi>Namur</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> which, by our taking the Field firſt, we could very well pretend to; and therefore in order to it the Count <hi>de Noyelles</hi> Lieutenant General had orders from the Prince to march out of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> on the <hi>12th.</hi> with the four Battallions commanded by Brigadier <hi>Fairfax</hi> and 8 <hi>Dutch</hi> from the ſame Garriſon, to poſt himſelf at <hi>Waterlo</hi> juſt without the <hi>Bois de Sogne</hi> towards the plain of <hi>Braine la Leu</hi> and <hi>Bois Seigneur Iſaac,</hi> and to intrench himſelf there with the Wood upon the Right Left and Rear, a little ſpace being left here, where was the Village of <hi>Waterlo,</hi> as 'twere on purpoſe for ſuch a deſign. The ſame day Count <hi>Naſſau,</hi> Lieutenant General, and Major General <hi>Ramſay</hi> with the Troops Cantoon'd under their Command, had orders to come and incamp at the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> of <hi>Ixelles</hi> between the <hi>Namur-porte</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and the <hi>Bois de Sogne,</hi> where they were follow'd the next day by the Six Regiments commanded by the Marqueſs <hi>de Mirmont,</hi> making in all 17 Battallions; the Prince left <hi>Bruſſels</hi> at the ſame time, and took his Quarter in the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> of <hi>Ixelles</hi> in order to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them: All the Infantry of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> and moſt of the Horſe being now come to the <hi>Meuſe</hi> from Winter-quarters, paſs'd it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95917:16"/>
about this time at <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> and went to Cantoon about <hi>Arſchot</hi> and <hi>Dieſt</hi> in the Villages along the River <hi>Rupelle;</hi> the Garriſons of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines</hi> and <hi>Louvain,</hi> and all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot Cantoon'd upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier hereabouts continued in their Quarters in order to take the Field upon the firſt Command: By this diſpoſition we were in a readineſs to ſecure either the Camps of <hi>Maſy</hi> or <hi>Bois Seigneur Iſaac</hi> as there ſhould be occaſion for our own Affairs; or as it ſhould be neceſſary, according to the Motions of the <hi>French,</hi> to take the Field on this ſide; and although 'twas yet very early for the Cavalry to move out of Winter-quarters by reaſon there was yet no manner of Forrage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ground, yet all the Cavalry of the <hi>States</hi> Quarter'd in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> had Orders to march, part to Cantoon towards <hi>Flanders,</hi> and part about <hi>Haſſelt, Tongres</hi> and St. <hi>Tron</hi> towards <hi>Brabant,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it was deſign'd to ſerve the Campagne following; The reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Quarters upon the very Frontier, was near enough at hand to be in a readineſs upon occaſion. But the Foot upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> pay did ſuffer ſomething in the Camps of <hi>Waterlo</hi> and <hi>Ixelles</hi> in being ſo early in the field, becauſe the Cloathing was not yet come from <hi>England,</hi> which ſeveral Regiments wanted extreamly; neither was this the only Misfortune, but they alſo came to want pay, occaſion'd by an obſtinate Eaſterly Wind which laſted about five Weeks till the King came over, and hinder'd any Pacquets from coming from <hi>England,</hi> whereby Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> was reduc'd to the laſt week at our taking of the Field, which he was forc'd to divide into half pay for a Fortnight. This was but a bad beginning of the Campagne for the Soldiers, which caus'd ſome Deſertion amongſt them; but nothing anſwerable to that mighty noiſe made about it in the <hi>Paris</hi> Gazette to Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poize the advantage we had gain'd in taking the Field firſt; and Care was taken in <hi>England</hi> to diſpatch the <hi>Centurion</hi> to <hi>Oſtend</hi> with Bills for the Army, where he got time enough (notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Winds) to ſet every thing to rights, and prevent any farther want of pay in the Army.</p>
            <p>During theſe Tranſactions in <hi>Brabant</hi> the Elector was taking all the care poſſible to put his Camp in a poſture of defence in <hi>Flanders;</hi> the Foot at the firſt taking of this Camp had been imploy'd in Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it with good Retrenchments between <hi>Nevel</hi> and the <hi>Lys,</hi> but this not being thought ſufficient, it was propos'd to Fortifie <hi>Deinſe,</hi> for which reaſon a Council of War was held the <hi>13th.</hi> and the day following the Ingeniers were ſent to trace an <hi>Exagone</hi> about it in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95917:16"/>
order to maintain this Poſt, being deſign'd only for this purpoſe and not for a ſtanding Fortification, according to the Agreement made when the French demoliſh'd this place and <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> in the Year 1695. The 17th the Elector diſpatch'd Patents for the forming of the Detach'd Companies left in Quarters into Battallions, and diſpoſing of them into the Frontier Garriſons of <hi>Flanders.</hi> Twelve <hi>Scots</hi> Companies were ſent to <hi>Newport</hi> under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Daviſon,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Battallion of ten Companies of the ſame Nation under Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Murray</hi> of <hi>Walter Collier</hi>'s Regiment, four Companies of <hi>Hanover</hi> cmmanded by Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Vittingehoffe</hi> of <hi>Hulſen,</hi> and a <hi>Dutch</hi> Battallion of eight Companies commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Maurenault</hi> of <hi>Zoutland</hi>'s Regiment, in all four Battallions in <hi>Newport;</hi> at <hi>Oſlende</hi> ten <hi>Engliſh</hi> Companies commanded by Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonel <hi>Foxe</hi> of <hi>Collingwood,</hi> eight Companies of the ſame at <hi>Bruges</hi> under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Lucy;</hi> eight Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies at <hi>Ghendt,</hi> and ſeventeen in <hi>Audenarde</hi> divided in two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions, beſides the <hi>Dutch</hi> Regiment of <hi>Loſecoct</hi> left here with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Walloon</hi> Regiments for the Security of this place. Of the Detach'd Companies in theſe two laſt places, thoſe in <hi>Ghendt</hi> were all <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>Audenarde</hi> all Forreigners but two Companies of the Fuſiliers and two of Colonel <hi>Frederick Hamilton</hi>'s Regiment; all the Detach'd Companies of the <hi>Dutch</hi> were poſted at <hi>Louvain, Bruſſels, Maeſtricht, Liege, Huy</hi> and <hi>Namur,</hi> in the laſt of which places a ſpecial care was taken to have a ſtrong Garriſon, The 19th Major General <hi>Dopft</hi> came again from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's Camp to concert the Methods that ſhould be taken in caſe the <hi>French</hi> ſhould bend the chief of their Forces upon <hi>Flanders,</hi> either to attack <hi>Newport,</hi> or to come to <hi>Torhout</hi> and <hi>Rouſſelar</hi> and endeavour to cut the way to <hi>Bruges,</hi> or force the Canals: For hitherto they had not appear'd in the Field, having (as 'twas ſaid) no Magazines of dry Forrage for the ſubſiſtance of an Army; but whatever reaſon there was for it they did not yet ſtir out of their Garriſons, and conſequently we could not know which way they would bring their chief ſtrength: And that the Elector's Army might effectually be ſecur'd againſt any attack from them in this Camp, the little River which comes from <hi>Poucke</hi> (and branches it ſelf in two at <hi>Nevel,</hi> one part going to the <hi>Lys</hi> near <hi>Deinſe</hi> and the other towards the Canal of <hi>Bruges)</hi> was ſtop'd at <hi>Nevel</hi> to bring the whole Current to make an Inundation before the Retrenchments of the Camp: But becauſe the Army being
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95917:17"/>
thus ſecur'd from any attack in this place, the <hi>French</hi> might march either towards <hi>Newport</hi> or <hi>Bruges,</hi> Quarter-Maſter General <hi>Dopft</hi> went on the 21th to view the Country between <hi>Nevel</hi> and <hi>Ansbeck</hi> upon the Canal of <hi>Bruges,</hi> and ways were order'd to be made for the March of the Army towards this Poſt upon the Canal, in caſe it ſhould be oblig'd to come this way for the Defence either of <hi>Bruges</hi> or <hi>Newport,</hi> which ways were finiſh'd and made fit for the March of the Army by the 23d. In the mean while Quarter-Maſter General <hi>Dopft</hi> went back to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the <hi>Hanover</hi> Regiments of <hi>Hering</hi> and <hi>Wolſembuttel</hi> Guards came to the Camp from <hi>Audenarde,</hi> which brought the Elector's Army to the Number of 42 Battallions, beſides the four <hi>Bavarian</hi> Regiments of Foot which by this time were come to incamp at <hi>Marykirk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Allies had now been near three Weeks in the Field in this Camp of <hi>Nevel</hi> and about eleven Days at <hi>Waterlo</hi> and <hi>Ixelles,</hi> when the <hi>French</hi> began to repair to their ſeveral <hi>Rendezvous</hi> appointed for the Forming of their Armies in <hi>Flanders</hi> and upon the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> and may be 'twas not ſo much want of Forrage as made them appear ſo late after us as our having taken the Field before them, which quite broke and alter'd their Meaſures; for the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> had been appointed to ſerve with an Army between the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> the lower <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> and his Generals nam'd; and the <hi>Germans</hi> were ſo alarm'd at it, that beſides the new Levies reſolv'd upon by the Circles of <hi>Suabia</hi> and <hi>Franconia,</hi> they were working very hard to make Lines and Redoubts to cover thoſe Circles from any Irruption by the <hi>French</hi> in paſſing the Upper <hi>Rhine</hi> between the <hi>Neckre</hi> and the <hi>Black Foreſt;</hi> and upon the Lower <hi>Rhine</hi> they were very buſie in Fortifying <hi>Bonne</hi> and the Paſſages of this River in the Electorate of <hi>Cologne</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Berg</hi> againſt the Attempts of the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal of <hi>Catinat;</hi> but ſeeing that our taking the Field firſt in <hi>Flanders</hi> brought the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> upon the <hi>Lys</hi> inſtead of going upon the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> it is more probable that the true Deſign of the <hi>French</hi> was to have beſieged <hi>Namur</hi> if they could have appear'd before us in the Campagne; for then <hi>Bouſters</hi> could have inveſted <hi>Namur</hi> from the <hi>Sambre,</hi> where his Army had its <hi>Rendezvous</hi> and then he could have been joyn'd by <hi>Catinat</hi> from the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> by which Method they would have had two Armies with that of <hi>Villeroy</hi> to cover the Siege and obſerve our Motions either in <hi>Brabant</hi> or <hi>Flanders:</hi> From whence we may very well inferr, That our taking firſt the Field on
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95917:17"/>
this ſide ſav'd the Siege of <hi>Namur;</hi> and there being at preſent no place left open to the <hi>French,</hi> by the preſent Diſpoſition of our Camps, beſides <hi>Ath</hi> and <hi>Audenarde,</hi> which twas impoſſible for us to cover with the Troops we had, they were therefore oblig'd to frame the <hi>Rendezvous</hi> of their Armies accordingly, and order the Troops deſign'd for <hi>Catinat</hi>'s Army on the <hi>Moſelle</hi> towards <hi>Flanders;</hi> which alteration of their Deſigns (as it may be ſuppos'd) hinder'd them from appearing in the Field ſo ſoon as they would otherwiſe have done: But now being come upon the Frontier on this ſide, they had three <hi>Rendezvous</hi> appointed for the meeting of their Armies to be commanded by the Marechals of <hi>Villeroy, Bouflers</hi> and <hi>Catinat; Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy</hi>'s Army began to aſſemble together in a Body about <hi>Tournay, Bouflers</hi> to Cantoon along the <hi>Sambre,</hi> except that part of his Army that was to conſiſt of Troops of the King's Houſe which gather'd about <hi>Mons,</hi> and <hi>Catinat</hi>'s upon the <hi>Lys</hi> about <hi>Courtray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Diſpoſition of the Enemies oblig'd the Allies at <hi>Nevel</hi> to look about them, and therefore to countermand the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cavalry which had receiv'd Orders to march towards <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> becauſe all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe and Dragoons which were to ſerve in the Army were not yet come up; a Diſpoſition was likewiſe made for the extending of this Camp from <hi>Bachtem</hi> upon the <hi>Lys</hi> clear to <hi>Ansbeck</hi> upon the Canal of <hi>Bruges,</hi> in caſe both <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Catinat</hi> ſhould come into <hi>Flanders,</hi> by this means to ſlip Regiments (the Foot by Water, and the Horſe and Dragoons by Land) to <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Newport</hi> with greater Expedition, where Major General <hi>Fagel</hi> had now a Body of ten Battallions ready to Incamp, beſides four Battallions of Detach'd Companies and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Battallion of <hi>Prot</hi> in Garriſon, without mentioning <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Foot in this place which has no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Affairs of the Field: In the interim, till it was known which way the Enemies would march from their places of <hi>Rendezvous,</hi> the ten Battallions commanded by Major General <hi>Fagel</hi> had Orders to poſt themſelves in this manner, three Battallions at <hi>Lombarzide</hi> to cover the Barr of <hi>Newport,</hi> and the other ſeven behind the Canals between <hi>Newport</hi> and <hi>Bruges,</hi> and <hi>Reinardt</hi> and <hi>Fagel</hi> remain'd as before between <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Ansbeck;</hi> and thus it was contriv'd to have ſent the beſt part of the Army towards <hi>Newport,</hi> if <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Catinat</hi> had march'd that way, or to have receiv'd Re-inforcements from thence in caſe they had march'd to attack the Elector in his Camp, and in both theſe caſes Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> was to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable

Detachments from <hi>Brabant</hi> to <hi>Flanders:</hi> This was the Reſult of a Council of War held upon the gathering together of the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Tournay</hi> and <hi>Courtray,</hi> which was communicated to the Elector at <hi>Ghendt,</hi> where he was oblig'd to go ſome days ſince for a Fluxion and Soreneſs in his Eyes which took him in the Camp.</p>

               <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Malines</hi> but the heavy Baggage was to be left behind till the next day. The Vanguard of Horſe as ſoon as it came into the Plain beyond the <hi>Bois de Sogne,</hi> ſent detachments to <hi>Genap, Wavre,</hi> and <hi>Nivelle</hi> to cover the March of the Army, at the ſame time Count <hi>de Noyelles</hi> ſent detachments of Foot from <hi>Waterlo</hi> to the Church of <hi>Ophain,</hi> the Abbey of <hi>Bois-Seigneur-Iſaac</hi> and the Village of <hi>Bas Iſtre</hi> towards <hi>Braine le Chaſteau</hi> to cover the March for this Camp on all ſides. If <hi>Bouflers</hi> had been paſs'd the <hi>Sambre,</hi> inſtead of theſe detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a great Body of Horſe was to have been order'd towards <hi>Genap</hi> and <hi>Nivelle</hi> commanded by a General Officer, but <hi>Bouflers</hi> was ſtill on the other ſide and ſav'd us this Care. At the ſame time that the Prince's Troops incamp'd at <hi>Ixelles</hi> were marching through the <hi>Bois de Sogne</hi> for <hi>Braine le Leu,</hi> the Troops incamp'd at <hi>Terhulpen</hi> and <hi>Gerival</hi> under General <hi>Heyden,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe under Count <hi>Tilly</hi> from <hi>Tombeeck</hi> march'd about between the <hi>Dyle</hi> and the Wood to this Camp, and thus joyn'd altogether the <hi>28th,</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd with an Elbow upon the right between the Abbey of <hi>Bois Seigneur-Iſaac</hi> and the Village of <hi>Bas Iſtre</hi> towards <hi>Brain le Chaſteau;</hi> this was the Poſte of the right Wing of Horſe and Right of the Body of Foot, the reſt of the Camp went in a ſtrait Line from the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey of <hi>Bois-Seigneur-Iſaac</hi> upon the Right as far as the Brook of <hi>Leu</hi> upon the Left towards the Wood of <hi>Sogne</hi> and <hi>Waterlo,</hi> having the Village or rather ſmall Town of <hi>Braine la Leu</hi> before it, as the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Ophain</hi> was before the Center, and the foremention'd Abbey upon the Right, all three in a Line.

firſt joyning conſiſted of 75 Squadrons of Horſe, 26 of Dragoons and 64 Battallions, making in all 46490 Men. A detachment of 400 Men was ſent to <hi>Nivelle</hi> under the Command of a Field Officer to keep Garriſon there and ſecure a Poſt that was very neceſſary for the cover of our Army, or from whence the Enemies could very much annoy us if they got once to be Maſters of it; and therefore this could not be conſtrued an infraction of the agreement made on both ſides with the Lady <hi>Abbeſs</hi> of <hi>Nivelle;</hi> becauſe 'twas onely for the preſent ſecurity of the Army, which would have been done by the <hi>French</hi> themſelves upon ſuch an occaſion, or if they gain'd an opportunity by it of attaquing our Army with more advantage. As for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe and Dragoons, which had march'd out of <hi>Ghendt</hi> towards <hi>Aloſt</hi> under the command of General <hi>Auerquerque</hi> in order to come to this Camp, they were order'd to march back again for their quarters to be at hand near the Electors Army, whilſt he had two of the Armies of <hi>France</hi> which were now about <hi>Tournay</hi> and <hi>Courtray,</hi> for dangerous Neighbours, for all the <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Cavalry deſign'd to ſerve in <hi>Flanders</hi> was not yet come to <hi>Brabant:</hi> But the <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> pay, <hi>Lloyds</hi> Dragoons, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Regiments of <hi>Montigny, Turck, Zuylen</hi> now <hi>Schulembourg,</hi> and <hi>Noyelles</hi> march'd on towards the General <hi>Rendezvous</hi> at <hi>Bois-Seigneur-Iſaac</hi> to make room for the ſame number, being 18 Squadrons of <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe and four of Dragoons, deſign'd to ſerve in <hi>Flanders</hi> under Lieutenant General <hi>Opdam,</hi> which being now come into this Countrey cantoon'd on both ſides of the Canal in the Quarters left by choſe that had march'd into <hi>Brabant.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Bavarian</hi> Horſe came up about the ſame time and quarter'd along the <hi>Scheld</hi> between <hi>Ghendt</hi> and <hi>Dendermond,</hi> ſo that the Elector had all the Horſe of his Army now ready to joyn him. As for the Horſe belonging to the Princes Army at <hi>Bois-Seigneur-Iſaac</hi> it was actually incamp'd in the Line, and the Magazines of Hay and Oats that were at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> were tranſported in Waggons to <hi>Waterlo,</hi> where we had them at hand to ſubſiſt the Army with dry Forrage.</p>
            <p>Whilſt our Forces in <hi>Brabant</hi> were marching up to joyn together at this Camp, His Majeſty, who could not let his Armies be in the Field without him, arriv'd at <hi>Oranje-Polder</hi> in the <hi>Maes</hi> from <hi>England</hi> the <hi>27th,</hi> and came the ſame Evening to the <hi>Hague</hi> where he was Complimented by the Deputies of the <hi>States</hi> and Forreign Miniſters. My Lord of <hi>Pembrook</hi> His Majeſty's firſt Ambaſſadour Extraordinary
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95917:19"/>
and Plenipotentiary for the Treaty of Peace came over at the ſame time, but an indiſpoſition hinder'd Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon</hi> from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Holland</hi> till the next Convoy; and as if all the Miniſters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in this great Congreſs had onely waired for His Majeſty's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to begin their Conferences, the firſt was held at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> the <hi>29th,</hi> being the I hurſday following, the Emperour having at laſt conſented to Treat in this place without inſiſting any longer to have the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Lorrain</hi> agreed upon in the Preliminaries, and the Palace of <hi>Ryſwick</hi> made up very Commodious for the Congreſs: There was before but one Gate upon the Center of the Court towards the <hi>Hague,</hi> which was appointed for the Mediatour leading up to the great Stairs of the Houſe in the middle <hi>Pavillon</hi> or Apartment; but to prevent diſputes in the going out or coming in, there was a Gate made at each end; That at the Weſt being appointed for the <hi>French</hi> and that the Eaſt for the Allies, which is the Right according to the facing of the Palace North towards the <hi>Hague.</hi> The <hi>States</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Guard to be kept here upon Congreſs days with an equal number of Sentinels upon each Apartment, where the Allies were receiv'd and introduc'd in this firſt Congreſs by a Gentleman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd thereto from the <hi>States</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> by another, having caſt Lots for their Poſt to prevent any manner of diſtinction in this matter: The Conferences were contriv'd by the Mediatour and not Perſonally, there being large Antichambers on each ſide of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatours Room, where the Plenipotentiaries came, the Allies on one ſide and the <hi>French</hi> on the other, and the Mediatour communicated the Writings and Memorials from one ſide to another. In this firſt Conference the Ambaſſadours produc'd their full Powers which were reciprocally communicated, and authentick Copies deliver'd: The full Powers of the <hi>French</hi> directed them to Treat with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and Empire, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and their Allies, which caus'd ſome Conteſtation, becauſe the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi>'s Miniſters alledg'd that the Elector their Maſter had declar'd War perſonally againſt the <hi>French</hi> King, and therefore that it was neceſſary the <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries ſhould be directed in their full Powers to Treat with his Electoral Highneſs by Name: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plenipotentiaries made no Objection againſt it, becauſe the King not being to be acknowledg'd by the <hi>French</hi> till the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding and Signing of the Peace, it was not neceſſary they ſhould produce full Powers to Treat with <hi>England</hi> till then, which they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95917:20"/>
accordingly did before the Ratification. This Affair took up ſome of the firſt Conferences, and afterwards the Congreſs proceeded to regulate the Ceremonial; which I ſhall not meddle withall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to ſay nothing more of thoſe Negociations than what relates to the Operations of War or the Forwarding of the Peace.</p>
            <p>The King having aſſiſted at the Aſſembly of the <hi>States General</hi> and Council of State at the <hi>Hague</hi> to conferr upon the preſent State of <note place="margin">May.</note> Affairs, intended to have gone the firſt of <hi>May</hi> for <hi>Loo,</hi> but His Majeſty having met with an Indiſpoſition the over-night was oblig'd to deferr it and to be Let-blood the next Morning, which had ſo good an effect that the King rid that very Evening in his Coach about the <hi>Voorhout;</hi> the third, His Majeſty being recover'd ſet out from the <hi>Hague</hi> for <hi>Loo</hi> and came this day to <hi>Zuylenſtein</hi> beyond <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> it prov'd an extraordinary hot day (and for about nine or ten days together about this time the Weather was as hot and ſettled as it has been the whole Summer) this made the King hot and reſtleſs in the Night but was again pretry well the next Day, however His Majeſty thought it convenient to tarry ſome Days in this place where the Herons afforded very good Divertiſement in this ſet of fine Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But in the mean time the <hi>French</hi> began to be very buſie upon our Frontier and were like to allow His Majeſty but a ſhort ſtay here, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Swiſs</hi> Guards had been come to <hi>Tournay</hi> ever ſince the 22d of <hi>April</hi> where the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> (being Colonel of the <hi>French</hi> Guards) came from <hi>Liſle</hi> to re-view them; all the other Troops were come by the beginning of <hi>May</hi> to their general <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous</hi> upon the <hi>Sambre, Tournay</hi> and about <hi>Courtray,</hi> and wanted only the Preſence of the Marechals of <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Catinat</hi> (who were expected at this time from <hi>Paris</hi> with the laſt Reſolutions of the Court concerning the Operations of the Campagne) to march and take the Field; as for the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> his Government of the <hi>French Flanders</hi> kept him upon the Frontier. We have ſhew'd above, that our being in the Field before the <hi>French</hi> quite broke their Meaſures which, as we have given very good Preſumptions for, were laid againſt <hi>Namur;</hi> elſe, why muſt our being firſt in the Field bring the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> from his Department aſſign'd upon the <hi>Moſelle</hi> and the Lower <hi>Rhine</hi> clear to the <hi>Lys;</hi> as for the <hi>Germans,</hi> they were ſtill in their Winter-Quarters and not likely yet to take the Field, and therefore there was as good a Proſpect on that ſide for the Marechal
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95917:20"/>
of <hi>Catinat,</hi> as when the <hi>French</hi> King appointed him to command an Army there; But the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> was thought neceſſary for <hi>Flanders</hi> whatever reaſon there was for this Change, though <hi>France</hi> had onely <hi>Ath</hi> and <hi>Audenarde</hi> left open to feel the Efforts of its Arms; and indeed they have been ſo moſt part of the War, ſince the <hi>French</hi> have broke in upon the Barriere given to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Territories on this ſide in the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> by the taking of <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Charleroy,</hi> their having ſecur'd and fortify'd <hi>Courtray</hi> and made a Line from thence to the <hi>Scheld,</hi> which has brought theſe two Towns, eſpecially the firſt, in the very Line of their Conqueſts; for this reaſon we have been forc'd to leave them expos'd almoſt every Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne without being able to cover them, and yet the <hi>French</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have ſeemd to neglect them, having incamp'd, and march'd backward and forwards about <hi>Ath</hi> ſeveral Campagnes; for in Truth the taking of <hi>Ath</hi> or <hi>Audenaerde</hi> could not extend their Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions an inch farther, which, ſince the taking of <hi>Mons,</hi> they have rais'd every where between the <hi>Scheld</hi> and the Canal of <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> and by their having <hi>Courtray,</hi> all the Countrey between the <hi>Scheld</hi> and the <hi>Lys,</hi> and <hi>Ghend</hi> and <hi>Bruges</hi> has been brought under Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, and therefore <hi>Audenarde</hi> could not give them a farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage upon this account: Neither could <hi>Ath</hi> and <hi>Audenarde</hi> do much miſchief in raiſing Contribution upon them, becauſe onely a ſmall and inconſiderable dependance of <hi>Tournay, Conde</hi> and <hi>Mons</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd expos'd on this ſide of the <hi>Scheld</hi> and the <hi>Haiſne,</hi> and all the reſt was cover'd by theſe two Rivers; as for the Countrey between the <hi>Scheld</hi> and the <hi>Lys,</hi> it was cover'd with a ſtrong Line from the one River to the other: From whence it appears that in relation to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions and advantage of the Countrey, neither <hi>Ath</hi> nor <hi>Audenarde</hi> could do them much harm whilſt in the Hands of the Allies, nor much good by their taking of them: However the <hi>French</hi> having no other places left expos'd to their Attempts thought it better to form a Siege hereabouts than to do nothing; and yet we ſhould not have left them even this to do, if the <hi>Heſſe</hi> and <hi>Lunenbourg</hi> Troops could have been brought ſoon enough from <hi>Germany</hi> and our Re-inforcement of eight Battallions from <hi>England,</hi> to have form'd an Army about <hi>Namur</hi> and obſerve the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> on the <hi>Sambre;</hi> for then, the Prince could have march'd from <hi>Bois-Seigneur-Iſaac</hi> towards <hi>Ath,</hi> which, with the Communication of the Electors Army at <hi>Deinſe</hi> and <hi>Nevel,</hi> would have ſav'd it and ſecur'd <hi>Audenarde</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:95917:21"/>
at the ſame time; this ſhews that notwithſtanding the great Armies the <hi>French</hi> had here in the Field, yet we had a competent number of Forces to have acted defenſively, if we could have brought them all in this Countrey time enough; but what gives Vigour to the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of War is Money. The <hi>French,</hi> I ſay, having onely theſe two places expos'd to them, reſolv'd upon the Siege of <hi>Ath,</hi> more to give a Reputation to their Armies during the Negotiations at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> than for any great advantage they could get by it; for he that is Maſter of the Field at ſuch a time gains very much by it in the Treaty. <hi>Audenarde</hi> was much ſtronger than <hi>Ath,</hi> and could onely be attack'd without the <hi>Courtray porte,</hi> all the reſt being eaſily laid under Water by the ſtopping up of the <hi>Scheld;</hi> the Hill that commands it on the South ſide of the <hi>Scheld</hi> may indeed do a great deal of dammage to the Houſes of the Town, but ſignifies nothing againſt the Fortifications, on the contrary it makes them ſo much the ſtronger that it helps very much to keep in the Inundation; and therefore ſeeing that there was no more advantage to be got by <hi>Audenarde</hi> than by <hi>Ath,</hi> and that it muſt coſt them a great deal more pains and bloodſhed to beſiege it, the Siege of <hi>Ath</hi> was reckon'd the moſt convenient in the preſent Conjuncture.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of theſe Reſolutions of the <hi>French</hi> Court, <hi>Catinat</hi> came to <hi>Tournay</hi> on the laſt day of <hi>April,</hi> whence having viſited the Fortifications of the Town and Citadel, he went to <hi>Helchin</hi> on the <hi>Scheld</hi> to cauſe Bridges of Boats to be laid over this River for the paſſage of his Army which was now form'd within the Lines and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd at the <hi>Moulin de Clare,</hi> and the Count <hi>Montrevel,</hi> with a ſmall Body deſign'd for the Guard of the Lines after the march of <hi>Catinat,</hi> was poſted in the mean while at <hi>Wevelghem</hi> without 'em near <hi>Courtray:</hi> This Neighbourhood of the <hi>French</hi> with two great Armies upon the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> oblig'd the Elector to take all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions we have ſpoken of before, for the ſafety of <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> and the fortifying of his Camp at <hi>Nevel,</hi> where, upon the news of the Marechal of <hi>Catinats</hi> being come to head his Army, it was farther thought neceſſary to fortifie the Church-yard of <hi>Maighem</hi> before the Camp and make a good Work to cover the Bridge of <hi>Deinſe</hi> upon the <hi>Lys;</hi> Meſſieurs <hi>Geldernalſen</hi> Deputy of the <hi>States General</hi> at the Army and <hi>Ivoix</hi> Quarter-maſter General, went to ſee <hi>Newport</hi> and <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and in what Condition every thing was for the defence of <hi>Newport</hi> and the Canals on this ſide, and the Margrave

               <hi>Lodowick</hi>'s Regiment of Foot was ſent to throw it ſelf into <hi>Aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde:</hi> But very few day's diſcover'd what the <hi>French</hi> aim'd at, and diſſipated our apprehenſions for <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Army commanded by the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> had orders to march to <hi>Helchin</hi> upon the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and <hi>Montrevel</hi> with his Body of about 8000 Men incamp'd at <hi>Wevelghem,</hi> went and poſted himſelf within the Lines of <hi>Courtray,</hi> his Head-quarter being in this Town.

Squadrons, at 120 <hi>per</hi> Squadron, amount to 5880 Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, which together makes the Sum of this Army to be 33430 Men; from whence it appears, that the three Armies of <hi>France</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to act againſt His Majeſty and the Allies in <hi>Flanders</hi> made no leſs than 144790 effective Men, beſides the flying Camp command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Marquis <hi>de Harcourt</hi> with which he march'd from the <hi>Moſelle</hi> to the <hi>Meuſe</hi> and the <hi>Sambre,</hi> which I could not get a Liſt of, but if computed at 6000 Men, will make the <hi>French</hi> to have been at leaſt 150000 ſtrong this Campagne in <hi>Flanders;</hi> I have ſeen a Letter from <hi>Paris</hi> wherein their Forces on this ſide were given out for no leſs than 168000 Men; but I will charge them no higher than can fairly appear by their ſeveral Lines of Battle.</p>

               <p>The Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> having diſpos'd his Troops thus in the Line of Circumvallation (which they work'd with all diligence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to finiſh them in five or ſix dayes) 'twas now the Marechals of <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s and <hi>Bouflers</hi> Buſineſs to obſerve our two Armies, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from pretending to raiſe this Siege; <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Army there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore march'd on the 8th, onely to come nearer <hi>Ath</hi> and bring the Head-quarter at <hi>Lignes;</hi> the Marechal of <hi>Boufler</hi> march'd the ſame day from St. <hi>Vaaſt</hi> and <hi>Haine St. Pierre,</hi> and came to incamp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Roeux</hi> and <hi>Mons,</hi> his Right at <hi>Thieux</hi> and Left at <hi>Thieuſies:</hi> In the mean while ſeveral Battering Pieces, Mortars and abundance of Pouder came daily from <hi>Doway</hi> (which is the Arſenal of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders)</hi> by <hi>Tournay</hi> to the Camp before <hi>Ath;</hi> the reſt came from <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Condè,</hi> and about 2000 Waggons of Bombs, Balls and other Ammunitions to carry on this Siege; where they had now 20000 Pioniers on work upon the Lines of Circumvallation, and to prepare every thing for the opening of the Trenches. The 10th the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Army march'd upon the Left to cover this Siege by Poſting himſelf upon the Lower <hi>Dender</hi> towards <hi>Audenarde</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh Flanders,</hi> where he incamp'd with his Right at <hi>Papigny</hi> upon the <hi>Dender</hi> between <hi>Ath</hi> and <hi>Leſſines</hi> and his Left at <hi>Hamedê</hi> towards the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and the Head-quarter at <hi>Oſtiche</hi> to hinder the Elector's Army from attempting the Relief of <hi>Ath</hi> on this ſide, this being a Camp by which our Army muſt paſs from <hi>Flanders</hi> to go to <hi>Ath,</hi> and therefore fit to be ſecur'd firſt by the <hi>French</hi> upon the undertaking of this Siege. The 11th the Marechal of <hi>Bouſters</hi> march'd likewiſe with his Army to come nearer the <hi>Dender</hi> on this ſide, and came to Poſt himſelf at the Camp of <hi>Soignies:</hi> For the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95917:27"/>
Town of <hi>Ath</hi> could not be reliev'd at preſent by us, but by one ſide of the <hi>Dender</hi> towards the <hi>Scheld</hi> or the other towards <hi>Brabant</hi> whilſt the <hi>French</hi> were Maſters of <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Tournay,</hi> which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd any Relief on the ſide of <hi>Leuſe</hi> and <hi>Lignes:</hi> In the firſt Caſe our Army muſt have march'd by the Camps of <hi>Ninove, Grammont,</hi> and <hi>Leſſines</hi> and endeavour to gain the Height of <hi>Rebay,</hi> which was now cover'd by <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Poſting himſelf at <hi>Oſtiche</hi> between <hi>Papigny</hi> and <hi>Hamedê:</hi> In the Second our Army muſt have march'd to <hi>Enghien</hi> in order to attack the Line of Circumvallation between the Upper and Lower <hi>Dender;</hi> but the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> being at <hi>Soignies,</hi> he was now at hand to Seize this Poſt before us and hinder any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for a Relief on that ſide: For the Prince could not ſtir from <hi>Bois-Seigneur-Iſaac</hi> without leaving <hi>Namur</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels</hi> expos'd to the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers,</hi> if he had offer'd to get before the <hi>French</hi> to the Camps of <hi>Enghien</hi> or <hi>Ghiſlenghien,</hi> and 'twas better run the risk of <hi>Ath</hi> than of either of theſe places.</p>
               <p>It is not neceſſary to give a deſcription of the Town <hi>Ath,</hi> before I run into the particulars of this Siege, having already given an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it in ſome of the precedent Hiſtories; I ſhall onely ſay at preſent, that <hi>Ath</hi> is a Fortification of Eight Baſtion upon ſeven ſides of a Polygone, that, towards <hi>Tournay</hi> and <hi>Leuſe,</hi> being much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than any of the other ſides (which are almoſt equal) has a flat Baſtion upon the Center of it; all the Baſtions and Half-moons are fac'd with good Stone, and 'tis enough to ſet forth the goodneſs and fineneſs of all theſe Works to ſay that they were the Contrivance of Monſieur <hi>de Vauban;</hi> but, notwithſtanding all the pains which the <hi>French</hi> took in fortifying of this place whilſt it was in their Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for 20 years together between the Treaties of <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> and <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> yet the ſituation of it is very weak and diſadvantagious, being commanded on one ſide of it towards the <hi>Scheld</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> by a high and riſing ground which comes to the very Paliſſades, from whence you may look into the Streets of the Town; and beſides this diſadvantage, all the Ground hereabouts is of a very eaſie Mould and Commodious for the making of Trenches, and cannot give much Pain and Labour to the Pioniers in digging. The Garriſon of it was not very ſtrong, conſiſting of the Regiments of <hi>Anhalt, Slabendorf</hi> and <hi>Schellinga,</hi> three Regiments of the <hi>States,</hi> which onely could be called Regiments; the reſt being <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Walloons</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſervice, and every one that has been in <hi>Flanders</hi> knows the ſtrength
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95917:27"/>
and condition of thoſe Regiments; but ſuch as they are 'tis not their fault if they are not better, and their ſervice has generally been very good upon occaſion and not at all anſwerable to the ſtate they are in: Of theſe Regiments in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſervive there was the <hi>Italian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of <hi>Aquaviva,</hi> the three <hi>Walloon</hi> Regiments of <hi>Grobendonck, d'Odrignies</hi> and <hi>Maucron,</hi> being Foot; the Regiment of Horſe of the Prince of <hi>Chimay,</hi> and the Dragoons of <hi>Rysbourg,</hi> neither of which muſt be reckon'd a Squadron, as any one may ſee by the Liſt of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe and Dragoons in our Lines of Battle. The three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Foot in the <hi>States</hi> ſervice being commanded by the Prince of <hi>Anhalt</hi> Brigadier, may be computed at 600 Effective Men one with another, which (I am ſure) was the moſt; as for the reſt, I dare ſay, they did not make upwards of 700 Men together; which makes the Garriſon to conſiſt at the beginning of this Siege of about 2500 Effective Men under the Command of the Count <hi>de Roeux</hi> Governour of the place, a Gentleman of the Houſe of <hi>Croye.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Chimay,</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Rysbourg</hi> and the Count <hi>d'Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viva</hi> were at the Electors Court when <hi>Ath</hi> was inveſted, but upon the News of it, went immediately to endeavour to throw themſelves into the place and ſerve at the head of their Regiments; the Prince of <hi>Chimay</hi> luckily got in diſguiz'd like a <hi>Boor</hi> following of a Cart, Load of Beer to ſell in the <hi>French</hi> Camp, but the Marquis of <hi>Ryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> and Count <hi>Aquaviva</hi> were made Priſoners in endeavouring to get in.</p>
               <p>Upon the firſt News of this Siege there was a project form'd in the Electors Army of endeavouring to make a diverſion by the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack of the Lines, or <hi>Courtray;</hi> and a diſpoſition was made thereupon for the Army to have march'd that way; in which Caſe it was to be joyn'd by all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe in Quarters at <hi>Ghendt,</hi> and the Dragoons cantoon'd between <hi>Nevel</hi> and <hi>Marykirk,</hi> the four Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Cuiraſſiers and Dragoons now incamp'd at <hi>Marykirk</hi> under the Count <hi>d'Arco,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, which was ſtill cantoon'd hereabouts: The deſign was to have paſs'd the <hi>Lys</hi> at <hi>Deinſe</hi> upon ſeveral Bridges of Boats laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this place and <hi>Bachtem,</hi> from whence the Army was to have march'd with all diligence and ſecreſie by <hi>Mackelen, Zult, Vive St. Eloy</hi> and <hi>Harlebeck</hi> towards <hi>Courtray;</hi> but <hi>Montrevel</hi> having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a pretty good Body at <hi>Courtray</hi> for the defence of the Lines, beſides the Marquis <hi>de la Mothe,</hi> who upon ſuch an occaſion could
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95917:28"/>
have detach'd ſeveral Battallions from his Camp between <hi>Ipres</hi> and <hi>Furnes,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Crequi</hi> at <hi>Celles,</hi> near the <hi>Scheld</hi> where he was at hand to get within the Lines, and that Succours could be ſent thither very eaſily from the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Army; this deſign was therefore thought impracticable, and ſo laid aſide, and the <hi>French</hi> could not be hinder'd from carrying on this Siege, for which no other expedient was left but the junction of our two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but before I bring them together it is neceſſary to enter into the Siege of <hi>Ath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> having ſpent ſome days in making up the Line of Circumvallation, laying of Bridges for the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Quarters, and the bringing in of great quantities of <hi>Faſcines;</hi> and ſeveral Battering pieces and Morters with great quantities of Ammunitions being come into the Camp the 11th, every thing was ready on the 12th for the opening of the Trenches, which the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers reſolv'd to do before the <hi>Bruſſels porte</hi> in two places, one upon the right (according to the facing of the works) againſt the Baſtion of <hi>Namur,</hi> and the other upon the Left againſt that of <hi>Limbourg;</hi> and that a Lieutenant General and a Brigadier ſhould mount upon the Right with three Battallions, a Marechal de Camp or Major General with as many Battallions upon the Left, and that a Brigade of Ingeniers ſhould be every Night in the Trenches at each of thoſe two Attacks. According to theſe Reſolutions the Trenches were open'd the 12th in the Night by Count <hi>Teſſè</hi> Lieute<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral on the Right and Brigadier <hi>Saliſch,</hi> with three Battallions of the Regiment of <hi>Navarre;</hi> on the Left, by Count <hi>de Marſin</hi> Major General with two Battallions of <hi>Poitou</hi> and one of <hi>La Marche;</hi> they work'd this firſt Night no leſs than 500 Fathoms of Trenches upon the Right and Left, which they joyn'd the next Morning by a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, which embrac'd the whole Attack before <hi>Bruſſels porte</hi> from the Baſtion of <hi>Namur</hi> on the Right to that of <hi>Limbourg</hi> on the left: The Beſiegers thought it convenient to make their Attack this way, becauſe the <hi>Batardeau</hi> or Damme, which keeps up the Water in the <hi>Foſſé</hi> was near this Gate, and therefore they could not propoſe to drain the Ditch in order to a General Aſſault till they had ruin'd the the Damme; ſome people thought that Monſieur <hi>de Vauban</hi> got the Attack to be made this way (though not the weakeſt) for the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of his own work which he would have to hold out for ſome time and not be forc'd to Surrender over ſoon, after ſuch vaſt Sums of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95917:28"/>
Money laid out by the <hi>French</hi> King for the Fortification of it. The 13th, a Convoy of 10 pieces of Cannon and 400 Waggons of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitions and Officers Baggage came into the Camp, having been Attack'd at the Village of <hi>Maude</hi> coming from <hi>Tournay</hi> by a <hi>Walloon</hi> Captain of an independent Company of Fuſiliers of the Garriſon of <hi>Ghendt</hi> with 100 Men, joyn'd by 24 Horſe of the Garriſon of <hi>Aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde;</hi> and though the Convoy had a very ſtrong <hi>Eſcorte,</hi> yet the Party was ſo lucky as to bring off 62 Horſes and 30 Priſoners which they had ſafe into <hi>Ghendt</hi> after having fought very hard to preſerve their Booty, and kill'd and wounded ſeveral of the <hi>French.</hi> In the Evening the Marquis <hi>de Vins</hi> Lieutenant General and the Marquis <hi>de Vibray</hi> Brigadier, mounted the Trenches upon the right with two Battallions of <hi>Anjou</hi> and one of <hi>Tourneſis;</hi> Count <hi>de Grancey</hi> Major General upon the Left with the two Battallions of <hi>Humieres</hi> and one of <hi>Vexin.</hi> The Trenches were brought this Night within 200 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms of the <hi>Glacis</hi> of the Place, and joyn'd the 14th in the Morning by a Parallel; The ſame day the Marquis <hi>de Conflans</hi> was taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in the <hi>French</hi> Camp as he was endeavouring to get into the Place: In the Evening the Marquis <hi>de Larrey</hi> Lieutenant General had the Trenches upon the Right with Brigadier <hi>Lee</hi> and the Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of <hi>Artois, Catinat</hi> and <hi>Pery;</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Clerambaut</hi> Major General on the Left with two Battallions of <hi>Vermandois</hi> and one of <hi>Bugey:</hi> The Trenches were advanc'd this Night very near the Foot of the <hi>Glacis,</hi> but the Beſiegers had ſeveral Soldiers kill'd and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, a Lieutenant of <hi>Bugey</hi> being among the latter.</p>
               <p>I muſt now leave this Siege for a while to ſpeak of the Motions made by the Allies in ſuch a Conjuncture. Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> was ſtill in his Camp of <hi>Bois-ſiegneur-Iſaac</hi> where little extraordinary happen'd to relate at preſent, but that, upon the Marechal of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers</hi> coming with his Army between <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Soignie,</hi> the Prince detach'd <hi>Bannier</hi>'s Brigade of Foot to Poſt it ſelf at <hi>Braine le Chateau</hi> and ſecure thereby our March to the Camp of <hi>Halle,</hi> which we could not have done if this paſs had once been in the hands of the <hi>French:</hi> And that there might be an exact Correſpondence in the Motions of the two Armies whilſt the <hi>French</hi> were ingag'd in the Siege of <hi>Ath,</hi> the Prince diſpatch'd Quarter-maſter-General <hi>Dopft</hi> to the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> at <hi>Nevel;</hi> where, upon his Arrival a great Council of War was held to ſettle the Marches of the two Armies, which (may be) put a ſtop to the Project above-mention'd of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting

a diverſion upon the Lines or <hi>Courtray;</hi> from hence Quater-Maſter-General <hi>Dopft</hi> went the ſame day Poſt to <hi>Breda,</hi> where the King was now expected from <hi>Zuylenſtein:</hi> for the <hi>French</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the Siege of <hi>Ath</hi> at this time, had prevented His Majeſty's going to <hi>Loo.</hi> On the 11th Meſſieurs <hi>Ivoy</hi> and <hi>Verboom,</hi> the firſt Quarter-Maſter-Ceneral under the Prince of <hi>Naſſau-Sarbruck</hi> and the ſecond of the Electors Troops, were ſent to <hi>Antwerp</hi> to meet Quarter-Maſter-General <hi>Dopft,</hi> who return'd this Evening from <hi>Breda</hi> with His Majeſty's Reſolutions about the march of the two Armies, which were, that they ſhould both joyn together and attempt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <hi>Ath;</hi> and accordingly they drew up a Scheme of the Marches which both the Armies ſhould make in order to a junction, and then went back each to their reſpective Camps to Communicate them to the Generals.</p>
               <p>The 13th the Electors Army begun firſt to march from the Camp at <hi>Nevel,</hi> upon the Left; the firſt Line with the Artillery and Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage march'd through the Town of <hi>Ghendt</hi> towards <hi>Dendermond,</hi> and the ſecond paſs'd the Canal of <hi>Bruges</hi> at <hi>Marykirk,</hi> and that of the <hi>Sas of Ghendt</hi> at <hi>Muleſtien,</hi> and ſo on towards the <hi>Scheld,</hi> but all the heavy Baggage was order'd to remain at <hi>Diſlelberg</hi> near <hi>Ghendt</hi> till further orders: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe in Quarters at <hi>Ghendt,</hi> and Dragoons cantoon'd thereabouts, together with the <hi>Bavarians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd at <hi>Marykirk,</hi> march'd in the Van by break of day, directing their march to paſs the <hi>Scheld</hi> the next day; the whole incamp'd by Brigades here and there, as conveniency could be found without doing any dammage to the Countrey; the Elector's Quarter was this Night at <hi>Overmeer,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> under the Command of General <hi>Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> at <hi>Grimberg Opſandt,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Naſſau Sarbruck</hi> at <hi>Calcken;</hi> the Horſe had expreſs Orders to meddle with no Forrage but Clover, and the Foot not to moleſt any <hi>Boors</hi> Houſe, nor to cut down any Wood upon pain of Death; Major General <hi>Fagel</hi> had the Care left to him of covering the Countrey behind the Canals from <hi>Bellem</hi> to <hi>Newport,</hi> whilſt the Electors Army ſhould be on the other ſide of the <hi>Sheld.</hi> The 14th the Electors Army paſs'd the <hi>Scheld,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe and Dragoons at <hi>Dendermond,</hi> being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Troops and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe; the Infantry paſs'd the <hi>Scheld</hi> at <hi>Appels</hi> and the <hi>Dender</hi> near the <hi>Dermonde</hi> at <hi>Wieſe,</hi> and ſo went on by <hi>Maſeel</hi> towards <hi>Aſche,</hi> follow'd by the Baggage of the Generals and light Baggage of the Army; as for the Artillery,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95917:29"/>
which the day before had got no further than the other ſide of <hi>Ghendt</hi> and incamp'd between the Caſtle and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> it came this day to <hi>Grimberg-Opſandt:</hi> All the Electors forces having paſs'd the <hi>Scheld</hi> (as we have now ſaid it) incamp'd regularly with the Right at <hi>Merchtem</hi> which was the Electors Quarters, and the Left towards <hi>Aſche</hi> within two Leagues and a half of <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> 'Tis true there was a ſhorter Cut for the Electors Army to joyn that of the Prince, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Gavre, Ninove</hi> and St <hi>Quintin Linneck,</hi> but <hi>Villeroy</hi> being incamp'd near <hi>Leſſines</hi> who upon ſuch an occaſion might have had Rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements out of the Line of Circumvallation to Attack the Elector, this laſt way, which the Army took, was preferr'd before it. The Electors Army halted at <hi>Merchtem</hi> and <hi>Aſche</hi> the next day being 15th, and the Artillery came up to the Camp from <hi>Grimberg Opſandt</hi> with the Dragoons of <hi>Holſtein-Ploen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having brought the Elector thus far in order to the joyning of the two Armies, I ſhall proceed to ſpeak of our Motions in <hi>Brabant,</hi> where the King was haſtening to Command the Army on that ſide in Perſon, and was now come up as far as <hi>Breda.</hi> The 12th Lieutenant General <hi>Heyden</hi> came from the <hi>Meuſe</hi> to the Neighbourhood of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> with the <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Gens d'Armes, Carrabiniers, Light Horſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all 21 Squadrons being the remainder of the <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Troops that were to paſs the Campagne in <hi>Flanders.</hi> The 13th Prince <hi>Cerclas</hi> of <hi>Tilly</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the <hi>Liege</hi> and <hi>Cologne</hi> Troops came near the ſame place with the Horſe and Dragoons of theſe two Countreys, but the Foot did not come up; though four Battallions of them were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd into the Elector's Line of Battle at his firſt taking of the Field, whether it was that they were left for the ſecurity of the Garriſons on the <hi>Meuſe</hi> upon <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s marching that way from the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> or that they were not yet in a readineſs and ſo we were depriv'd of that Reinforcement for the preſent. The ſame day the Prince's Army incamp'd at <hi>Bois-Seigneur-Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Braine la Leu</hi> had orders to be in a readineſs to march, and the King came from <hi>Breda</hi> to <hi>Malines</hi> in the evening in order to joyn the Army the next day at <hi>Halle;</hi> The Artillery and heavy Baggage was ſent away this Evening, by <hi>Waterlo</hi> and the <hi>Bois-de-Sogne,</hi> to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> under the <hi>Eſcorte</hi> of Prince <hi>Charles</hi>'s Regiment of <hi>Danes</hi> (which was commanded this way for the Guard of the Town) the paſs of <hi>Braine le Chateau</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too difficult for wheel Baggage; a Body of Horſe was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95917:30"/>
out at the ſame time to paſs <hi>Noſtredame de Halle</hi> and poſt it ſelf upon the Height of <hi>Vlieringon</hi> from whence it was to make detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as far as <hi>Tubiſe</hi> and St. <hi>Arnelle,</hi> and towards <hi>Hautecroix,</hi> to get intelligence of the Motions of the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> and cover the March of our Army. The 14th the Princes Army began to file off very early upon the Right from the Camp of <hi>Bois-Seigneur-Iſaac,</hi> the Right Wing of Horſe firſt upon one Column, and the Left upon another, follow'd by the Body of Foot; and having paſs'd the little River <hi>Braine</hi> at <hi>Braine la Chateau,</hi> the Foot upon the Bridges laid over the River upon the Right, and the Horſe over the Wooden Bridge by the Village, they come to paſs the <hi>Senne,</hi> the firſt Line at <hi>Halle</hi> and the ſecond below at a Bridge of Boats laid at the Village of <hi>Buſingen; Bannier</hi>'s Brigade, that had incamp'd at <hi>Braine la Chateau</hi> for the Guard of that paſs, joyn'd the Body of Foot in its proper Poſt upon the march, and ſo the Army incamp'd this day with the Right at the <hi>Chateau</hi> of <hi>Pepinghen</hi> towards St. <hi>Quintin-Linnecke</hi> and the Left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Halle</hi> upon the way to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Anderlecht,</hi> in the Figure of a Half Moon, the Town of <hi>Halle</hi> remaining before the Convex of the Camp; His Majeſty's Quarter was in the Town, as alſo that of Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> which, to cover on the other ſide towards <hi>Braine le Chateau,</hi> the Brigade of Guards and the firſt Battallion of the Royal Regiment of Foot were order'd to incamp juſt on the other ſide of the Town. The Artillery and heavy Baggage which had incamp'd the over-night at the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> of <hi>Ixelles</hi> near <hi>Bruſſels</hi> joyn'd us this day, the <hi>Cologne</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> Troops under Prince <hi>Cerclas</hi> of <hi>Tilly</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> under Lieutenant General <hi>Heyden</hi> having march'd at the ſame time from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to St. <hi>Pieters Leuwe</hi> near St. <hi>Martin Linneck;</hi> And the Army was reinforc'd with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Battallions from the Garriſon of <hi>Namur</hi> under the Command of Lieutenant General <hi>Cohorne,</hi> which (upon <hi>Bouflers</hi> paſſing the <hi>Sambre</hi> and marching towards <hi>Ath)</hi> could now be drawn out of that Garriſon: But the beſt Reinforcement was that of His Majeſties Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who having come from <hi>Malines</hi> this day by the way of <hi>Vilvorde,</hi> arriv'd betimes in the Camp, upon which occaſion all our Artillery was fir'd thrice round, in the Evening.</p>
               <p>The 15th His Majeſty's Army halted in this Camp, becauſe the Electors Artillery came up to him from <hi>Dendermond</hi> but this day, and therefore he could not march on his part in order to the joyning together, which therefore was deferr'd till the next day,

Beſides theſe Troops mention'd in the Line of Battle Major General <hi>Fagel</hi> commanded a Body of Ten Battallions behind the Canal of <hi>Newport,</hi> being the Regiments of <hi>Buchan, Lorne, Hanover-</hi>Guards, <hi>Hulſen, St. Paul, Cinqvilles, St. Amand, Soutlandt, Beima</hi> of <hi>Groningen,</hi> and <hi>Swansbeck,</hi> which were to receive the Electors orders as much as if they had actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd in his Line of Battle, and therefore may properly be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd a part of his Army: Theſe Ten Battallions at 550 <hi>per</hi> Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion

The Sum of the King's and the Elector's Armies, which were all the Troops we could command at preſent during the Siege of <hi>Ath,</hi> amounts to 104756 Effective Men including the Ten Battallions under Major General <hi>Fagel,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> had at this time, beſides the Body commanded by the Marquis <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> 144790 Men; from whence it appears that they were now during the Siege of <hi>Ath</hi> no leſs than 40034 Men ſtronger than the Allies, which (if duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd) it muſt then be no wonder if the <hi>French</hi> beſieg'd <hi>Ath</hi> and we could not relieve it; but it muſt be a wonder that with little more than half this difference by which we out-number'd the <hi>French</hi> in the Year 1695.

lower <hi>Dender,</hi> his head Quarter being at <hi>Silly.</hi> Bridges were laid at the ſame time over the lower <hi>Dender</hi> for a Communication between the two Armies; and the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> fell on Fortifying the Caſtle of <hi>Hamedê</hi> upon his left for the ſecurity of his Camp on that ſide; And ever ſince the Siege, the <hi>French</hi> had Six Battallions and a Regiment of Dragoons poſted in the Abbey of <hi>Crambron</hi> where they had orders to intrench themſelves, and another Body at <hi>Lens</hi> upon the upper <hi>Dender</hi> to defend this paſſage into the Plain of <hi>Cambron,</hi> and ſhut up any relief from coming to the beſieged on that ſide.</p>
               <p>During theſe Motions on both ſides, to cover the Siege of <hi>Ath</hi> and to attempt the Relief of it, the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> was carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this Siege very quietly; for hitherto the <hi>French</hi> had not fir'd one piece of Cannon againſt it, and no firing was heard amongſt us but that of ſome ſingle Cannon Shots from time to time by the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, which did the Beſiers no conſiderable damage onely at firſt in bringing up of their Faſcines to have them ready for the making of the Trenches, in which Work the <hi>French</hi> loſt ſeveral Men. The 15th at Night the Chevalier <hi>de Teſſe</hi> Lieutenant General and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Bligny</hi> Brigadier mounted the Trenches on the Right with three Battallions of <hi>Stouppa,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Villepion</hi> with one Battallion of <hi>Stouppa</hi> and two of <hi>Saliſch</hi> mounted upon the Left; the Beſiegers work'd this Night at a parallel between the two Attacks near the foot of the Glacis from the Baſtion of <hi>Namur</hi> on the Right to that of <hi>Limbeurg</hi> on the Left, and the Chevalier <hi>de Teſſé</hi> receiv'd this Night a ſmall Wound or Contuſion on his ſide; but hitherto the Beſiegers, according to their accounts, had loſt but fifteen or ſixteen Soldiers, among whom two Officers were included. The Trenches being advanc'd to the foot of the Glacis, this Parallel was made to cover the Batteries which the Beſiegers deſign'd to make cloſe to the Glacis, in order to Batter the place effectually at the very firſt ſervice of their Cannon; And if the account which the <hi>French</hi> have given of their Loſſes to this day be true, I believe that Trenches were never car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on ſo quietly, with ſo little Loſs, and without firing of Cannon to the very Glacis of ſuch Fortifications as thoſe of <hi>Ath</hi> before; and indeed the Beſiegers made ſo little a Noiſe that all the Diſcourſe in our Camp was of a General Ceſſation of Arms (and that the <hi>French</hi> had thereupon ſuſpended their proceedings in this Siege) which had been propos'd by the Plenipotentiaries of that Nation at <hi>Ryſwick,</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:95917:35"/>
both By Land and Sea, and to open at the ſame time the Ports and Harbours on all ſides for a free Trade and Commerce as before the War. Theſe are the Terms (according to publick Reports) upon which the <hi>French</hi> propos'd a Truce during the Treaty, which the Allies would willingly conſent to in relation to the ſuſpenſion of Armes, but not to the opening of an immediate Trade thereupon; becauſe the <hi>French</hi> Ports would ſoon have fill'd with the Allies Ships, whereas few of theirs would have come for Trade in the Allies Ports, the <hi>French</hi> Commerce being very ſmall in proportion to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> and therefore if the Treaty had broke off, the <hi>French</hi> King could then have Seiz'd all the Allies Ships in his Harbours for his own uſe, or having ſo many of them in his power, he might for that very reaſon have ſtood upon ſo much the higher Terms in the Treaty; this oblig'd the Allies not to conſent to a Ceſſation of Arms as it was propos'd by the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> on their ſide would not conſent to it without this laſt Condition, when they had all the advantages of the Campagne: Theſe were the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſcourſes about a Truce, and I do not pretend to ſay any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing about this matter of any farther Authority; however theſe Diſcourſes, grounded upon the ſilence of the <hi>French</hi> before <hi>Ath,</hi> ſoon ceas'd in our Camp, when we heard the Batteries of the Beſiegers Cannon, which they work'd upon, as ſoon as they had finiſh'd the parallel we have now ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>The 16th in the Evening, the Marquis <hi>de Gaſſion</hi> Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the Marquis of <hi>Biron</hi> Brigadier had the Trenches on the Right with two Battallions of <hi>Maulevrier</hi> and one of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de Hauteſort</hi> Major General on the Left with three Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions of <hi>Surbeck;</hi> the Beſiegers work'd very hard this Night to finiſh five Batteries of Cannon they had begun juſt before the parallel now mention'd, in order to have them ready the next Morning; and accordingly the 17th in the Morning the <hi>French</hi> Cannon began to Roar againſt <hi>Ath,</hi> and fir'd the whole day without intermiſſion and ſo much to the purpoſe that before Night they diſmounted all the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, but two pieces, upon the attacqu'd Baſtions: And may be, the reaſon why the <hi>French</hi> defer'd to fire their Cannon till this time was, becauſe <hi>Ath,</hi> being commanded by the Height of the Ground on this ſide of the <hi>Dender</hi> to the very Paliſſades, and the Baſtions being conſequently ſunk, their Battaries could not be brought to bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, unleſs they made them ſo near as this to the Body of the place.</p>

The Noiſe of the Beſiegers Artillery preſs'd the Allies ſo much the more to endeavour the Relief of <hi>Ath,</hi> and it was concluded by the King and the Elector, that both Armies ſhould march in the ſame order as they were now, the Electors upon the Right and the Kings upon the Left, to come up cloſe to the <hi>French</hi> and ſee what could be done for the ſuccour of the place: In purſuance of this Reſolution Major General <hi>Dopft</hi> Quarter-Maſter General of the <hi>States</hi> Armies was order'd by the King to go and view the ways from our Camp to <hi>Enghien,</hi> under an Ecorte of 600 Horſe and Dragoons and 200 Foot, commanded by Brigadier <hi>Lumley,</hi> and make them ready for our March: Brigadier <hi>Lumley</hi> met early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near <hi>Enghien</hi> with a Detachment of the <hi>French</hi> commanded by the Colonel of the <hi>Huſſars,</hi> conſiſting of 100 Carabiniers, 50 Dragoons and 50 <hi>Huſſars,</hi> which he defeated, the <hi>French</hi> being decoy'd into the Body of our Party that lay in Ambuſcade, by the Vanguard, where commanded Sir <hi>William Ruſſel</hi> of Colonel <hi>Coy</hi>'s Regiment, according to the orders he had receiv'd upon this occaſion; and the Colonel of the <hi>Huſſars</hi> with two Lieutenants, a Cornet and 40 Troopers were made Priſoners, about as many Horſes taken, and ten or twelve of the <hi>French</hi> kill'd upon the ſpot and the reſt fled as well as they could, without any loſs on our ſide worth mentioning: The Colonel of the <hi>Huſſars,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Mortagne</hi> by Name, and the three Officers were treated very civilly and ſent priſoners to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> in General <hi>Auerquerque</hi>'s Coach. At the ſame time that Major General <hi>Dopſt</hi> was commanded from our Army to view the Countrey and repair the ways towards <hi>Enghien,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Ivoy,</hi> Quarter-Maſter General to the Prince of <hi>Naſſau Sarbruck,</hi> was ſent upon the ſame deſign for the Electros Army towards the Wood of <hi>Leſſines;</hi> and a great Council of War being held, a diſpoſition was made for the two Armies to march the next day, the Kings, to the Camp of <hi>Enghien</hi> with the Right at the Village of <hi>Marck</hi> and the Left behind this place where the Kings Quarter was appointed; and the Elector's, between the Wood of <hi>Leſſines</hi> upon the Right and the Village of <hi>Marck</hi> upon the Left, and orders were given to march the next day; But that very Night it began to Rain in ſuch abundance, that our workmen for the repairing of the ways had much ado to get home, and the Rain continuing all the dayfollowing, which by that time had ſpoil'd all the ways in this deep Countrey, the Order was countermanded and the Armies were forc'd to continue where they were.</p>

The 17th in the Evening Monſieur <hi>de Vauban</hi> Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and the Count <hi>de Mornay</hi> Brigadier reliev'd the Trenches upon the Right with two Battallions of <hi>Surlanbe</hi> and the Regiment of <hi>Hautefort;</hi> Major General <hi>Greder</hi> upon the Left, with a Battallion of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and two of <hi>Teſſé;</hi> the Beſiegers work'd this Night upon three Batteries of Mortars, one upon the Right and a ſecond upon the Left of Twelve Mortars, each carrying Bombs of 150 weight, to fire them into the attacqu'd Works (for the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> had given orders to do as little damage to the Town as was poſſible) and the third in the Center which conſiſted of 3 large Mortars carrying Bombs of 500 weight to throw them upon the <hi>Batardeau</hi> or Damme, that held up the Water in the Ditch, in order to deſtroy it, being a very good and ſtrong Stone Work; for the Beſieged had ſo ſtop't up the Water by the help of this Damme, that they had Eight Foot of Water in the <hi>Foſſé,</hi> and the Meadows on both ſides the upper <hi>Dender</hi> near the Town were all overflow'd. The 15th, all theſe Mortars began to fire very violently, which with the Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Cannon augmented very much the Noiſe and Thunder of the Beſiegers; at Night Monſieur <hi>de Bachevilliers</hi> Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral had the Trenches on the Right with the Duke <hi>de Humieres</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier and the Regiments of <hi>Boulenois, Xaintonge</hi> and <hi>Mouchy;</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Sailly</hi> Major General on the left with the Regiments of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goumois, d'Enonville</hi> and <hi>Choiſinet,</hi> the Beſiegers fir'd their Bombs without intermiſſion this night, and the day following their Cannon play'd very hard to ruin the Defences of the Beſieged and ſilence their Cannon, which by this time were almoſt all diſmounted, ſo that they fir'd very ſeldom but in the Night, and that with ſmall Shot; The <hi>French</hi> brought their Trenches this Night within 12 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms of the Points of the Salliant Angles of the cover'd way and made every thing ready for the Attack of the Counterſcarp the next Evening.</p>
               <p>The 19th Count <hi>Teſſê</hi> Lieutenant General mounted the Trenches for the ſecond time on the Right, and Brigadier <hi>d'Orgemant,</hi> with the firſt Battallion of <hi>Surbeck</hi> and the firſt and laſt of <hi>Saliſch;</hi> Count <hi>Marſin</hi> Major General mounted likewiſe for the ſecond time on the Left with the three <hi>Iriſh</hi> Battallions of <hi>Lee:</hi> The Beſiegers made an Aſſault this Evening upon the Counterſcarp, which they carried after a ſhort Reſiſtance (the Beſieged retiring along the cover'd way upon the Right and Left) and made three Lodgments upon the Salliant

Angles of the cover'd way, before the Baſtion of <hi>Namur,</hi> the Half-moon of <hi>Barbanſon</hi> that covers the <hi>Bruſſelles Porte,</hi> and the Baſtion of <hi>Limbourg;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> according to their Accounts receiv'd but very little Damage in this Buſineſs, having had only three Soldiers kill'd and eight wounded, Meſſieurs <hi>de Joinville</hi> an Ingenier and <hi>d'Emonin</hi> Captain of the Artillery Waggons were dangerouſly wounded, the Chevalier <hi>de Pizy</hi> was ſhot through the Arm, and Monſieur <hi>Vialis</hi> (both Ingeniers) had his right Thumb ſhot off. Monſieur <hi>de Vauban</hi> whoſe preſence was neceſſary in ſuch an occaſion receiv'd a ſlight Contuſion on his left Shoulder, which, however did not oblige him to leave the Trenches, but continued the whole Night to give his orders about the making and finiſhing of the Lodgments upon the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp, and the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> himſelf was in the Trenches till four the next Morning. The <hi>French</hi> were now oblig'd to exchange all their Batteries and bring them upon the very cover'd way to Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more effectually the attack'd Baſtions and Half-Moons and make a Breach, which hitherto they could not do, but had onely diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Cannon of the Beſieged with their former Batteries, for the reaſon we have before given of the Height of the ground round the Ramparts of <hi>Ath</hi> on this ſide of the <hi>Dender.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great ſilence of the <hi>French</hi> Artillery on the 20th after the Noiſe it had made for the three precedent dayes, occaſion'd a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in our Camp that <hi>Ath</hi> was already Surrender'd; and our Generals themſelves were not a little ſurpriz'd at it till they had advice of the meaning of it, that the Cannon had ceas'd to play upon the carrying of the Counterſcarp, which now oblig'd the Beſiegers to advance their Batteries upon the very cover'd way. The day before having been tolerably fair, the Earl of <hi>Athlone</hi> took hold on that occaſion to review all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe both in the King's and the Elector's Armies; and as if the deſign had ſtill continued to attempt the Raiſing of the Siege, our Pioniers were again ſet on work to repair the ways for the March of the Armies towards <hi>Enghten</hi> and the <hi>Bois de Leſſines,</hi> and the King declar'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral General Officers; Monſieur <hi>d Auerquerque</hi> was declar'd Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe, the Earl of <hi>Rivers</hi> Lieutenant General, Brigadier <hi>Lumley</hi> Major General, and the Earl of <hi>Albemarle</hi> Major General of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Army: My Lord <hi>Portland</hi> being very much troubled with the Gravel was forc'd to leave the Camp and go to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> but the thoughts of Relieving the Town of <hi>Ath</hi> were at

Grenadiers of <hi>Vermandois</hi> had this command, which they executed with ſuch Vigour, that they lodg'd themſelves upon the point of this Work, and forc'd a Captain and 60 Men of the Beſieged to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it and retire in a Brick <hi>Reduit</hi> inviron'd with Water behind the <hi>Gorge;</hi> after which they lodg'd themſelves upon the Half-Moon and remain'd Maſters of it, having had onely two Grenadiers kill'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion, and a Captain of <hi>Vermandois</hi> and five Soldiers wounded; The Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> himſelf and Monſieur <hi>de Vauban</hi> repaired to this work, as ſoon as it was carried, to give neceſſary or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for a good Lodgment: About two hours after in the Night the Beſieged endeavour'd to regain this Poſt, for which purpoſe, they lin'd all the oppoſite Courtin and Flanks of the two Baſtions of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi> and <hi>Limbourg</hi> with ſmall ſhot, which fir'd very hard upon the Half-Moon for an hour and a half together, notwithſtanding the noiſe of all the Beſiegers Cannon and Bombs playing at the ſame time very quick about them; but it was too late, the Beſiegers were lodg'd and all this fire from the Rampart could do them no harm; the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Night was imploy'd, after the finiſhing of this Lodgement, in bringing Faſcines ready upon the Counterſcarp to fill the <hi>Foſſé</hi> of the Body of the place before the attack'd Baſtions, and this Night Monſieur <hi>de Courtin</hi> an Ingenier was kill'd, and Monſieur <hi>Mercier,</hi> likewiſe an Ingenier, Wounded.</p>
               <p>The 23 the Trenches were reliev'd in the Evening by Monſieur <hi>de Vauban</hi> Lieutenant General on the Right with Brigadier <hi>Lee</hi> and three Battallions of <hi>Stouppa;</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Hautefort</hi> Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral on the Left with a Battallion of <hi>Stouppa</hi> and two of <hi>Saliſch;</hi> the Beſiegers work'd this Night at two Batteries of 20 pieces of Cannon each, upon the cover'd way, one upon the Right againſt the the Baſtion of <hi>Namur</hi> and t'other upon the Left againſt the Baſtion of <hi>Limbourg,</hi> in order to make a Breach and ruin the oppoſite Faces and Flanks of the ſaid Baſtions, being the only defence that was left to the Town, but the Mortars ſtill continued to fire upon the Stone Damme and the attack'd Works, and eſpecially the <hi>Reduit</hi> (where the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and 60 Men before mention'd had retir'd upon the taking of the Half-Moon of <hi>Barbanſon)</hi> in order to ruin it and break the Bridge between them and the Town; and the Beſiegers had two Ingeniers wounded in the Work of this Night.

The 25th the Batteries continued to play very hard againſt the foreſaid Baſtions, and the Right face of that of <hi>Limbourg</hi> fell the length of 14 or 15 fathoms; this made the Beſiegers ſo much the more eager in firing their Batteries to widen and level the Breaches for a General aſſault; but eſpecially the Morters, which play'd without ceaſing upon the attack'd Baſtions, to hinder the Beſieged from working at any retrenchment within the Ruins of them; for all the Baſtions of <hi>Ath</hi> are very large and capacious: In the Night the Beſiegers work'd to finiſh the deſcent in the Ditch, and the 26th in the Morning the Breaches being found wide enough, for 30 Men abreſt to march up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Baſtion of <hi>Namur,</hi> and 25 upon that of <hi>Limbourg,</hi> and the Ditch being fill'd with Faſcines and the Ruines of the faces of theſe Baſtions, it was concluded by the Beſiegers to give this day a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſault, Monſieur <hi>de Teſſé</hi> Lieutenant General and the Count <hi>de Marſin</hi> Major-General having then the Trenches which they had reliev'd the over-night; for which end a diſpoſition was made for twenty Companies of Grenadiers, commanded by the Count <hi>de Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,</hi> to make an aſſault upon the Breaches in the Afternoon, and carry the Town in it: But the Beſieged did not think fit to run the Risk of a General Aſſault, and as they could expect no relief from without, ſo about two of the Clock this Afternoon they Beat the <hi>Chamade,</hi> and Hoſtages being exchang'd, they enter'd upon the Capitulation which was ſign'd that very Evening, of which this was the ſubſtance.</p>

               <p>After the <hi>French</hi> had taken poſſeſſion of <hi>Ath,</hi> the Magiſtrates went in a Body to Compliment the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> for his goodneſs in ſparing the Buildings of the Town, and doing as little dammage as was poſſible during the Siege, he having given expreſs orders not to fire Bombs into the Place; The Government of which was given to the Chevalier <hi>de Teſſé</hi> Lieutenant General by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rechal of <hi>Catinat,</hi> and was confirm'd to him afterwards by the <hi>French</hi> King. <hi>Thus</hi> (to uſe the Terms of the <hi>Paris</hi> Gazettier) Ath, <hi>one of the ſtrongeſt and the moſt murdering places of</hi> Europe <hi>has been taken in thirteen days Siege from the opening of the Trenches, with the Loſs of onely about 50 Soldiers kill'd, the Sieurs</hi> Courtin <hi>Ingenier, du</hi> Frêne <hi>Maſter of the Horſe to the Marechal of</hi> Villeroy, <hi>and</hi> Emonin <hi>Captain of the Artillery Waggons dead of their wounds; and 150 wounded, among whom were a Captain of Grenadiers of the Regiment of</hi> Vermandois, <hi>a Lieutenant and ſeven Ingeniers:</hi> The loſs of the Beſieged was as inconſiderable, and the whole on both ſides did not exceed 400 Men kill'd and wounded, which is but very little for one of the <hi>ſtrongeſt and moſt murdering Places of</hi> Europe.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the taking of <hi>Ath</hi> the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> gave orders for the Levelling of the Line of Circumvallation, and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Breaches, which oblig'd him to continue ſtill ſome day's in the Camp before the Town; but the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> paſs'd the <hi>Dender</hi> with his Army between <hi>Ath</hi> and <hi>Leſſines</hi> and came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp with his right upon the Wood of <hi>Leſſines</hi> towards <hi>Ghiſlenghien</hi> and his Left upon the <hi>Dender</hi> towards <hi>Papignies,</hi> where, the Troops that had been detach'd from his Army to carry on the Siege of <hi>Ath</hi> under the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> joyn'd him and came again into his Line of Battle.

for to carry back all the Ammunitions and Stores which the <hi>French</hi> had provided for this Siege, having ſpent onely 4000 Balls of 15000 they had ready, and 400 Bombs of 5000 or thereabouts: The Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> ſent likewiſe all the Pontoons or Tinboats that had been made uſe of in the Siege for the Communication of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon the upper and lower <hi>Dender</hi> and River of <hi>Irchenwebz,</hi> to the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and others were ſent from <hi>Doway</hi> by Water to <hi>Pottes</hi> and <hi>Canaffe</hi> for the uſe of his Army, being now deſign'd to march into <hi>Flanders</hi> as I ſhall tell it by and by.

and St. <hi>Quintin</hi> for fear of leaving <hi>Namur</hi> expos'd to a Siege; and thus we were oblig'd to continue in this Camp and wait for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>French</hi> after the reduction of <hi>Ath,</hi> and to guide ours accordingly, either for the cover of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> or <hi>Namur.</hi> But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Prince of <hi>Tilly,</hi> he had been detach'd from the Elector's Army after the News of the taking of <hi>Ath;</hi> becauſe now both <hi>Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> and <hi>Bouflers</hi> could joyn their Forces together and march towards <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and therefore a reinforcement was neceſſary here for our <hi>Brabant</hi> Army; Prince <hi>Cerclas</hi> of <hi>Tilly</hi> being come to this place, poſted himſelf upon the height within the retrenchment made, when the <hi>French</hi> Bombarded <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> before the Fort of <hi>Monterey.</hi> The 3d, Lieutenant General <hi>Cohorne</hi> was ſent to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> with ſeveral Ingeniers to trace out a Line before the <hi>Flanders Porte</hi> to cover <hi>Bruſſels</hi> from <hi>Anderlecht</hi> to the Canal: Eight Battallions were expected hourly at this time from <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Lunenbourg, Munſter</hi> and <hi>Heſſe</hi> Troops from the <hi>Rhine;</hi> but not having as yet any competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Forces about this Town, nothing was made of this Line at preſent more than the Plan, for want of Men to work about it; which if it had been put forthwith in any tolerable poſture of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, would have given the King's Army a great deal more liberty of marching for the conveniency of Camps and Forrage: And indeed we have had about the middle of the Campagne a ſufficient number of Troops to have put not onely <hi>Namur</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> but the whole Countrey in a poſture of defence, if they could have been brought into the Countrey at the beginning.

the late coming of our Reinforcement from <hi>England,</hi> but likewiſe in ſome meaſure of that of the <hi>Lunenbourg, Munſter</hi> and <hi>Heſſe</hi> Troops; and the <hi>French</hi> had the time both to take <hi>Ath</hi> and to pen us up under the Walls of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> whilſt they had the whole Country between the Canal and the <hi>Scheld</hi> to range freely in and Forrage at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as it ſhall appear in the Sequel of this Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>The Third, a <hi>French</hi> Ingenier deſerted over to us that had ſerv'd in the Siege of <hi>Ath,</hi> pretending to have fought a Duel which oblig'd him to fly for his Life; he gave an account of the little loſs there had been in this Siege, the whole on both ſides of kill'd and wounded not exceeding 400 Men: The ſame Evening my Lord <hi>Portland,</hi> being recover'd of his late Indiſpoſition that had made him go for <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> came back to the Camp in good Health, and His Majeſty was pleas'd to declare him General of Horſe in his Armies. The Fifth, Colonels <hi>Cholmley, Langſton</hi> and <hi>Windham</hi> were declar'd Brigadiers of Horſe at the Orders, the firſt being made Brigadier of the Brigade of Life-Guards; Colonel <hi>Coy</hi> diſpos'd afterwards of his Regiment to my Lord of <hi>Arran</hi> Brother to His Grace the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Harvey</hi> Lieutenant of one of the Troops of Life-Guards, got the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe in <hi>England:</hi> This day five Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions landed at <hi>Willemſtadt</hi> from <hi>England</hi> being the ſecond Battallion of <hi>Scots</hi> Guards, Colonel <hi>Columbine</hi>'s, Sir <hi>Bevil Granville</hi>'s, Colonel <hi>Murray</hi>'s and the Marquis of <hi>Puizars,</hi> where they met with a <hi>Route</hi> to march forthwith to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> by <hi>Liere</hi> and <hi>Malines.</hi> The Sixth, The Troops of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenbourg</hi> under the Command of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General <hi>Ohr</hi> conſiſting of eight Battallions and twelve Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons paſs'd the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> coming from the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the Foot at <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> and the Horſe and Dragoons at <hi>Maſeick</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd this day near <hi>Tongres,</hi> and came the Eighth to <hi>Tirlemont</hi> where they had Orders to halt, the <hi>French</hi> having made yet no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Motion ſince the taking of <hi>Ath,</hi> and therefore 'twas not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd where to diſpoſe of this Reinforcement; as for the <hi>Heſſe</hi> and <hi>Munſter</hi> Troops, they follow'd, but did not come up till the <hi>French</hi> had brought us under the Walls of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> for the Safety of that place, as I am now going to give an account of it; only I muſt ſee firſt what was tranſacting in the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Camp in <hi>Flanders</hi> after the loſs of <hi>Ath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt Advantage the <hi>French</hi> had by the taking of this place was, that now they could march with their Armies in the <hi>Pays

d'Aloſt,</hi> and Forrage all the Country to the very Walls of <hi>Dender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and the Banks of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> the <hi>Rupelle</hi> and the Canal of <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;</hi> and that in having their Armies here, they made the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication between <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> very difficult for the Allies, who in ſuch a caſe could not march any Troops from the one to the other but by the Canal of <hi>Bruſſels, Rupelmonde</hi> and ſo by the <hi>Pays-de Waes</hi> behind the <hi>Scheld;</hi> and if the War had laſted another Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne we ſhould have felt the Inconveniency of a <hi>French</hi> Army in the <hi>Pays-d'Aloſt</hi> yet more than we did this, unleſs we had been much ſtronger in the Field than we were this Year to ſecure this Camp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. This Conſideration, that the <hi>French</hi> were now Maſters of the Country to incamp where they pleas'd about <hi>Aloſt,</hi> oblig'd the Elector to provide betimes for the Safety of <hi>Dendermond</hi> and <hi>Pays-de-Waes,</hi> thereupon after the News of the Surrender of <hi>Ath,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Regiment of Horſe of <hi>Bunau</hi> and the <hi>Liege</hi> Dragoons of <hi>Roſt</hi> and <hi>Jamar</hi> with the two Battallions of the Electoral Prince of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to march towards that place for its defence, and to hinder the <hi>French</hi> Parties from paſſing the <hi>Scheld</hi> to raiſe Contributions in that Countrey; but the Allies having a deſign to make up a third Army about <hi>Bruſſels</hi> at this time if it could be brought together time enough to prevent the <hi>French</hi> on this ſide; and beſides, <hi>Bruſſels</hi> being expos'd, without any conſiderable Troops about it ſince the loſs of <hi>Ath,</hi> Prince <hi>Cerclas</hi> of <hi>Tilly</hi> was order'd away for <hi>Bruſſels</hi> from the Elector's Army that ſame night, being the 29th of <hi>May,</hi> with the <hi>Liege</hi> Cavalry and Dragoons, and took the two Regiments of Dragoons of <hi>Jamar</hi> and <hi>Roſt,</hi> ſent to <hi>Dendermond;</hi> in his way; and ſo the Regiment of Horſe of <hi>Bunau</hi> and the two Battallions of the Electoral Prince remain'd about <hi>Dendermond,</hi> but Prince <hi>Cerclas</hi> of <hi>Tilly</hi> came to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> where he incamp'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fort of <hi>Montery</hi> as we have ſaid it above.</p>
               <p>The Elector's Army had been in this Camp ever ſince our early taking of the Field (except the little time it was with the King's Army at <hi>Ternath</hi> and <hi>Iſeringhen)</hi> which made Forrage very ſcarce about his Army; ſeveral great Detachments were therefore made to look for Forrage between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld</hi> ſome towards <hi>Warreghem</hi> and <hi>Vive St. Eloy</hi> up along the <hi>Lys,</hi> and others towards <hi>Naſſaret</hi> and <hi>Gavre</hi> upon the <hi>Scheld,</hi> one of which Detachments beat a Party of the Enemies at <hi>Cruyſhoutem.</hi> The third of <hi>June,</hi> it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have march'd with the Army between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:95917:44"/>
and a Camp was mark'd at <hi>Naſſaret,</hi> but Forrage was very ſcarce and the Army could ſubſiſt but very few days in this place, and therefore 'twas thought neceſſary to oblige the Country of <hi>Flanders</hi> behind the Canals to have dry Forrage ready at this time for the Subſiſtence of the Army. The Seventh, the Elector's Army made one general Forrage more about <hi>Wacken</hi> on both ſides of the River <hi>Mandel,</hi> which falls into the <hi>Scheld</hi> at this place; the Marquis <hi>de Montrevel,</hi> being incamp'd with the Body under his command within the Lines near <hi>Courtray,</hi> having intelligence of it, march'd with a Body of Horſe from this place to interrupt our Forrage between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Mandel:</hi> We had on our ſide three Field-pieces at the Mills of <hi>Wacken</hi> upon the River and Detachments all along as far as the Bridge of <hi>Colberg</hi> and from thence between the <hi>Mandel</hi> and the <hi>Lys</hi> all along the way to <hi>Baſſevive</hi> upon this laſt River; <hi>Montrevel</hi> had about 3 or 400 Horſe, and having advanc'd pretty far between theſe two Rivers he met with an Out-guard of ours of 30 Horſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lieutenant, which were ſoon oblig'd to fly for their main Body, being under the Command of a Colonel; theſe were likewiſe driven from their Poſt and forc'd to retire, being purſued by the <hi>French</hi> as far as an Inn call'd the Hive, where Major General <hi>Saliſch</hi> (who commanded the Forrage this day) was poſted, with about 1300 Men; The <hi>French</hi> did not think it ſafe to venture any farther, but went back to <hi>Courtray</hi> having about 40 Priſoners and 30 of our Horſes along with them. The Tenth, the Country of <hi>Flanders</hi> began to furniſh the Army with dry Forrage according to the Elector's orders, which could not ſubſiſt any longer at <hi>Nevel</hi> without it: And the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> having level'd the Lines and repair'd the Breaches of <hi>Ath,</hi> and being now upon his March to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and it being uncertain as yet which way the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> would turn, whither towards <hi>Brabant</hi> or <hi>Flanders;</hi> a Council of War was call'd the 12th at the Elector's Camp to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert what was to be done if both the Marechals of <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Catinat</hi> ſhould bring their Armies into <hi>Flanders,</hi> either at <hi>Thilt</hi> or <hi>Rouſſelar;</hi> it was propos'd in that caſe to bring the Elector's Army behind the Canal of <hi>Bruges,</hi> to march, in order to that, upon the Right and paſs the Canal at <hi>Ansbeck,</hi> and obſerve the ſame Method that was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd laſt Year by the Prince of <hi>Vaudemont;</hi> three Battallions were commanded from Major General <hi>Fagel</hi>'s Body at <hi>Newport</hi> to come and poſte themſelves about <hi>Bruges</hi> to be in a readineſs to reinforce

the Elector, that of <hi>Lorne,</hi> upon the Canal of <hi>Oſtend</hi> near <hi>Schipſtal, Buchan</hi> at <hi>Steinbrugghe</hi> upon the Canal of <hi>Bruges,</hi> and St. <hi>Amand</hi> at <hi>Moorbrugghe;</hi> Colonel <hi>Reinard</hi>'s Regiment of the Elector's Army had been upon the Canal ever ſince the coming back of the Elector to this Camp of <hi>Nevel</hi> and a Regiment of the <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Troops, which upon this Diſpoſition were order'd to poſt themſelves the firſt at <hi>Roſtein,</hi> and the ſecond at St. <hi>George</hi> upon the ſame Canal ſomething nearer to <hi>Bruges,</hi> thus to give or receive Reinforcements to and from Major General <hi>Fagel</hi> according to the Motions of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were the Precautions taken by our Army in <hi>Flanders</hi> during the Uncertainty of the Enemies Deſigns after their taking of <hi>Ath;</hi> for then, either <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Catinat</hi> could have march'd into <hi>Flanders</hi> and endeavour to attack <hi>Newport,</hi> or paſs the Canals, or oblige the Elector, by their coming to <hi>Thilt</hi> or <hi>Rouſſelar,</hi> to get behind them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and ſubſiſt his Army with dry Forrage at the Expence of the Country; or elſe the Marechals of <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Bouflers</hi> could joyn together and ſubſiſt their Armies in the Country about <hi>Aloſt</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> which ſince they were Maſters of <hi>Ath</hi> was now at their Devotion; or elſe the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> could have march'd himſelf about <hi>Aloſt</hi> and the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> towards the Camp of <hi>Pieton,</hi> which would have oblig'd His Majeſty equally to provide for the Defence of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and <hi>Namur;</hi> or laſtly the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> could have beſieg'd <hi>Audenarde,</hi> whilſt <hi>Bouflers</hi> ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our <hi>Brabant</hi> Army, and <hi>Catinat</hi> that of <hi>Flanders.</hi> In the firſt of theſe caſes, we were too watchful for <hi>Newport,</hi> and the letting out of the Waters could hinder the <hi>French</hi> from coming near it; and this Advantage, with the Troops we had on this ſide, ſeem'd ſufficient to cover the Country between <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Newport</hi> and behind the Canal of <hi>Bruges,</hi> ſo that it would be too much Hazard to attempt any thing on this ſide; where, beſides, in ſuch an occaſion the King could have ſent good Reinforcements directly to <hi>Ghendt,</hi> eſpecially now that our <hi>German</hi> Forces were on their March and Lieutenant General <hi>Ohr</hi> actually come into <hi>Brabant:</hi> As for the Subſiſting of their Armies about <hi>Thilt, Rouſſelar</hi> and <hi>Torhout,</hi> and the driving of the Elector behind the Canals, this Country had been ſo Harraſs'd and Plunder'd in the two preceding Campagnes, that no Forrage could be expected here for the Maintenance of ſuch Armies, and therefore if both march'd that way one at leaſt would be oblig'd to march back again in a little time. The ſecond Propoſition of <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s and <hi>Boufler</hi>'s joyning to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95917:45"/>
march into the <hi>Pays d'Aloſt</hi> ſeem'd to be the moſt advantagious and ſafe, becauſe this Countrey, eſpecially the bottom of it, between the <hi>Rupelle</hi> and the <hi>(Scheld</hi> from <hi>Willebrook</hi> upon the Canal of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to <hi>Dendermond)</hi> had hardly been moleſted by any Armies all this War, and therefore their two Armies could live here a long time very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently in the midſt of plenty in relation to Forrage of all ſorts: As for the third, the Seige of <hi>Namur</hi> could be but a Dream, now that we were going to have ſuch a reinforcement from <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Rhine:</hi> 'Tis true that we could not hinder them from beſieging of <hi>Audenarde,</hi> but the ſituation of it is naturally very ſtrong upon the account of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> which, with the keeping up of the Sluces in the Town, overflows all the Meadows about it, leaving no acceſs for Trenches but before the Gate that leads to <hi>Courtray</hi> and <hi>Deinſe,</hi> and there was a very great Garriſon in it, ſo that they could not think of having it at ſo cheap a rate as <hi>Ath,</hi> but muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to looſe a great many Men in the taking of it; which they did not think convenient to do at a time, when the Negotiations of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace ſeem'd to be in a very hopeful forwardneſs; and beſides, the Communications upon the River, which is very large, are very difficult, and eaſily broken upon the lower <hi>Scheld</hi> by the letting out of the Sluces; and therefore it would not be very difficult to raiſe the Siege, by attacking them in one Quarter or other; theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made the <hi>French</hi> prefer to march into the Countrey of <hi>Aloſt,</hi> with the Armies of <hi>Bouflers</hi> and <hi>Villeroy</hi> joyn'd together, to any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign they could propoſe to themſelves; and the rather, becauſe His Majeſty's Army had a very long and difficult march, and a cloſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file for near 3 Leagues thro' the <hi>Bois de Sogne</hi> to come to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and therefore if the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> could but gain one march upon the King, he might have pretended to the Camp of <hi>Anderlecht</hi> before our Army in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and then <hi>Bruſſels</hi> would have been once more expos'd to the Fury of the <hi>French</hi> Bombs, after all the Charges that had been ſpent to raiſe it out of its ruines much more ſtately and magnificent than it was before; and if the <hi>French</hi> in ſuch a Caſe would have been inclin'd to accept a Summe of Money to ſpare the Town, either of them would have made a very great noiſe in the World, when done in the preſence of ſuch an Army as we had then incamp'd at <hi>Promelles</hi> and <hi>Genap</hi> commanded by the King in Perſon, and it would have been as inglorious for the Allies and eſpecially His Majeſty, as a great and happy undertaking for the <hi>French;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

About Ten at Night, the whole Army began to follow the march of the Artillery and heavy Baggage according to this diſpoſition, it being then a very dark night and bad Weather; the Infantry march'd firſt in two Columnes upon the Right towards the <hi>Koning's Huys</hi> there to gain the Great Cauſſey for <hi>Waterlo</hi> and ſo through the <hi>Bois-de-Sogne</hi> to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the Right Wing of Horſe was to follow the ſame way and then the Left Wing; all the Cavalry being order'd to march in the Rear, not onely for a Rear-Guard to ſee the Body of Foot ſafe into the Wood, but alſo becauſe of the great darkneſs of the Night whereby ſeveral People might have been otherwiſe troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Foot by the Horſe: About Midnight the King left his Quarters at <hi>Promelles</hi> attended by Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> to go to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the King and Prince were in their Coaches having a great many Flambeaus to light them, without which it had been almoſt impoſſible to ſee the way; the Brigade of Guards march'd about break of day, from the King's Quarter and got in the Rear of the Body of Foot, the Front of which was by this time advanc'd almoſt as far as <hi>Waterlo;</hi> it was full day before the Horſe began to march, having orders to make ſeveral detachments, from Height to Height in the Plain, to cover our march till the whole Army was got into the Wood, where Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Gohr</hi>'s Regiment of Foot was order'd to poſt it ſelf for the Rear Guard of the Artillery and Baggage, and to bring up all the ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling or wearied Soldiers that could not keep up with the Army in ſo long and tedious a March. The King and Prince got very early on the 13th through <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> with Quarter-maſter General <hi>Dopft</hi> along with them, to viſit the ground between <hi>Anderlecht</hi> and the Canal of <hi>Bruſſells</hi> and chuſe the ſtrongeſt and the moſt defenſible Camp; the Prince of <hi>Tilly</hi> had orders the over night from the King to get on the other ſide of <hi>Bruſſells</hi> with the Horſe and Dragoons under his Command, and accordingly had march'd that ſame Night from the Fort of <hi>Monterey</hi> without <hi>Halle-porte</hi> through the Town, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd on the other ſide between the <hi>Flanders porte</hi> and that of <hi>Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecht;</hi> from whence he ſent ſeveral detachments towards <hi>Hall,</hi> St. <hi>Quintin-Linneck</hi> and <hi>Aſche,</hi> both to get Intelligence of the <hi>French</hi> motions, and cover the Countrey hereabouts (till the coming up of the Army) for an Eſcorte to His Majeſty, who was now viſiting all the poſts hereabouts and the Avenues and Approaches to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> for the taking up of a good Camp and fruſtrating the Deſigns of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: The Van of the Body of Foot got to the Height of the Faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg

of <hi>Ixelles</hi> without <hi>Namur porte</hi> the 13th by Ten in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where it was order'd to halt till the Camp ſhould be mark'd; for all the Quarter-maſters were ſtill here with their Field Colours wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Quarter-maſter General <hi>Dopft</hi>'s Orders, who was with the King, as we have now ſaid it, on the other ſide; but as ſoon as the Body of Foot was come up ſo near <hi>Bruſſells</hi> they were ſent for to come and mark the Camp; and about one the Army had orders to march by the <hi>Namur porte,</hi> the right of the Body of Foot through the Town by the <hi>Laacken porte</hi> and ſo to gain the Height between <hi>Ganſhoren</hi> and the Canal, and the Left round the Rampart by the Gate of <hi>Anderlecht</hi> to that of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ſo to incamp with the Right at <hi>Berchom,</hi> and Left cloſe upon the Town, between the <hi>Flanders-porte</hi> and that of <hi>Anderlecht</hi> facing towards this place and <hi>Dilbeck,</hi> as the Right did (from <hi>Berchom</hi> to <hi>Laacken</hi> upon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal) towards <hi>Aſche, Wemmel</hi> and <hi>Grimberg.</hi> We were to incamp, according no this diſpoſition, in the figure of an acute Angle, fix'd with one Leg at the Village of <hi>Laacken</hi> upon the Canal of <hi>Bruſſells</hi> where was the Right, and to'ther between the <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecht-portes</hi> being the Left, and the Vertex or point at <hi>Berchom,</hi> to have by this means the advantage of the Brook of <hi>Zellich</hi> to cover our Right, which runs through a bottom before the Villages of <hi>Ganſhoren</hi> and <hi>Jette</hi> and the Chaſteau <hi>de Riviere,</hi> and ſo falls near <hi>Laacken</hi> into a branch of the <hi>Senne</hi> (that goes all along the Canal on this ſide as far as the <hi>Fort-des-trois-Trous)</hi> forming ſeveral Fiſh-ponds from the <hi>Chaſteau de Riviere</hi> to the Village of <hi>Jette,</hi> and ſo to that of <hi>Laacken;</hi> This made the right of our Camp very ſtrong, the Brook of <hi>Zellich</hi> being ſtopt up upon this occaſion to make an inundation in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom before our Right between <hi>Jette</hi> and <hi>Laacken;</hi> and in General all the approaches to our Camp on this ſide were through ſtrong defile's caus'd by the Woods about the Abbey of <hi>Dillighem,</hi> the paſſages over this Rivulet, and the ſeveral Villages before us. Our Left, which turn'd down from <hi>Berchom</hi> to the Town of <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> facing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Anderlecht</hi> and <hi>Dilbeck,</hi> was cover'd by a bottom which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan near the Village of <hi>Berchom</hi> and ſo continued to the very Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts of the Town, having ſeveral Fiſhponds in it, with deep and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ways, which made it very difficult to attack us on that ſide; we left indeed the Height between <hi>Anderlecht</hi> and <hi>Dilbeck</hi> open, from whence the <hi>French</hi> Bombarded <hi>Bruſſells</hi> in the Year 1695, becauſe of the weakneſs of the Ground to defend it; but as we were incamp'd,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95917:47"/>
we could hinder them from coming near enough to do any dammage to the Town.</p>
               <p>All the Foot being got through <hi>Bruſſells</hi> about five or ſix in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, it began to incamp according as we have now deſcrib'd it, and the King and Prince took their Quarters in the Fauxbourg of <hi>Cockelbergh</hi> juſt without the <hi>Flanders-porte;</hi> But the Cavalry did not come into their ground till 'twas in the Night, all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe incamping upon the right near the Village of <hi>Laacken,</hi> except the Brigades of <hi>Dompré</hi> and <hi>Chauviré</hi> under the Command of Major-General <hi>Hubert,</hi> which interlin'd with the Body of Foot upon the Left of <hi>Ingoldesby</hi>'s and <hi>Belcaſtel</hi>'s Brigades behind the Village of <hi>Ganſhoren,</hi> the moſt open paſſage to our Camp upon the Right being hereabouts; Prince <hi>Cerclas</hi> of <hi>Tilly</hi> incamp'd upon the left with the <hi>Liege</hi> Horſe and Dragoons, but all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cavalry march'd through <hi>Bruſſells</hi> by the <hi>Scarbeck-porte</hi> and incamp'd on the other ſide of the Canal, with the Right at <hi>Ever,</hi> where General <hi>Auer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querque</hi> was Quarter'd, and the Left at <hi>Diegom</hi> upon the way to <hi>Louvain,</hi> except the Dragoons of <hi>Tiviot, Roſſe</hi> and <hi>Jedborough</hi> which were poſted between <hi>Vilvorde</hi> and the <hi>Burnt-bridge</hi> upon the Canal of <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Eppinger</hi> and <hi>Lloyd</hi> which were mix'd with the Foot at the Camp of <hi>Cockelbergh: Anhalt</hi>'s Brigade being compos'd of the three Battallions of <hi>Anhalt, Scheltinga</hi> and <hi>Slabendorf</hi> lately come to <hi>Bruſſells</hi> from the Siege of <hi>Ath,</hi> and the two Battallions of <hi>Els</hi> and <hi>Eſſen</hi> detach'd from our Army, incamp'd on the other ſide of <hi>Bruſſells</hi> before the Fort of <hi>Monterey:</hi> This was the ſtate of our Army about the Town at our firſt coming to this Camp, where we were very conveniently poſted to expect the <hi>French,</hi> if they would have attack'd us, and no ſtronger camp could have been found out to cover the Town and ſecure our ſelves at once; but becauſe we were likely to have to do with two powerful Armies joyn'd together, and that too much care could not be taken for our Safety, eſpecially at our firſt coming, that we had not as yet thoſe conſiderable reinforcements, which joyn'd us ſoon after from <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> therefore as ſoon as the Army began to incamp, fifty men out of each Battallion were commanded to work that very Night, being about 3400 men, at a Retrenchment upon the Left of the Village of <hi>Berchom</hi> where was an open ground about a quarter of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile over, that joyn'd to the Height of <hi>Dilbeck</hi> and commanded this part of our Camp, and was the weakeſt poſt we had to defend, and the moſt dangerous inlet

into our Camp in caſe of an attack, and therefore ſpecial care was taken to Fortiſie immediately this Avenue; My Lord <hi>Cutts</hi> was then Major of the day, and was, by the King's order, upon the work all Night to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it by his Care and Preſence; and by the next Morning it was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably advanc'd and in a ſtate not to be eaſily carried by an Enemy. This Retrenchment was a <hi>Redan</hi> or work of Salliant Angles with a large <hi>Foſſè</hi> and cover'd way, the Glacis of which was ſenc'd with an outer Ditch, being ſtuck all over at the bottom with ſhort Paliſſades, or ſharp wooden Spikes, having their points upwards to hinder the Enemy from getting into it.</p>
               <p>As His Majeſty's Army came to this Camp the 13th, that of the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> was at the ſame time upon the march from <hi>Stein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi> towards <hi>Noſtredame de Halle,</hi> where he incamp'd this Evening with his Right at <hi>Lembeck</hi> upon the <hi>Senne,</hi> and his Left at the Brook of <hi>Pepinghen</hi> towards St. <hi>Quintin-Linneck,</hi> the Head-quarter being at St. <hi>Arnelle</hi> in the Rear, upon the way that goes from <hi>Halle</hi> to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hien;</hi> as ſoon as the Mareſchal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> was come up to this Camp he immediately detach'd the <hi>Chevalier de Neſle</hi> with 150 Horſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Anderlecht</hi> to get intelligence of our motions, and whether our Army was yet got to this ſide of <hi>Bruſſells;</hi> the Chevalier <hi>de Neſle</hi> advanc'd with his Party almoſt as far as <hi>Dilbeck</hi> this Night, and met hereabouts, upon the way to <hi>Halle,</hi> with a Party of 30 <hi>Liege</hi> Horſe commanded by a Cornet, which Monſieur <hi>de Sainfal,</hi> a reform'd Captain in the <hi>French</hi> Life Guards, attack'd with a Squadron of 50 and defeated him, killing four upon the ſpot, and took eleven Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners with fifteen Horſes: 'Twas by the meeting and defeat of this Party that the Chevalier <hi>de Neſle</hi> was inform'd of all our Armies being incamp'd on this ſide of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> between the <hi>Flanders-porte</hi> and the Canal: But the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> who had march'd through the Wood of <hi>Leſſines</hi> on the 12th to incamp between <hi>Caſtergat</hi> and <hi>Gamerage,</hi> was forc'd to halt the next day, the Weather having been ſo very bad the 11th and 12th, and the ways grown ſo difficult, that his Artillery and Wheel Baggage could not come up to march the 13th, being to paſs through the deſiles of the Wood of <hi>Leſſines;</hi> but on the 14th this Army march'd and came to incamp with the Right beyond <hi>Goick</hi> towards St. <hi>Quintin-Linneck</hi> within three Quarters of a League of <hi>Bouflers</hi> Left, and the Left towards the <hi>Dender</hi> beyond <hi>Strithem,</hi> the Head-quarter being at this laſt place: And if the <hi>French</hi> had at firſt any deſign upon <hi>Bruſſells</hi> and our Army, it was this halting of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95917:48"/>
                  <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Army that prevented it, and gave us time to Fortifie our Camp before the Town, and receive conſiderable reinforcements; for the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> was not ſtrong enough to pretend to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack us himſelf, and therefore could not march up to us on the 14th before we had ſufficiently Fortified our Camp; and <hi>Villeroy</hi> coming but this day to the Neighbourhood of St. <hi>Quintin-Linneck,</hi> the two Marechals could not joyn together till the 15th, and conſequently could not attack us well till the 16th in the morning, when we could not be in a condition to apprehend their coming; therefore the <hi>French</hi> were oblig'd to think of nothing elſe at preſent but the ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe two great Armies in the Countrey between the <hi>Senne</hi> and the <hi>Dender,</hi> where they reach'd almoſt from the one River to the other, being upwards of three Leagues diſtance; and here I ſhall leave them to return to His Majeſties Camp near <hi>Bruſſells.</hi>

               <p>The 14th the King and Prince went out very early to ſee the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment we had work'd upon in the Night, and the avenues to the Height of <hi>Dillebeck,</hi> where, having heard of the defeat of our Party of <hi>Liege</hi> Horſe the overnight ſo near our Camp, all the out-poſts were thereupon order'd to be reinforc'd, in all the Villages before the Camp, as in the Villages of <hi>Berchom, Ganſhoren, Jette</hi> and <hi>Laacken,</hi> and the Abbey of <hi>Dilleghem</hi> and Caſtle of <hi>Riviere;</hi> theſe two laſt places commanding a paſs in the bottom over the Rivulet of <hi>Zellich,</hi> the firſt on one ſide towards <hi>Wemmel,</hi> and the laſt on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards <hi>Bruſſells;</hi> a Field Officer with two or 300 men was poſted in the Abbey before our Right, and in the Villages of <hi>Dilbeck</hi> and <hi>Anderlecht</hi> before our Left; and that the Retrenchment, we were working upon ſince the overnight to ſtop up the paſſage into our Camp from the Height of <hi>Dillebeck,</hi> might be finiſh'd with all Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, 30 Men more were commanded out of every Battallion (being now between five and 6000 perſons) to work upon it, and His Majeſty, in his Riding out this morning, ſaw the Marechal of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fler</hi>'s Army incamp'd at <hi>Halle.</hi> In the Evening Lieutenant General <hi>Ohr</hi> (having receiv'd an Expreſs from His Majeſty at <hi>Tirlemont</hi> the 12th at Night to come and joyn him here) paſs'd through the Town of <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> and incamp'd in the firſt Line upon the Left of all (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Flanders-porte,</hi> his Left being upon the way that goes from the Fauxbourg of <hi>Cockelberg</hi> to <hi>Anderlecht)</hi> with 8 Battallions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe of <hi>Ohr, Witgenſtein, Wey, Dedem,</hi> and <hi>Heydemale</hi> of the Troops of <hi>Hanover,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Tozen, Ranſaw,</hi> and <hi>La Motthe</hi>

The 17th the Retrenchment to ſtop the paſſage into our Camp from the Height of <hi>Dillebeck,</hi> being very near finiſh'd, and being thus pretty ſecure on this (though the moſt dangerous) ſide, the Army work'd at a General Retrenchment from the Height of the Village of <hi>Berchom</hi> to the Canal at <hi>Laacken,</hi> taking in the little plains between <hi>Berchom</hi> and <hi>Ganſhoren, Ganſhoren</hi> and <hi>Jette,</hi> and <hi>Jette</hi> and <hi>Laacken,</hi> which quite ſhut up our Camp and render'd it not onely inacceſſible to the <hi>French</hi> with the many defilés and difficult paſſages before us, but likewiſe kept the Soldiers in it, out of which they could not eaſily ſtir to <hi>Marode</hi> or Deſert, and this (may be) was the thing chiefly deſign'd in the making of it; for it is hardly probable, that the <hi>French</hi> would have come to attack us, though we had not made this Retrenchment, conſidering the difficulty of the avenues into our Camp every way, and the great Army we were now going to have by the joyning of the <hi>Rhine</hi> Troops.

               <p>The ſame day that we begun to work at this Line being the 19th, two Battallions of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> came up to the Camp from <hi>Germany</hi> and took their Poſt upon the Left of the Second Line near the <hi>Flanders porte:</hi> The <hi>Heſſe</hi> Troops Commanded by Velt-Marſhal Count <hi>de Lippe</hi> came up to <hi>Diegom,</hi> and the Hereditary Prince of <hi>Heſſe</hi> came to Court to wait upon His Majeſty: The 20th the <hi>Heſſe</hi> Troops march'd through <hi>Bruſſells</hi> to incamp without <hi>Halle porte</hi> before the Fort of <hi>Monterey</hi> being compos'd of Four Battallions, <hi>viz.</hi> one of the Life Regiment, one of Grenadiers, and two of <hi>Blixen-croon,</hi> and the Regiments of Horſe of <hi>Spiegel</hi> and <hi>Garſtenbroeck,</hi> and thoſe of Dragoons of the Prince of <hi>Hombourg</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> making together Eight Squadrons; ſo that we had now a reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 18 Battallions and 26 Squadrons from the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and Five Battallions from <hi>England,</hi> which were ſoon follow'd by Three more, and Three Battallions of the Garriſon of <hi>Ath,</hi> being in all 29 Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions, which having left no detach'd Companies, but being full Regiments, may be reckon'd at 600 men one with another, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all to 17400 Foot; and 2900 Horſe and Dragoons, all which

together made 20300 men; Add this to the Sum of His Majeſties and the Elector's Armies, and it made the Allies about 125000 ſtrong in the Field now in <hi>Flanders,</hi> out of which our Army about <hi>Bruſſells</hi> conſiſted of no leſs than 99 Battallions and 175 Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons, being ſo poſted that they in a manner inveſted the Town: The Main of the Army incamp'd between the <hi>Senne</hi> and the <hi>Canal,</hi> Eight Battallions of <hi>Heſſe</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> and Five of <hi>Anhalt</hi>'s Brigade, and 26 Squadrons of <hi>German</hi> Horſe and Dragoons were on the other ſide of the <hi>Senne</hi> upon the Height before the Fort of <hi>Monterey</hi> under the Command of Velt-Marechal General Count <hi>de Lippe,</hi> where they made a very good Line to cover the Town on that ſide, almoſt in the ſame place with the Retrenchment as Prince <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demont</hi> made in the Year 1695; General <hi>Auerquerque</hi> incamp'd with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cavalry and Dragoons at <hi>Ever</hi> and <hi>Diegom</hi> on that ſide of <hi>Bruſſells</hi> which is towards <hi>Malines</hi> and <hi>Lonvain;</hi> the Wood of <hi>Sogne</hi> cover'd the reſt: By this diſpoſition, if the Marechal of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flers</hi> had paſs'd the <hi>Senne</hi> with his Army from the Camp of <hi>Halle</hi> to march towards <hi>Genap</hi> and <hi>Nivelle,</hi> we had all the Troops incamp'd at <hi>Diegom</hi> and without the Fort of <hi>Monterey</hi> to joyn in one march about <hi>Wavre;</hi> the firſt by <hi>Neer-Iſche</hi> and the ſecond through the <hi>Bois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de-Sogne,</hi> which together would have made above 100 Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons, and 13 Battallions which could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably reinforc'd with Infantry from the Garriſon of <hi>Namur</hi> and the Army at <hi>Cockelberg,</hi> and thus the next day we could have ſecur'd the Camp of <hi>Maſy</hi> and cover'd this Important Place; for it was the opinion of ſome People that the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> (after the <hi>French</hi> had wedg'd our Army between the <hi>Senne</hi> and the <hi>Canal</hi> at <hi>Bruſſells)</hi> would have march'd towards <hi>Namur</hi> to get between this Place and the Allies; but, as His Majeſty had diſpos'd his Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> we could reach the Camp of <hi>Maſy</hi> as ſoon as <hi>Bouflers</hi> could come to the Plain of <hi>Fleury,</hi> and thus cover at once both <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi> and <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> the firſt againſt the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers,</hi> and the ſecond againſt that of <hi>Villeroy;</hi> and indeed (as I have ſaid it before) if the Allies had had all the Troops in the Field in the beginning of the Campagne which they had now, 'tis a queſtion whether the <hi>French</hi> could have Beſieg'd even <hi>Ath</hi> it ſelf, notwithſtanding their 150000 Men.</p>
               <p>The Marquis <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> who had march'd from <hi>Montroyal</hi> with his flying Camp towards the <hi>Low-Countreys</hi> on the 31th. of <hi>May,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:95917:51"/>
to obſerve the motions of the Troops which the Allies expected there from the <hi>Rhine,</hi> paſs'd the <hi>Meuſe</hi> at <hi>Givet</hi> the 15th of <hi>June</hi> about the ſame time that the <hi>German</hi> Reinforcement was getting up to our Camp about <hi>Bruſſells;</hi> the 16th he march'd to <hi>Phillipville</hi> from whence he was to paſs the <hi>Sambre</hi> and joyn the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers;</hi> who as well as the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> was now at a ſtand upon the Meaſures that had been taken by His Majeſty in bringing off his Army with ſo much expedition, and poſting of it ſo ſtrongly and conveniently about <hi>Bruſſells;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> ſeem'd at preſent to have no other deſign with theſe two Armies but to Forrage and waſte all the Countrey along the <hi>Dender</hi> and between the <hi>Scheld</hi> and the Canal of <hi>Bruſſells.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Marechal of <hi>Catinat,</hi> we have left him incamp'd at <hi>Lignes,</hi> where he came with his Army after the Siege of <hi>Ath,</hi> (and that he had repair'd the Breaches and levell'd the Line of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation) on the 9th Inſtant, in order to march into <hi>Flanders:</hi> The 12th this Army advanc'd towards the <hi>Scheld</hi> and came to incamp along the <hi>Ronne</hi> between <hi>Anvain</hi> and <hi>Cordes,</hi> the Marechal of <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat</hi>'s Quarter being in the laſt of theſe places. The 13th he march'd to come up cloſe to the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and the Head Quarter was at <hi>Herines;</hi> all the Artillery and heavy Baggage was order'd to paſs the <hi>Scheld</hi> this very Evening, at the Bridge of Boats made ſince the Campagne between <hi>Pottes</hi> and <hi>Canaffe,</hi> and the Army paſs'd the River the next day upon this, and another Bridge made for this occaſion with Boats that were ſent from <hi>Doway</hi> after the Siege of <hi>Ath</hi> for the uſe of this Army, which incamp'd this day about half way between the <hi>Lys</hi> and the <hi>Scheld.</hi> The 15th the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> march'd on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Lys,</hi> and came to incamp at <hi>Vive St. Eloy,</hi> where he was joyn'd the ſame day by the Forces that had been poſted within the Lines of <hi>Courtray</hi> under the Command of Monſieur <hi>de Montrevel,</hi> and this Army, according to the <hi>French</hi> accounts, conſiſted of 52 Battallions and 69 Squadrons; but the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> having ſent back all the Reinforcements he had from the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Ath,</hi> the moſt that he could have at the repaſſing of the <hi>Scheld</hi> muſt be but 25 Battallions, and when joyn'd by <hi>Montrevel</hi> his Army could not well exceed Forty; but whatever his Strength was at preſent, he ventur'd to march with it cloſe to the Elector's Army, and came the 17th to incamp between <hi>Cruy's houtem</hi> and the <hi>Lys,</hi> within a League and a half of <hi>Deinſe,</hi> his Right being at
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95917:51"/>
                  <hi>Nackeren</hi> and Left at <hi>Zulte</hi> upon this River, where the General Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was; ſo near the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> incamp'd now to the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> only the <hi>Lys</hi> remain'd between them.</p>
               <p>This March of the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> ſo near to <hi>Deinſe</hi> oblig'd the Elector to look about him, and this made his Electoral Highneſs call a Council of War upon theſe Motions of the <hi>French</hi> towards him, to conſult what was to be done in the preſent Conjuncture; his Army conſiſted of about 43 Battallions including the Brigades of <hi>Holſtein-Norburg</hi> and <hi>Ranſaw</hi> that were incampd upon the Right of all between <hi>Landeghem</hi> and <hi>Ansbeck</hi> and eighty five or ſix Squadrons; Four Battallions had been detach d under Baron <hi>Sparre,</hi> ſince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back of the Army from <hi>Brabant</hi> to <hi>Audenarde;</hi> three at <hi>Dender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and in the <hi>Pays de Waes,</hi> and two behind the Canal of <hi>Bruges</hi> which made the remainder 43 Battallions; the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi>'s true ſtrength was not at firſt known, ſome made him ſtronger than he was and others weaker which accordingly caus'd a variety of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and the Elector ſent Monſieur <hi>Verboom</hi> his Quarter-Maſter General, to the King to give His Majeſty an account of it, and it was reſolv'd in the mean time to fortifie the Bridge of <hi>Deinſe</hi> at <hi>Peteghem</hi> and to have a very ſtrong Guard there, being the next Poſt to the Marechal of <hi>Catinat,</hi> and to lay Bridges over the Canal, one at <hi>Ansbeck</hi> and another lower at <hi>Dorme</hi> either to receive Reinforcements that way if <hi>Catinat</hi> came to attack the Elector, or to be ready to march behind the Canal if <hi>Catinat</hi> ſhould march towards <hi>Bruges</hi> or <hi>Newport.</hi> In the midſt of theſe Doubts the Elector had Advice that the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi>'s Army at his coming to <hi>Zulte,</hi> had but four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Battallions in the firſt Line and fewer in the ſecond, and that he was but weak in Horſe and Dragoons; this made His Highneſs very deſirous to pay a Viſit with his Army to the Marechal of <hi>Catinat,</hi> but he had a mind firſt to know the Truth of the Matter, for though the Camp was very ſtrong where <hi>Catinat</hi> was poſted, yet it could hardly be imagin'd that he would have ventur'd ſo near the Elector with ſo inconſiderable an Army: The Elector therefore ſent that very Night to <hi>Newport</hi> for Major General <hi>Fagel,</hi> and order'd the three Battallions of <hi>Lorne, Buchan</hi> and St. <hi>Amand</hi> that were about <hi>Bruges,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Reinard</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> behind the Canal, to come up and joyn together at <hi>Bellem</hi> to be there in a readineſs to reinforce the Army upon occaſion. The 18th in the Afternoon His Highneſs went with a ſtrong Eſcorte as far as the Wind-mill of <hi>Oſſelghem,</hi> from whence
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95917:52"/>
he might diſcover the whole Line of <hi>Catinat</hi>'s Army, and in the Evening Major General <hi>Fagel</hi> came to the Camp. The 19th at Night the Elector had advice that the <hi>French</hi> had laid Bridges over the <hi>Lys</hi> near <hi>Zulte,</hi> with a Deſign to Forrage the next day about <hi>Wacken</hi> and the <hi>Mandel,</hi> on this ſide of the River; wherefore His Highneſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that a ſtrong Detachment of Horſe, Foot and Dragoons ſhould immediately be ſent that very Night with Cannon to diſturb this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and accordingly 8000 Horſe, Foot and Dragoons with eight Pieces of Cannon were order'd for this Command, and ſtood paraded at the Head of the Camp till Ten or Eleven of the Clock the next Morning, to hear of the Enemies paſſing of the <hi>Lys;</hi> but the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> having advice of our Preparations to attack his Forragers order'd the Bridges over the <hi>Lys</hi> to be taken up again, and laid this Deſign aſide, of which the Elector being inform'd, this great Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was countermanded. Major General <hi>Fagel</hi> went back the over-night to <hi>Newport</hi> and the five Regiments of Foot at <hi>Bellem</hi> were ſent again to their former Poſts. The 20th a great Detachment of 1500 Horſe was commanded away towards <hi>Bruges</hi> for a feint to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Deſign which the Elector ſeem'd to have ſtill of marching up to the Marechal of <hi>Catinat,</hi> for at the ſame time he order'd Bridges to be laid over the <hi>Lys</hi> between <hi>Deinſe</hi> and <hi>Bachtem,</hi> and the 21th the Brigades of <hi>Ranſaw</hi> and <hi>Holſtein-Norbourg</hi> were order'd to come and incamp cloſe upon the Elector's Right between <hi>Nevel</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deghem,</hi> whereas before they were poſted near the Canal of <hi>Bruges</hi> between <hi>Landeghem</hi> and <hi>Ansbeck.</hi> But on the 22th at night the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> march'd off privately with his Army from <hi>Zulte</hi> to get back towards the Lines and incamp'd with his Right near <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray,</hi> and his Left towards <hi>Harlebeck;</hi> it was generally ſuppos'd then, that theſe Preparations of the Elector's oblig'd <hi>Catinat</hi> to withdraw ſo ſuddenly and with ſo much Secrecy into the Lines. But 'tis more probable that this Retreat of <hi>Catinat</hi>'s was upon <hi>Montrevel</hi>'s going with the Body under his command, to poſt himſelf near <hi>Grammont</hi> upon the <hi>Dender;</hi> where his Troops were order'd, to cover the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys that come by Water from <hi>Tournay</hi> to <hi>Pottes</hi> and <hi>Canaffe,</hi> and thence by Land to <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Army. and the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> could not pretend to keep in this Camp of <hi>Zulte</hi> without that Re-inforcement which <hi>Montrevel</hi> commanded. Thus I ſhall leave the Army in <hi>Flanders</hi> to go back to His Majeſty's Camp near <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and ſpeak of the Tranſactions that happen'd there, of which ſome were of great Importance and cannot well be omitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:95917:52"/>
At His Majeſty's firſt coming to this Camp to cover <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the Army had abundance of Forrage, of which there was a great Plenty all about it; and moſt laid in Forrage at the firſt coming to this Ground for a Fortnight at leaſt without going far for it; but this being the only Camp the main of the Army had for all the reſt of the Campagne, and <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Bouſlers</hi> being Maſters of all the Country about <hi>Aloſt,</hi> and between the <hi>Scheld</hi> and the Canal, it is no wonder if there was at laſt a very great Scarceneſs of Forrage here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. The firſt General Forrage which the Army made was not till the 20th being about <hi>Grimberg</hi> and the outſide of the Canal, to get as much as poſſibly we could all before us, about <hi>Aſch, Zellich, Wemmel</hi> and <hi>Grimberg,</hi> which was now reckon'd but as ſo much taken from the <hi>French.</hi> But I ſhall ſay no more of theſe Affairs, which make the ordinary and daily Tranſactions of Armies, to ſpeak of things of more moment and which had a nearer Relation to the Happy Concluſion of this Campagne in Peace.</p>
               <p>The 22th Penſionary <hi>Heinſius</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> who had lately been nam'd by the States General for their third Plenipotentiary at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences for the Treaty of Peace at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> in the room of the Sieur <hi>Boreel</hi> lately deceas'd, came to the Camp to wait upon His Majeſty; and this Voyage, which could not be but about Affairs of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, occaſiond abundance of Diſcourſes ſome tending to War and others to Peace: For Buſineſs went on a little ſlowly at this time in the Congreſs at <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> ſome time had been taken up at firſt in adjuſting of the Ceremonial, which had been agreed upon at laſt and not long ſince, wherein it was concluded that in relation to Viſits, and paying of the firſt Viſit and the receiving of it, the Plenipotentiary Ambaſſadours of Crown'd Heads that had come firſt to the <hi>Hague</hi> or <hi>Delft</hi> for the Congreſs of <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> ſhould pay the firſt Viſit to the laſt Comers, without inferring from thence any Conſequence about Precedency, or derogating in any manner from any one's Privileges or Pretentions about it; and according to this Regulation Count <hi>de Caunitz</hi> and Count <hi>Straatman</hi> that had come to the <hi>Hague</hi> before the <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries arriv'd at <hi>Delft,</hi> went to pay them the firſt Viſit at their own Houſes, and afterwards the <hi>French</hi> Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries return'd the ſame Complement to the Counts of <hi>Caunitz</hi> and <hi>Straatman</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and paid at the ſame time the firſt Viſit to the Baron of <hi>Zeilern</hi> the third Imperial Plenipotentiary, being come into <hi>Holland</hi> after them; and the ſame Method was obſerv'd in the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95917:53"/>
Viſits of the reſt. After the adjuſting of the Ceremonial, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours were requir'd by the Mediator to give in their Project of a General Peace with the Allies, in purſuance of the Overtures already made in the Preliminaries, and ſo to enter upon more Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Buſineſs than had hitherto been handled in the Congreſs: The <hi>French,</hi> on their ſide, were delaying to give it in, putting of it off from Congreſs day to Congreſs day, which made People generally believe they had firſt a mind to know the Iſſue of three great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings which <hi>France</hi> had now in hand, and of which News were daily expected with a great deal of Impatience on all ſides, to model their Project accordingly; and that was, firſt Monſieur <hi>de Pointy</hi>'s Expedition in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> againſt the <hi>Galleons,</hi> having ſail'd from <hi>Breſt</hi> the beginning of <hi>January</hi> laſt, with a Squadron of about twelve Men of War, having Troops and Tranſport-Ships along with him and other Neceſſaries for a Landing, not without giving us ſome Jealouſie in <hi>England</hi> at firſt, eſpecially for <hi>Ireland:</hi> The ſecond was the Election of <hi>Poland,</hi> for which the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> ſtood Candidate, and was now ſo fair for the carrying of it, that the Election of Marechal of the Dyet met at <hi>Warſaw</hi> to chuſe a King, was carry'd by the <hi>French</hi> Party, which ſhew'd but too much the Superiority of it againſt any other Pretenders, which gave them very great Hopes on that ſide. The third was the Siege of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> form'd by the Duke of <hi>Vendome,</hi> General of the <hi>French</hi> Army in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> ſince the beginning of this Month, and which was now carrying on with a great deal of Vigour.</p>
               <p>Several People thought that Penſionary <hi>Heinſius</hi>'s Journey to the Camp was concerning the Retardments which the <hi>French</hi> made in giving in their Project, and to concert thereupon ſome Methods of carrying on the War with more Vigour than we had done hitherto, and oblige the <hi>French</hi> not to be ſo backward in giving reaſonable Terms for a General Peace as they were reported to be at preſent; others imagin'd that it regarded the Forwarding of the Negociations at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> where there ſeem'd to be a certain Slowneſs among ſome of the Allies and eſpecially the Imperialiſts: Theſe were the publick Diſcourſes about this Journey, but one may rather imagine from what follow'd, that it was to make way for the Conferences that happen'd few days after between the Earl of <hi>Portland</hi> and the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers;</hi> and that, may be, the <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries had made ſome Overtures about it to thoſe of the <hi>States,</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> King's order, becauſe His Majeſty
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95917:53"/>
being not yet acknowledged by the <hi>French</hi> as King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> there could be no Conferences in the Congreſs between the Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries of <hi>England</hi> and thoſe of <hi>France:</hi> But whatever was the occaſion of Penſionary <hi>Heinſius</hi> his coming to the Camp, theſe were only Conjectures, and I do not pretend to dive farther into the Matter.</p>
               <p>The 24th Prince <hi>Cerclas</hi> of <hi>Tilly</hi> was commanded with the <hi>Liege</hi> Horſe and Dragoons and the <hi>German</hi> Cavalry lately come from the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to march towards <hi>Namur,</hi> where he incamp'd at <hi>Maſy;</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Horſe was under the Command of Major General <hi>Bulau,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Tilly</hi> was joyn'd in this Camp by two Battallions of the <hi>Liege</hi> Troops, the reſt being to follow upon occaſion; for we were ſtrong enough without them at preſent, and the ſending of them that way ſpar'd ſo much the more Forrage about <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where the Army was like to continue long enough to want it; and beſides, the Marquis <hi>de Harcourt</hi> was marching back to repaſs the <hi>Sambre,</hi> in order to incamp at <hi>Boſſu</hi> upon this River with the Forces he had brought from the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> where at his coming he receiv'd ſix Field pieces from <hi>Philipville;</hi> and though <hi>Harcourt</hi> was poſted here upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count but for the Security of Convoys from the <hi>Meuſe</hi> to the <hi>Sambre</hi> againſt the Garriſon of <hi>Namur,</hi> and thence to be ſent to <hi>Mons</hi> for the uſe of the Armies, yet it was neceſſary to have a proportionable Body near <hi>Namur</hi> to obſerve him, eſpecially now that the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> was incamp'd conveniently enough to march that way as ſoon as the Allies.</p>
               <p>The 25th Penſionary <hi>Heinſius</hi> went back for <hi>Holland,</hi> and in the Evening at the Orders His Majeſty was pleas'd to declare the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Prince of <hi>Heſſe</hi> Major General of his Forces. The 26th the Princeſs of <hi>Vaudemont</hi> attended with moſt of the chief Ladies of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> came in the Evening to ſee the Camp, going at the Head of the Line with a Train of about a dozen Coaches with ſix Horſes; the Electrice was near her Time and could not go abroad. The 27th the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Army came to Forrage about <hi>Zellich,</hi> and his Out guards advanc'd pretty near our Camp, which gave us the Allarm; His Majeſty immediately rid out, being follow'd by the Prince, to obſerve the Motions of the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Haxhauſen</hi>'s Brigade of <hi>Danes,</hi> incamp'd upon the Height between <hi>Ganſhoren</hi> and <hi>Berchom,</hi> was order'd to march with the Dragoons we had in the Camp on this ſide of <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> all the Cavalry receiv'd Orders to mount on
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95917:54"/>
Horſe-back, and <hi>Belcaſtel</hi>'s Brigade at <hi>Laacken</hi> took Arms. About thirty Squadrons of Horſe were commanded to attend His Majeſty, who rid to the Height on the other ſide of the Abbey of <hi>Dilleghem,</hi> and it being found that the <hi>French</hi> had no other Deſign but to Forrage between <hi>Zellich</hi> and <hi>Aſch,</hi> it was not thought expedient to attempt any thing which might have ingag'd us in a General Battle without our Retrenchments, but only to watch and obſerve their Motions, and His Majeſty came back to the Camp. The 29th the Dragoons of <hi>Tiviot, Roſſe</hi> and <hi>Jedborough</hi> which, at our firſt coming to this Ground, had been poſted at the <hi>Burnt-bridge</hi> upon the Canal, receiv'd Orders to march and joyn the Main Body of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons incamp'd at <hi>Diegom</hi> under General <hi>Auerquerque;</hi> and <hi>Scheltinga</hi>'s Regiment of <hi>Anhalt</hi>'s Brigade was commanded in their place to cover the Canal from thence to <hi>Willebrook,</hi> as Colonel <hi>Murray</hi>'s did on the other hand to <hi>Vilvorde</hi> and the <hi>Fort des trois Trous.</hi> The ſame day was the firſt Interview between the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> and My Lord <hi>Portland</hi> in the open Field on this ſide of <hi>Halle;</hi> the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> had ſent a Trumpet into our Camp to attend his Lordſhip, who went in his Coach without any other Eſcorte, and the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> who was come to the place of Rendezvous with ſome Squadrons of Horſe, order'd them all back to his Camp, when he ſaw My Lord come without any Guard, and only the Trumpet that he had ſent, with him, but the General Officers that attended him remain'd: After great Civilities on both ſides they withdrew apart to enter upon Buſineſs, and My Lord <hi>Portland</hi> came back into our Camp in the Evening; notwithſtanding that his Lordſhip went this firſt time very privately, yet it was the publick Diſcourſe of the Camp the next day, and the Opinions were divided about the Buſineſs, ſome conjecturing one thing and ſome another, but moſt agreed that this Conference had more Relation to the Affairs of Peace than War. The 30th the King went to Dine in the Abbey of <hi>Dilleghem,</hi> which is very pleaſantly ſituated about two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> in the way to <hi>Wemmel,</hi> and was now almoſt a Mile in the Front of our Camp; it is of the Order of St. <hi>Norbert</hi> or <hi>Premontré,</hi> and ſtands upon an eaſie Aſcent of a Hill with fine Walks and Woods, Gardens and Fiſh ponds about it. Colonel <hi>Webb</hi>'s and Colonel <hi>Walter Collier</hi>'s Regiments were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd out to cover the Abbey, and a Detachment of 200 Men of the Guards were ſent here to do Duty about His Majeſty's Perſon; the King's Kitchin and Furniture had been ſent in the Morning, and the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95917:54"/>
Army (that was now full of the News of yeſterdays Conference) would have it, that the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> met the King in this place; but the King found his Quarter at <hi>Cockelberg</hi> too cloſe, being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron'd with the Camp on one ſide and the Town on the other, and His Majeſty had once a mind to remove his Quarters to this place to have a better and a freer Air, but it was too far out of our Camp, and too much expos'd, to hazard His Majeſty's Perſon there, and that Deſign was given over: In the Evening the King rid the <hi>Tour</hi> in his Coach about the chief Streets of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> according to the Cuſtom of the Nobility in theſe Countries, and the next day His Majeſty went to the Opera; this gave very good hopes to thoſe that were Well-wiſhers for Peace, to ſee the King mind ſome Divertiſements in the midſt of a Campagne.</p>
               <p>The firſt of <hi>July</hi> His Majeſty had by an Expreſs from the <hi>Hague,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">July.</note> the News of the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s being choſen King of <hi>Poland</hi> in the Dyet at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> which came by a Courier at the <hi>Hague</hi> to the Sieur <hi>Boſen</hi> the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s Plenipotentiary at the Congreſs for the Peace, and which he communicated immediately to all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Allies, who went to Complement him upon this occaſion; the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> had not publickly appear'd as a Candidate till the Meeting of the Dyet, and that the <hi>French</hi> Party had carried their Point in the Election of a Marechal; and the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> and the Prince Royal eldeſt Son to the late King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſeem'd to be the only Competitors that ſtood fair for the Crown; as for the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> he was not yet talk'd of, and his Deſign ſeem'd hitherto to continue in the Emperor's Service and command his Armies in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> the Campagne following; but when the <hi>French</hi> Party appear'd ſo great at the Meeting of the Dyet, none but ſo Powerful a Prince as the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who could offer ſuch great Advantages to the <hi>Poles,</hi> and make them Powerful by the joyning of thoſe Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and the Electorate of <hi>Saxony</hi> under one Head, as they are in Situation, and recovering thereby the Ancient Limits of that Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> by the Siege of <hi>Caminieck;</hi> I ſay none but ſo Powerful a Prince that could bring ſuch Advantages along with him to the <hi>Poles,</hi> could then fruſtrate the Deſigns of the <hi>French</hi> Party and oppoſe the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi>'s Election: Colonel <hi>Fleming</hi> was ſent to the Dyet as the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s Ambaſſador, who declar'd his Maſter one of the Candidates and made very great Offers to the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95917:55"/>
Republick, and indeed greater than any one of the other Candidates could do; he was ſoon countenanc'd by the Imperial Party, and that the Religion which the Elector had hitherto profeſs'd might be no Obſtacle to his Election, he produc'd a Certificate of His Highneſſes Abjuration of the Proteſtant Religion, and of having receiv'd the Sacraments of Confeſſion and Communion ſome time before from the Duke of <hi>Saxen-Zeits</hi> his Kinſman Biſhop of <hi>Raab,</hi> ſign'd by the ſaid Biſhop; and the Pope's Nuncio atteſted the Truth and Validity of the Certificate as knowing the Hand of the ſaid Biſhop; <note n="*" place="margin">The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of <hi>Saxony</hi> were the firſt that receiv'd <hi>Luther</hi>'s Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and it cannot be believ'd that the Pope's Nuncio would have made that ſtep if the Pope had been ſo Neutral in that Affair before the Election as he pretends to be ſince. The Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> march'd at the ſame time with all the Forces he had in his Country being about 8000 Men into <hi>Sileſia</hi> and came to <hi>Breſlaw</hi> upon the Frontier of <hi>Poland,</hi> to be as near <hi>Cracaw</hi> as he could to back his Pretentions: When the day of the Election came, the Standards of the Prince Royal's Party appear'd in the Field as if they were ſtill reſolv'd to ſtand by him; and <hi>Saxony</hi>'s and his being then divided, the Majority appear'd on the <hi>French</hi> ſide, which made the Cardinal Primate, without any farther Poling, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> the very firſt day of the Meeting for the Election; the Prince Royal's Party ſeeing that it was in vain to ſtruggle for him any farther, and that if they did, the <hi>French</hi> muſt carry the Election, joyn'd that of the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> which now made them much Superior to the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi>'s Faction, and thereupon the Biſhop of <hi>Cujavia</hi> proclaim'd the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> in the Field, and Sung <hi>Te Deum</hi> for it in the great Church of <hi>Warſaw,</hi> which the Elector's Party had ſhut up againſt the Cardinal Primate, who therefore Sung it in the Field; and thus it came to a double Election, about which I ſhall ſay no more, than that this Crown will in all likelihood be us'd hereafter as a Bait to bring the moſt Powerful Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> over to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thus at length ruin the Proteſtant Intereſt in the Empire, where we ſee it daily grow weaker and weaker: There is yet another Method of the Pope's to undermine the Proteſtant Religion in <hi>Germany,</hi> which 'tis not unfit to mention upon this occaſion, and that is the alluring of the Younger Brothers among the Proteſtant Princes who are but Poor, with Money and Preferments to profeſs the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion; and if the Elder Branches fail, <hi>Rome</hi> gets this Advantage, that they have a Proſpect of ſucceeding. This is ſufficient to ſhew that, next under
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95917:55"/>
God, the Welfare of the Proteſtant Intereſt does depend from the Good Union of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> and the Northern Crowns, not only to Support it abroad, but even to keep it up in their own Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: This Good Union and Correſpondence is moſt eſpecially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary between the two former, and the Enemies of our Religion can hardly compaſs their Deſigns but in ſetting us together by the Ears, in which ('tis to be fear'd) they meet but with too much Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the People on both ſides.</p>
               <p>The Second, The Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> ſent a Trumpet to the Prince of <hi>Vaudemont</hi> to notifie to him, that a Courier had paſs'd through the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi>'s Army the day before, going to the <hi>French</hi> King with an Account of the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi>'s Election to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> and that he had been proclaim'd King by the Cardinal Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate before the Courier came away from <hi>Warſaw:</hi> The ſame day all our Artillery was drawn off from the Batteries upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment, and paraded upon the Height near the Wind-mill of <hi>Ganſhoren,</hi> the Poſt where it had been before at our firſt coming to this Camp; it was at firſt ſuppos'd that this bringing of the Artillery together was for a <hi>Feu de joye</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s Election to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> but it was brought from thence to incamp in the Rear of the Second Line two or three days after. The Fourth in the Evening, all the Artillery in the Marechals of <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Boufler</hi>'s Armies being drawn up together in a Line upon a Height between them both toward <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> it was thrice fir'd, with as many rounds of Small-ſhot in both Armies, for the News of the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi>'s Election to be King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the ſame thing was done in all the other Armies of <hi>France</hi> by the King's Order. The Fifth, My Lord <hi>Portland</hi> went to the ſecond Conference with the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> privately as before, and it was held in the ſame place in the open Field; ſeveral General Officers and others waited upon the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> to the place of Conference, and the Marechal told My Lord <hi>Portland,</hi> that if his Lordſhip would come attended with the Generals and other principal Officers of our Army, they ſhould be very Welcome: Orders were given this Evening for all the Horſes to Graze in the day-time, thereby to ſpare Forrage, which began now to grow very ſcarce about our Army; The Horſes belonging to the Infantry graz'd accordingly the next day before our Camp, towards <hi>Zellich, Releghem</hi> and <hi>Wemmel,</hi> having a good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to cover them; of which the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> having
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95917:56"/>
Intelligence, he came with about 30 Squadrons to diſturb them, and all our Graziers were forc'd to come back into the Camp without any conſiderable Loſs; but upon firſt notice on our ſide, the Earl of <hi>Athlone</hi> was commanded out with about 20 Squadrons of Horſe with orders not to ingage himſelf in any Action, only to obſerve the <hi>French</hi> and ſhelter the Retreat of our Graziers: Several Squadrons of the <hi>French</hi> Horſe and ours came very near one another and drew up in Oppoſition, a deep hollow way remaining between them, and fac'd one another for a while, the Trumpets and Kettle-drums making a very good Entertainment at the ſame time on both ſides, without any Diſturbance; but at laſt one of our Troopers, or ſome body elſe, fir'd a Shot or two from behind a Hedge, which alarm'd the <hi>French,</hi> and ſome of them fir'd again, and kill'd two of our Troopers, which broke up this kind of an Interview; the <hi>French</hi> drew off and went their way, and ſo did we.</p>
               <p>The Tenth was held the third Conference between My Lord <hi>Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> in the open Field as before, My Lord went attended this time by about twenty Perſons of note from our Camp, among whom were the Earl of <hi>Rivers</hi> Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> His Majeſty's Envoy at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and Treaſurer of the Army, and Mr. <hi>Stepney</hi> the King's Envoy to ſeveral Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> lately arriv'd from thence, and ſeveral others: The Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> receiv'd them very kindly being preſented to him by My Lord <hi>Portland,</hi> and deſir'd the Dukes of <hi>Roquelaure, Luxembourg</hi> and <hi>Guiche-Grammont</hi> to entertain them in Converſation whilſt he and My Lord ſhould go aſide to talk of Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries gave in at laſt their Project of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace with the Allies this day; the Affairs of <hi>Poland</hi> had not ſucceeded according to the Deſires and Expectations of the <hi>French</hi> Court, Monſieur <hi>de Pointy</hi>'s Expedition had produc'd nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able but the Sacking of <hi>Carthagena</hi> and the <hi>Galleons</hi> were ſafe; but <hi>Pointy</hi> himſelf ſeem'd not to be ſo now, and the <hi>French</hi> were very apprehenſive of his meeting with Admiral <hi>Nevil,</hi> that had been ſent from <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> with a ſtrong Squadron to obſerve him, and there were ſeveral Reports at preſent in <hi>Europe</hi> which were not at all favourable to <hi>Pointy,</hi> and the Parties concern'd were very much afraid that they ſhould have no great Share in the Booty made at <hi>Carthagena;</hi> and though <hi>Pointy</hi> ſhould eſcape <hi>Nevil</hi> yet he had
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95917:56"/>
another Risk to run, and that was his getting into <hi>Breſl:</hi> As for the Siege of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> this place was very obſtinately defended by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had all the Forces they were Maſters of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> concern'd in the Defence by a Communication between the Town and the Army by the Fort of <hi>Monjouy,</hi> and which within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out amounted to about 17000 Men; whereas the <hi>French</hi> were not above 27 or 28000 ſtrong, and too weak to take up the Poſts all about the Town, but were forc'd to leave the Quarter of <hi>Monjouy</hi> open, which ſerv'd for a Communication between the Beſieged and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army without, where they had not then above ſix or ſeven thouſand Men commanded by the Vice roy of <hi>Catalonia;</hi> this made the Siege of <hi>Barcelona</hi> doubtful, and there was no likelihood of taking the place as yet: The <hi>French</hi> did not therefore think it convenient to delay the giving in of their Project any longer, and it was deliver'd in this day in Congreſs to the Mediator, conſiſting of three Heads (according to the Tenour of the full Powers which the <hi>French</hi> Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries had of Treating with the Emperor and Empire, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the States General and their Allies) and 37 Articles. The <hi>French</hi> King by this Project offer'd chiefly (in relation to the Empire) either to reſtore <hi>Strasbourg</hi> in the Condition it was when taken, or to give in exchange all the places he had in <hi>Briſgow</hi> and <hi>Alſatia</hi> on the right ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as <hi>Briſack, Fribourg,</hi> &amp;c. and the Fort of <hi>Kell</hi> on the ſame ſide of the <hi>Rhine</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Strasbourg;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to reſtore <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> and all other places taken in the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate or elſewhere in the Empire ſince the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen;</hi> and in caſe the Emperor and Empire accepted of the Equivalent for <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> that then the <hi>Rhine</hi> ſhould ſerve as a common Limit to <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France</hi> all above <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> and thereupon that the Emperor and Empire ſhould have no Forts nor Fortifications from thence upon the left ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> nor the <hi>French</hi> upon the right ſide of it; according to which Propoſitions if agreed to, the New Town of <hi>Briſack</hi> on the left ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the Bridge of <hi>Philips<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> and the Work that covers it on the ſame ſide, were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd by the <hi>French,</hi> in delivering of thoſe places up to the Empire; and the <hi>French</hi> retaining <hi>Strasbourg</hi> and <hi>Fort-Louis</hi> were to demoliſh all the Forts upon the Iſlands of the <hi>Rhine</hi> in both theſe places, and the Works upon the right ſide of the <hi>Rhine</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Fort-Louis;</hi> but the Fortifications on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> were to be deliver'd up to the Empire as part of the Equivalent
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95917:57"/>
for this Town: The <hi>French</hi> King offer'd likewiſe to reſtore the Dutchy of <hi>Lorraine</hi> (notwithſtanding the Pretenſions he had by vertue of the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen)</hi> in the State and Condition that <hi>Charles</hi> the 4th enjoy'd it in the Year 1670, juſt before it was ſeiz'd by the <hi>French;</hi> only he reſerv'd to himſelf the Sovereign Property and Poſſeſſion of the Town of <hi>Saar-Louis</hi> and a Territory of half a League about that place, for which the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> ſhould have an Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſomewhere elſe, in which he ſhould have a Soveraign Property and Juriſdiction himſelf. The Subſtance of this Project in relation to <hi>Spain</hi> was, to reſtore firſt, all that had been taken either in <hi>Flanders</hi> or <hi>Catalonia</hi> ſince the War to His Catholick Majeſty. 2ly, The Town of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> taken ſince the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> or elſe to give an Equivalent for it; which Equivalent was left in Blank in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but was given out by Reports to be <hi>Maubeuge</hi> upon the <hi>Sambre, Condé</hi> upon the <hi>Scheld; Menin</hi> upon the <hi>Lys,</hi> and the Town and Chatellenie of <hi>Ipres.</hi> 3ly, To revoke all the Re-unions made ſince the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> which by vertue of this Treaty were to be reſtor'd: And laſtly, To give back the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Dinant</hi> in the Condition they were when taken. As for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to <hi>Holland</hi> in this Project, it does not belong to the Affairs of War hereabouts, and therefore I ſhall not take notice of it; only I ſhall add, that the Peace made between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> in the Year 1696, was to be comprehended in the General Treaty, and by the 35th Article all thoſe that ſhould be nam'd on both ſides by common Conſent, either before the Ratification or within ſix Months after; which was the only one that could be interpreted to have any relation to <hi>England;</hi> and may be, My Lord <hi>Portland</hi>'s Conferences with the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> were about this Project in relation to <hi>England,</hi> which (by reaſon the <hi>French</hi> had not yet acknowledg'd His Majeſty) could not be inſerted in the General one we are now mentioning; And laſtly, The <hi>French</hi> allow'd the Allies to conſider of this Project, till the 20th day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following Old Stile, after which if they did not conſent to it before or upon the ſaid day, they pretended to be at liberty of altering the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and making new Offers; But if the Treaty were concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>France</hi> and the Allies, that then the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and any other King's, Princes and Republicks might give their Guarranty for the Faithful Execution and Obſervation of the ſame.</p>

But to return from the Congreſs to the Camp; the 13th the King, having review'd the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe and Dragoons and the <hi>German</hi> Troops ſome time before at <hi>Diegom,</hi> began the Review of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry this day, and the five eldeſt Brigades, being thoſe of the Guards, <hi>Haro, Orkney, Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Ingoldesby,</hi> drew out in the little plain without the Retrenchment between <hi>Ganſhoren</hi> and <hi>Jette</hi> to paſs before His Majeſty, the General Officers ſaluting at their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Poſts; the 14th the Regiments of Foot of <hi>Selwyn, Trelawny</hi> and <hi>Erle,</hi> having Landed lately at <hi>Willemſtadt</hi> from <hi>Edgland,</hi> came up to the Camp, where they were poſted in a third Line in the Rear of <hi>Orkeney</hi>'s Brigade; the Duke of St <hi>Albans</hi> and Major General <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart,</hi> that had paſs'd along with them, came ſome days before to Court.

and the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> Camp form'd an Elbow here upon the Left facing toward <hi>Dendermond,</hi> as <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s did at <hi>Aſche</hi> and <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vord</hi> to face towards <hi>Halle</hi> and <hi>Bruſſells:</hi> The <hi>French</hi> loſt 40 or 50 Horſes this day, and had ſeveral Priſoners taken by ſome of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſent out from the Regiments, which had been commanded behind the Canal to cover it upon this march of the Enemies, who were now incamp'd within two Leagues almoſt in a parallel with it.</p>
               <p>This near Neighbourhood of the <hi>French</hi> to the Canal and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> oblig'd us equally to look to ſecurity of the Countreys co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by them, and to prevent their paſſing of either; and according to the ſituation of Places and the Poſitions of our Camps, the Canal ſeem'd to be deſign'd for the Care of our <hi>Brabant</hi> Army, and the <hi>Scheld</hi> for that of <hi>Flanders;</hi> wherefore His Majeſty upon the firſt News of <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s and <hi>Bouflers</hi> marching to come nearer the Canal, order'd <hi>Belcaſtel</hi>'s and <hi>Oxenſtern</hi>'s Brigades (making eleven Battalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to march on the 18th and incamp between the <hi>Burnt-bridge</hi> and <hi>Willebrook,</hi> where they were to be joyn'd by Colonel <hi>Murray</hi>'s and <hi>Scheltinga</hi>'s Regiments already poſted upon the Canal; my Lord <hi>Tiviot</hi> Major General was commanded the ſame way with five Regiments of Dragoons, being thoſe <hi>Tiviot, Eſſex, Roſſe, Jed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> and <hi>Mirmont;</hi> and all theſe Regiments together, Foot and Dragoons, made about 9000 Men under the command of Count <hi>de Noyelles</hi> Lieutenant General: Upon this removal of <hi>Oxenſtern</hi>'s and <hi>Belcaſtel</hi>'s Brigades to march behind the Canal, that of <hi>Selwyn</hi> was order'd to incamp at <hi>Laacken</hi> in <hi>Belcaſtel</hi>'s place; <hi>Anhalt</hi>'s Brigade incamp'd before the Fort of <hi>Monterey,</hi> march'd through the Town upon this, to incamp at <hi>Cockelbergh</hi> and fill up the Room of <hi>Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi>'s; and the Brigade of Horſe of <hi>Ooſt-friſe</hi> incamp'd before the Fort of <hi>Monterey,</hi> in lieu of that of Foot of <hi>Anhalt;</hi> Infantry being more neceſſary in our Camp, as we were now intrench'd, than Horſe.</p>
               <p>As for the Elector, he had been forc'd to leave the Camp of <hi>Nevel</hi> ſince the 11th to come to <hi>Ghendt</hi> for his Health, being very much troubled with ſore Eyes; but his Army had a little more plenty of Forrage, that Corn being now ripe, which was not good for Horſe when it was Green. The 17th the Elector receiv'd an Expreſs from His Majeſty to give him notice that the Marechals of <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Bouflers</hi> were to march the next day towards the Canal of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:95917:59"/>
                  <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and the <hi>Scheld;</hi> and therefore that it would be neceſſary for His Electoral Highneſs to ſend twenty Battallions and all the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons of his Army to incamp about <hi>Dendermond,</hi> there to oppoſe the Paſſage of the <hi>Scheld</hi> by the <hi>French;</hi> and all his Cavalry under the Cannon of <hi>Audenarde,</hi> to incamp on the <hi>Brabant</hi> ſide of the <hi>Scheld</hi> and diſturb the Enemies Convoys, who after the next March would be far from their Frontier Garriſons, and therefore very much incommoded by them, and that the reſt of his Army ſhould get behind the Canal between <hi>Ghendt</hi> and <hi>Bruges:</hi> Orders were likewiſe ſent by the Elector to the Governour of <hi>Dendermond</hi> to let the Waters out to overflow the Country about this Town, which for this reaſon is ſtrongly ſituated at the Confluence of the <hi>Scheld</hi> and the <hi>Dender,</hi> having abundance of Water at command by the Tides coming up the <hi>Scheld</hi> beyond it, and the lowneſs of the Country on both ſides eſpecially at the mouth of the <hi>Dender;</hi> ſo that with the Sluces they have at <hi>Dendermond</hi> they can drown all the flat Country about it and render it inacceſſible. The Elector who was now at <hi>Ghendt</hi> (as I have juſt now ſaid) repair'd back to the Camp the ſame day, upon the firſt News of the Motions of the <hi>French,</hi> to regulate the Marches and Operations of the Army upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture.</p>
               <p>The 18th General <hi>Heyden</hi> march'd by the Elector's Orders with all the <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Foot being 18 Battallions (which, with the two Battallions of the Electoral Prince of <hi>Bavaria</hi> already behind the <hi>Scheld,</hi> made 20, the Number thought convenient by His Majeſty) two Regiments of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Dragoons, and three Squadrons of Horſe of the ſame Nation, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Regiment of Dragoons of <hi>Holſtein-Ploen</hi> towards <hi>Dendermond</hi> for the Defence of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> where General <hi>Heyden</hi> incamp'd this day at <hi>Grimberg Opſandt</hi> near that Town; the two Brigades of <hi>Ranſaw</hi> and <hi>Holſtein-Norbourg</hi> that had incamp'd all this while apart upon the Right about <hi>Landeghem</hi> were order'd to come and incamp in the Line in the place of the <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Foot, and <hi>Fagel</hi>'s Regiment was detach'd to cover the Canal of <hi>Bruges:</hi> The ſame day the Elector had Advice that the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> was march'd with the remainder of his Army <hi>(Montrevel</hi> being at <hi>Grammont)</hi> behind the Lines from <hi>Harlebeck.</hi> The 19th the Elector left the Army of a ſudden to go to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the Command of the Army remain'd to the Prince of <hi>Naſſau-Sarbruck,</hi> who on the 20th receiv'd Advice that the Marechal of

                  <hi>Catinat</hi> was march'd from the Lines to paſs the <hi>Scheld,</hi> of which he ſent an Expreſs to Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> being now ſo near <hi>Dendermond</hi> and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> had very much alarm'd the Inhabitants of the <hi>Pays de Waes</hi> who ſent to the Prince of <hi>Naſſau</hi> to deſire his ſpecial Protection, and to take care for the Defence of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> where the Troops already poſted about <hi>Dendermond</hi> did not ſeem ſufficient; therefore the Prince of <hi>Naſſau</hi> ſent the 21th twelve pieces of Cannon, with Powder, Ball and other Neceſſaries to incamp on the other ſide of <hi>Ghendt</hi> at <hi>Diſtelberg,</hi> there to be ready to joyn General <hi>Heyden</hi> upon occaſion; and the 23th the Prince himſelf left the Camp of <hi>Oydonck</hi> and <hi>Nevel,</hi> being attended by Major General <hi>Saliſch</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Holſtein-Norbourg</hi> Brigadier, with the Troop of the <hi>Friſeland</hi> Guards, the Regiment of Horſe of <hi>Naſſau-Sarbruck,</hi> and ſix Battallions, being thoſe of <hi>Naſſau</hi> Walloon, <hi>Holſtein-Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, Lochman, Dona, Harſolt</hi> and <hi>Willekens,</hi> and twelve pieces of Cannon with the Kettle-drum; with which he march'd through <hi>Ghendt</hi> to get behind the <hi>Scheld</hi> for the further Security of it at this time, and incamp'd with his Right at <hi>Huyſen</hi> and Left near <hi>Melle-veer</hi> upon the River, where the twelve pieces of Cannon that had been ſent to <hi>Diſtelberg</hi> came to his Camp and made up his Artillery to conſiſt here of 24 pieces of Cannon: The reſt of the Army which remain'd in the Camp of <hi>Nevel</hi> was under the Command of Count <hi>d'Arco</hi> General of the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> and Lieutenant General <hi>Opdam</hi> of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The 24th, the Prince of <hi>Naſſau</hi> went to viſit all the Poſts along the <hi>Scheld,</hi> between <hi>Calcken</hi> and <hi>Melle-veer,</hi> and he order'd the Dragoons of <hi>Holſtein-Ploen</hi> that had march'd with General <hi>Heyden</hi> to come back to his Camp at <hi>Huyſen.</hi> The 25th both the Troops of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> began to work upon ſome Retrenchments for the Defence of the moſt dangerous Paſſages of the <hi>Scheld;</hi> and the 26th General <hi>Heyden</hi> and Major General <hi>Saliſch</hi> went to view the ſeveral Poſts upon it between <hi>Calcken</hi> and <hi>Dendermond;</hi> for below <hi>Dendermond</hi> there was no great Danger, the <hi>Scheld</hi> being very large and a great Tide coming up, which render'd it very difficult for an Enemy to make Bridges over if there were any manner of Force to oppoſe them; and therefore the <hi>French</hi> could not pretend to attempt the paſſage of this River but between <hi>Dendermond</hi> and <hi>Ghendt,</hi> and conſequently if they had ſuch a Deſign, they muſt have paſs'd the <hi>Dender</hi> (as they were now incamp'd) between <hi>Aloſt</hi> and <hi>Dendermond</hi> to come near this part of the <hi>Scheld.</hi> The 27th a Diſpoſition was
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95917:60"/>
made for the Troops to incamp along the <hi>Scheld</hi> for the Defence of the moſt dangerous paſſages of it, in the manner following; over againſt <hi>Baſſerode</hi> below <hi>Dendermond</hi> one Battallion, at <hi>Dendermond</hi> one Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallion, at <hi>Appels-veer</hi> one Battallion, upon <hi>Berleer</hi> Heath nine Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions, and the Dragoons of <hi>Marwitz,</hi> the Horſe-Grenadiers, the Grand-Muſqueteers and the <hi>Gens d'Armes</hi> with General <hi>Heyden:</hi> At <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tberg</hi> the Dragoons of his Electoral Highneſs and three Battallions, and over againſt <hi>Schellebeck</hi> three Battallions more, all theſe made the Troops of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> commanded by General <hi>Heyden.</hi> The two Battallions of the Electoral Prince of <hi>Bavaria</hi> were poſted at <hi>Witteren,</hi> where they were to be joyn'd by three more of the ſame Nation now expected daily from the <hi>Rhine:</hi> The reſt of the Poſts along the <hi>Scheld</hi> towards <hi>Ghendt</hi> were taken up by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Troops which came with the Prince of <hi>Naſſau-Sarbruck,</hi> who during the Elector's abſence, did now command the Army in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Method taken for the guard of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> did not expreſs any Deſign that way, they ſeem'd only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with ſubſiſting of their Army in this Country, which was now open to them (as they were incamp'd) to the very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the <hi>Scheld</hi> and the <hi>Rupelle</hi> within two Leagues and little more of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where they found abundance of all manner of Forrage, no Armies having incamp'd all this War thereabouts to deſtroy it, or to diſcourage the Boors from Tilling of the Ground, or frighten them out of the Country; but if the <hi>French</hi> were ſo conveniently incamp'd for Forrage, they ſuffer'd for it another way by the Difficulties they muſt meet with to get Proviſions into their Camp, at ſuch a diſtance from the Frontier Towns: <hi>Ath</hi> being newly taken, they could have no great Magazines there, and therefore they were forc'd to have their Bread and Proviſions from <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Tournay,</hi> which places were far diſtant from them: To level theſe Difficulties as much as was poſſible, Monſieur <hi>de Courtebonne</hi> was detach'd with ten Battallions and twelve Squadrons from <hi>Bouflers</hi> Army to go and incamp near <hi>Mons</hi> for the Communication of that place with the Army; Monſieur <hi>de Montrevel</hi> was already incamp'd at <hi>Grammont</hi> (as we have ſaid before) to cover the Convoys from the <hi>Scheld</hi> to <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Camp upon his advancing to St. <hi>Quintin-Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neck:</hi> But now the Convoys from <hi>Mons</hi> to the Armies being very difficult, becauſe it lay ſo remote and all Land-carriage, and ſome thing expos'd to our Army at <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> and therefore that moſt of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95917:60"/>
Bread and Proviſions muſt come from <hi>Tournay</hi> and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> for which <hi>Montrevels</hi> little Body at <hi>Grammont</hi> was not ſufficient to furniſh ſo many Eſcortes, for this reaſon the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> march'd from within the Lines of <hi>Courtray,</hi> to poſt himſelf at <hi>Helchin</hi> upon the <hi>Scheld</hi> for the ſecurity of Convoys by Water from <hi>Tournay</hi> to <hi>Renay,</hi> and thence by Land to <hi>Grammont;</hi> whence, being Eſcorted by Detachments from <hi>Montrevels</hi> Army, they were ſent by the <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to <hi>Aloſt</hi> for the uſe of the Army, where the <hi>French</hi> had now ſeveral Battallions in Garriſon; and there were Diſcourſes at firſt that they had a deſign not onely to Fortifie this plaee, but alſo <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nove</hi> and <hi>Grammont,</hi> thereby to be Maſters of the <hi>Dender</hi> as far as <hi>Dendermond</hi> it ſelf; but as it has appear'd, their Garriſon in <hi>Aloſt</hi> was onely for the preſent occaſion. <hi>Catinat</hi> being oblig'd to leave the Lines and poſt himſelf upon the <hi>Scheld</hi> for the Security of Convoys to the two Armies beyond <hi>Aloſt,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de la Mothe,</hi> who commanded a Body of Eleven Battallions and Six Squadrons between <hi>Ipres</hi> and <hi>Furnes,</hi> march'd to poſt himſelf within the Lines between <hi>Ipres</hi> and <hi>Comines</hi> upon the <hi>Lys</hi> and obſerve the Troops we had left at <hi>Nevei;</hi> And moſt of the <hi>French</hi> Troops being now near the <hi>Scheld,</hi> Major General <hi>Fagel</hi> who Commanded a ſmall Camp about <hi>Newport,</hi> ſent ſeveral Regiments to poſt themſelves about <hi>Bruges</hi> there to be ready to march towards <hi>Dendermond</hi> if the Marechals of <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Bouflers</hi> offer'd to paſs the <hi>Dender,</hi> and endeavour to force the <hi>Scheld:</hi> The <hi>French,</hi> however, thought of nothing elſe at preſent but deſtroying the Forrage in this plentiful Countrey, and as ſoon as they came to incamp hereabouts, the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> went to view with a ſtrong Eſcorte, all the Countrey to the very confluence of the <hi>Rupelle</hi> and the <hi>Scheld</hi> over againſt <hi>Rupelmonde,</hi> where the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> have a little Fort call'd the Fort of Ste <hi>Marguerite,</hi> and a ſmall Garriſon in it; this gave the Allarm as far as <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and fearing that the <hi>French</hi> might ſeize this Fort, which would cut off the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between <hi>Bruſſells</hi> and <hi>Antwerp,</hi> a Reinforcement of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> was ſent from the Citadel by the Governour of <hi>Antwerp</hi> for the ſecurity of the place; but the <hi>French</hi> made no attempt againſt it, onely they ſent parties ſometimes upon the Banks of the <hi>Rupelle,</hi> which fir'd once or twice upon the Barge or Veſſel that carries Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers every day between <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Willebrook,</hi> where the paſſage to and from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> is by the Canal in a <hi>Track-Schout</hi> or Barge that goes 'twice every four and twenty Hours; And thus I come inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

to His Majeſty's Camp near this Place, and therefore to ſpeak of our Affairs on this ſide.</p>
               <p>We have left the King reviewing of the Infantry of his Army Brigade by Brigade, and taking care for the ſafety of the Canal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the late Motions of the <hi>French,</hi> with ſome thoughts at the ſame time of leaving the Army and going ſhortly to <hi>Loo.</hi> On the 20th the King continued to review ſeveral Regiments of Foot, and <hi>Lucq</hi>'s Brigade and the <hi>German</hi> Foot in the <hi>States</hi> Service review'd before His Majeſty this day; afterwards the King ſaw my Lord <hi>Albemarle</hi>'s Carabiniers and <hi>Dopft</hi>'s Dragoons exerciſe, which they did with a great deal of Dexterity and order; My Lord of <hi>Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle</hi> was ſent this day by His Majeſty to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and the Fourth Troop of Guards march'd out of the Camp to poſt it ſelf in <hi>Relays</hi> for the Guard of His Majeſty's Perſon between <hi>Breda</hi> and <hi>Loo:</hi> In the Evening the Elector, who had left the Camp of <hi>Nevel</hi> the day before, and lay the ſame Night at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> came to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> and after having paid a Viſit to the Electrice, he went to wait upon His Majeſty at his Quarter at <hi>Cockelberg.</hi> The 21th the King went to take his Leave of the Electrice and of the Princeſs of <hi>Vaudemont;</hi> 22th the King review'd <hi>Haxhawſen</hi>'s Brigade of <hi>Danes,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> and Major General Count <hi>d' Alfeldt</hi> ſaluted at the head of it. The 23d my Lord <hi>Portland</hi> had the Fifth Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> about half way between the two Camps, but the King being to leave the Army the next morning, my Lord had not much Company with him; the Chief of our Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that attended him were Major General <hi>Collier,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> my Lord <hi>Raby</hi> and Brigadier <hi>Ingoldesby, &amp;c.</hi> as for the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> he had much the ſame attendance as before. We had a great many of our <hi>Maroders</hi> out of our Army this day, which were met by the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> a great way out towards the <hi>French</hi> Camp, he advis'd them to go back or elſe that they were in danger of being taken Priſoners, but our Soldiers told him <hi>that a Peace was made, and that there was no great danger of it;</hi> this anſwer made him ſmile, and he was ſo Civil as to get this Officers to command them back to our Camp: In the Evening His Majeſty was pleas'd to declare Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier <hi>Dompré</hi> of the <hi>Dutc-</hi>Horſe, Major General of the <hi>States</hi> Forces; and the Elector was late with the King this Night, but came again very early the next Morning to ſee His Majeſty go away for <hi>Holland,</hi> moſt of the Cheif Officers of the Army came to Court
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95917:61"/>
at the ſame time: His Majeſty left the Army about ſeven or eight this Morning being the 24th, the Elector took his leave at the Kings Quarter and went back to <hi>Bruſſeſts,</hi> and the King went on to paſs the Canal at <hi>Vilvorde</hi> and go from thence by <hi>Malines</hi> to <hi>Breda,</hi> Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> went as far as <hi>Vilvorde</hi> in His Majeſty's Coach, where he took his leave of the King and then came back to the Camp to command the Army in Chief, and the Duke of St. <hi>Albans</hi> and my Lord <hi>Portland</hi> accompanied His Majeſty in the Coach to <hi>Breda;</hi> whence his Lordſhip went the next day for the <hi>Hague</hi> to conferr with our Ambaſſadours and the Chief of the Allies touching his Negotiations with the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers;</hi> but the King went to <hi>Dieren,</hi> where His Majeſty tarried ſeveral days, and thence to <hi>Loo,</hi> there to take the Divertiſements of the Seaſon.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> being now Commander in Chief of our Army in <hi>Brabant,</hi> review'd <hi>Haxhauſen</hi>'s Brigade of <hi>Danes</hi> and Brigadier <hi>Muitland</hi>'s Regiment on the 27th. becauſe he had been indiſpos'd when they review'd before the King. The Electrice of <hi>Bavaria</hi> was brought to bed this Afternoon of a Prince, and in the Night all the Artillery was fir'd thrice round the Ramparts, and there were abundance of Fire-works and great Illuminations in Town upon this occaſion: <hi>Eppingers</hi> and <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s Dragoons which had hitherto kept with the Camp at <hi>Cockelberg,</hi> were commanded this day to march behind the Canal and incamp with the reſt of the Dragoons under the Command of Lieutenant General <hi>de Noyelles.</hi> The 28th the Army Forag'd beyond <hi>Malines</hi> and <hi>Louvain</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Dyle,</hi> Count <hi>d'Alfeldt</hi> Commanded the Eſcorte which was order'd to take two days Bread, becauſe the Army could not Forage ſo far and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the 29th. This ſcarcity of Forrage was very troubleſom to the Army, and the Prince, to make it ſubſiſt as eaſie as 'twas poſſible, in a Camp which we could not abandon, order'd all the Horſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Infantry, with all the Artillery Horſes, and thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Bread-Waggons to be ſent to Graze in the Meadows along the <hi>Rupelle</hi> and the <hi>Dyle</hi> about <hi>Malines,</hi> and detachments were made at the ſame time from the Army, being a weekly Command under a Field Officer, to cover them; one for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and another for the <hi>Duteh:</hi> There were yet two or three Forage dayes about our Camp which were reſerv'd for the Horſe, but the Chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Colonels of the Foot, and others that were oblig'd to have Horſes in the Camp had orders on the 31th to ſend for dry Forage

from the Magazines of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> for which they were to pay nine Stivers a Ration; This day in the Evening the Elector, being attended with his Court, came to ſee the Camp, and rid along both the Lines, and went to ſee the Retrenchments we had made both for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the Camp and to cover the Town; but the King keeping ſtill his Quarter at <hi>Cockelberg,</hi> where moſt part of his Camp-Baggage was left, and a Guard mounting daily upon it (His Majeſty being reſolv'd to come back again, if the <hi>French</hi> did attempt any thing during the remainder of the Campagne) the Elector therefore thought it fit to go back again and command the Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the Deſign that had been agreed upon at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> of advancing with the ſaid Army as far as <hi>Rouſſelar,</hi> where it could now ſubſiſt conveniently for Forrage; which the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> could not hinder, whilſt the Marechals of <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Bouflers</hi> were incamp'd ſo near the Canal of <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and ſo far remov'd from their Frontier. For the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> could not pretend to paſs the <hi>Lys</hi> and diſpute this Camp with the Elector, unleſs he was reinforc'd by <hi>Montrevel</hi>'s Troops incamp'd at <hi>Grammont,</hi> in which caſe the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chals of <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Bouflers</hi> could not ſubſiſt where they were, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making great Detachments from their Armies to <hi>Grammont</hi> and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> to make good their Communication with their Frontier, and ſecure their Convoys, which otherwiſe could not come to their Camps without very great Difficulties, the Garriſon of <hi>Audenarde</hi> laying unluckily in the way to cut them off; then, if the Marechals of <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Bouflers</hi> made ſuch Detachments, the Prince could ſend proportionable Detachments from his Army to guard the <hi>Scheld;</hi> or if the joyn'd Marechals did ſend any greater Reinforcements to the Marechal of <hi>Catinat,</hi> then Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> could (by ſlipping of Troops from his Army behind the Canal and ſo to the <hi>Scheld)</hi> defend the <hi>Pays de Waes</hi> himſelf, and General <hi>Heyden</hi> could have march'd from thence to joyn and reinforce the Elector at <hi>Rouſſelar:</hi> But if only <hi>Montrevel</hi> joyn'd the Marechal of <hi>Catinat,</hi> and <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Bouflers</hi> made no other Detachments from their Armies but for the Poſt of <hi>Grammont</hi> to ſeoure their Convoys, it would be ſufficient for the Prince to ſend a Brigade of Foot and two Regiments of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons to guard the <hi>Scheld</hi> below <hi>Dendermond,</hi> whilſt General <hi>Heyden</hi> ſhould provide for the Defence of it above between <hi>Dendermond</hi> and <hi>Ghendt;</hi> where the paſſage of this River is moſt practicable, but was at preſent in no great danger whilſt the <hi>French</hi> were on the

The Fourth, The Elector's Army having incamp'd at <hi>Thilt</hi> and <hi>Denterghem</hi> the day before, march'd to joyn together at <hi>Rouſſelar;</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Bavarians</hi> from <hi>Thilt</hi> by <hi>Pettem, Ardoye,</hi> and <hi>Baveren,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourghers</hi> from <hi>Denterghem</hi> by <hi>Mulenbeck, Ingelmonſter</hi> and <hi>Emel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,</hi> and ſo incamp'd all together in a Line of Battle with the Right at St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Chappel between <hi>Rouſſelar</hi> and <hi>Hooghleede,</hi> and the Left near the Bridge upon the High-way from <hi>Rouſſelar</hi> to <hi>Caecktem;</hi> the Elector came this day to the Camp from <hi>Ghendt,</hi> a good Eſcorte being left by the Army to attend His Highneſs along the way, and both the Elector and Prince of <hi>Naſſau-Sarbruck</hi> had their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Town of <hi>Rouſſelar:</hi> This Army conſiſted at preſent of 29 or 30 Battallions, 18 having been left behind the <hi>Scheld,</hi> two upon the Canal of <hi>Bruges,</hi> (being thoſe of <hi>Fagel</hi> and <hi>Reinard)</hi> four ſent to <hi>Audenarde,</hi> and one left in <hi>Dendermond.</hi> The Marechal of <hi>Catinat,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it was to obſerve the Motions of our Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> left <hi>Helchin</hi> upon the <hi>Scheld</hi> on the Seventh, and not being able to hinder the Elector from taking the Camp of <hi>Rouſſelar,</hi> he came on the Fourth to poſt himſelf behind the <hi>Lys,</hi> the Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Menin</hi> and <hi>Comines,</hi> and the Horſe at <hi>Courtray</hi> to Forrage without the Lines: And the Fifth, Monſieur <hi>Montrevel</hi> detach'd eleven Battallions and a Regiment of Dragoons of his Body at <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> to poſt themſelves at <hi>Helchin,</hi> there to be in a readineſs to joyn <hi>Catinat</hi> upon occaſion, and the Brigade of <hi>Mouroux</hi> from <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s

Army, and another from <hi>Bouflers,</hi> were commanded to reinforce <hi>Montrevel,</hi> and make up the Number he had ſent to <hi>Helchin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince, being oblig'd on his ſide to provide at preſent for the Safety of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and the Reinforcing of General <hi>Heyden</hi> upon occaſion, commanded on the third Major General <hi>Stewart</hi> to march with <hi>Tiffin</hi>'s Brigade (except <hi>Saunderſon</hi>'s Regiment) by the Canal to <hi>Willobrook</hi> and ſo to <hi>Rupelmonde,</hi> where he was to paſs the <hi>Scheld,</hi> in order to poſt himſelf in the <hi>Pays de Waes,</hi> being to be reinforc'd in his March by <hi>Eppinger</hi>'s and <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s Dragoons. The Fourth, Major General <hi>Stewart</hi> came with the ſaid Forces into the Neighbourhood of <hi>Dendermond,</hi> where he diſpos'd them Regiment by Regiment to incamp about the Villages near the <hi>Scheld,</hi> his Quarter being at <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lcer;</hi> and the <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Troops remov'd from hence to <hi>Heuſen,</hi> where General <hi>Heyden</hi> incamp'd with the main Body, but the reſt of the <hi>Brandenbourgers</hi> remain'd poſted as before: The ſame day in the Morning was a Rencounter near the Wind mill of <hi>Releghem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Zellich</hi> and <hi>Wemmel,</hi> of a Party of the <hi>French</hi> Life guards and Dragoons, with one of <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe commanded by Colonel <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuin</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein-Pleon</hi>'s Regiment, where the <hi>French</hi> were worſted; the Prince had been inform'd over-night, that the <hi>French</hi> had a Deſign to carry off the next Morning our Patrouille of Horſe, which was ſent daily at break of day from one of our Out-guards to the Wind mill of <hi>Releghem,</hi> whereupon he order'd that very Night a Detachment of 250 Horſe and 50 Dragoons, to be ſent to the Wind-mill of <hi>Releghem</hi> under the Command of Colonel <hi>Balthuin,</hi> there to put himſelf in Ambuſcade and expect the <hi>French,</hi> who accordingly order'd a Squadron of fifty Horſe in the little Plain by the Wind-mill, and poſted himſelf in a Neighbouring Defilé: The <hi>French</hi> made that night a Detachment of fifty Dragoons of Ste <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>'s Regiment under the Command of the Sieur <hi>Sainfal,</hi> and 80 Horſe of the King's Houſe commanded by the Sieur <hi>Philipes.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt of the Guards, all which he divided into three Squadrons, to come and carry off our Patrouille; when, early in the Morning, they came near the Wind-mill, they met with the fifty Horſe and Dragoons we had in the Plain, and <hi>Sainfal,</hi> who commanded the firſt Squadron, charg'd them ſo briskly that they retir'd into the Defilé, where being purſued by the <hi>French, Sainfal</hi> got thus into our Ambuſcade, where both he and the Squadron would have been intirely cut off, had not the Sieur <hi>Philipes</hi> come and reſcu'd them as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95917:64"/>
well as he could, but by his aſſiſtance they got off after a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Loſs; about twenty were killed upon the Spot on both ſides, of which fifteen or ſixteen were <hi>French,</hi> and amongſt them a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Perſon who was buried the next day in the Church of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leghem</hi> with Trumpets and Kettle-drum; on our ſide, the Captain-Lieutenant and Quarter-Maſter of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>'s Regiment, a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Prince <hi>Philip</hi>'s, were wounded and taken Priſoners, and ſix Troopers either kill'd or Priſoners, and two wounded; On the <hi>French</hi> ſide, a Sub-Brigadier of the Life-guards, two Life guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and 12 Dragoons were made Priſoners, and 20 Horſes taken and brought into our Camp: Colonel <hi>Balthuin</hi> having gain'd this Advantage, did not think it convenient to purſue the <hi>French,</hi> for fear of falling into an Ambuſcade himſelf, but retir'd, after this Action, to our Camp.</p>
               <p>At this time, not only Forrage but likewiſe Straw was very ſcarce about <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the Soldiers lay very ill for want of it; on the Fifth, My Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> with the Prince's leave, ſent a Party to the Village of <hi>Mais</hi> to fetch all the Straw that was there, for the uſe of the Guards and Royal Regiment, which was above half way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Camp and ours, but where we had kept a Guard in the <hi>Chaſteau</hi> all this while, the <hi>French</hi> having on their ſide a Safe-guard in the Village; this Detachment was made out of the Guards and the ſaid Regiment, and a Man of a Tent for Straw, who here provided themſelves with it and got back ſafe into the Camp; the Safe-guard was abſent at the firſt coming of our Party, but return'd to his Poſt before they went off, he reported that the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> had review'd his Army that day, and therefore had been oblig'd to go to the Camp and repair to his Company; and, may be, had it not been for that, the bringing off of the Straw from this Village could not have been done without ſome Skirmiſh with the <hi>French.</hi> The Sixth, Colonel <hi>Saunderſon</hi>'s Regiment (the Remainder of <hi>Tiffin</hi>'s Brigade) was order'd to march behind the Canal of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and guard it between the <hi>Burnt-bridge</hi> and the <hi>Fort des Trois Trous</hi> on both ſides of <hi>Vilvorde,</hi> being the Poſt which Colonel <hi>Murray</hi>'s Regiment had before.</p>
               <p>The Ninth in the Evening the two Marechals of <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Bouflers</hi> had <hi>Te Deum</hi> Sung at their Quarters for the taking of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> the Capital City of the Principality of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and afterwards all their Artillery and Small-ſhot was fir'd thrice round, and the ſame thing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95917:64"/>
was done this Evening in the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi>'s Army: This place had been inveſted the Second of <hi>June,</hi> the Trenches open'd the Fifth in the Evening, and after having held a Siege of one and fifty Days from the opening of the Trenches, it began to Parley the 26th of <hi>July,</hi> and a Ceſſation of Arms was agreed upon, but the Beſieged did not conſent to Capitulate till the 27th, under pretext of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring firſt with the Chief Officers of the Town, and the next day, of giving notice to the Vice-roy of <hi>Catalonia</hi> incamp'd ſeven or eight Leagues off, but the <hi>French</hi> allowing no longer term for the Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Hoſtages were exchang'd the 27th in order to Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; yet the Capitulation was not made up and ſign'd till the 31th, becauſe of the great variety of Buſineſs it included, for the Army, Courts of Judicature Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal, Civil Magiſtrates and Burghers, <hi>Barcelona</hi> being the Head Town of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and all this Principality ſurrender'd up to the <hi>French</hi> with it: The Marquis <hi>de Chemerant</hi> Brigadier of the Army brought the Capitulation to the <hi>French</hi> King, who made him a <hi>Marechal de Camp</hi> or Major General for this Service; and by it, the Beſieged were to march out of the Town and the Fort of <hi>Monjouy</hi> (which was deliver'd up with it) on the fifth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to go thence to <hi>Tarragon,</hi> with 30 Pieces of Cannon and ſix Mortars, and to be conducted as far as <hi>Martorel</hi> upon the River of <hi>Lobregat;</hi> a Ceſſation of Arms was likewiſe agreed upon by this Capitulation, between the two Armies till the 22th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> Old Stile, during which time the River <hi>Lobregat</hi> ſhould ſerve as a Barrere for the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> each to keep on their reſpective ſide: But I muſt not forget (whilſt I ſpeak of this Capitulation) to add, That the Article, made by the Beſteged for the Preſervation of the Authority and Privileges of the Inquiſition-Court held in this Town, was rejected by the <hi>French,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this Court laid aſide whilſt <hi>Barcelona</hi> ſhould be in their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, as if 'twas yet a ſeverer Tribunal than the Military Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dragoons. Thus <hi>Barcelona</hi> fell into the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> after a Famons Siege, not ſo much for the Strength of the Place, (for 'tis but weak and ill fortified) as for the Defence that was made in it, the Number of the Beſieged, and that of the Beſiegers: The Beſieged, though the whole Army of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the Communication of the Fort of <hi>Monjouy,</hi> was concern'd in it, got a great deal of Honour in the Defence of a large and weak Town, and vigorouſly preſs'd with Cannon and Bombs; and the Prince of <hi>Heſſe d'Armſtadt</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:95917:65"/>
who was once Colonel of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiment and Brigadier of His Hajeſty's Army, and in a manner train'd in our Service in the War of <hi>Ireland,</hi> had a very great ſhare in the Glory of ſo good a Defence; the <hi>French</hi> on their ſide, with a ſmall Army of about 28000 Men, out brav'd the great Reſiſtance of all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, and carried it, when they did not exceed the Beſieged by above 10 or 11000 Men; which Conſideration muſt help very much to ſet off the Vigour, Boldneſs and Reſolution of the Beſiegers, who ought to have a great deal of Honour allow'd them upon this account: 'Tis true; that they ranſack'd all the Forts and Garriſons in <hi>Languedor</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> whereby they got a Reinforcement of ſix or ſeven thouſand Men to repair their Loſſes, and were by this means almoſt as ſtrong at the end of the Siege as at the beginning of it; but if the number of Burghers that were in <hi>Barcelona,</hi> who no doubt had a hand in the Defence of it, be conſider'd, this will not very much leſſen the Glory of taking of it. I do not know the Situation of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> yet it can hardly be imagin'd, but if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (having no other place to defend to put a ſtop to the Progreſs of the <hi>French</hi> Conqueſts in a Country where they could not ſubſiſt with great Armies) had made by times a good and ſtrong Retrenchment on one ſide of <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona</hi> for to cover their Army, and at the ſame time good Fortifications and Out-works on the other, that if the <hi>French</hi> had beſieg'd it in ſuch a Poſture of Defence, <hi>Barcelona</hi> could have taken by them; and even as <hi>Barcelona</hi> was, if <hi>Spain</hi> had tranſported the Troops they had to ſpare in <hi>Italy</hi> ſince the Peace on that ſide, it would have been an Attempt above their Power: As to this laſt, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſay that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> kept ſtill the Forces on foot he had during the War, and therefore that they could not leave the <hi>Milane's</hi> open and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to an arm'd Neighbour, if it was ſo, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> has done, in that, a ſignal piece of Service to the <hi>French</hi> King; as to the firſt, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretend that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> were to ſend a good Squadron to their Aſſiſtance, and then that <hi>Barcelona</hi> would have been in no Danger; for the <hi>French</hi> Army before this place could not ſubſiſt but by the Communication it had by Sea with <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and the Sea-ports they were Maſters of in <hi>Catalonia;</hi> and if we had ſent a Fleet in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> at that time, the <hi>French</hi> muſt not only have rais'd the Siege, but the Army could not have got off but with very great difficulty: Whatever reaſon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might have to expect a Fleet from <hi>England</hi> and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95917:65"/>
the <hi>States,</hi> yet no Man can ſay that this does excuſe them from acting their part in providing for the Safety of the Place, and putting of it in a good Poſture of Defence, chiefly conſidering that we had already a Squadron of about twenty Men of War in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> to watch <hi>Pointy</hi>'s Motions and protect the <hi>Galleons,</hi> which muſt otherwiſe have fallen into the hands of the <hi>French;</hi> and may be, this was as much as <hi>England</hi> could do at that time, conſidering our late Money Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the great Advantages which the <hi>French</hi> had over the Allies by this great Conqueſt; and that the <hi>French</hi> Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries had given in their Project the Tenth of the foregoing Month in the very middle of this Siege, and that no Relief could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for the Place, but purely from the vigorous Defence of the Beſieged, yet this did not ſeem to haſten the Negociations amongſt them at <hi>Ryſwick:</hi> Copies of this Project had been given to the Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries of the Empire, <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> according to the Tenour of it; and the Project as well as full Powers of the <hi>French,</hi> being directed to treat with the Emperor and Empire, the Empire had therefore in the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> made a Solemn Deputation to treat on the behalf of all the States and Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> King; in which, among the Eccleſiaſtical Electors that of <hi>Mentz,</hi> the Secular, thoſe of <hi>Bavaria, Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg;</hi> and out of the College of Princes, for the Catholicks, the Arch biſhop of <hi>Saltsburg,</hi> the Great Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order, the Biſhops of <hi>Wortzburg, Spire, Conſtance, Hilderſheim, Liege</hi> and <hi>Munſter,</hi> the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria, Palatine</hi> and <hi>Newbourg,</hi> &amp;c. and for the Proteſtants, <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> for the Dutchy of <hi>Magdebourg, Sweden</hi> for the Dutchies of <hi>Bremen</hi> and <hi>Deuxponts, Saxen-Cobourg, Saxen-Gotha, Brandenbourg-Cullenbach, Brunſwick-Zell, Brunſwick-Wolfembuttle, Heſſe-Caſſel, Wirtemberg, Holſtein, Anhalt</hi> and the Counts of <hi>Wetteravia;</hi> out of the Imperial Towns, for the Catholicks, <hi>Cologne</hi> and <hi>Augsburg,</hi> and for the Proteſtants, <hi>Francfort</hi> and <hi>Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> were appointed, by their Plenipotentiaries at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the whole Body of the <hi>German</hi> Empire, and to treat in its Name with the <hi>French</hi> King's Ambaſſadors. Theſe having a Copy of the Project laid before them, gave in their Anſwer to it, wherein they inſiſted upon the full and entire Reſtitution of every thing as it had been eſtabliſh'd in the Treaty of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> reſerving a Power to the Emperour and Empire of keeping a Garriſon in the

Town of <hi>Straisbourg,</hi> for which they could not accept of an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent; neither could they allow the <hi>French</hi> King to keep <hi>Saar-Louis</hi> with the pretended Diſtrict about it in the Dutchy or <hi>Lorrain,</hi> but that the whole muſt be reſtor'd to that Duke: This was the chief Subſtance of their Anſwer, when at this time the <hi>French</hi> were preſſing the Siege of <hi>Barcelona</hi> very hard, that they had taken <hi>Ath</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> was ſtill on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> notwithſtanding the Weakneſs of the <hi>French</hi> that way. This Anſwer ſeem'd to raiſe great Obſtacles to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding of the Treaty, if the Empire would inſiſt upon it to the laſt; and yet notwithſtanding theſe Difficulties, 'twas about this time <note n="*" place="margin">The firſt Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> the Sixth.</note> that they began to treat perſonally at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour's Chamber, whereas hitherto the Conferences had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in Writing by the Mediatour, the Allies and the <hi>French</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their reſpective Apartments.</p>
               <p>The Term given by the <hi>French</hi> in their Project was now drawing near, but in the mean while 'tis fit to ſee what the Armies were doing in the Field: The two <hi>French</hi> Armies commanded by the Marechals of <hi>Villeroy</hi> and <hi>Bouflers,</hi> were now advanc'd a great way from any of their Frontier Towns, which made Convoys tedious, and every thing but Forrage very ſcarce in their Camps; and, had it not been for the Conveniency of Water carriage, from <hi>Tournay</hi> to <hi>Renay</hi> upon the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and from <hi>Grammont</hi> to <hi>Aloſt</hi> by the <hi>Dender</hi> (no Land car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage remaining but from the <hi>Scheld</hi> to <hi>Grammont,</hi> and from <hi>Aloſt</hi> to the Armies which were juſt by) it had been impoſſible for them to have ſubſiſted where they were; and the great Rains that fell about this time ſo broke the ways, that the little Land-carriage they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came extreamly difficult, and the Boats could hardly for the ſame reaſon be drawn by Horſes: If this made Proviſions ſcarce and dear in the <hi>French</hi> Armies, it created no leſs an Inconveniency for the bringing in of Forrage, and they were forc'd at this time to cut down vaſt Quantities of Faſcines for the repairing of the Ways, and the making of Bridges over the Ditches, being all fill'd with Water by the exceſſive Rains. The 12th, the two Brigades of Foot that had been commanded to <hi>Grammont,</hi> were order'd to return to the two Armies, and the 11 Battallious detach'd from <hi>Montrevel</hi> came back from <hi>Helchin</hi> to their former Poſt, becauſe the <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Troops had not march'd to <hi>Rouſſelar</hi> with the Elector, but continu'd in the <hi>Pays de Waes,</hi> and therefore the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> did not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95917:66"/>
want Aſſiſtance for the defence of the Lines: But the <hi>French</hi> having conſum'd by this time all the Forrage hereabouts, and being oblig'd to Forrage the laſt time on the other ſide of the <hi>Dender</hi> towards <hi>Ghendt,</hi> began to think of retreating with their Armies and coming nearer to their Frontiers; and thereupon order'd this day 8000 Men to go and cut Faſcines under the cover of a Brigade of <hi>Swiſſers</hi> and ſome other Battallions, for the Reparation of the Ways and making Bridges over the <hi>Dender,</hi> which were carried to the places appointed, by the Horſe and Dragoons; for the Weather was ſo bad at this time, that we thought the <hi>French</hi> could not ſtir at preſent, becauſe they (as ſome ſuppos'd) could not carry off their Artillery; but by the help of vaſt quantities of Faſcines, and of Trees cut down and laid a-croſs under them in the moſt dangerous places, they compaſs'd this Difficulty: The Marquis <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> who had left <hi>Boſſu</hi> to come and incamp at <hi>Solre</hi> lower upon the <hi>Sambre,</hi> was driven by the Rains from the Banks of this River, to incamp between <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> and <hi>Florennes.</hi> The 14th, The <hi>French</hi> having repair'd the Ways, and finiſh'd the Bridges over the <hi>Dender,</hi> the Artillery and heavy Baggage was commanded away out of both Armies, that of the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> paſs'd the <hi>Dender,</hi> and that of <hi>Bouflers</hi> kept on the right ſide of it. The 15th, The Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Army march'd upon the Left to paſs the <hi>Dender,</hi> and Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> who had Information of their Deſign and of the March of their Artillery the overnight, order'd then a Detachment of 1500 Horſe and 1000 Foot to be ready the next Morning, with which he went betimes to obſerve the Marching off of the <hi>French,</hi> and ſee if any Attempt could be made upon their Rear-guard, having advanc'd for this end, between <hi>Zellich</hi> and <hi>Aſche;</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> march'd off in ſuch order, that no advantage could be taken, and no other Action happen'd but that of ſome Pickeering of our <hi>Huſſars</hi> amongſt them, and thus paſs'd the <hi>Dender</hi> upon ſeveral Bridges at and about <hi>Aloſt,</hi> and incamp'd with the Right near this Town, and the Left at <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derleuwe,</hi> where the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> had his Quarter: The ſame day the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> march'd upon the Right to change Poſt again with <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and came to incamp at <hi>Aloſt,</hi> the <hi>Dender</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining between them; and 16 Boats came down that River this day from <hi>Grammont</hi> to <hi>Aloſt,</hi> laden with Bisket for the uſe of the Armies which wanted it very much at preſent. The 16th, the Artillery and heavy Baggage march'd on before, becauſe of the badneſs of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95917:67"/>
the Ways, having a ſtrong Eſcorte of ſeveral Squadrons and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions commanded by the Marquis <hi>de Crequi</hi> Lieutenant General; The Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Army halted this day, but that of <hi>Bouflers</hi> march'd from <hi>Aloſt</hi> up the <hi>Dender,</hi> which River was upon the right Colomn of the March, and came to incamp at <hi>Ninove,</hi> keeping ſtill on the ſame ſide of the <hi>Dender.</hi> The 17th, The Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Army march'd on upon the Left towards <hi>Audenarde</hi> and the <hi>Scheld,</hi> and came to incamp with the Right beyond <hi>Eſche,</hi> the Left at <hi>Ste Marie-Oudenhove</hi> and General Quarter at <hi>Steinhuys,</hi> to deſtroy the Forrage, and ſubſiſt between the <hi>Scheld,</hi> the <hi>Dender</hi> and <hi>Ghendt,</hi> where the Armies had not yet incamp'd this Year; but <hi>Bouflers</hi> Army halted this day, and march'd on the 18th upon the Right higher up the <hi>Dender</hi> towards <hi>Grammont,</hi> where it incamp'd for the Conveniency of Forrage on both ſides of the River, with the Right at <hi>Stanberg</hi> towards <hi>Gamerage,</hi> and the Left on the other ſide towards the <hi>Scheld.</hi> The 19th, the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> remov'd his Quarter from <hi>Steinhuys</hi> to <hi>Ste Marie-Oudenhove</hi> upon the Left, where the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Swiſſe</hi> Guards, and the Dragoons of <hi>Fimareon,</hi> had Orders to come and incamp to cover his Quarter: The Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> Army being now poſted near <hi>Grammont,</hi> Monfiour <hi>de Montrevel</hi> was order'd to incamp at <hi>Helchin</hi> with the Body under his command, conſiſting of 16 Battallions and 20 Squadrons.</p>
               <p>Theſe Motions of the <hi>French</hi> ſeem'd to threaten <hi>Audenarde,</hi> and we were apprehenſive of it; for the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> had gone, at his firſt coming to this Ground, to view all the Poſts and Avenues about this place, and the Banks of the <hi>Scheld</hi> both above and below, with a ſtrong Detachment of the King's Houſe, Light-Horſe and Dragoons, as if he deſign'd to Inveſt it; and the Siege of <hi>Audenarde</hi> was diſcours'd of very hotly upon this occaſion, in caſe the Peace was not Sign'd by the 20th Iuſtant, according to the Time prefix'd by the <hi>French</hi> in their Project; and it being now juſt upon the time, every Body long'd to know the Event of that day at <hi>Ryſwick:</hi> The Affairs relating to the Differences between <hi>France, England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were adjuſted, and the Treaty ready to be Sign'd; <hi>Spain</hi> had juſt now loſt all <hi>Catalonia</hi> in the loſs of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and therefore had no reaſon to ſtand upon very high Terms; and the Empire had as little Proſpect of bringing the <hi>French</hi> to the Treaty of <hi>Weſtphalia;</hi> this made moſt People expect that a General Peace would be Sign'd that day; but when it came to the very nick of time, the Imperialiſts
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95917:67"/>
pretended to have a longer time for their Inſtructions, which they could not have time enough to Sign at preſent; and inſiſted upon having better Terms than thoſe offer'd by the <hi>French,</hi> which in ſeveral caſes derogated from the Treaty of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon refus'd to Sign: Our Plenipotentiaries and thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> having no Inſtructions to Sign ſeparately from the reſt of the Allies, were therefore oblig'd to ſtand out too: The <hi>French,</hi> who had their Meaſures ready, as if they expected this from the Imperialiſts, gave in a Memorial to the Mediator the very next day, in which they laid out the great Advantages their Maſter had gain'd over the Allies in the whole Courſe of the Campagne, and eſpecially by the taking of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> which could not do otherwiſe than give him great Hopes of gaining conſiderably by the farther Proſecution of the War; and, although the Allies had let the Term given in their late Project paſs, and conſequently that they had a Right to enter upon new Propoſitions, yet the <hi>French</hi> King (to ſhew his great Moderation to the World, and that in the midſt of his Conqueſts he ſincerely deſir'd the Peace and Repoſe of Chriſtendom) was contented, notwithſtanding all his Advantages, to change and alter nothing in the ſaid Project, but in relation to <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> which he did now pretend to keep to himſelf, and that the Emperour and Empire ſhould be oblig'd to take the Equivalent, without any farther liberty of Choice in that Matter; and likewiſe, that <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould yield to him about ſeventeen Villages of the <hi>Chatellenie</hi> of <hi>Ath</hi> for a Land Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between <hi>Tournay</hi> and <hi>Condé;</hi> and a farther Term was given in this new Memorial to the Allies, till the Tenth of <hi>September</hi> following.</p>
               <p>This Memorial made a great Noiſe at firſt at <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> and People began to apprehend it might break off the Negociations; the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts eſpecially talk'd very much of renewing the War, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of it with greater Heat and Vigour than it had been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done; and ſo they had need: But notwithſtanding all this Buſtle, they grew calmer by degrees, and this new Memorial ſeem'd to have been contriv'd on purpoſe to obviate all the Difficulties which otherwiſe muſt have occurr'd in the Choice of the Equivalent for <hi>Strasbourg;</hi> for the reſtoring of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> a Soveraign, Free and Imperial Town, as it was offer'd by the <hi>French,</hi> did not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the Emperour nor indeed the Empire; becauſe then it would ſtill have been at the <hi>French</hi> King's Mercy, and muſt have open'd its
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95917:68"/>
Gates when ever his Armies ſhould come that way to paſs the <hi>Rhine:</hi> But the keeping of it accommodated the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent the Emperour; and it could not be expected, that, whilſt there was a Liberty of Choice, the Empire could be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Equivalent but with very great Difficulties; though, in Truth, the Equivalent was a better Barrier to the Empire, than the Reſtauration of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> in the State it was in when the <hi>French</hi> took it, and they would not offer it upon any other Terms; but the lapſing of the Term given in the firſt Project, and the putting in this new Memorial thereupon, was an Expedient to ſatisfie both Parties, and to compaſs their Ends without any Difficulty. And thus the Negociations were not interrupted by this Memorial, and the <hi>French,</hi> who ſeem'd to threaten <hi>Audenarde</hi> with a Siege, and had brought their Armies towards the <hi>Scheld</hi> upon the Expiration of the Term given in their Project, did not think it fit at preſent to attempt this Undertaking: I have therefore little to ſay concerning them in this place, and ſo ſhall come to ſpeak of the Tranſactions in the Elector's Camp during theſe Affairs, which I have left at <hi>Rouſſelar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sixth, the height of <hi>Hooghleede</hi> commanding very much the Camp, it was thought fit to alter it, and bring the Right to ſecure a Poſt at preſent of ſuch Conſequence for the Army; which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted on the Seventh, and the Army incamp'd with the Right at <hi>Hooghleede,</hi> and the Left towards <hi>Caectem,</hi> extending it ſelf as much as was poſſible. A Field-Officer out of every Regiment of Horſe and Dragoons was order'd at the firſt coming to this Camp, to go with Quarter-Maſter-General <hi>Ivoy,</hi> and ſee what Forrage was to be found in the Country hereabouts towards <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> and <hi>Ipres,</hi> where they found enough for the Army to have ſubſiſted here, much longer than it did, though ſome would have repreſented to the Elector, that it could not ſubſiſt hereabouts for want of it; but nevertheleſs this was a very inconvenient Camp another way, becauſe the Army was but ſmall and far advanc'd from our Frontier, and the Convoys difficult, which conſequently muſt Harraſs it very much by the greatneſs of the Duty; and the Country about it was cloſe and Woody, and very convenient for the Parties out of <hi>Courtray, Menin</hi> and <hi>Ipres,</hi> which made them take daily a great many Horſes: For theſe Reaſons it was thought neceſſary to bring the Army back nearer to our Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, either towards <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> or <hi>Bruges;</hi> and the Elector went this
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95917:68"/>
day to view the Camp of <hi>Hantſame</hi> and <hi>Cortemark</hi> near <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> and that of <hi>Torhout</hi> near <hi>Bruges,</hi> with an Eſcorte of 500 Horſe; which was not the only Security His Highneſs had for this Journey, for Major General <hi>Fagel</hi> was marching at the ſame time that way from <hi>Newport,</hi> to reinforce his Army at <hi>Rouſſelar,</hi> where he arriv'd this day with the four <hi>Hanover</hi> Battallions, of the Guards, St. <hi>Paul, Hulſen</hi> and <hi>Cinqvilles,</hi> and two <hi>Dutch,</hi> being thoſe of <hi>Beyma</hi> and <hi>Swansbeck;</hi> and by this Reinforcement the Elector's Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted now of 35 Battallions: Upon this Motion of <hi>Fagel</hi>'s, Colonel <hi>Soutandt</hi> had the Guard of the Canal of <hi>Bruges,</hi> with his Battallion and thoſe of <hi>Fagel</hi> and <hi>Reinardt;</hi> and Colonel <hi>Buchan</hi>'s and the Lord <hi>Lorne</hi>'s Regiments were order'd to march for <hi>Plaſſendal</hi> to be near <hi>Newport.</hi> The Elector thought to have kept the Field longer in this Camp with this ſmall Reinforcement, but the Rains came on ſo violently, that it would be a very hard Matter to get Convoys from our Frontier, and muſt make Proviſions very Scarce and Dear; for this and the Reaſons above mention'd, it was reſolv'd to leave this Camp, and march either towards <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> where every thing could come by Water to the Camp, or elſe towards <hi>Torhout,</hi> which was but between three and four Leagues from <hi>Bruges;</hi> the firſt, though very Convenient, was not thought adviſeable, becauſe then if the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> had the Advantage of one March, he would eaſily get to <hi>Bruges</hi> before the Army could come there to cover it; and therefore the Camp of <hi>Torhout,</hi> where <hi>Bruges</hi> and the Canal were at once cover'd, was thought the moſt convenient. Accordingly the Army march'd the 15th upon the Right (all the Infantry upon one Colomn being the Left, and all the Cavalry upon another which made the Right, and the Artillery and heavy Baggage upon a third within the two others, and cover'd by them, towards the Canal of <hi>Newport)</hi> and came to incamp with the Right beyond the Chappel of <hi>Wynendale</hi> with the Wood before it; the Body of Foot between the Caſtle of <hi>Wynendale</hi> on the Right, where the Prince of <hi>Naſſau-Saarbruck</hi> had his Quarter, and Town of <hi>Torhout</hi> on the Left, where was that of the Elector; the Left Wing, being all compos'd of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Horſe and <hi>Pyper</hi>'s Brigade, extended it ſelf farther upon the Left beyond this ſmall Town: A Captain of the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> that had been detach'd with a Party to cover the March, and Scower the <hi>French</hi> Parties which Sculk'd up and down in this cloſe Country, defeated three of them, and kill'd three and twenty <hi>French,</hi> beſides ſeveral
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95917:69"/>
wounded and Priſoners. The 16th, Major General <hi>Fagel</hi> march'd back to <hi>Newport</hi> with the ſix Battallions under his Command. The 17th, the Army made a General Forrage in the Villages of <hi>Hantſame, Cortemarck</hi> and <hi>Werckene,</hi> where the Elector went in Perſon; Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonel <hi>Pechman</hi> of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Guards, who was order'd to Scower the Woods with a good Detachment of Foot, defeated two <hi>French</hi> Parties, kill'd and wounded ſeveral, and brought 25 Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of the firſt, and 19 of the ſecond into the Camp; all the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers had their Arms by the Elector's Orders, and this Affair was manag'd ſo well, that the Army did not loſe one Horſe. The 19th, the Elector view'd all the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Troops in the Heath between <hi>Torhout</hi> and <hi>Wynendale,</hi> and went thence to <hi>Bruges,</hi> being ſtill trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſore Eyes; the ſame day the Prince of <hi>Naſſau-Saarbruck</hi> left the Camp to go to the Baths of <hi>Aix la Chappelle</hi> for his Health, and Count <hi>d'Arco,</hi> General of the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> was left Commander in Chief of the Army: Upon this going of the Prince of <hi>Naſſau</hi>'s to <hi>Aix la Chappelle,</hi> My Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> had once Orders to go and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and was preparing to leave the Prince's Army for that purpoſe, but how this came to be alter'd, is what brings me to ſpeak of the Affairs of our Army in <hi>Brabant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Marechals of <hi>Bouflers</hi> and <hi>Villeroy</hi> being now ſeparated, and march'd from the Neighbourhood of the Canal of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> a great deal of our Cavalry could be ſpar'd out of our Camp, where there was hardly any Forrage to be had at preſent, to go and ſubſiſt more conveniently ſome where elſe; and therefore all the Cavalry upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pay, being firſt joyn'd with the Dragoons that had been poſted behind the Canal, march'd on the 18th from <hi>Diegom</hi> to <hi>Wavre</hi> upon the <hi>Dyle</hi> for the Conveniency of Forrage, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe being left in this Camp, were furniſh'd with dry Forrage from the <hi>States</hi> Magazines in the Town: Upon this March of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cavalry to <hi>Wavre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Tilly</hi> left <hi>Maſy,</hi> and paſs'd the <hi>Meuſe</hi> at <hi>Namur</hi> to incamp within the Retrenchment upon the Height of <hi>Ste Barbe,</hi> there to ſubſiſt in the <hi>Condros</hi> and ſpare the Forrage on this ſide for our Cavalry. The both, the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Heſſe</hi> left the Army, the firſt to go for <hi>England</hi> and thence to <hi>Ireland</hi> for his Domeſtick Affairs, and the laſt into <hi>Germany,</hi> and this day, being the Term given in the <hi>French</hi> Project, there was no other Diſcourſe in the Camp but of Peace, but how this came to fail, is what I have given an account of juſt now. The 24th, the Prince gave
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95917:69"/>
Orders for all the Artillery and Baggage-Horſes to be ſent for from Grazing, and for the Army to be ready to march, upon Information that <hi>Bouflérs</hi> Army was upon the March towards the Plain of <hi>Fleury;</hi> the ſaid Marechal having left the Camp of <hi>Stanberg</hi> and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of <hi>Grammont</hi> on the 22th to come to <hi>Enghien,</hi> whereupon Count <hi>Tillard</hi> was left at <hi>Grammont</hi> with 18 Battallions and as many Squadrons for the Guard of the Convoys between the <hi>Scheld</hi> and <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Camp, and of the Bread which was Bak'd in this Town for the uſe of the Armies. The 23d, the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd to march upon the Right, and came to incamp at <hi>Soignies,</hi> where he was joyn'd by the Marquis <hi>de Courtebonne</hi> and the ten Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions under his Command, which had been poſted about <hi>Mons</hi> ſince <hi>Bouflers</hi> March towards <hi>Dendermond.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> being got ſo far to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Sambre</hi> alarm'd the Prince, who (as we have now ſaid) order'd all the Horſes to be ſent for from Grazing, but did not get into the Camp till the 25th, and the Artillery and heavy Baggage could not march till the next day towards <hi>Louvain;</hi> Major General <hi>Stewart</hi> with <hi>Tiffin</hi>'s Brigade was now upon his March from the <hi>Pays de Waes</hi> back to the Canal of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> who, with the Body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Count <hi>de Noyelles</hi> upon this Canal, was to joyn the Prince's Army at <hi>Louvain.</hi> Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cavalry and Dragoons at <hi>Wavre</hi> were to march towards <hi>Namur,</hi> who, with the Prince of <hi>Tilly</hi> and the Garriſon we had in the place, might have cover'd it till the coming up of the Prince's Army. The 26th, the Artillery and heavy Baggage began to File off towards <hi>Louvain</hi> under the Eſcorte of a Colonel with 1000 Foot, and the Army had Orders to follow the ſame way the next day, to march thence towards the <hi>Mchaigne,</hi> But Count <hi>Naſſau</hi> Lieutenant General, and Major General <hi>Erle,</hi> were to be left at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> with 15 Battallions <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> to incamp within the new Line which was now almoſt finiſh'd, there to cover the Town. The Prince had ſent an Expreſs to <hi>Loo</hi> to give His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty an account of the Marechal <hi>de Boufler's</hi> Motions, and of his Reſolutions thereupon; but <hi>Namur</hi> being at preſent an Attempt not to be made by the <hi>French,</hi> conſidering the Strength of the place with that of its Garriſon, and the Forces we had about it, and the Backwardneſs of the Seaſon; and that, beſides, it would put the Army to great Difficulties to march that way without any preſſing Occaſion, and <hi>Boufler</hi>'s Army being halted at <hi>Soignies</hi> where it was now Hutted, and in no likelihood to ſtir from thence; it was therefore thought
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95917:70"/>
convenient to countermand this March, and it was accordingly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termanded the 27th; for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Infantry could not ſtir but with great Difficulty, becauſe they wanted Horſes to carry their Baggage; two Waggons had been allow'd each Battallion till the coming up to this Camp, which had been hir'd by the King the beginning of the Campagne, to ſupply the preſent Neceſſity; but having been diſmiſs'd at the coming to this Ground, only one could be had at preſent, and if the Army had been oblig'd to march, moſt of the Officers muſt have left all their Baggage behind them, for very few had Horſes to carry it; and therefore, not to put them to ſuch a Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, it was thought more Expedient to let the Foot remain where it was, and that it would be ſufficient to ſend the <hi>Dutch</hi> Cavalry and Dragoons (being ſtill in this Camp) under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Athlone,</hi> towards the <hi>Mehaigne:</hi> Theſe Agitations had ſtopt his Deſign to go and command the Army in <hi>Flanders</hi> in the abſence of the Prince of <hi>Naſſau Saarbruck,</hi> and that thought was now quite laid aſide, to go and command the Army we were going to form towards the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haigne;</hi> where, beſides all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe and Dragoons, My Lord was to have <hi>Tiffin</hi>'s Brigade from the <hi>Pays de Waes,</hi> and the two Brigades of <hi>Belcaſtel</hi> and <hi>Oxenſterne</hi> from the Canal (making toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſixteen Battallions) which now could be ſpar'd from thence upon the Marching off of <hi>Villeroy</hi> towards <hi>Audenarde,</hi> and <hi>Bouflers</hi> to <hi>Soignies;</hi> and only one Battallion was left thereupon for the Guard of the Canal. The 28th, all theſe Regiments joyn'd together near <hi>Louvain,</hi> under the Command of the Count <hi>de Noyelles</hi> Lieutenant General, and Major General <hi>Stewart,</hi> and incamp'd behind the <hi>Dyle</hi> about a League above the Town, with the Left at <hi>Corbeck,</hi> and the Right extending it ſelf towards <hi>Neer-Iſche;</hi> but that of Colonel <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon</hi> was commanded to incamp with the Artillery at <hi>Louvain</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Bruſſels-porte,</hi> and the Detachment of the Prince's Army that cover'd it was order'd back to the Camp. The 30th, all the Horſes belonging to the Infautry incamp'd at <hi>Cockelberg</hi> were remanded to Graze as before along the <hi>Dyle,</hi> between <hi>Louvain</hi> and <hi>Malines,</hi> and a Colonel with a Detachment of 1000 Foot was ſent to <hi>Louvain</hi> to bring the Artillery back again to our Camp: The ſame day My Lord <hi>Portland</hi> came from the <hi>Hague</hi> to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> in order to have another Conference with the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> (as 'twas ſuppos'd) upon what had happen'd at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> the 20th Inſtant, and to put Affairs in the ſame State as before, for the approaching Term given in the

               <p>The 31th, all the <hi>Duteh</hi> Cavalry and Dragoons march'd out of the Camp of <hi>Cockelberg,</hi> under the Command of the Earl of <hi>Athlone,</hi> to go and Subſiſt towards the <hi>Mehaigne</hi> (except <hi>Iſelſtein</hi>'s Brigade, My Lord of <hi>Albemarle</hi>'s Carabiniers and <hi>Dopft</hi>'s Dragoons, which remain'd in the Camp to furniſh the Patrouilles and Out-guards) and having croſs'd the Canal upon our Bridges of Boats between <hi>Laacken</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> they were joyn'd on the other ſide by <hi>Ooſt friſes</hi> Brigade, which had march'd through the Town from its Camp before the Fort of <hi>Monterey,</hi> and ſo came to incamp between <hi>Neer-Iſche</hi> and <hi>Roeux St. Auguſtin.</hi> The Firſt of <hi>September,</hi> My Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> paſs'd the <hi>Dyle</hi> at <hi>Florival,</hi> being follow'd by the Infantry commanded by Count <hi>de Noyelles</hi> and twelve pieces of Cannon detach'd from our Artillery at <hi>Louvain,</hi> and incamp'd together this day with the Right at <hi>Iudoigne</hi> (where was My Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi>'s Quarter) and left at <hi>Pietrain</hi> on this ſide of the <hi>Geet,</hi> where they had Orders to Hutt: The ſame day the Artillery came back from <hi>Louvain</hi> to the Prince's Camp, and all the Horſes were ſent to Graſs, but Colonel <hi>Saunderſon</hi>'s Regiment march'd with My Lord of <hi>Athlone:</hi> My Lord <hi>Portland</hi> went likewiſe this day in one of the Prince's Coaches, being attended with Lieutenant General <hi>Bellaſſis</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hill,</hi> to <hi>Tubiſe</hi> beyond <hi>Halle,</hi> where he was met by the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> from <hi>Soignies,</hi> and after having conferr'd together, they parted with great Expreſſions of reciprocal Eſteem, and My Lord came back to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> this Evening, but did not return to the <hi>Hague</hi> till the Third in the Afternoon. This renew'd the Diſcourſes of Peace in the Army, which had very much fallen ſince the 20th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> till this Journey of My Lord's. There happen'd very little Extraordinary in this Camp to ſpeak of after this, till the Concluſion of the Peace and the Separating of the Armies on both ſides; this obliges me to leave the Prince's Army, and ſee what was doing towards <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding that the <hi>French</hi> had laid aſide the Thoughts of Beſieging <hi>Audenarde,</hi> which of it ſelf would have been a Doubtful Siege, conſidering the great Armies the Allies had at preſent, with the Reaſons I have ſpoken of before, and the continuing of the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations at <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> and that therefore the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> had
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95917:71"/>
left <hi>Grammont</hi> and the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> to go and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp at <hi>Soignies,</hi> yet they ſeem'd to have ſome Deſign on foot for the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi>'s Army which was now ſhut up behind the <hi>Lys,</hi> where it ſubſiſted at the Expence of the <hi>Pays-Conquis;</hi> but if rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd, could march towards the Elector's Army, and oblige him either to accept of a Battle, or elſe to retire into the Retrenchments of <hi>Bruges,</hi> and leave all the Country without the Canals for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of the <hi>French,</hi> there to ſubſiſt without being Burdenſome to their own Frontier: For which Deſign ſeveral Pontoons were ſent from <hi>Tournay</hi> to the <hi>Lys</hi> for the uſe of this Army, and Lieutenant General <hi>Montrevel</hi> march'd on the 21th with the Body under his Command from <hi>Helchin</hi> upon the <hi>Scheld</hi> to reinforce the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> upon the <hi>Lys,</hi> and four Battallions of the King's Regiment, and two of <hi>Stouppa,</hi> were ſent from <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Army to incamp at <hi>Helchin</hi> in <hi>Montrevel</hi>'s place under the Command of Monſteur <hi>de Surville</hi> Major General, and were follow'd the 23d by the Queens Dragoons, and thoſe of <hi>Ste Hermine</hi> and <hi>Davaray:</hi> The ſame day the Marechal of <hi>Catinat,</hi> being joyn'd by <hi>Montrevel,</hi> paſs'd the <hi>Lys</hi> about <hi>Menin,</hi> and the Horſe at <hi>Courtray,</hi> and came to incamp at <hi>Becelar</hi> and <hi>Dadyzeel</hi> about half way between <hi>Courtray</hi> and <hi>Ipres.</hi> The 24th, he went with a ſtrong Eſcorte to <hi>reconoitre</hi> the Country about <hi>Rouſſelar</hi> Camp, which had been left by the Elector's Army ſome days before, and ſee what Forrage was to be had thereabouts for his Army; or to viſit the Ways for a March towards <hi>Torhout,</hi> in caſe the Elector was reſolv'd to maintain his Ground there.</p>
               <p>Upon the firſt News of <hi>Catinat</hi>'s paſſing the <hi>Lys,</hi> the Elector, who was at <hi>Bruges</hi> ſince the 19th, went back the 23d to put himſelf at the Head of his Army at <hi>Torhout,</hi> and concert with his Generals what was to be done upon it; immediately after his Arrival a Council of War was call'd, and it was reſolv'd to leave the Camp of <hi>Toxhout</hi> if the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> advanc'd as for as <hi>Rouſſelar;</hi> for <hi>Catinat</hi> being joyn'd by <hi>Montrevel</hi> and <hi>La Mothe,</hi> would be near 60 Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions ſtrong, but the Elector had not above Thirty; and if <hi>Fagel</hi>'s joyning had been ſufficient, yet it was not ſafe at preſent to have them from <hi>Newport;</hi> as for the Horſe and Dragoons on both ſides they were pretty near equal: But where to go from <hi>Torhout,</hi> the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals were divided upon this Point, ſome were for going to incamp between <hi>Ghiſtel</hi> and <hi>Oudenbourg</hi> along the Canal of <hi>Newport,</hi> where the Army could ſtill ſhare the Forrage of the Country with the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95917:71"/>
                  <hi>French,</hi> and ſpare the Free of <hi>Bruges</hi> with the reſt of the Country behind the Canals, from ſubſiſting of it with dry Forrage; others were of opinion to march directly into the Retrenchment of St. <hi>André</hi> before <hi>Bruget</hi> to cover this place; that it was better to put the Country behind the Canals to ſome Expence, than <hi>Bruges</hi> ſhould be in danger, and if the Elector march'd to <hi>Oudenbourg, Catinat</hi> would certainly come to <hi>Torhout,</hi> and endeavour to cut him off from getting within the Retrenchment of St. <hi>André:</hi> The firſt of theſe Advices ſeem'd to be pitch'd upon for the preſent, and to prevent Confuſion in the March, and execute this Deſign with more Eaſe and Expedition, it was reſolv'd to ſend all the Artillery and heavy Baggage before-hand in the Retrenchment of St. <hi>André,</hi> from whence it could come and joyn the Army at <hi>Oudenbourg</hi> and <hi>Ghiſtel,</hi> or the Army would follow the Artillery if it march'd to <hi>Bruges.</hi> The ſame day a Detachment was made out of the Army to go and repair the Ways towards <hi>Bruges,</hi> for the March of the Artillery and heavy Baggage, and towards <hi>Oxdonbourg</hi> for that of the Army, which Work was finiſh'd by the next Morning. The 24th, all the Artillery and heavy Baggage was ſent to the Retrenchment of St. <hi>André,</hi> under the Convoy of the two Battallions of <hi>Dona</hi> and <hi>La Mothe,</hi> and a <hi>French</hi> Party attack'd it in a long Defilé between <hi>Torhout</hi> and the <hi>Chateau</hi> of <hi>Malſtapel,</hi> in which caſe 'tis very difficult to cover a whole Line of the Baggage and Artillery of an Army; the Party being in Ambuſcade, took the Opportunity to fall upon it where it was weakly guarded, and rifled the Baggage of three Regiments of Foot, and carried away their Horſes. The 26th, Monſieur <hi>Ivoy</hi> Quarter-Maſter General, and all the Quarter-Maſters of the Army, were ſent to mark a Camp between <hi>Ghiſtel</hi> and <hi>Oudenbourg</hi> for the next day; the Elector's Quarter was appointed at <hi>Ghiſtel</hi> upon the Right, and the Prince of <hi>Naſſau-Saarbruck</hi>'s at <hi>Oudenbourg</hi> upon the Loſt; but in the Night they receiv'd Orders to go immediately and mark the Camp within the Retrenchment of St. <hi>André</hi> before <hi>Bruges,</hi> for the Elector had receiv'd an Account this Evening that <hi>Catinat</hi> was marching to <hi>Rouſſelar,</hi> in order to come and attack him; whilſt a Body of <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s Army which had been detach'd under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Monſieur <hi>de Surville</hi> to <hi>Countray,</hi> ſhould endeavour to cut off his March to <hi>Bruges;</hi> this made the Elector reſolve, without any farther Ballancing, to go and ſecure the Retrenchment of St. <hi>André</hi> with his Army, upon which this Order was ſent to the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95917:72"/>
Quarter-Maſters at <hi>Oudenbourg;</hi> and the Army began to march at Ten of the Clock this Night, and got the next Morning within the Retrenchments before <hi>Bruges,</hi> not without ſome Confuſion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; though it prov'd afterwards but a falſe Alarm, for <hi>Catinat</hi> was not yet ſtir'd from <hi>Becelar;</hi> however, 'tis true that <hi>Surville</hi> was come to <hi>Courtray</hi> with the ſix Battallions and two Regiments of Dragoons above mentioned, doubtleſs upon ſome Deſign: This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment had been repair'd lately with no Alteration but the taking in of the Abbey of St. <hi>André,</hi> and Gazoon'd (that is fac'd with Turf) both within and without, and was now in a very good Condition; the Elector took his Quarter during this Camp at <hi>Schipſtal,</hi> the Landing place from <hi>Oſtend</hi> to <hi>Bruges,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Naſſau</hi>'s was mark'd at the Abbey of St. <hi>André.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 29th, the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi>'s Army advanc'd from <hi>Becelar</hi> and came to incamp at <hi>Rouſſelar,</hi> with the Right here and Left about <hi>Hooghleede,</hi> but the Marechal himſelf went this day to <hi>Courtray</hi> to meet with the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> who had come there to conferr with him: but it is probable that the Elector's March had broke their Meaſures, for <hi>Villeroy</hi> return'd to his Army the next day, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Surville</hi> was order'd back with the Body under his Command to <hi>Helchin.</hi> The 30th, in a general Forrage along the <hi>Scheld,</hi> the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> took occaſion to demoliſh an old Caſtle which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had at <hi>Cavre</hi> upon that River, ſituated upon a little Mount in the middle of it, where they always kept a ſmall Garriſon of 30 or 40 Men detach'd from the Cittadel of <hi>Ghendt,</hi> but had now been reinforc'd upon <hi>Villeroy</hi>'s March towards the <hi>Scheld,</hi> more to run upon Parties than for any Defence; and all the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were made Priſoners. The Marechal of <hi>Catinat,</hi> who had come back the 29th from <hi>Courtray</hi> to the Army, march'd upon the Left from <hi>Rouſſelar</hi> to <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> and incamp'd with his Right at <hi>Hantſame</hi> near <hi>Cortemarck,</hi> and his Left at <hi>Eſene</hi> towards that Town, having the Brook of <hi>Hantſame</hi> before him and his head Quarter at <hi>Zarren,</hi> where at his coming up to this Camp, he was joyn'd by Monſieur <hi>de la Mothe</hi> with the Troops under his Command, which had incamp'd all this while about <hi>Furnes</hi> and <hi>Ipres,</hi> conſiſting of eleven or twelve Battallions, and ſome Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons; ſo that the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> was now reckon'd near 60 Battallions ſtrong, and about 80 Squadrons: But all the Waters having been let out at <hi>Newport,</hi> upon his March hither, the Water about this Camp
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95917:72"/>
was found too Brackiſh and Unwholſome, and therefore on the 31th; the Army paſs'd the Brook of <hi>Haniſame</hi> to come more towards <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout</hi> and <hi>Wynendale,</hi> and incamp'd with the Left upon the Wood of <hi>Beeſt,</hi> the Right at <hi>Werckene,</hi> and the General Quarter at <hi>Waldeſloo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> having put <hi>Bruges</hi> under cover as well as his Army, by Incamping in the Retrenchment of St. <hi>André,</hi> took care at the ſame time for the Defence of the Canals and <hi>Newport,</hi> whereupon <hi>Lorne</hi> and <hi>Buchan</hi>'s Regiments were order'd to guard the Canal of <hi>Newport,</hi> the firſt at <hi>Laffine</hi> and the ſecond at <hi>Snaeskirk,</hi> and <hi>Soutlandt</hi>'s was order'd from the Neighbourhood of <hi>Bruges</hi> back to Major General <hi>Fagel</hi> at <hi>Lombarzyde;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Holſtein-Ploen</hi>'s Dragoons and the Battallions of <hi>Harſolt, Marquet, Dona</hi> and <hi>La Mothe,</hi> were order'd, at the coming to St. <hi>André</hi> Camp, to go and poſt themſelves behind the Canal of <hi>Bruges,</hi> which, with the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Fagel</hi> and <hi>Reinardt</hi> already there, they were to guard all along to <hi>Ghendt.</hi> The 29th, His Highneſs went to <hi>Newport</hi> to ſee every thing thereabouts in a good Poſture of Defence, and at the ſame time order'd Major General <hi>Schlipenbach,</hi> with four Squadrons of <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe, two of <hi>Bavarian</hi> Cuiraſſiers, and ſix of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> to march that way with ten or twelve pieces of Cannon; Brigadier <hi>Rantſaw</hi> was alſo ſent to incamp with the Battallions of <hi>Willekens, Rantſaw, Obergen, Schack</hi> and <hi>Weed,</hi> behind the Canal of <hi>Oſtend</hi> over againſt <hi>Plaſſendale;</hi> the Waters were let out at <hi>Newport</hi> to overflow all the Country about it towards <hi>Furnes</hi> and <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> and a Garriſon was put into the <hi>Chateau</hi> of <hi>Ghiſtel;</hi> and the Elector, having given his Orders at <hi>Newport,</hi> came back the ſame day to the Camp at <hi>Schipſtall</hi> near <hi>Bruges:</hi> His Highneſs had been inform'd the day before, that the Barrier upon the Line of <hi>Furnes</hi> had now been ſhut up two or three days together, without ſuffering any Body either to go out or come in, which gave ſome Apprehenſion for <hi>Newport;</hi> but it was quickly known that it was for the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who was come Poſt to <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> in order to imbark with his Retinue and about 1000 choſen Men and Volontiers, on Board of a ſmall Squadron of light Frigats, commanded by the Chevalier <hi>Bant,</hi> to Sail for <hi>Dant: zick,</hi> and endeavour to make good his Election to the Crown of <hi>Poland</hi> by the Cardinal Primate and his Party; which, ſince the Dyet at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> had again been ratified by the Party in a <hi>Rokoſz,</hi> or Confederation of the Party met at the Cardinal's Summons, which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95917:73"/>
invited the Prince to come into <hi>Poland</hi> to take Poſſeſſion of the Crown, and protect his Friends; but this Expedition was made too late, when the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> was already Crown'd and had Poſſeſſion of the Government, which <hi>Conti</hi>'s Party could not now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of; and thus that Expedition fail'd, and the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> after having remain'd a great while on Ship board in the Road of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> was forc'd to come back without being able to attempt any thing.</p>
               <p>The Third of <hi>September,</hi> the Elector, who had never been at Sea, went to <hi>Blankenberg</hi> (a little Borough inhabited by none but Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <note place="margin">Septemb.</note> between <hi>Oſtend</hi> and <hi>Sluys)</hi> where he and his Retinue went on board of ſeveral Fiſhing-boats a little way out to Sea, to try the Temper of this Element; two or three Privateers were ſent out at the ſame time to guard the Coaſt, and the Elector had almoſt the Satisfaction of ſeeing a Sea Ingagement, for they were purſued back into <hi>Oſtena</hi> by ſome <hi>French</hi> Privateers, which oblig'd His Highneſs, after having been ſome few Hours at Sea, to come back to <hi>Blanken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> and from thence return'd to the Camp. The Sixth, The Elector left the Army to go in Relays to <hi>Antwerp</hi> this day, where Prince <hi>Vandemont</hi> was to meet His Electoral Highneſs the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the Command of the Army in <hi>Flanders</hi> fell thereby to the Count <hi>d' Arco</hi> General of the <hi>Bavarians.</hi> The Seventh, Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> came accordingly from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to wait upon the Elector at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and conferr together upon the preſent State of Affairs; the Prince went back the ſame day to the Army at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> but the Elector remain'd in that Town: The Term prefix'd by the late Memorial given in by the <hi>French</hi> drawing near, His Electoral Highneſs was more conveniently here, than in any other Town of his Juriſdiction, to ſend Expreſſes to or receive them from Don <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo de Quiros</hi> the firſt Plenipotentiary of <hi>Spain</hi> at the Congreſs of <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> who had receiv'd expreſs Orders from the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> alarm'd by the Loſs of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> to Sign then upon the Conditions offer'd by the <hi>French,</hi> Sign who will for the reſt; and (as 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) had had a Reprimand for not Signing the 20th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Term given before in the Project; which was a Tune many Notes lower than at the beginning of theſe Negociations, when <hi>Spain</hi> as well as the Empire, were ſo unwilling to Treat upon the Foot of the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen.</hi> The Prince at his return to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> began
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95917:73"/>
to review the Army, Brigade by Brigade, not ſo much to be ſati fied of the Strength of the Regiments, as to ſee them Exerciſe, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little to do at preſent for them. The Ninth, <hi>Selwyn</hi>'s Brigade poſted at <hi>Laacken</hi> exercis'd before him; and the Tenth, the half Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade of Guards of the firſt Line continued the ſame Paſs-time. The 11th, The Prince being inform'd that the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> had advanc'd with his Army from <hi>Ste Marie Oudenhove</hi> nearer to <hi>Ghendt,</hi> and was come to incamp at St. <hi>Lievens-Houthem,</hi> order'd <hi>Selwyn</hi>'s Brigade and the Regiments of <hi>Columbine</hi> and <hi>Granville</hi> of <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s, to ſend for their Baggage-Horſes from Graſs, in order to march the next day, being deſign'd for a Reinforcement to the <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg</hi> Foot incamp'd at <hi>Heuſen</hi> for the Defence of the <hi>Scheld</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Ghendt</hi> and <hi>Dendermonde;</hi> for if the Peace had not been Sign'd the over-night, of which there could be no News as yet in our Camp, it was expected that the War would begin again with more Vigour and Animoſity than ever; and that <hi>Villeroy</hi> thereupon might have endeavour'd either to Bombard <hi>Ghendt</hi> or paſs the <hi>Scheld.</hi> But it pleas'd God at length to put an end to a War which for nine Years together had Haraſs'd and ſeverely Chaſtis'd moſt Parts of Chriſtendom, and the Peace was Happily Sign'd the 10th at night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>England, Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> on one part, and <hi>France</hi> on the other: The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plenipotentiaries Sign'd about Midnight, and after them thoſe of the <hi>States General,</hi> which being done, the <hi>French</hi> were now oblig'd according to the Preliminary Articles, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge His Majeſty for King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> without any Reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Condition or Reſerve; our Plenipotentiaries were thereupon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd by the Mediatour, and receiv'd by the <hi>French</hi> with all the Civility that was due to the Plenipotentiaries of the Crown of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> after which the Articles were Sign'd between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> in the preſence of the Mediatour, and the Plenipotentiaries on both ſides embrac'd one another with all the Demonſtrations of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Eſteem, and an intire Reconciliation; and the Converſation ſoon fell upon the Panegyrick of the two Moſt Powerful Monarchs in Chriſtendom, whoſe great Actions muſt hereafter make the beſt part of the Hiſtory of theſe Times; the <hi>French</hi> eſpecially ſpoke of the great Veneration that all Brave <hi>French-men</hi> had for ſo Renown'd a Prince as King <hi>William</hi> the Third, and of the great Eſteem and Value the King their Maſter had for him.</p>

As for the Imperialiſts, they ſtill ſtuck out and refus'd to Sign, alledging that they had not time enough given them to have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from the Emperour and Empire about the Matters in Debate, and eſpecially one of ſuch Conſequence as the Diſmembring of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> from the Body of the Empire was, and inſiſted ſtill upon the full Reſtitution of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> without the Reſervation of <hi>Saar-Louis</hi> and <hi>Longwy</hi> to the <hi>French:</hi> After this ſecond Refuſal of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's Plenipotentiaries, thoſe of <hi>England, Spain</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> Sign'd without them, according to the Inſtructions they had receiv'd; but a Separate Article was added at the end of every one of theſe three ſeveral Treaties, in which it was ſtipulated between the Mediatour, the Powers that had Sign'd and the <hi>French,</hi> that a farther time ſhould be allow'd to the Emperour and Empire till the 22th day of <hi>October</hi> incluſive, next enſuing, (being ſix Weeks time) to regulate the Affairs relating to the Empire; during which time all manner of Hoſtilities ſhould ceaſe between the <hi>Germans</hi> and the <hi>French;</hi> for the Performance whereof, the Powers that had Sign'd ingag'd themſelves as Guarrantees; but if by that time the Peace was not Sign'd between the Empire and <hi>France,</hi> that nevertheleſs the Treaty concluded at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> ſhould ſtand good, and the Powers that had Sign'd ſhould remain Neuter in the War between <hi>France</hi> and the Empire. I will not pretend to advance, that there was a Deſign in the refuſing to Sign by the Emperour's Plenipotentiaries, both the former Term and this; but this may be ſaid for Truth, that the refuſing to Sign the time before, put it out of the Empires Choice to take <hi>Strasbourg</hi> or the Equivalent; and their refuſing to Sign now, left them to Treat with the <hi>French</hi> among themſelves, which has brought in the Fourth Article of the Treaty for the Empire, ſo Prejudicial to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and Derogatory to the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi> in its behalf; which may be look'd upon as the Fundamental Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Empire, as 'tis now divided between the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and the <hi>Romiſh Religion;</hi> which Article, 'tis very probable, would not have been ſo eaſily gain'd to the Prejudice of the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt,</hi> if the Imperialiſts had acted and ſign'd in Conjunction with the reſt of the Allies: I need not give an account of the three ſeveral Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Sign'd at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> the Tenth, becauſe they are already Printed by themſelves, to which I ſhall referr the Reader; only I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſomething concerning <hi>Luxembourg</hi> and the Equivalent offer'd to <hi>Spain</hi> in lieu of it, namely, That the Equivalent offer'd by the <hi>French,</hi>

being <hi>Maubeuge, Condé, Menin</hi> and <hi>Ipres,</hi> was much more Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions in the Low-Countries; becauſe it made them more united, and gave them a better and more defenſible Frontier, and for the ſame reaſon was ſo to <hi>England;</hi> but, the <hi>French</hi> reſtoring <hi>Lorrain,</hi> it was better for the Common Intereſt of <hi>Europe</hi> to have <hi>Luxembourg</hi> back again for a Communication between <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the Empire and the Low-Countries, for otherwiſe without it, the <hi>French</hi> might ſtill have over-aw'd the Empire upon the <hi>Lower-Rhine,</hi> and have had an In-let into <hi>Holland,</hi> for which reaſon <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> has been preferr'd to the Equivalent; and the <hi>French,</hi> who to be ſure expected that it would be ſo, and therefore were aware of it, reſolv'd to retain <hi>Saar-Louis</hi> and <hi>Longwy</hi> to have ſtill a Bridle upon the Empire and <hi>Luxembourg;</hi> and alſo for a Defence to <hi>France</hi> it ſelf in caſe of ſuch another Alliance againſt it, as the laſt.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the Signing of the Peace at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> the 10th or rather 11th of <hi>September,</hi> Expreſſes were diſpatch'd to all the Courts in Chriſtendom to give notice of it, and our Plenipotentiaries at the <hi>Hague</hi> thought it convenient to ſend one to Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> who commanded all His Majeſty's Forces and Armies in Chief in the Low Countries; the Expreſs paſs'd by <hi>Antwerp</hi> at Nine of the Clock at Night, and Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> His Majeſty's Envoy at the Court of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> who was then at his Pay-Office at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> had the firſt News of it before the Elector; about Twelve the Expreſs came to the Prince at the Camp, and the good News were all over the Army next Morning; our Expreſs was follow'd by two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Couriers going to <hi>Madrid,</hi> the firſt with the News of the Signing, and the ſecond with the Treaty in due Form to be Ratified, who both receiv'd the Elector's Orders at <hi>Antwerp</hi> in their way: And as if Providence had deſign'd this to be mark'd for a Happy day in the Calender, the Elector receiv'd, ſoon after the paſſing of the firſt <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Courier, an Expreſs from the Emperour, with the News of the Great and Glorious Defeat which Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> had given the <hi>Turks</hi> at <hi>Zanta</hi> near the <hi>Theyſſe</hi> in <hi>Hungary</hi> on the Firſt of <hi>September;</hi> which as it appears by the Accounts of it, was as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and entire a Victory as has been gain'd for many Ages; and ſo much the more Welcome, that it was gain'd in a time when Men were very apprehenſive for the Emperour's Affairs in <hi>Hungary,</hi> the Grand Seignior having a much more powerful Army; with which he had already driven the Imperialiſts from <hi>Titul,</hi> and was now paſſing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95917:75"/>
the <hi>Theyſſe,</hi> to march towards <hi>Peter-Waradin;</hi> when, his Army being imprudently divided by the River, either for want of Boats to make ſeveral Bridges, or Conduct, Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> attack'd that part which had paſs'd under the Command of the Grand Viſier, and gave it an entire Rout, and in the Purſuit over the Bridge (which occaſion'd the loſs of moſt of the Infidels) put that part, which was commanded by the Grand Seignior on the other ſide, into no leſs Confuſion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. The Elector having receiv'd this joyful News by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, diſpatch'd immediately the Count <hi>de Milan</hi> to the Electrice and Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> with the Letter he had receiv'd from the Emperour upon this occaſion: Several People wiſh'd that this Victory had happen'd a little ſooner for the ſake of the Allies, who (if the <hi>Turks</hi> had been brought to make a Peace, which would have been much more Honourable than what they at preſent can expect) could then have given the Law in the Congreſs of <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> and oblig'd the <hi>French</hi> to much greater Reſtitutions, or elſe have carried on a War that muſt have been Fatal to them; but the <hi>French</hi> Court has known ſo well how to manage the <hi>Turks</hi> upon this Point, in all the Misfortunes they have had for theſe ſeven or eight Years laſt paſt, that there was no more reaſon to expect the <hi>Turks</hi> would ſeek for a Peace after this Defeat, than after that of <hi>Salankement,</hi> or the Loſſes of <hi>Guyla</hi> and <hi>Great-Waradin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 12th in the Evening, the Elector follow'd the good News and came to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and the next day he ſent the Marquis <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſiés,</hi> a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant General <hi>de Battaille</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops to the Marechal of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> and Baron <hi>Simeoni</hi> to the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers,</hi> to give them an account of the Signing of the Peace on the Tenth at Night, and to know what Orders they had from the <hi>French</hi> Court about their Armies between this and the Ratification, which was to be made within three Weeks after; Count <hi>Monaſterol</hi> was ſent at the ſame time by Count <hi>d'Arco</hi> from the Army near <hi>Bruges</hi> to the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> upon the ſame account; they were receiv'd with great Civilities in the <hi>French</hi> Camps, and nobly entertain'd, but return'd with this Anſwer, That no Orders were yet come from Court to them upon the Signing of the Peace, but that as ſoon as they did receive any, they would give an account of it to His Electoral High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thereby to regulate Affairs on both ſides accordingly. The 14th, all the Artillery was drawn out before the Camp upon the Height uear the Wind mill of <hi>Ganſhoren,</hi> and all the Army drew out in the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95917:75"/>
Evening to fire three Volleys for the great Victory obtain'd over the <hi>Turks</hi> by Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> but it fell a Raining very hard, and all the Troops were diſmiſs'd to their Tents, and the Artillery commanded back to its former Poſt; which, may be, was not the true Reaſon, but rather it was not thought convenient to have any publick Rejoycing about it, the Peace being Sign'd between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> which made <hi>England</hi> to have no Intereſt in the Emperour's Affairs that way; For I do not remember that there were any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Rejoycings in <hi>England</hi> for the raiſing the Siege of <hi>Vienna</hi> in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Reign, or even for the taking of <hi>Buda</hi> in King <hi>James</hi>'s, though a Popiſh Prince: But <hi>Te Deum</hi> was Sung this Evening in the Elector's Chappel, and all the Cannon fir'd thrice round the Ramparts of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> with abundance of Illuminations and Fire-works; and Count <hi>d'Arco</hi> the <hi>Bavarian</hi> General, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded at preſent the Army of <hi>Flanders</hi> in Chief, had <hi>Te Deum</hi> Sung in his Quarter by the Chaplains of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Bavarian</hi> Troops, and the Army and Artillery being drawn out, fir'd three rounds for this Victory. The 17th, Prince <hi>Vaudemont</hi> left the Camp to go and wait upon His Majeſty at <hi>Loo,</hi> not only to regulate the Marching of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops out of the Country, but chiefly to Thank His Majeſty for the great Honours he had receiv'd in commanding of his Armies in <hi>Flanders</hi> the three laſt Campagnes, and to paſs as much time as he could with the King before His Majeſty went for <hi>England,</hi> now that the parting would be for ſome time, the Prince being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> in the Room of the Marquis <hi>de Leganés;</hi> where we may expect from ſo Brave and Wiſe a Prince, that he will manage Affairs ſo as to conſerve the Peace and Repoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> and contribate thereby to maintain that of Chriſtendom in General. The Prince being now gone to <hi>Loo,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> became in courſe General in Chief of the Army near <hi>Bruſſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 19th, the Marechal of <hi>Bouflers</hi> ſent Monſieur <hi>de Pracontal</hi> a Merechal de Camp or Major General of his Army, to the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> to give His Highneſs an account, that the <hi>French</hi> King had ſent Orders for his Armies to retire forthwith out of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Territories in that Country, and ceaſe all farther Acts of Hoſtility againſt His Catholick Majeſty's Subjects, or any others belonging to the Powers which had Sign'd the Peace on the 10th in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; whereupon an Order was publiſh'd by Beat of Drum in the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95917:76"/>
Armies on both ſides to publiſh the Signing of the Peace at <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> and prevent all manner of Hoſtilities hereafter upon pain of Death; and all Parties were immediately after drawn off, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded back to their reſpective Regiments or Garriſons, and the Countrey left free and open for an intercourſe and Commerce between the Subjects on both ſides in purſuance of an order to this purpoſe proclaim'd in all the Towns of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Frontiers.</p>
               <p>On the 20th. the Three <hi>French</hi> Armies commanded by the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chals of <hi>Villeroy, Bouſlers</hi> and <hi>Catinat,</hi> march'd out of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Territories to retire into the <hi>Pays Conquis,</hi> in purſuance of the Orders they receiv'd from the King their Maſter, yet ſo as to ſubſiſt in the Country which they were to reſtore by the Treaty, and ſpare their own: The Marechal of <hi>Villeroy</hi> came to incamp juſt without the <hi>Scheld</hi> in the Chatellenie of <hi>Ath</hi> to Forrage the Countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this place, and <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Tournay;</hi> the Marechal of <hi>Bouſlers</hi> left <hi>Soignies</hi> to paſs the <hi>Sambre</hi> and ſubſiſt between <hi>Beaumont</hi> and <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy,</hi> and the Marechal of <hi>Catinat</hi> repaſs'd the <hi>Lys</hi> to come into the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellenie</hi> of <hi>Courtray</hi> with the beſt part of his Army to demoliſh the Line (this place and <hi>Chatellenie</hi> being to be reſtor'd to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by vertue of the Treaty) and the reſt march'd into the Lines of <hi>Ipres.</hi> The Marquis <hi>de Harcourt</hi> had been commanded back, juſt before the Signing of the Treaty, towards the <hi>Moſelle</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to reinforce the Marechal of <hi>Choiſeul;</hi> for the <hi>Germans</hi> had at laſt paſt the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the main of the Army commanded by Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> was come to incamp at <hi>Creutznach</hi> between the Electorate of <hi>Treves</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> whilſt the reſt beſieg'd the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Eberenbourg</hi> belonging to the Elector of <hi>Treves,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> had poſſeſs'd themſelves of ſince the beginning of the War: Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> was carrying on of this Siege at the time of the Signing of the Treaty, and the Marechal of <hi>Choiſeul</hi> was not in a condition to attempt the relief of it, which oblig'd the Marquis <hi>de Harcourt</hi> to march back towards <hi>Montroyal</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour jointly with the Marechal of <hi>Choiſeul</hi> to raiſe that Siege; for which purpoſe, immediately after the retiring of the <hi>French</hi> Armies out of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dominions in the <hi>Low Countrey</hi>'s, great detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, eſpecially of Horſe, were ſent to follow the Marquis of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> and no leſs than 150 Squadrons were then commanded that way; which was done, not onely in order to force the <hi>Germans</hi> to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95917:76"/>
raiſe the Siege they were ingag'd in, but likewiſe to ſend them to ſubſiſt between the <hi>Meuſe</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where the Peace was not yet concluded, and ſpare their own Frontier by that means; but <hi>Harcourt</hi> could not come time enough to joyn the Marechal of <hi>Choiſeul</hi> and relieve <hi>Eberenbourg,</hi> nor could the beſieged hold out long enough to prevent the loſs of the place by the Ceſſation of Arms agreed upon at <hi>Ryswick</hi> between <hi>France</hi> and the Empire; for they were forc'd to capitulate but a day or two before the order came to ceaſe all acts of Hoſtility on both ſides, upon the Six Weeks Truce made at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> between the <hi>Germans</hi> and the <hi>French:</hi> This ſhews very plainly that if the <hi>Germans</hi> had been as early in their Motions this Campagne, as the Allies were in the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> they would have made the <hi>French</hi> pay dear for the Siege of <hi>Ath</hi> or elſe would have prevented it; and if they had not paſt the <hi>Rhine</hi> ſo late, not onely <hi>Eberenbourg</hi> but <hi>Kirne</hi> muſt have fallen into their hands; by which means they could have eſtabliſh'd themſelves good Winter Quarters on this ſide of the <hi>Rhine</hi> in the Electorate of <hi>Treves</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> which would have been of vaſt conſequence towards a vigorous proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the War, in caſe the Congreſs at <hi>Ryſwick</hi> had broke up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concluding of a Treaty; or the Imperialiſts would at leaſt have had ſome reaſon to back the pretenſions they inſiſted upon ſo much in theſe Negotiations, which have conſiderably deferr'd the General Peace: But the ſlowneſs of the <hi>Germans,</hi> where their Operations depend from ſo many Princes and States of different Intereſts, and having often private grudges among themſelves, and no common and General Magazines for an early taking of the Field, will always be an obſtacle to any thing that is Brisk and Vigorous in a Confederate War; and the <hi>French</hi> for this reaſon will ever be before-hand with them in the Field, which is of very great moment in the operations of a Campagne; and we have ſeen, but the laſt Summer, the Marechal of <hi>Choiſeul</hi> ſubſiſt a conſiderable while between the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Neckre,</hi> with an Army that did not dare ſhew its face, when the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had once taken the Field.</p>
               <p>After the taking of <hi>Eberenbourg</hi> by Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de Harcourt</hi> who was marching that way to reinforce the Marechal of <hi>Choiſeul,</hi> turn'd with his Army into the Countrey of <hi>Liege</hi> beyond the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> which, being a dependance of the Empire the <hi>French</hi> thought they could very juſtly put their Troops to ſubſiſt there and eaſe their own Frontier, whilſt the Peace was not Sign'd as
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95917:77"/>
yet between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> and accordingly they crouded as many Troops, eſpecially Horſe and Dragoons, as they could there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and likewiſe in the Dutchy of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> which was to be reſtor'd to <hi>Spain</hi> by the Treaty. As ſoon as the <hi>French</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated with their Armies out of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Territories in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to get into their own Conqueſts, and that a Ceſſation of all manner of Hoſtilities was thereupon publiſh'd, and a Free Trade and intercourſe between the Frontiers on both ſides proclaim'd, the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> left <hi>Bruſſells</hi> and went to <hi>Loo</hi> to ſee His Majeſty, and partake of the Divertiſements which the Countrey thereabouts afforded in this Hunting Seaſon, and at the ſame time to conferr with the King about the marching of the Allies Troops out of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> and retaining a certain number of the <hi>States</hi> Forces to keep Garriſon in the Frontier Towns of that Countrey, as they were to be after the Ratification and Execution of the Treaty of <hi>Rvſwick;</hi> as <hi>Luxembourg, Namur, Charleroy, Mons, Ath, Aude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narde, Courtray</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were too weak to Garriſon themſelves; Four and Twenty Battallions of the <hi>States</hi> Forces were agreed upon for this Service, which, with the Seven Battallions of <hi>Bavarians,</hi> and the few Troops of <hi>Spaniards, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> in this Country, were thought ſufficient to Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Frontier Towns in time of Peace.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, till the Ratification of the Treaty, the Armies on our ſide continued incamp'd as before; the Infantry of the <hi>Brabant</hi> Army at <hi>Cockelberg;</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe and Dragoons at <hi>Wavre</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der General <hi>Auerquerque;</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> with <hi>Tiffin</hi>'s, <hi>Belcaſtel</hi>'s and <hi>Oxenſtern</hi>'s Brigades of Foot, at <hi>Judoigne,</hi> under the command of the Earl of <hi>Athlone;</hi> and our <hi>Flanders</hi> Army in the Retrenchments of <hi>Bruges;</hi> where it was commanded by the Count <hi>d'Arco,</hi> till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back of the Prince of <hi>Naſſau-Sarbruck</hi> from the Baths of <hi>Aix la Chappelle,</hi> which was on the 23d, when he arriv'd at <hi>Bruges,</hi> and took his Quarter (as it had been mark'd at the coming of the Army to this ground) in the Abbey of St. <hi>André.</hi> The 25th, all the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Cuiraſſiers and Dragoons left the Camp to march towards the <hi>Rhine</hi> and Winter in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> being deſign'd for the Emperors Service in <hi>Hungary</hi> the next Campagne; but the Foot march'd into the <hi>Spaniſh Guelderland</hi> to Quarter in that Countrey till the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> where they were appointed by the Elector to Garriſon in this and other places of that Dutchy, as <hi>La Roche</hi>

               <p>The Elector continued all this while with His Majeſty at <hi>Loo</hi> and <hi>Dieren</hi> ſometimes at the one and ſometimes at the other, where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Divertiſements they ſettled the <hi>Routes</hi> and Marches of the Allies out of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> and his Highneſs did not come back to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> till the 13th of <hi>October,</hi> by which time all the Confederate Forces had clear'd the Countrey, except His Majeſties National Troops which were to paſs over into <hi>England, Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> with as much expedition as the Seaſon would permit; and the <hi>Danes,</hi> which did not begin their March homewards till the <hi>November</hi> following.

And to convince the King that all theſe Proteſtations of the <hi>Czars</hi> Eſteem and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of ſo great a Monarch, were no formal Complements, they acquainted His Majeſty that the <hi>Czar</hi> their Maſter was in the next Room himſelf, having come ſo far out of his Dominions to aſſure His Majeſty of it in Perſon: After which they introduc'd the King into the <hi>Czar</hi>'s Chamber, where they were together above an Hour, His Majeſty being attended by the Earls of <hi>Albemarle</hi> and <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and Three or Four more Perſons of Quality; but the <hi>Czar</hi> who Travell'd <hi>Incognito</hi> in the Retinue of his own Embaſſy could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Invitation to dine with the King, but went back after the Interview to <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Czar</hi> had contriv'd this way of Travelling in the Train of his own Embaſſy as a private Perſon, on purpoſe to ſee <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> the moſt flouriſhing and wealthy Countreys in the World, and the moſt famous for Trade and Navigation; being very deſirous to improve his own Subjects that way, eſpecially now, that being Maſter of <hi>Afoff</hi> upon the Mouth of the <hi>Tanais</hi> he had a very good Harbour open to the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> by which, if he could gain any Strength on thoſe Seas, he may not onely increaſe very much the Trade and Wealth of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> but cut himſelf a way at the ſame time to the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire, and become Maſter of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi> Theſe are thoughts worthy of ſo great a Prince, and to put himſelf thereupon in the beſt way of compaſſing ſuch great ends, he came with his Embaſſy to the <hi>Baltick</hi> Shore about the beginning of the laſt Summer where he imbark'd to come to <hi>Coningsberg</hi> the Capital City of the Ducal <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> belonging to the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg;</hi> where his Electoral Highneſs was then with all his Court,

to be near <hi>Warſaw</hi> during the time of the Election for the Crown of <hi>Poland.</hi> The <hi>Czar</hi> and his Embaſſy were nobly entertain'd here, and purſued their Travels over-land afterwards through <hi>Pruſſia, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merania, Brandenbourg, Weſtphalia,</hi> &amp;c. to come to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and Embark there for <hi>Holland;</hi> and after a conſiderable ſtay in <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> the greateſt Town for Trade and Navigation in the World, unleſs this mighty Character be moſt deſervedly due to <hi>London,</hi> his <hi>Czariſh</hi> Majeſty is at length come himſelf privately to <hi>England,</hi> to ſee our Shipping and Docks, where the moſt ſtately, curious and perfect Models for Building of Ships in the World are to be ſeen; and to inſtruct himſelf in Navigation and Maritime Affairs, now that he has the Sea open to him, in a milder Climate than <hi>Archangel,</hi> whereby he may at once make his Subjects conſiderable for their Trade, and become a Terrour to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, which may one day be ſubdued by his power on the <hi>Black Seas;</hi> and Viſit the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the moſt wealthy City in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> and Imperial Seat of a Great Monarch, who has all the Power which the Purſes of the wealthieſt Nations of the World can afford without any Arts of Tyranny, Oppreſſion or Arbitrarineſs to have them; who has had Vaſt Fleets at Sea and Numerous Armies in the Field, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not oppreſs'd by thoſe heavy Burdens which always attend an Abſolute Power, and without which even Arbitrary Power it ſelf can never be great; and who Rules the moſt Flouriſhing <hi>States</hi> in the Univerſe ſo happily and with ſuch Juſtice, Equity, Gentleneſs and Wiſdom, that notwithſtanding the vaſt difference of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, one may find in the Commonwealth all the duty and reſpect of Subjects without any derogation to its Liberties; and in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, all the Liberty of a Free People conſiſtent with the Fealty and Allegiance due to a Sovereign.

               <p>The 22th of <hi>October</hi> being the Term allow'd in the Separate Article of the 10th of <hi>September,</hi> the Peace was Sign'd between the Empire and <hi>France,</hi> according to the Project given by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours, and the Memorial of the 21th of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> and by it the <hi>French</hi> quitted to the Empire all <hi>Briſgow</hi> and <hi>Alſatia</hi> on the Right ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> with the Towns of <hi>Briſach</hi> and <hi>Fribourg,</hi> the Fort of <hi>Kehl</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Philipsbourg,</hi> all on the ſame ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> together with the Territories belonging to the Electorate of <hi>Treves,</hi> and the Palatinate on the left ſide of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> and oblig'd themſelves farther, to demoliſh all the Forts they had upon that River on the right ſide of it; and moreover <hi>Montroyal</hi> and <hi>Traerbach</hi> upon the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> after which they were to be reſtor'd to the Elector of <hi>Treves,</hi> together with the Town of <hi>Treves</hi> in the Condition it was then: They likewiſe ingag'd to reſtore the Dutchy of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Barre</hi> in the Condition wherein <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth enjoy'd it in the Year 1670, only they reſerv'd to themſelves the Town of <hi>Saar-Lonis,</hi> with a diſtrict of half a League about it, and the Town and Provoſtſhip of <hi>Longwy</hi> upon the Frontier of <hi>Lorrain</hi> towards <hi>Luxembourg;</hi> for which Towns the <hi>French</hi> promis'd to give an Equivalent of the ſame Extent and Value in one of the three Biſhopricks, as it ſhould be agreed upon between Commiſſioners appointed by the <hi>French</hi> King and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and farther, to give back the Dutchy of <hi>Deux-Ponts</hi> to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the County of <hi>Mont-belliard</hi> to the Dukes of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg,</hi> with all the Mannors and Feudſhips belonging to the ſaid Family in the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Franche-Comte;</hi> the Towns and Biſhopricks of <hi>Wormes</hi> and <hi>Spire,</hi> the firſt to the Grand Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order, and the latter to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Treves:</hi> And the Elector Palatine re-entering in the Poſſeſſion of all his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and Revenues on both ſides of the <hi>Rhine</hi> by this Treaty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they were reſtor'd at the Peace of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> the

Emperour and the <hi>French</hi> King were nam'd to be Arbitrators of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s Pretenſions, in which if they did not agree, that then the Pope ſhould decide that Matter according to the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Empire; and in the mean while that the Elector Palatine ſhould allow the Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans</hi> a Yearly Penſion of 200000 Livers <hi>French</hi> Money.

               <p>The Treaty being Sign'd between the Empire and <hi>France,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently a General Peace eſtabliſh'd among all the Parties concern'd,

the King came then to the <hi>Hague</hi> on the 29th, attended by the Prince of <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> where his Princeſs came to wait upon His Majeſty to Complement him upon the Peace, and take her leave before her parting for <hi>Italy</hi> with the Prince her Husband, who were lodg'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Oud Hoff,</hi> one of the King's Palaces at the <hi>Hague.</hi> All the Plenipotentiary Ambaſſadours and Forreign Miniſters went to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement the King upon his Arrival and the Concluſion of the Peace, and among them the three <hi>French</hi> Plenipotentiaries came there the next day in a Body, by the <hi>French</hi> King's order, and had an Audience in Form as his Ambaſſadours Extraordinary, to make the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The Fourth of <hi>November</hi> (being the King's Birth day) was kept at the <hi>Hague</hi> with a great deal of Solemnity, the Court was throng'd <note place="margin">Nov.</note> with Forreign Miniſters upon this occaſion, and the <hi>French</hi> Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries eſpecially made their Complement to His Majeſty upon his Birth-day; and in the Evening a Magnificent Ball was given by the Prince and Princeſs of <hi>Vaudemont</hi> at the <hi>Oud Hoff.</hi> After this the King waited only for a fair Wind to bring him over to <hi>England,</hi> and went ſome few days after to <hi>Oranje-Polder</hi> to imbark, but the Wind coming about contrary, His Majeſty went back to the <hi>Hague:</hi> At laſt the Wind coming fair, the King imbark'd at <hi>Oranje Polder</hi> the 13th in the Morning, and happily arriv'd at <hi>Margate</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> the 14th of <hi>November</hi> between Ten and Eleven in the Morning, and went to lay that Night at <hi>Canterbury:</hi> The 15th, His Majeſty came to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> in order to make his Publick Entry the next day in the City of <hi>London,</hi> where His Majeſty was then receiv'd with all the Solemnity and Magnificence that Loyalty and Affection accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an Univerſal Joy could be capable of, to ſee His Majeſty return Safe to his Kingdom after ſo many Fatigues and Dangers, ſo many Campagnes and Voyages, Battles and Sieges, with the Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch of a Happy and Honourable Peace in his Hand; and the Lord-Mayor and Citizens of <hi>London</hi> had made it their particular Requeſt to receive His Majeſty publickly, to expreſs thereby their Affection, Duty and Gratitude upon ſuch an Occaſion, in a manner ſuitable to the Wealth and Grandeur of that Famous and Renowned City; in the Particulars, of which Magnificent Reception, 'tis not my Buſineſs to enter at preſent, as belonging properly to the Hiſtory of <hi>England:</hi> I ſhall only add, that His Majeſty receiv'd afterwards Congratulatory
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95917:81"/>
Addreſſes from all Parts of his Dominions for his ſafe Return, after having Happily terminated a moſt Obſtinate and Expenſive War; carried on for ſo many Years by our late Enemies, chiefly and on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to bereave him of a Throne he fills with ſo much Fame and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown; and to deprive us of his moſt Juſt and Equitable Government, and of what has a neceſſary Dependence upon it (all that can be Dear and Precious to a People) our Religion, Laws, Priviledges and Liberties. Theſe are Exploits which require the utmoſt Gratitude of all True Patriots and Lovers of their Religion and Country, which can do no leſs than expreſs it ſelf in hearty Prayers to the King of Kings, that he would Bleſs His Majeſty with a Long, Happy and Proſperous Reign over us, as a Juſt Reward of ſo many Glorious Atchievements for our Safety and Preſervation.</p>
               <p>All this while the <hi>French</hi> were not yet ready to Evacuate any of the Places they were oblig'd to reſtore to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by the late Treaty of <hi>Ryſwick;</hi> being firſt, by vertue of it, to carry away all their own Artillery, Ammunitions, Proviſions and Stores, and leave behind them the Artillery and quantity of Stores they found in theſe places at the taking of them: 'Tis true, the Evacuating of theſe Towns requir'd ſome time upon this account, but 'tis very probable that the <hi>French</hi> delay'd the fulfilling of this Article purpoſely, till they ſaw what Succeſs the Treaty they had Sign'd on the 22th of <hi>October</hi> with the Empire, ſhould have at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> where 'twas likely to meet with a conſiderable Oppoſition from the Proteſtant Princes in the Ratification; for if the Treaty, inſtead of being Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied there, had been declar'd Illegal and Derogatory to the Treaty of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and to the Articles provided therein in behalf of the Proteſtant Religion, it would not have been very convenient for the <hi>French</hi> King's Affairs, that <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> and other places to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd by the Treaty of the Tenth of <hi>September,</hi> ſhould be in the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s hands.</p>
               <p>The Plenipotentiaries of the Proteſtant Princes having refus'd to Sign the Treaty between the Empire and <hi>France</hi> on the 22th of <hi>October,</hi> had ſtill ſome Conferences with thoſe of <hi>France</hi> to find a temper for the fourth Article, ſo as they might Sign joyntly with the reſt of the Empire, but they were all to no purpoſe: <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> had bor'n the Burden of a long and very Expenſive War, and their Trade and Commerce (the very Springs of all their

               <p>The Treaty between <hi>France</hi> and the Empire being Ratified within the Term prefix'd in the Articles, it was thereupon exchang'd at <hi>Ryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> having ſecur'd this Point, reſtor'd, immediately after, the Towns of <hi>Mons, Ath, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroy</hi> and <hi>Courtray</hi> in the Low-Countries, and <hi>Barcelona, Gironne, Roſes</hi> and <hi>Belver</hi> in <hi>Catalonia</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but they did not quit the Dutchy of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> till the Month of <hi>January</hi> following, when <hi>la Roche</hi> and <hi>Arlon,</hi> little Fortreſſes upon the Frontier towards the <hi>Pays de Liege,</hi> were deliver'd up to <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſons on the 17th; and the 19th they took Poſſeſſion of the Town of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> whereof the Count <hi>d'Autel</hi> General of the Palatine Troops had been appointed Governour by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> through the Queen's Intereſt, being the Elector Palatine's Siſter.</p>
               <p>By this time all or moſt of His Majeſty's National Forces, Horſe and Foot, had left <hi>Flanders,</hi> and were paſs'd the Seas and got over into <hi>England, Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> except ſix <hi>Scots</hi> Regiments of Foot, which the States have taken into their Pay and Service; being thoſe of <hi>Lauder, Murray, Walter Collier, Ferguſon, Strathnaver</hi> and <hi>George Hamilton,</hi> and the three <hi>French</hi> Battallions of <hi>Refugies</hi> of <hi>la Meloniere, Belcaſtel</hi> and <hi>Marton,</hi> My Lord <hi>Gallway</hi>'s Horſe, and

the Marquis <hi>de Mirmont</hi>'s Dragoons which are ſtill kept in His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Service in <hi>Flanders:</hi> And the <hi>French</hi> were then working to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh the Works on the <hi>Rhine</hi> and elſewhere, which are to be Raz'd by the Treaty, and to evacuate thoſe which they are to reſtore to the Empire; but as yet have not perform'd it, however we need not doubt but they will, and News are daily expected of their having begun with <hi>Philipsbourg</hi> and deliver'd it up to an Imperial Garriſon; but theſe Affairs do not come directly within the compaſs of this Hiſtory, and therefore I need not ſpeak any more about them, leſt that ſhould ſwell this Account to too great a Bulk; which is long enough already, and longer than I would have made it, if it could have been done conveniently without omitting ſome Material Paſſages.</p>
               <p>I have no more to add, but ſome few ſhort Reflexions upon the Peace lately agreed upon at <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> which brings this Hiſtory to a moſt happy Period, and to its wiſh'd for Concluſion; the Negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations whereof have been carried on with more Calmneſs, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility and Expedition, than any General Treaty we can read of before, notwithſtanding ſeveral Occaſions, which have offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeaſonably enough to take hold of them, thereby to diſturb or prolong this great Work. We have ſeen the King of <hi>Sweden, Charles</hi> the Eleventh, (who by his Mediation had ſo wiſely manag'd Affairs, as to bring the Plenipotentiaries of the ſeveral Princes and States ingag'd in the War, together, in order to open their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences) <note n="*" place="margin">April 5. 1697.</note> dye, as 'twere, upon the very Threſhold of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and yet the Treaty not delay'd at all by ſo Fatal an Accident: The Regency under his Succeſſor <hi>Charles</hi> the Twelfth, who was then a Minor, carried on the Mediation without any Intermiſſion, by diſpatching new full Powers to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Miniſter at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and both the Allies and <hi>France</hi> receiv'd it without any Wrangling or Heſitation; which, as on the one hand it redounded very much to the Glory and Honour of the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſo on the other, it demonſtrated plainly the Sincerity of the moſt Powerful Parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the War, and that they deſir'd in earneſt the Peace and Quiet of their own Dominions, and the General Repoſe of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. We have ſeen <hi>France</hi> gain conſiderable Advantages over the Allies, both in Land and Sea Expeditions the laſt Campagne, and yet not ſtand upon much higher Terms for it in the Treaty, unleſs it
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95917:83"/>
was the keeping of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> and the giving an Equivalent for it; which, if duly conſider'd, was as much for the Advantage of the Empire, as <hi>Strasbourg</hi> was for that of <hi>France;</hi> for <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> an Imperial Town, would have made but a very weak Barriere to the Empire, but as it is now, that the Empire has the Fort of <hi>Kehl</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> and all the Forts and ſtrong Places on the right ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> it ſeems to be in a better Condition to hinder the <hi>French</hi> from paſſing of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> than in the State 'twas left by the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen:</hi> And indeed 'twas well for the Peace and Quiet of <hi>Europe,</hi> that thoſe met with moſt Succeſs the laſt Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne, who wanted Peace the moſt; elſe a General Peace could not have been negociated with ſo much Expedition, and ſo few Difficulties to overcome: And for this reaſon we find no Loſers in the Treaty, but it ſeems at once Advantagious for all the Parties concern'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spain</hi> has reduc'd the <hi>French,</hi> by its ſtrict Union with the Allies more than by any Efforts of its own, within the Bounds and Limits of the precedent Treaty, notwithſtanding that the <hi>French</hi> were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the whole Dutchy of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> before the War; whereas before, in all the precedent Treaties ſince that of <hi>Vervins,</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> were always giving up conſiderable Towns and Provinces to <hi>France,</hi> and eſpecially in thoſe of the <hi>Pyrenees, Aix la Chappelle</hi> and <hi>Nimeguen.</hi> The Empire has a much ſtronger Frontier by this Treaty than by that of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> conſidering the better Conditions given at preſent to the Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and that <hi>France</hi> has quitted all the Country, Towns and ſtrong places it had on the other ſide of the <hi>Rhine</hi> before, by vertue of the <hi>Weſtphalian</hi> Treaty and that of <hi>Nimeguen;</hi> and although the Empire has quitted <hi>Strasbourg</hi> and deliver'd it up to the <hi>French,</hi> in lieu of <hi>Briſach, Fribourg</hi> and all that <hi>France</hi> had beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> yet having the Fort of <hi>Kehl</hi> by vertue of this Treaty, on the oppoſite ſide of the <hi>Rhine</hi> to <hi>Stras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> it will always be a Curb and a Bridle upon the <hi>French,</hi> and will hinder them from Subſiſting beyond the <hi>Rhine</hi> with an Army, as long as this Place is in the hands of an Imperial Garriſon; which <hi>Strasbourg</hi> of it ſelf could not have done, if it had been reſtor'd to the Empire in the Condition wherein 'twas taken by the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:95917:83"/>
The <hi>States General</hi> have plainly gain'd their Cauſe about the Electo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of <hi>Cologne,</hi> which was one of the Articles upon which <hi>France</hi> declar'd War againſt <hi>Holland,</hi> and by regaining with it the Dutchy of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> to <hi>Spain</hi> in the late Treaty, they have remov'd the <hi>French</hi> altogether from their Frontier, eſpecially from the <hi>Rhine,</hi> whereby they made that Fatal Irruption upon them in the Year 1672. They have likewiſe Parried a Mortal Stroke to their Religion, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and Liberties, by the Happy and Miraculous Turn of Affairs in <hi>England</hi> juſt at the beginning of the Wars, which in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was due to their Aſſiſtance; and their Liberty laying upon the ſame Stake with ours, and the Proteſtant Intereſt all over Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but eſpecially in the United Provinces being imbark'd upon the ſame Bottom with the Fate of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> we may ſay that they have been, together with us, deliver'd from Popery and Slavery.</p>
               <p>As for the Advantages of <hi>France</hi> in this Peace, notwithſtanding that it has loſt all Footing in <hi>Italy</hi> by the Separate Treaty with <hi>Savoy,</hi> by giving back <hi>Pignerol</hi> after a Poſſeſſion of above Sixty Years, to obtain it; that <hi>Lorrain</hi> is reſtor'd upon much better Terms for that Duke and the Empire, than thoſe agreed upon in the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen;</hi> and notwithſtanding the great and prodigious Expences to which the <hi>French</hi> King has been oblig'd, to carry on ſo long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious a War, which in truth he began himſelf, againſt ſo many Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and yet that he is ſtill reduc'd to the Bounds and Limits of the precedent Peace; which for this reaſon looks like ſo much Blood ſhed, and Treaſure ſpent to no purpoſe; that <hi>Cazal</hi> has been taken by the Allies, <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Dinant</hi> reſtor'd, both which were in his Poſſeſſion even at the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen;</hi> and <hi>Luxembourg</hi> given back to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> all which Places were in the hands of the <hi>French</hi> before the beginning of the War; and that he has been oblig'd to evacnate all the Towns and Fortreſſes he has taken ſince, at the Expence of ſo much Blood and Money; and all the Country he was Maſter of beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in Exchange for <hi>Strasbourg:</hi> Yet it muſt be own'd that the <hi>French</hi> King has manag'd the whole War with abundance of Art and Wiſdom; that he has gain'd very great Advantages over the Allies; that he has brought them to make a Peace upon his own Terms, and extricated himſelf very gloriouſly thereby out of all the Difficulties which a Powerful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95917:84"/>
had brought his Kingdom to, not ſo much by the Vigour of their Efforts as by the Neceſſity of his own Affairs, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a Burdenſome and Expenſive War carried on by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt ſo many Potent Enemies, which had reduc'd moſt of the Provinces of <hi>France</hi> to an Univerſal Poverty and Miſery; and at laſt he remains Maſter of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> in <hi>Alſatia, Longwy</hi> and <hi>Saar-Louis</hi> in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> much more to his Advantage than the Equivalents he gives, being thereby in a Condition to hinder <hi>Lorrain</hi> (though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd) from being troubleſome to <hi>France,</hi> and ſtill to keep the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the Empire in awe; and has Power enough left by it, to be ſtill formidable to the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> and to diſturb the Peace and Quiet of Chriſtendom as ſoon as his Coffers are repleniſh'd; unleſs his Adherence to the Publick Faith and Sacredneſs of Treaties, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains him more than the Apprehenſion of the Power and Greatneſs of any of his Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding theſe Advantages on both ſides in the Treaty of <hi>Ryſwick,</hi> it is certain that both <hi>France</hi> and the Allies are fallen very ſhort of their Expectations in the laſt War; <hi>France</hi> propos'd to it ſelf at leaſt to have chang'd the Twenty Years Truce into a perpetual Treaty, in purſuance of the repeated Inſtances made by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour at the Dyet of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> for that purpoſe; and nothing in the World could have prevented, not only this, but even the Ruin of the Proteſtant Religion every where, and with it the Truckling of the Empire, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and United Netherlands, to the Power of <hi>France,</hi> ſave the Happy Wonderful and Sudden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in <hi>England,</hi> when, in all Humane Probability, His Majeſty's Expedition with ſo conſiderable a Body of the States Forces in that Kingdom, muſt have created ſuch Civil Wars, as would have been rather Subſervient to carry on the great Deſigns of <hi>France,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of hindering them; which I think is a ſufficient Argument to convince any Man, unleſs he is byaſs'd by his Paſſions, Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and Intereſt, that it was the doing of that over-ruling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, who, as the Pſalmiſt tells us, <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Maketh the Devices of the People to be of none effect, and caſteth out the Counſels of Princes.</hi> As for the Allies, they had ſufficiently felt the Effects of that Great Power which the <hi>French</hi> had come to by the Treaty of <hi>Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen;</hi> and whilſt the Court of <hi>England</hi> was ingag'd in the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> that turn'd the Scale ſo much, that there could be no reſiſtance for them: But that powerful Kingdom having been ſo
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95917:84"/>
happily and ſuddenly drawn out of the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deliver'd out of its Power, by the late Revolution in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and brought over by it to the ſide of the Allies (in whoſe Cauſe, the Religion, Laws, Priviledges and Liberties of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were ſo nearly concern'd as the Liberties of <hi>Europe</hi> were reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally involv'd in the Deſtiny of that Nation) ſo the Allies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd very great Hopes thereupon of reducing <hi>France</hi> to much lower Conditions than the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and of hindering it hereafter from diſturbing ſo often the Peace and Quiet of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But ſeveral Accidents have ſtop'd the Progreſs of the Allies Affairs thus far; the firſt has been the War of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which hinder'd <hi>England</hi> from bending the Force of its Arms againſt <hi>France</hi> at the beginning, to imploy them for the three firſt Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnes to recover a Kingdom which ſo undoubtedly belongs to it, and in which it was certainly the Intereſt of the <hi>French</hi> to maintain the War as long as poſſibly they could; not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the perſidious Malice of a Party of Men and unnatural Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, we have at Home, which has weaken'd our Efforts very much, and clogg'd the Progreſs of our Affairs, ſo as to make them often drive heavy: The ſecond has been the Over-ſight of the Imperial Court, in not making a Peace with the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> after the Siege of <hi>Belgrade,</hi> as the <hi>Turks</hi> ſo earneſtly ſollicited it at that time: And the third, The Obſtinacy of the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial at laſt to their true Intereſt, in carrying on ſo unſucceſsful a War in <hi>Hungary;</hi> when by the neceſſity of the Emperour's Affairs, whilſt ingag'd in a War againſt <hi>France,</hi> they could have made a very Advantageous Peace for themſelves; which they ought to have done chiefly, when they found that, notwithſtanding the great Diverſion they expected from the <hi>French</hi> upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the Imperialiſts could give them an intire Rout at <hi>Salankement,</hi> and take in the Campagnes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Guyla</hi> and <hi>Great-Waradin</hi> from them; for which ill Policy they find at preſent but too much reaſon to repent, when they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves left in the Lurch, and to deal with a Powerful Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy; which, now that there is a General Peace in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, can bend all its Forces againſt a weaken'd and drooping Empire.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe Obſtacles being at length happily ſurmounted by the Reduction of <hi>Ireland, France</hi> contriv'd an Invaſion in the Year 1692. to make us look to our own defence at home inſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95917:85"/>
the ſtrength of the Allies abroad, by which though it miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried in the main, yet it gain'd the Town of <hi>Namur:</hi> And the defeat of <hi>Landen</hi> in 1693 having ſhew'd the neceſſity there was for <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> to augment conſiderably their Land Forces, the Scale begun to turn the Campagne following, and the weight of <hi>England</hi> appear'd very conſiderable in the Ballance chiefly in the Campagne of 1695 by the Glorious Recovery of <hi>Namur;</hi> which, if it be true that <hi>France</hi> offer'd to treat upon the Foot of <hi>Nimeguen</hi> before, upon the Iſſue of the Campagne of 1694, ſufficiently juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Conduct of the Allies in the rejecting of it, when the <hi>French</hi> loſt <hi>Cazal</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> at the ſame time: And there is a great deal of reaſon to think that the carrying of the War by the Allies thereafter would have been attended with many other Glorious Advantages and very Fatal to the <hi>French,</hi> had it not been for the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s deſerting of the Common Intereſt, in the Campagne of 1696; and (what was, may be, in ſome meaſure the Cauſe of it) the Money difficulties which happen'd in <hi>England</hi> at that time and oblig'd us to Reform our Coin, which had been Clipp'd and Debas'd almoſt to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; ſo that it could bear no Price abroad, but muſt have hinder'd our Armies at laſt from Subſiſting in <hi>Flander</hi>'s, and drawn the loſs of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> after it without a ſpeedy Remedy: And as we could not carry on the War nor indeed our Trade without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our Coin, ſo <hi>France</hi> expected we ſhould be reduc'd to ſuch Extremities in the doing of it, as might have put a People together by the Ears that is not us'd to want, which would have made it worth its while to continue a War, in which it would once more have had a fair Chance to ſubdue the League and Compaſs its great Deſignes by the Ruine of <hi>England.</hi> This may be reckon'd the true Cauſe both of the inaction and weakneſs of the Allies for the two laſt Campagnes, and of the continuing of the War then by the <hi>French</hi> King; But though our Money difficulty's occaſion'd in a great meaſure this prolonging of the War by the <hi>French,</hi> yet our overcoming of them ſo happily and in ſo little a time, (which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the vaſt and unexpected Wealth of a Nation they reckon'd altogether impoveriſh'd, and which was repreſented as ſuch by our Domeſtick Enemies) has made amends for it in opening the Eyes of our late Enemies, and letting them ſee that the Continuation of the War would Ruin <hi>France</hi> before it could Beggar <hi>England;</hi> which has contributed very much to facilitate and bring about that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95917:85"/>
Univerſal Peace which <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> now Enjoys. And though the Allies have fallen ſhort of their Expectations in the War, and that <hi>France</hi> ſtill continues in the main upon the Foot of the Treaty of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> yet <hi>England</hi> having ſo ſucceſsfully rcover'd its Liberties and maintain'd and vindicated the Liberties of all <hi>Europe</hi> at the ſame time, it is thereby in a Condition to ballance Affairs enough to keep <hi>France</hi> quiet and to make it obſerve the Terms of the laſt Treaty, unleſs it would run the Risk of an Alliance which, hereafter, would be more fatal to it than ever.</p>
               <p>My laſt Reflexion ſhall be about the Advantages which <hi>England</hi> has gain'd by the preſent Peace. As for the King, he has rais'd an Eternal Monument of Fame and Glory to himſelf by it, in bringing of a War (in which he had already gain'd an Endleſs Renown in expoſing his Perſon ſo freely to all the Dangers and Fatigues of it every Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne) to ſo happy a Period, in ſpight of all the difficulties which ſeem'd rather to intail it upon himſelf and his Dominions; in ſteering all along ſo juſtly and nicely among all the different Parties, Nations, Religions and Intereſts that made up the Body of the Allies, as to bring them to joyn and Center together in effecting his Peaceable and quiet Settlement upon the Throne of theſe Realms, even, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding too many ill Succeſſes in the Courſe of the War both for his and their Affairs; and by this Union among the Chief Powers of the League ſo ſtrictly carried on, and ſo happily manag'd (of which the <hi>French</hi> themſelves when Enemies, gave the <note n="*" place="margin">Father <hi>la Rue</hi> his Funeral Oration upon the Marechal of <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg.</hi>
                  </note> Applauſe to our Great Prince) to compaſs an Honourable Peace for his Allies as well as for himſelf. But the Glory of Kings does not alwayes make the Happineſs of Subjects, this would not amount to ſo much for us, if the welfare of <hi>England</hi> was not joyn'd with it; and here it is that we muſt take a view of the Advantages which <hi>England</hi> reaps at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by that Peace it owes to the Wiſdom and Valour of our Good and Gracious as well as Great Sovereign; in which caſe it would be enough to ſay that <hi>England</hi> has gain'd its cauſe by it, and compaſs'd the great and noble deſign, it did chiefly aim at in the War, of recovering under. His Majeſty's Government, its Rights, Priviledges and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which had been ſo notoriouſly violated before; and of ſecuring thereby the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion not onely amongſt us but in the reſt of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> which was then in ſo manifeſt and apparent a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by the violent Irruptions of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Government; ſo as for the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95917:86"/>
future we might intail both our Religion and Liberties to Poſterity upon a ſurer and more ſolid Foundation then they could have, when in the reach of Tyranny and Arbitrary Power: But over and above (which indeed is but a neceſſary conſequence of the former) <hi>England</hi> is again re inſtated in its prerogative of holding the Ballance of <hi>Europe,</hi> and keeping a due <hi>aequilibrium</hi> among the contending Powers of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> as it is its true intereſt; for Popery nor Arbitrary Power can hardly be introduc'd amongſt us but by a pernicious Adherence or rather Servility to one ſide or t'other, to render it formidable thereby to the reſt of the World, by this means to compaſs ſuch Tyrannical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns under the ſhelter of it; and I think we have had but too much experience already to vouch for the Truth of this Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>England</hi> has ſo gloriouſly recover'd itſelf, and is reinſtated in the Umpireſhip of the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> by gaining of our Cauſe in the happy Concluſion of a War in which we were ſo neceſſarily ingag'd, ſo conſequently is it in our Power to make the preſent Peace Solid, Laſting and Durable; for neither ſide will think it their advantage to be troubleſome whilſt a powerful Umpire is reſolv'd to maintain the Ballance of Affairs. Whilſt <hi>England</hi> is in this Condition, it is in its true Poſture, and as it ſhould be; but in order to keep and maintain our ſelves in it, theſe two things ſeem to be abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: The firſt is a Careful regard to the State of Affairs abroad, not to look upon them with an indifferency becauſe we are in an Iſland happily divided from the reſt of the World, which frees us from a great many of its Commotions and Diſturbances; but whenever this point of the Umpireſhip (in which our own Safety as well as Glory is ſo nearly concern'd) lies at Stake, then to ingage heartily and freely for the Liberty of <hi>Europe;</hi> for otherwiſe we muſt at length become a Prey our ſelves, or be involv'd in a War at laſt which will then coſt us more Millions, than in taking things at the beginning it would have coſt us Hundred Thouſands of Pounds; for the Truth of which I need but appeal to the vaſt Expences of the late War: The Second is Peace and Unity among our ſelves; for, beſides, that this Umpire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Affairs of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> wholly depends upon it, which will always ſhelter us from Enemies abroad at the ſame time that it makes us great in the World, it is the onely bottom that the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and with it our Religion, Priviledges and Liberties can ſtand upon; for their Fate is at preſent inſeparable, and I may

boldly venture to ſay, that as Affairs are now in <hi>Europe,</hi> if our (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Diviſions ſhould work to that height as to produce a Change, (which God forbid) no Revolution can happen in <hi>England</hi> from the preſent Government, but for Popery and Tyranny, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a very great Miracle to prevent it; which is a Risk no wiſe Proteſtant can expoſe the Common Intereſt of all that call themſelves Reformed to: And therefore whatever Deſignes too many people amongſt us may directly propoſe to themſelves in carrying off of Factions and Diviſions to work a Change of Affairs either in Church or State to their own Advantage, of what ſide ſoever they may be yet in effect they onely work for their own Deſtruction, and muſt of Courſe be involv'd in the Ruines of that very Fabrick which they endeavour to pull down, and thus open the only remaining Inlet to <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery:</hi> And I pray God that all that call themſelves Proteſtants may lay theſe things ſeriouſly to their Hearts, that ſo our own Diviſions may not one day effect what all the Power of <hi>France</hi> prompted and incouraged by the Treacherous and baſe Contrivances of an Unnatural Party of Men at home, has not been able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and to this End may the God of Peace guide our judgements in all things, and endow our Hearts with a healing Chriſtian Charity among our ſelves (which is the onely Bond of Peace) ſo that, though we cannot bring Matters to an exact Uniformity of Sentiments in Matters of Religion, yet thereby we may at leaſt be hinder'd from <hi>biting</hi> and <hi>devouring</hi> one another, which cannot end otherwiſe but in a Common Ruin, and united in the Methods of a mutual defence, as we have at preſent, more than over, an Unity of Intereſt againſt the Common Adverſary.</p>
