         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

growth, and fruits of Dividing.
Principles, Dispositions, and Practices in these
Kingdomes, not being totally innocent therein
my self, in my unexperienced youth; Had I
seen so much bloud shed, so many Governments
overturned, and so many Ministers openly reviled, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
ejected, silenced, and so many damnable heresies risen up;
and all this done in the Name of God; Had I my self been one
of them that have been cast out of my publick Ministry and
maintenance, with about 1800 more at once, and seen the pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
case of too many Congregations in the land; and all this as
the fruit of former Church-Divisions, obstinately continued
twenty years, (to look no farther) and the new effect of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59274:4"/>
same spirit still working in both extremes; I say, Had I seen
and felt all this, and yet taken the spirit, the principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
of Division, in one side or other, for a virtue, or a little
sin, I had been guilty of such horrid, wilful blindness, as every
Christian's soul should hate: And had I seen what strong tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are lately given to propagate these evils; and what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
Satan hath got by the malignity of some, to increase the
bitter censoriousness of others, and to pull down the good old
principles of Concord, on pretence that now the case is changed?
Had I seen the fruits of Gods indignation against a self-destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
people, in <hi>Londons</hi> plague, and dreadful flames, and in our
present Church-convulsions? Had I seen what visible dangers
are over us, of a condition yet worser than all this? Had I seen
how many thousand honest Christians are in danger of being
<hi>sinners</hi> or <hi>sufferers</hi> by this evil; I say, had I stood by, and seen
all this, and held my tongue, and let men sight like Dog and
Bear, and not interposed a word of counsel or controulment to
the wasting fire? I had been guilty of an obduratious self-saving,
and perfidious silence, unbeseeming the Ministry, or the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
name.</p>
               <p>Having therefore begun long ago to publish my Testimony
and Council against the <hi>Dividing-evils;</hi> in 1660 fore-seeing the
critical day and danger, I took the liberty of the season once
more, to discharge my Conscience, though with slender hopes,
and to reason, and even beg for Peace; that had it been possible
as much as in us lay, we might have lived peaceably with all.
When those opportunities and hopes were gone, (and some
glimmering once and again since vanished,) <hi>one side</hi> having
discharged me from speaking <hi>to them</hi> any more, and God I think
discharged me at present, I saw nothing more to be attempted
but with <hi>the other;</hi> whose duty for <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>Christian Love</hi>
(after many years silence) I opened in a Treatise called <hi>The
Cure of Church-Divisions:</hi> But yet would not publish it without
an <hi>Addition</hi> of the Duty of those Pastors that most complain
against separation, lest I should exasperate their minds against
those that I instructed, and should tempt them to overlook their
own miscarriages. But more of this then I there adjoyned, it
could not be expected that the Licenser should pass.</p>
               <p>The only man that rose up against this Writing with furious
indignation, was Mr. <hi>Edw. Bagshaw,</hi> a man that had before
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59274:4"/>
written against Bishop <hi>Morley</hi>'s Letter published against me,
and lain in prison many years. And gave the world a notable
proof of one of the chief passages displeasing to them in my
Book; <hi>viz. That there is a marvellous affinity between the spirit
of Persecution, and of sinful SEPARATION, though several
opinions or capacities cause them to operate several wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this time I discerned the <hi>guilty</hi> from the <hi>innocent,</hi> by the
<hi>Cry</hi> which signified their smart. I had seen so much of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of that spirit, that I expected not to escape their sharpest
censure. And verily, I expected neither preferment, nor so
much as <hi>Liberty to preach,</hi> as a reward from the other side, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the favour of those that I knew I was to lose. Nor yet
had I such a contempt of them, or a desire to be bitterly censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and reviled, as to invite men to it (as the <hi>Circumcellians</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned
men to kill them.) I foresaw that some interessed men
would be angry, as supposing that I would hinder their alienating
work, though they could not deny but that I spake the truth:
I foresaw that many that look but to the present day and place,
would say, It was unseasonable, and served the Prelates design,
not considering that their design is not to bad, but that some
things which seem their design, do also seem the design of Christ,
and his Churches good, and mens salvation. I foreknew those
that make uncharitable Divisions their very Religion, would
make it a part of their religious dutys to call me as bad as their
distempers do incline them. These things I prognosticated in
my Preface. As <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith of the Christians martyrdome,
<hi>It is more the choice of our own will, than the effect of your power.
i. e.</hi> We dye because we <hi>will</hi> dye, rather than not do our duty,
by the omission of which we could escape: so I say, I could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
have kept as large an interest in the favour and applause of
all the parties that ever railed at me, as most men of my profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as their own words have told me. What did it gain me
in the world, to do what I have done, to lose the favour of
the Papists, the <hi>Ithacian</hi> Prelatists, the Anabaptists, the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
the Quakers, the seekers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I saw whither the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
of this age did tend. And this was a work that some
body must do, (or else woe to the Ministry that in their very
sufferings would be so unfaithful.) And I thought my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the Uncurable as fit to be cast away, and my self as
fit to bear their slanders, as most of my brethrens, who had more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59274:5"/>
use for an interest in them than I had. And I remembred that
ill-gotten goods must be restored; and without restitution, no
remission: Though I can truly say, that I disliked and decryed
this spirit from my beginnings, yet when I preached first, the
favour and loud applause of some good people, tainted a little
with this disease, did tempt me to please them too often, by
exclaiming too smartly against the corruptions of the Church:
Though I said nothing but what I was confident was true, yet I
think I did not well to cherish their inor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inate censoriousness in
such matters. And having gotten sometime a great stock of
estimation with such angry persons, by means which I dare not
wholly justifie, (though it made me the more capable to do
them good) I did voluntarily surrender it to them again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they took it from me; and I did yield to serve God at the
rate of so small a part of self-denial, rather than be silent at such
a time as this. I have long ago preached to Drunkards and other
ungodly people, till they openly rose against me in tumults in
the streets, and sought my life. And shall I forbear to speak
that truth to <hi>Ignorant-proud</hi> Dividers, which is necessary to heal
the Church and them, and all for fear lest their passion and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
should shew their guilt, by their calling me what they are
themselves. They call out for <hi>Valiantness</hi> in <hi>suffering</hi> themselves:
And shall <hi>I</hi> be so <hi>cowardly</hi> as to fear <hi>their</hi> false reports? They cry
out against the <hi>fear of man:</hi> And shall <hi>I fear their</hi> impotent revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings?
They will be my witnesses, that it is a duty to deny our
selves, and to forsake all for the Cause of Christ: And I am as
certain that Love and Unity are his Cause, as I am that he is
the Christ: And shall I think the good thoughts and words of
some of his froward Children, too great a matter to forsake and
lose: They themselves think that we should rather suffer a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or death, then joyn with the holiest Minister and people in the
use of the Common Prayer: And should I that know the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
think, that LOVE and CONCORD are not matters more
worthy to be suffered for? When first the City and Countrey
had sounded with abundance of untruths about my Book, while
it was yet but in the Press, at last the man that openly assaulted
it when it came forth, did use the same instruments which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
decryed, and filled his Libel with as many untruths as ever
I saw heaped up in so small a room (except <hi>once</hi> in <hi>such another
piece,</hi> that was about eight years elder.) And the <hi>Cause</hi> it self
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59274:5"/>
he shamefully slip'd over; as if his <hi>spirit</hi> and <hi>interest</hi> had direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to <hi>no other means,</hi> but only to attempt to asperse the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that was against him: I wondred that no soberer a man rose
up to defend <hi>Dividing-Principles.</hi> And I was glad, that in an
age of such Temptations, he had no more approvers among
the Ministers. When I had answered that Libel, he sent forth
another, which instead of professing repentance, did double the
number of his <hi>Vntruths,</hi> and cast out more of his bilious excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but pretended also to say somewhat for his <hi>Separating.</hi>
Principles and Cause. When I had replyed to that, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
him to repent of his false Doctrines and Crimes,
and above fourscore visible <hi>Vntruths,</hi> he hath vented a third
Libel, of which I am now to give you a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>

               <p>I Must needs again remember the Readers, 1. That the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of my Book was not <hi>particular,</hi> to reconcile men only
to the Parish Churches; but <hi>universal,</hi> against those <hi>Principles</hi>
in mens minds, which cause Divisions in all other Churches,
as well as that, and will never suffer Christians to Unite and
Agree where they prevail.</p>
               <p>2. That I was so far from perswading any Minister to the
present <hi>Conformity,</hi> that I perswaded not the Readers, 1. Either
to use the Ceremonies; 2. or to communicate with any Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors;
3. or to own Diocesans; 4. nor to communicate with,
or own a Diocesan Church; 5. nor to communicate with, or
own any Parish Minister, that is intolerable, through <hi>Insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Heresie,</hi> or <hi>Wickedness;</hi> 6. nor to speak one false word, nor
to do one sinful action, to obtain Communion with the best
Church in the world; 7. nor to prefer Communion with a <hi>worse
Church</hi> and <hi>Minister,</hi> before Communion with a better, where it
may be had, without greater loss than benefit; 8. nor to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
any lawful endeavours in private for each others good;
9. nor to forsake a lawful faithful Pastor, merely because he is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59274:6"/>
cast out of the Tythes and Temple; 10. nor to take a man for
your Pastor, merely because he hath possession of the Tythes and
Temple; 11. nor that a lawful faithful Minister should give
over his Ministerial work, or not perform it to the best Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Church, whoever is displeased by it, or whatever
it cost him; which I take to be downright <hi>Perfidiousness</hi> against
his <hi>Ordination,</hi> and <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> as being the alienation of a devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
consecrated person; (yea, greater Sacrilege than alienating
Church Lands.) 12. Nor did I perswade any Minister, that
instead of <hi>flying to another City</hi> (as Christ once commanded)
he must needs fly from all Cities: (For the Diocesans that think
Cities only were the seats of Churches and Bishops, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr,
that if it be lawful to desert the souls of all in Cities and
Corporations, it is but a little step farther to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sert the Villages
also.) 13. Nor did I ever perswade any Minister to go to a
Parish Church in City or Corporation, who is by Law forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to come within five miles of it; and who by appearing
there, doth put himself into prison for six months in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Jayl. 14. Nor did I ever perswade any to hear the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer, or go to the Parish Churches, merely for fear of
punishment, and to save themselves. None of all these were the
matters I that medled with.</p>
               <p>3. But the things that I perswaded men to, were these; 1. To
disclaim the foresaid <hi>Love-killing</hi> and <hi>Church-dividing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
2. Particularly to joyn with a Parish Church, that hath
a good Minister, and that ordinarily, in case you can enjoy no
better, without more loss than the benefit is like to be. 3. And
extraordinarily to joyn sometimes with such a Parish, even when
you have a better, to shew by what Principles you walk; unless
when some apparent hurt forbid it, which for that time is like to
be greater than the good.</p>
               <p>Pardon this Repetition of the state of my Case; for without
it I cannot be understood, and his repeated untruths require it.
And now to his third Libel, called the Review.</p>
               <p>Sect. 1. The Title Page speaks of <hi>[All</hi> my <hi>immodest calumnies
confuted]</hi> when 1. He neither proveth one Calumny in my
Book; nor confuteth one detection of his Untruths.</p>
               <p>Sect. 2. He cunningly tells you, in an Advertisement, that
ten or eleven have read his present, citations of my words; As if
that justified fourscore falshoods before written.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59274:6"/>
               <p>Sect. 3. Pag. 1. He confesseth it is [<hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi>] to
publish fourscore <hi>Vntruths</hi> in five or six sheets of Paper; And yet
thinks not himself obliged (it seems) any farther to vindicate
himself, by one considerable word, but as it were by hoping
<hi>his Readers</hi> will not believe that he was [so <hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>wicked.</hi>]
Doth Church-discipline require no better defence? nor no
more repentance for above fourscore published Untruths than
this?</p>
               <p>Sect. 4. Instead of Repentance, he inviteth his Readers to
usurp Gods prerogative, as he doth, and to judge my <hi>Heart,
that it was never truly humbled,</hi> and that my <hi>Repentance</hi> is <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sect. 5. Thus lying down impenitently under all the crimes,
false doctrines, and untruths which he published, he now puts
them off as <hi>Bye-matters,</hi> and taketh on him to return to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
which he saith was first designedly handled between us,
which he saith is, <hi>[Whether Conformity at this day upon conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
grounds, can be defended by any, or at least with any kind of
honesty, be contended for by you]</hi> Thus he will play small game no
more, nor write Untruths by parcels, but let you know, that
it is not <hi>one untruth</hi> shall be the substance of his discourse. If <hi>tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
the <hi>Church</hi> be a duty, it is not <hi>Railing</hi> to name the sin. I
therefore desire the Church to consider whether it be easie
among the parties that he separateth from, or worse than they
to meet with so great <hi>Impudency</hi> in <hi>forgeries.</hi> I know by equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
almost any words may be verified; But when there
is no explication adjoyned, the rule of humane speech is, that
<hi>Analogum per se positum stat prosignificato famosiore:</hi> that is, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous,
(or equivocal) words put alone without an ex expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
are to be taken in the most common or famous sense.
Now the word [<hi>Conformity</hi>] in its old and usual sense doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
that Conformity by Subscriptions, Oaths, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
which distinguish the people called <hi>Non-conformists</hi> from
the <hi>Conformists,</hi> who yet were notoriously distinguished from
the <hi>Separatists.</hi> It's true, that it may be called <hi>Conformity,</hi> if we
are baptized, if we profess Christianity, if we read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
if we use the common Translation, if we go to hear
a Sermon in publick, if we use the Lords Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all
this we do as the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth. But this is not it
that is notified by the common use of this name. Now do but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59274:7"/>
note the front of the man. 1. The world knoweth that I never
<hi>Conformed,</hi> as the Law obligeth Ministers to do; that I lose my
whole Ministerial maintenance, (much more than ever he did,
all things considered) and which is a thousand times more, the
liberty of my Ministry in publick, because I do not conform.
2. He knoweth that I have professed in all the three Books,
which he writeth against, that I neither am for Conformity, nor
ever wrote for it. He knoweth how distinctly I excluded that
from the Question, and stated the Question far otherwise, which
I meddle with. Yet dare this man make this false profession of
our difference. 3. Yea, when it is [<hi>separation</hi>] in plain words,
and not mere <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> which he undertakes to defend
on his very Title Page. 4. And that I have oft professed to
plead for the same cause that <hi>Dod, Hildersham, Cartwright, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
Bradshaw, Brightman, Ball, Gifford,</hi> and the other <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists</hi>
defended, against the <hi>Separatists</hi> of those times.

               <p>Sect. 6. He again repeateth his most palpable untruth, in
comparing me in the warrs with [<hi>any one whomsoever</hi>] passing
over my answers, [<hi>adding, that Generals or Parliament would
have signified little, had they not had such Chaplains</hi>] when I
had told him, (and he durst not deny it) that the Armies were
raised, before I ever spake to Parliament man or Officer, or
ever preached to them; yea, two years before I was in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
whither I went with an open profession to disswade them
from the changes which they made: my judgment forsaking
their Cause in 1644. when their Commission at the New-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling
left out [<hi>For the King</hi>] which before had run [<hi>For
the defence of the Kings person, &amp;c.</hi>] and the rest of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
evidently to me appearing. Till then, in <hi>Coventry</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,
I did speak all that which in the Book cited by him I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
Nor did I ever say, <hi>I did but little,</hi> as he vainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth.</p>
               <p>Sect. 7. Pag. 3. By a false representation of my Repentance,
(whether ignorantly or maliciously) he would insinuate, that I
Repent of <hi>Good</hi> as well as of <hi>Evil;</hi> or else that such as he, and
his adherents the <hi>Separatists,</hi> have none of that sort of culpabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to repent of; or else that they disclaim so inglorious a thing
as Repentance is, and will stand to their sins at Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59274:7"/>
let God say against them what he will. The first is an
intimation which maketh no small part of his Book to be one
continued Untruth. When one part is spent in making the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and suspicious believe that I wrote for Conformity; the
next is constituted of another Untruth, in the false description
of my Repentance. But I know the design of his railing, is to
draw me to talk of those matters over rashly, (about Wars and
Governments) (which I repent of talking of so much already)
that he may catch somewhat for his Malice to make use of to
a farther end: Fain he would make the world believe that I
must <hi>speak Treason,</hi> or be a <hi>Coward</hi> or a <hi>Turn coat:</hi> Not with
the simplicity as children dare one another into the dirt; but
with the kindness that traps and snares are set for birds, to
catch and kill them. And if <hi>Murderous Malice,</hi> and Lying be
made by Christ the Devils sins, and the marks of his children,
<hi>Ioh. 8. 48. 1 Ioh.</hi> 3. 8. I think those that are notoriously thus self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigmatized,
are fitter to be separated from, than to separate from
others, as unworthy of their good company. I must profess,
that as in my Answers to divers such men as this, I have as near
as I could, imitated my great example, so I cannot see but this
man, and others that have led him this same way, have exactly
imitated the malicious <hi>Pharisees;</hi> And let him be also their imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator,
who thinketh them wiser and more stout and valiant men
than Christ; <hi>Matth. 22. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. Then went
the Pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his
talk,</hi> (that they might either accuse him of Treason, as after
they did, or else make the people hate him, as a favourer of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Tyranny, as they accounted it) <hi>Master, we know that
thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth</hi> (and wilt not
hide thy judgement by dark speeches, nor bauk plain truth:)
<hi>neither carest thou for any man; for thou regardest not the persons of
men:</hi> (O malicious commendations!) <hi>Tell us therefore what
thinkest thou: Is it lawful to give tribute unto</hi> Caesar, <hi>or not?
But Iesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me,
ye hypocrites? shew me the Tribute money: And they shewed him a
penny. And he saith unto them, Whose is this Image and Superscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption?
They say unto him</hi> Caesars. <hi>Then saith he unto them, Render
therefore unto</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesars, <hi>and unto</hi> God <hi>the
things that are</hi> Gods. I hope Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi> will neither say, that
Christ here plainly decided the controversie intended by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59274:8"/>
questioners; nor yet deny but he <hi>seemeth</hi> to do it, so far as silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
his adversaries then, and as putteth Expositors hard to it
now, to understand his meaning: (See Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on the
words.) And I am in some hope yet, that as foul-mouth'd as
he is, he will not call Christ a Lyar, or dissembler, or a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of Tyranny, or a Coward; that would say any thing to
escape sufferings; But rather of the two think that he is not
deceived, who thinketh his own way somewhat like to the <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous-Tempting-Hypocrites</hi>
in the <hi>Text.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for my Repenting, which he ignorantly and maliciously
talketh of, I shall now say no more to the Reader, but this:</hi>
1. That I expect that the enemies of Repentance be enemies to me.
2. That I little regard such censures as this man, who either cannot
through ignorance, or will not through malice or passion, understand
plain <hi>English</hi> when he readeth it; nor know the difference between
the disowning of Evil, and of Good.</p>
               <p>Sect. 8. pag. 4. He intimateth by a Question this visible
falshood, that I said, [<hi>I thought nothing of Divinity in the
cause,</hi>] so hard is it for Ignorance and rashness to speak truth.
This is because I said that [<hi>I knew of no controversie in Divinity
about it, but in Politicks and Law.</hi>] And can one that hath ever
learned to read <hi>English,</hi> and ever exercised his thoughts of
such matters, be possibly so ignorant, as to think this is all one
as to say, that <hi>there was nothing of Divinity in the cause?</hi> Their
<hi>Controversies were, whether the Parliament had Authority to raise
their Arms against the Kings will, prohibition, and opposition?
And, whether the King had Authority to raise his Arms against
theirs?</hi> And is this a Controversie in Divinity? Poor souls!
Will you be seduced to think that Christ or <hi>Paul</hi> must decide
all controversies of <hi>forms and degrees of power</hi> in Republicks?
Which Text is it that telleth you, that the <hi>Militia</hi> belonged to
the Parliament, or what degree of power the Courts of Justice
have? Did <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. tell you, whether <hi>Nero</hi> or the Senate
were the higher power? Did Christ tell the tempting hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
whether <hi>Caesar</hi> justly coined money in, or for <hi>Iudaea?</hi>
But what? Hath Divinity therefore nothing to do in Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies?
Yes surely, both about the efficient, end, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.
Politicks and Law tell us <hi>which is the highest power;</hi> And
Divinity telleth us, that <hi>we must obey it,</hi> and that <hi>for conscience-sake,
as being of God.</hi> Divinity telleth you, that <hi>Religious interest
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59274:8"/>
may be the just end and motive of a War:</hi> but withall, that <hi>it must
be made by those only that have just power to do it:</hi> But <hi>who hath
just power,</hi> the Laws must tell us. Thus, Reader, the mans
ignorance and false speaking have lengthened thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Sect. 9. <hi>Ib.</hi> [That my <hi>Love of ease and fear of suffering</hi>] cause
strange changes in my <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>carnal understanding,</hi> is at least
a single untruth, and may be a double one, for ought he knows,
that knoweth not the heart: I am sure it is a fault, even in
Mr. <hi>Bagshaw,</hi> to make himself a <hi>Heart-searching-God,</hi> while
he maketh the Prayers of his betters to be <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sect. 10. <hi>Ib.</hi> But he professeth, that he dealeth thus [in <hi>Zeal
to the Glory of God, Love to the Cause of Christ and Non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which I have deserted.</hi>] Where, 1. It is a repeated falshood
that I have <hi>deserted the Cause of Non-conformity:</hi> I challenge
him openly to name even one point of it, in which I have chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
my judgment these 31 yeares: (which I speak not as my
praise, who in those things have grown no wiser, except in
knowing the same things better) to this day. 2. What sin will
you call it to father all these falshoods on [<hi>the Glory of God,
and the Cause of Christ?</hi> Doth his <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> need mens
Lies? How many hundreds thus in a few more Libels may you
publish, if Satan bless them, as hitherto he hath done, with an
<hi>Increase</hi> and <hi>Multiply.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Sect. 11. pag. 5. He reciteth many words of my Disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Church Government, and laboureth (whether by gross
Ignorance or malice, I know not) to perswade the Reader that
I retract or contradict them; and saith [<hi>We stand amazed you
should so soon and so much forget all that you have said.</hi>]</p>
               <p>This is not a single falshood, but maketh up no small part of
his Book. Reader, do but hear, and judge whether any thing
except his <hi>Amareduci</hi> can excuse such horrid deliberate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths?
1. I never retracted any of that book, setting aside the
Dedication. 2. I do still profess that I am of the same judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which that book expresseth. 3. I have in the greatest au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
told the Bishops, that I <hi>stand to it,</hi> and provoked them
to answer it. 4. There is not a word of contradiction to that
Book, in my Cure of Church-Divisions, which he writes
against: And am I not as like to understand my own writings
as this man is? 5. That very Book pleadeth as much, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59274:9"/>
much more for a moderate Episcopacy, the lawfulness of a
Liturgy, and those circumstances or ceremonies which I judge
lawful, (as kneeling at the Sacrament) than my later Books
have done. 6. It was to me a considerable Providence which
drew me, when the Sectaries were at the very highest, to write
that Book, which had I written since the King returned, they
would have imputed to <hi>temporizing,</hi> or a change. 7. The very
same men that now rail so loud against me, said nothing that ever
I could hear of, against that book, that contained more than
Now I have written for; But then it passed uncontradicted by
them that now rail at half as much. So, Is it not a strange fate
which that poor Book incurreth, that the men of both sides
plead it as for them, and commend it, whilst they condemn the
Author, as if he were himself against it. The Reverend Bishop
whom Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi> wrote against, alledged it in the greatest
audience (before his Majesty, Dukes, Lords, and Bishops)
with no less commendation than these words, [<hi>No man hath
spoken better of this than Mr.</hi> Baxter.] And now Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi>
citeth it with applause: Reader, who is in such a case as I? The
Bishop is for my Book: Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi> is for it: And I am the
man that am against my self, whilst I openly tell them both that I
still stand to it as my judgment (only not owning any words that
any party shall justly find to be too sharp.) Surely, they labour
to bring me to that reputation among these contenders, as <hi>Plato</hi>
was among the Philosophers, whom every Sect took to be the
second, or next the best.</p>
               <p>Sect. 12. But pag. 6. he thinks that he talketh like a man of
brains, when he inferreth, that [<hi>if they be such kind of persons as
I have represented them, they ought immediately to be forsaken, and
forborn, as to any acts of Church-communion] Answ.</hi> But, 1. I
never said of them, that they printed, besides false Doctrines,
<hi>fourscore untruths</hi> in two small Libels, as you have done, and
give the world neither vindication nor repentance: And yet you,
or your disciples, will not inferr thus against your self. 2. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
man! Did I ever lay the charge you mention, against
all the honest conformable Pastors of the Parish Churches in the
Land, who have no hand in any thing that you can call an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
or a persecution? Nay, that own not (as they think)
the Diocesan Prelacy as such, but only Episcopacy in general,
and Diocesans, as the Kings Officers? Did I ever lay that
charge against all the Christians in the Parish Churches? No,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59274:9"/>
nor against all the Bishops neither. 3. And must all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
in a Kingdome be excommunicated or forsaken, for the
cause of a few men, whom few of them ever knew or saw.
This is like the Popes interdicting Kingdomes. 4. And if you
separated but from the <hi>individual offenders,</hi> should it not be done
in a regular way? Why go you about to blind the ignorant with
such palpable fallacies as these. Is it truth, that men must be
thus cheated into with errours?</p>
               <p>Sect. 13. pag. 6. From what I said [the Episcopal Churches
would then have been, if they had but had a meer toleration in
the times that openly discountenanced them, when the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
parties should set up by themselves:] he inferreth, as
if I had called them such now, when no other are tolerated, and
that in all those Parishes where are good Ministers, and no
other Churches. Thus palpable falshood is the very life of all
his Libel.</p>
               <p>Sect. 14. <hi>Ib.</hi> The self-contradicting man professeth, to <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Light which I once had</hi> in this, and yet that my <hi>present
Light is nothing else but confusion of darkness;</hi> when I said the
same then in that very Book that now I do, and now own
that book which I wrote then; And all to carry on a
cheating falshood, as if in this I had changed my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Sect. 15. I had almost pass'd over a shameless falshood,
pag. 4. <hi>And that you may know I do not speak at randome, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
when at</hi> Gloucester <hi>you preached upon</hi> [Curse ye Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roz,]
<hi>and now you say you do repent: do you expect ever to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
again?</hi>] which is a mere composition of <hi>Vntruths.</hi> 1. I
never preached on [<hi>Curse ye Meroz</hi>] in my life, if he mean
that text, or those words: I never was at <hi>Gloucester</hi> but about
one month before the Wars: in which I preached thrice or
four times: of which one on a Fast, had respect to the times:
which was on <hi>Ezek. 37. 3. Son of man, Can these bones live?</hi>
And my business was to shew the Difficulty of the reparation
and reformation of a sinful lapsed Church: In which I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
many things, and sorts of people that would hinder it,
but neither my Notes, (which I yet have by me) or memory,
have any thing at all that tended unto War, or resistance of
Authority. Yet if any other Sermon there, did touch the times,
which I remember not, I am sure it was not on that Text which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59274:10"/>
I never preached on. 2. And he as falsly insinuateth that I [<hi>say
I repent</hi>] of what I preached at <hi>Gloucester;</hi> so hard is it to him
to speak that which is not utterly false.</p>
               <p>Sect. 16. pag. 7. In a parenthesis, he saith [<hi>If there be any
(difference between you and us.)</hi>] The Libeller filling three Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
with heinous charges, and after (and before also) que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning,
<hi>Whether indeed there be any difference between him and
me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sect. 17. pag. 8, With as insolent ignorance doth he feign
me to make that which he calleth [<hi>Devised Worship] viz.</hi> the
<hi>Liturgy</hi> to be <hi>Idolatry</hi> in my foresaid Book, and now to repent
of, and oppose what I held: And all because <hi>Disp.</hi> p. 378. I
say <hi>to such as they would suspend, silence, excommunicate, punish,
all such as will not pray to God in the words that they impose on them;
that if Reasons will not allay their impious distemper, but will domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer
over mens consciences, and the Church of God, we must leave
them to him, that being the Lord and Law-giver of the Church,
is jealous of his prerogative, and abhorreth Idols.</hi> Remember that
I spake of none but the Clergy. And is there any man that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth
not in <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>rashness,</hi> that would have thought
here, that it is a Form of Prayer, or Liturgy, that I call [<hi>Idols</hi>]?
or that could not see at the first reading, that I call the <hi>persons</hi>
only the <hi>Idols,</hi> that <hi>usurp the prerogative of God.</hi> And will this
pittiful man still falsly insinuate or suppose, that all the honest
Christians or Ministers of all the Parish Churches in <hi>England</hi>
are such usurping imperious Idols? yea, or all the Bishops ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Even <hi>Martyn</hi> himself as well as <hi>Ithacius?</hi> Thus are poor
souls abused by deceivers. Yea, note that in the same disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cited by him, I largely prove the lawfulness of Liturgies
and Forms, and the necessity of them in some cases.</p>
               <p>Sect. 18. <hi>Ib.</hi> Yet doth he again most falsly say, that [<hi>I have
unworthily receded from what I wrote,</hi> and yet addeth, that <hi>I have
not, that he knoweth of, repented of it. Receded from it, and yet not
repented of:</hi> What a forgetful self-contradicter is this man?
And so he thanketh God <hi>that I was heretofore stirred up to write so
much,</hi> which now condemneth me, even for the same that I
there and then did write, and never repented of.</p>
               <p>Sect. 19. His next subject, where he saith that [<hi>I argue
against the Divine and self-evidencing authority of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>]
is one of the visiblest lyes that ever I saw written by a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59274:10"/>
man: When I had not only <hi>said</hi> the contrary, but told where
I had voluminously <hi>proved it,</hi> to give me not a word of sense in
answer, but write as if he had never read my reply. Being to
<hi>Tell the Church,</hi> I must desire them to consider, Whether a more
<hi>Impudent studied Lye, impenitently insisted in, after a double de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
without an answer,</hi> was ever presented to their view?
And, whether they can name me a Christian Writer in the world
more infamously self-stigmatized with this vice? The rest that
he writeth of it, I cannot perswade my self to tire the Reader
with an answer to. Only I note that he citeth Mr. <hi>Hildersham</hi>'s
words, with the false intimation that I contradict them, while
the same worthy man is both applauded by him, and supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
taken for a Patron of Idolatry, as one that perswadeth
men not onely to come to Church and Common-prayer, but to
come to the beginning. False speakers do thus ordinarily contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
themselves.</p>
               <p>Sect. 20. When pag. 11. he saith, that a <hi>Papist is worse than
of no Religion,</hi> I say no more to him, but that <hi>Overdoing is the
Devils last way of undoing,</hi> and that such men be they that mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
and confirm the Papists.</p>
               <p>Sect. 21. <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 11. he would have you know what Religion
he is of, and how he meaneth to save his Disciples from Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
saying, <hi>Had not I learned the truth of Christian Religion,
from better arguments, and a more certain way of reasoning than
any your books afford, I had still been plunged in the depths of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism.</hi>]
Now, 1. Note that <hi>Reasoning in a certain way,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth
him from Atheism. 2. That he seemeth to say, that he
<hi>was</hi> an <hi>Atheist,</hi> by saying [<hi>I had still continued so.</hi>] But you
must not expect such base mutability from him, as when he hath
denied the <hi>Living God,</hi> to <hi>confess it plainly, and profess repentance.</hi>
3. Note that he <hi>will be an Atheist still,</hi> and it seems perswade the
Separatists to be such, till he hath <hi>better Reasons than my
Books afford.</hi> Now the Reasons that my Books afford are these
(note them Reader.) First, from the witness of God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
in the frame of Nature. Secondly, From the witness of God
our Redeemer, in his supernatural Revelations. 3. From the
witness of God the Holy Ghost, on the Scriptures, and in the
Soul. First, Printing on the Scripture the Image of Gods <hi>Power,
Wisdome, and Goodness</hi> (which is its <hi>self-evidence.</hi>) And next
by the Scripture printing the said Image of Gods <hi>Power, Wisdom,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59274:11"/>
and Goodness</hi> on every <hi>holy soul,</hi> (which none but God is able
to do.) These three Testimonies of the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, is the sum of my <hi>evidence</hi> enlarged. Now Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi>
will <hi>be an Atheist still,</hi> and it seems perswade the Separatists to
be such, till he hath better reasons for his faith, than the witness
of the <hi>Creator,</hi> the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and the <hi>Sanctisier;</hi> God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi> This is his zeal for the Glory of
God, and the Cause of Christ, and the good of souls.</p>
               <p>Sect. 22. Yet pag. 13. with much railing, he insinuateth this
abominable falshood and calumny against Christs excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
that <hi>Calvin, Preston, Hildersham, Perkins,</hi> &amp;c. would
have no more done in asserting a Deity and Christianity, than to
tell men, [<hi>that all is true that God speaketh in his Word,</hi> and that
<hi>propria luce, it is evident that the Scripture is his word, and that to
all Gods elect he will give his spirit to discern it, and thus much alone
is better than all these disputes and reasonings.</hi>] Whereas, 1. These
same men have all of them said much more themselves in their
writings. 2. And <hi>Paul</hi> preached otherwise to the <hi>Athenians,
Acts</hi> 17. and to others. 3. And what kind of preaching would
this man make among <hi>Turks</hi> and Heathens that deny the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
You see, 1. He will leave out all the <hi>Natural evidences
of a Deiy,</hi> and of mans immortal state, and so all the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
in which we are agreed with them. 2. He will leave out
all the Historical proofs that these Books were written by
Christs Apostles and Evangelists, and are not altered since.
And 3. That he will leave out the use of mans Ministry, in
Translating or Preaching; And will let the illiterate Reader
look on a <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Bible, till <hi>propria luce,</hi> they know
it is of God; or at least, that the Minister, when they say, <hi>How
shall I know that this is Gods Word?</hi> shall only bid them read it,
(whether they can or not) and if they be elect, the spirit will
cause them to discern that <hi>propria luce</hi> it will shew it self to be
Gods Word; but if they be not elect, they have no remedy.
And what need Preachers to tell men this? Bibles may be sent
by other hands; and will be <hi>Bibles</hi> whether we preach or not.
And the elect are elect before we preach to them. And if the
man know that Light here is but a Metaphor, what can he
mean by it but [Objective <hi>Evidence.</hi>] And must we only tell
Heathens, that the Scriptures have their proper evidence, and
not tell them what that evidence is? Is this his preaching?
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59274:11"/>
Yet, that you may see what such men would bring the Church &amp;
world to, he adds, p. 13. [<hi>If understand anything of the true nature
of Religion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and warneth all persons</hi> most earnestly that they
go his way; And most falsly addeth, that <hi>I lay my foundation in
the corrupt will of man, and build my superstructure in the carnal
understanding, and leave no room for true holiness and mortification,
but the root of sin within remaineth untouched.</hi> And is not this,
like the Pope, the most uncharitable man of Infallibility, who
hath <hi>better reasonings</hi> against <hi>Atheism,</hi> and for a holy state of
souls, and (unless to forbid all Reasoning be it) will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to open them to the Church, or bless mankind by a noble
communication of them.</p>
               <p>Sect. 23. pag. 14. Having ended, he beginneth again with
his <hi>Witticismes:</hi> And 1. I speak <hi>absurdly and insignificantly,</hi> for
saying of his <hi>Rash,</hi> and <hi>carelesly uttered untruth,</hi> that it's <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
voluntary,</hi> that is, <hi>when the Will omits its office.</hi> Where (saith
this Learned man) <hi>I am much to seek what can be meant by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatively
voluntary; or how any action can be done where the will
omits its office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> And I have no mind to take such a person for my Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
And therefore let me be excused, if I leave him (and such
<hi>proud ignorant persons</hi>) in his beloved ignorance. Let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that a man is a beast, and that his Rational faculties were
not made to rule the sensitive, or that the Will either never
omits its ruling office, or if it do, the sensitive cannot act; or
that the Will is not the principle <hi>quoad exercitium,</hi> of <hi>humane
acts,</hi> as the Intellect is <hi>quoad specificationem;</hi> or that if the Will
omit this imperate act, <hi>ad exercitium,</hi> and the sense lead men
never so far, that yet the Act is not Reputatively Voluntary;
that is, that mans Will not guilty of any privation or omission
of loving God, of feeding our children, of giving to the poor,
of praying, meditating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or that such omissions are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable
to the Will as sins: when all say that all sin is Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.
I do not wonder that this man is against Bishops
tooth and nail; even as they are ordainers: For, as loose as
they are said to be in their ordinations, I doubt whether
they would not reject him for utter Ignorance and insu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience,
who hath no more knowledge of the nature of sin, and
no more reason to cure his Atheism.</p>
               <p>Sect. 24. His next high witticisme is, that I mention [<hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59274:12"/>
obediential power in a carnal Will; which receiving you
call</hi> (saith he) <hi>a passive power; where the Comment is harder than
the Text.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Reader, Dost thou not blush, that among men that
have been at an University, there should be found a man so
<hi>ignorant,</hi> (and so <hi>proud</hi> of it) as not to know what <hi>Potentia
obedientialis</hi> is, in common use of Philosophers and Divines; or
not to know that every creature is passive in receiving the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
influx, or operation; or that <hi>Recipere est pati,</hi> unless when
we take the word <hi>Recipere</hi> analogically and morally. If these
things were but <hi>Hard</hi> to the man, why is he so proud as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
them?</p>
               <p>Sect. 25. The next and last is, when he had said that [<hi>It is
not corruption barely, nor imposition barely, that is a sufficient ground
for any to separate;</hi> I had no rag to cover his [<hi>barely</hi>] with, but
charitably to interpret him, as meaning by <hi>barely</hi> [the <hi>Quate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
or the <hi>Act formally as such,</hi> without taking in the <hi>greatness</hi>
of the <hi>matter</hi> of that <hi>corruption</hi> or <hi>imposition:</hi> that is, That it is
not <hi>Corruption formally, as Corruption,</hi> but the <hi>greatness</hi> of the
matter corrupted; Nor <hi>Imposition formally,</hi> as an Act of Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but as an <hi>imposition</hi> of some ill or unsufferable thing: I
could not have put sense on his words by any other interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Yet doth he so disdain my kindness, and to have so much
<hi>sense</hi> imputed to him, that he pronounceth the sentence that [<hi>I
and the Schools may call these distinctions, but indeed they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Learned Nonsence.</hi> And if the Reader be not yet
convinced that <hi>PRIDE</hi> is the Father, and <hi>IGNORANCE</hi>
the mother of our errours, contentions, divisions, scandals and
confusions, he shuts his eyes here against a most convincing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>Sect. 26. p. 15. For saying upon the invitation of his Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
that I am perswaded if <hi>Christ came personally and visibly to
demand it, the King would yield up his Crown to him;</hi> Instead of
defending his errour, which this reason did detect, he only
sentenceth me to be <hi>like</hi> the <hi>Mockers</hi> that deride the promise of
his coming.</p>
               <p>Sect. 27. <hi>Ib.</hi> He next compareth me to <hi>Boyes and Children,</hi> as
<hi>pretending to know no difference in point of Imposition, between one
that useth a form of his own, and he that is imposed on to use only the
form of another,</hi> P. 119. 120. Thus the man and his ten or eleven
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59274:12"/>
friends, whom he chargeth in his premonition with attesting his
Veracity, are all made falsities by him. There is not a word
of my <hi>pretending to know no difference:</hi> Nor was my comparison
at all [<hi>between one that useth a form of his own, and he</hi> (he
meaneth <hi>him</hi>) <hi>that is imposed on, to use only the form of another,</hi>
as he is himself <hi>imposed on</hi> by that other, but only as both impose
upon the people. No doubt there is a difference in the <hi>Passive
part,</hi> between the Minister that is imposed on, and him that is
not. But I still provoke him to tell me any difference in their
several impositions on the people, which at all concerneth our
present controversie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yes, he addeth</hi> [In the one case the hearer is alwayes at perfect
liberty how far and how often he will joyn: In the other he is
alwayes tied up, and must either joyn in such a prescript form of words,
or none at all; and this he knoweth before hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here are two differences pretended. 1. Reader, Is
there in the first any shadow of the truth at all? Yet are there
some men that such words will take with, contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense of mankind; As if it were not the Papists only that
can believe against all common sense. What reason can he
give why one that is present is not as free to joyn, or not to
joyn in heart, with any passage in the Common Prayer, as
in a <hi>free prayer</hi> of the Minister? I do seriously wonder what
made the man speak these words. When the Minister prayeth
freely, I may in heart either joyn with him, neglect him, or
dissent: And what hinders me from doing so at Common-Prayer?
He saith, <hi>I must joyn in that form, or none at all. True;</hi> And
so must I when the Minister either prayeth <hi>freely,</hi> or in a <hi>stinted
form of his own.</hi> You must joyn in that or none at all for that time.
I told him of old Mr. <hi>Fen,</hi> (a zealous Non-conformist at <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>)
that would say Amen loud to every Prayer of the Liturgy,
save that for the Bishops: Did he not use as much liberty here
as he could have done at free prayer?</p>
               <p>2. And for <hi>fore knowledge,</hi> he passeth by all the answer I
oft gave to that objection, and singeth over the same song
again. <hi>Fore-knowing</hi> what will be said, doth <hi>more</hi> enable me
to know what clause to forbear my consent to, than in sudden
Prayer not foreknown. And what if by his constant custome I
foreknow, that <hi>Iohn Simpson, Randal, Iohn Goodwin, Saltmarsh,
Dr. Crisp, Canne, Iohnson, Blackwood,</hi> or any other tolerable
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59274:13"/>
Opinionist, will put his opinion into his Prayers? Doth not
that make them in this all one with an imposed prayer, as to
<hi>fore-knowledge?</hi> And when I <hi>fore-know</hi> that the Matter of
the Liturgy (used on the Lords dayes by the Minister and
people) is <hi>sound,</hi> this <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> maketh it not evil in the
use.</p>
               <p>Sect. 28. When I gave him no less than twenty Queries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
plain evictions of the falseness of his Doctrine about
the Scriptures, his answer is, that he will answer them, when
<hi>I have satisfied him that I sinned not greatly in raising such mists
and doubts: and when I give him security that I will not ask him
as many more.</hi> Reader, Is not this man an easie disputant; Did
you ever know any that answered all with less ado, than so silly
a reason, Why he should not answer it?</p>
               <p>Sect. 29. He concludeth, by telling us, that he [<hi>is (to say
no more) your best, your equal</hi>] I know what he <hi>meaneth,</hi>
though not what he <hi>saith:</hi> And really it was but need that he
should tell the world how good or worthy a man he is, or else
a sober person that had but read one of his three Libels, would
hardly have believed it.</p>
               <p>Sect. 30. Having ended the second time, he begins again
with a Postscript, to tell us his reasons for his refusing the
Oath of Allegiance, which he is imprisoned for. But I
have no mind to meddle with him where I have no call.
And shall only say, that had it been more, even the Oath
of Supremacy it self, if he will regard either <hi>Non-conformist,
Independents</hi> or <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nie</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Tombes</hi> have each written enough <hi>to teach him better to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

as unpleasing, to open Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi>'s sins. But as Christ
did it by the Pharisees, yea, and <hi>Peter</hi> himself; and as <hi>Paul</hi>
in his Epistles, did it by many; so I think it is now become
my duty, though he and his believers be displeased by it.
I shall but desire the impartial sober Readers, that have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used
his Writings and mine to judge.</p>
               <p>1. Whether so great <hi>Ignorance</hi> as he discovereth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
be not scandalous in a Preacher of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>2. Whether such <hi>dangerous errours in Doctrine,</hi> against the
<hi>very foundations of our faith,</hi> with many other proved against
him, make him not an unsafe Guid for souls? And give not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
greater occasion for renouncing him as an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
to such as are apt to take such occasion, than most cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Hereticks in the ancient Churches gave.</p>
               <p>3. Whether it be not rare among the worst of men, to
meet with so many evidences of <hi>Insolent Pride,</hi> above the
common measure of <hi>Proud men,</hi> as his three Libels do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>4. Whether it be not a hard matter to find among the
worst of men on earth, two Libels so small, containing <hi>above
fourscore visible Vntruths in matter of fact;</hi> And a third to follow
them, <hi>substantially constituted of the like Vntruths;</hi> scarce now
to be numbred, any more than drops that are aggregate in a
Pond.</p>
               <p>5. Whether it be not rare to meet with more <hi>malicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
snares,</hi> to make up his ends upon the <hi>person,</hi> instead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
of his Cause.</p>
               <p>6. Whether ever you saw a controversie so managed by any
sort of men, of what heresie soever, that <hi>said so little for their
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59274:14"/>
Cause</hi> as he hath done for his Love-killing Principles. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
I remember not one, no not excepting the very <hi>Quakers.</hi>
Read over several debates, and see whether ever a cause so hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contended for, had so little said for it?</p>
               <p>7. Whether ever you saw <hi>Books so answered</hi> as mine are
by him? In all his three Libels, not medling at all with any
considerable part of my Books, as to any answer; But silent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passing them over, as if he had never read them. And
yet going on to repeat the same things, which I had confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>
               <p>8. Whether his <hi>Calumny,</hi> or <hi>false accusations</hi> of me, and
of <hi>Calvin, Perkins, Hildersham, Preston,</hi> &amp;c. be not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
act?</p>
               <p>9. Whether it be not rare among the worst to find such foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of great <hi>Impenitence,</hi> as he giveth in so silent a passing over
his guilt of the fore-mentioned <hi>fourscore Vntruths,</hi> without any
considerable Vindication: and after Admonition, adding so
many worse?</p>
               <p>10. Whether it be not rare to meet with so much <hi>audacious
impudence</hi> in <hi>sinning?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. Whether the <hi>slandring</hi> of so many millions, yea, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all Christs Churches on Earth,</hi> as differ from him in point
of Forms, &amp;c. <hi>as guilty of Idolatry,</hi> be not a most heinous sin
against Christ and them, as representing them as odious in
the world?</p>
               <p>12. And is it not a sin to <hi>draw so many poor souls</hi> as will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieve
him, so far towards the <hi>hatred of Christs Churches,</hi> and
<hi>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59274:14"/>
against Church-dividing Principles, as that for the sake of
it, they will read no other of my Books: (And if that hurt
<hi>them</hi> no more than <hi>me,</hi> the matter is but small.)</p>
               <p>Sect. 2. And when you have well considered of these
things, I shall next desire you to consider, Whether this man
hath not brought you as great a Care or Caution against <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Separations</hi> and <hi>Divisions,</hi> as most men ever did in the
world? For 1. Here you see how much you must bear with,
unless you will separate from your own leaders: Deal but
impartially: Is there one Parish Minister, yea, or one Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Church Member of many, that was ever convict of so
much sin, as Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi> hath published, and silently, but
impertinently lyeth down under? Is there many of them
that ever defended half so much sin so obstinately, without
confession, and yet so impotently without sence? Separate
from no Ministers or people that are not proved as guilty as
this man, and I will never more write against your Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
2. And now the world and posterity shall see in this
mans writings, how the cause of unlawful Separation was
defended in this age. I openly profess, that this is a great
reason that drew me to Defend my Cure of Church Divisions,
by three following Defences; that Posterity may see what
interest and passion will not now suffer some to see. I look to
the times to come. And if there be any wiser men among
them, that can say more for the Separating-cause, they are
best set to it; For if they leave it on such hands as Mr. <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaws,</hi>
it is easie to foresee that it will be shamed for
ever.</p>
               <p>Yet do I solemnly profess that to my utmost remembrance,
I never in my life did venture upon, or manage one dispute
by word or writing, through a confidence in my own ability
to make good what I undertook, but in a confidence of the
goodness of my Cause, and of the great advantage which the
evidence of plain truth doth give to any man of good reason
to defend it, even against the cunningest Sophister that shall
oppose it.</p>
               <p>Sect. 3. And now I shall add my Admonition to you, as
not being quite ignorant of Satans Wiles, to tell you what a
snare is laid for you all in Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi>'s Writings; and as
one that hath no interest, but Christs and the Churches to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59274:15"/>
move him to it, to tell you how great the danger is, if you
swallow the bait.</p>
               <p>1. If he prevail with you, he will draw you into the <hi>guilt of
all those sins of his own</hi> fore-mentioned, by your approbation &amp;
consent. And how great an addition will that be to your load?</p>
               <p>2. It would draw you to the entertainment of all those
<hi>Love-killing, Malignant,</hi> and <hi>Dividing Principles,</hi> which I
cast down, and he sets up. And you little know what an evil
it is, to have an understanding so blinded, and a heart so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</p>
               <p>3. By this means that <hi>true universal Love to Godly men and
Christians as such</hi> will be destroyed: And when you should
bear Gods Image, who is Love it self; you will be made like
Satan, the enemy of God and Love: And instead of loving
your neighbour as your self, you will take your neighbours,
yea, Christs members, for your enemies.</p>
               <p>4. And as Love is the fulfilling of the Law, so your <hi>death of
Love</hi> will be the death of all your <hi>true obedience,</hi> and lead you
to the breach of every Law. You will deny all the <hi>acts</hi> of
Love in word or deed to others that you owe them to; you
will <hi>censure,</hi> you will <hi>backbite</hi> freely, you will <hi>receive false
reports,</hi> and <hi>vend</hi> them again to others. And Christ may say
to you, <hi>Inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least</hi> (mark <hi>the
least) of these my brethren, you did it not to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. You will be tempted into <hi>Treason against Christ,</hi> under
pretence of piety, denying his interest in almost all his
Churches in the world; Even as if you should say, that the
King is King of one or two Towns only in all his Kingdoms,
on pretence that all the rest are not good enough to be his
Subjects. I profess openly, that nothing in the world more
moveth me to do what I do, than this; <hi>That there is much
within me that will not suffer me without abhorrence, to think of
either unchurching all Churches in the world, that use a set Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi>
(yea that use one worse than ours) or <hi>yet to hold that
they should all be separated from.</hi> And had I ever Vowed and
Covenanted to do this (as I did not) it had been a sinful
Vow.</p>
               <p>6. And moreover, it will possess you with a <hi>degenerate and
false kind of Religion,</hi> consisting in sidings, and partial opinions,
and obeying your selves instead of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59274:15"/>
7. And it will make you Satans instruments to <hi>disturb all
Churches</hi> that you joyn with, if you do not want occasion and
temptation. For the Principles which I wrote against will let
no Church be quiet where they prevail: And a Kingdom or
house divided cannot stand.</p>
               <p>8. You will be drawn from true <hi>spiritual worshipping</hi> of God;
and your worship and Church-communion will be corrupted:
Instead of holy and heavenly Sermons, Prayers, praises, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you
will be infected with a contending and envying passion, and puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
up with the conceit of your own judgments, and grow zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for your personal opinions, and your parties, and turn your
preaching and praying into a strain that savoureth of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
and defile them with unsounder passages for your errours
or divided interests, than any can be found in the Common
Prayers which you shun.</p>
               <p>9. And if you be thus overcome, it will heinously aggravate
your sin, that you will do all this as a <hi>part of your Religion,</hi> and
so will father it <hi>all on God,</hi> as if such doing pleased him, and
proceeded from his <hi>spirit,</hi> and were commanded by <hi>his word.</hi>
And as <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. it is made the unpardonable sin to <hi>blaspheme
the Holy Ghost,</hi> by ascribing his Miracles to Satan, so though it
be <hi>pardonable,</hi> you should easily see that it cannot be <hi>small,</hi> to say
that those things which are <hi>pleasing</hi> to the Devil, and proceed
from <hi>his will,</hi> and malicious suggestions, are <hi>pleasing to God,</hi> and
<hi>proceed from his spirit and word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. By these means Satan would make your <hi>Churches</hi> to do
his work against the Lord whom they profess to worship, and
and to be the very Nests where <hi>PRIDE</hi> and <hi>IGNORANCE</hi>
shall breed their like, and shall cherish sinful Love killing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and passions, and animosities against your brethren: And
so your Assemblies will be acted too much by his suggestions,
and become his Work-houses, while you think that they are
serving God; and mens <hi>wisdom</hi> will be <hi>earthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sensual,</hi> and <hi>dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical,</hi>
when they verily think it is <hi>from above, Iam.</hi> 3, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>11. Thus he would fain bring an <hi>odium</hi> upon <hi>your selves,</hi> and
cause you to go under such a character as the <hi>Munster</hi> Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
and the Familists, Quakers, and such others do: That men
may say of you, that while you take on you to be stricter than
others, it is but in abhorring other mens <hi>Prayers,</hi> and extolling
your own; And that sin is no sin when you find it in your own
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59274:16"/>
party, or your selves. And that Lyars, and most impudent Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators
and proud Revilers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> go among your selves for
Godly persons, while the uprightest men that use the Common
Prayer, do go for Idolaters and Ungodly. And if Satan can but
get such an odious Character fastened on you, what mischievous
advantage will he make of it?</p>
               <p>12. For then next he will hope to bring <hi>all the Non-conformists</hi>
(or the greater part while a few only are excepted) under the
<hi>same Character</hi> for <hi>your sakes:</hi> That they may be all thought to
be men of <hi>irrational, uncharitable,</hi> and <hi>unpeaceable</hi> principles and
spirits; whose Religion consisteth but in Fanaticisme, and self-conceit,
and foolish condemning the things which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not, because their party hath done so before them. And if
Satan can thus far obtain his ends, he hath laid the eggs of a
world of farther sin and sufferings.</p>
               <p>13. Then all that are against them will be exceedingly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in all those things and wayes, which I need not name unto
you, and for which it is that you separate from them: And will
think that your condemnation of them is but a commendation.</p>
               <p>14. Yea, Ministers of <hi>loose and vicious lives</hi> will be hardened
by you against repentance, and will think that they are better
than you, and that though they sometimes are drunk, or idle,
yet they are pardoned, because you that own such greater sins,
do pass for godly, and because chiefly such as you condemn them.</p>
               <p>15. Yea, (which will be a doleful mischief) you will afford
<hi>matter</hi> for every <hi>carnal Preacher</hi> to make a Sermon of, against
those that go for strict and godly, and to perswade the people
that all that profess much strictness, are but such as you, and that
hypocrisie is the cover for their sins, which are worse than other
mens. Thus, while the word <hi>Puritan</hi> (as Fanatick now) was
first taken up to signifie an errour (a conceit of <hi>self-perfection, &amp;c.</hi>)
at last it grew that which Mr. <hi>Robert Bolton</hi> hath so often told the
world, a word of scorn in wicked mens mouths, against all that
truly feared God. And thus while you fly from all the Parish As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
as desiled, you will be the men that will make them far
worse, when some Pulpits will be made Stages, on which the
Actors may set forth all those Religious men, that in any thing
dissent from them in a ridiculous and odious dress, to the derision
and loathing of the auditors.</p>
               <p>16. By which means thousands of ignorant people will be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59274:16"/>
tempted into a contempt of piety it self, and their conversion
wonderfully hindered: And prejudice will make them turn from
that way with scorn and obloquy, which should save them. O
how many thousands have in <hi>England</hi> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>merly been hindred
from true repentance, by hearing strict Religious people both
talk'd and preached against, as hypocrites, and a sort of proud
self-opinioned men!</p>
               <p>17. And the common people will learn quickly to overgo the
Preachers, and will make the Godly in streets and Ale-house;
their common scorn: And Satan will have almost as many
Preachers to make Piety odious, and hinder mens repentance, as
there be wicked men. As when the Preacher by a <hi>Puritan</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
meant a <hi>Non-conformist,</hi> the ignorant rabble expounded
and applied it, of all that were not such as they.</p>
               <p>18. And by this means the Devil hopeth to disaffect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate
many <hi>Learned men</hi> that differ from you, to turn the
<hi>strength and reputation</hi> of their <hi>parts and learning,</hi> to make you
contemptible and vile. Bishop <hi>Overall, Whitgift, Mountague, &amp;c.</hi>
were very learned men: but exasperation set their parts and
pens in that military strain, as was not pleasing to their Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonists:
As it did Mr. <hi>Hooker's</hi> and many more, who by Love
and meekness, and a peaceable familiarity (without sin) might
have been disarmed. I need not go beyond Sea, to tell you how
the Learned <hi>Ios. Scaliger</hi> was exasperated to revile the <hi>Puritans</hi>
by Mr. <hi>Lidiates</hi> opposition (<hi>vid. Praef. ad Cam. Isagog.</hi>) nor to
mention <hi>Salmatius, Grotius,</hi> or any others there; nor to look
back as far as <hi>Erasmus,</hi> much less to many, (too many) of the
ancient Bishops and Doctors of the Church.</p>
               <p>19. Yea, while you fear Persecution, you will take the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest
way in the world to bring it on your selves, and others for
your sakes: For the consciences of Rulers will (perhaps) little
scruple the hurting of such men as are taken to be so bad: They
being Gods Ministers to use the sword for a terrour to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
doers, and if you once pass for notorious evil doers,
you will hardly scape. And it will be but a foolish fruitless
course to <hi>do the evil your selves,</hi> and then lay the blame of all your
sufferings on them that <hi>tell you of it,</hi> and that <hi>take</hi> it to be evil,
and will not commend your sins as so many acts of piety: As if
the assumed name of Virtue would hide the odiousness of Vice:
For nature and Scripture will help men to see your nakedness
through so thin a vail, and God himself will not suffer sin to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59274:17"/>
keep up its credit by usurped names. It is not silencing the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
that will do the work of any sinners. It must be the avoiding
of the sin it self.</p>
               <p>20. And if you take this sinful dividing course, you <hi>will make
more Papists,</hi> and such others as you your selves, most fly from and
disclaim, than almost any other way could do. Nothing that I
know of in the world, doth so strongly tempt some sober conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
men, to think Poperty necessary for the Concord of the
Churches, and a violent Church Government necessary to our
Peace, as the woful experience of the errours and schisms, the mad
and manifold Sects that arise among those that are most against
them. Thousands have been made Papists in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> within these twenty years, that have been driven from
us by our shameful Sects; yea, many of the Sectaries themselves,
when they have run themselves through as many Sects as they could
try. I am perswaded that Mr. <hi>Bagshaws</hi> Libels are as powerful wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
to cross his own desires, and turn many from Non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and others unto Popery, as most that have been published in
this age. Multitudes that read them will say, <hi>Here you see the spirit
of Non conformity</hi> (though I have proved it a calumny:)
Others will say, <hi>You see how mad men grow when they unite not with
the Cathalick Church, and live not under a strict Church Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>21. And by all this Satan hopeth to turn the <hi>Non-conformists
Sufferings</hi> to their <hi>shame:</hi> And to make the world believe that as
this man suffereth for refusing the Oath of Allegiance, so do the rest
for some self-conceits, and unwarrantable fancies of their own.</p>
               <p>22. And he will put hard to bring <hi>Church diseipline</hi> it self into
disgrace and scorn, by you that most desire and plead for it. For men
will say, These are they that cry out for <hi>Discipline,</hi> and separate
from our Church because it wanteth or corrupteth it. When in
their own Churches and Leaders, such crimes (as <hi>Bagshaws</hi> Books
contain) are tolerable, as consistent with religious zeal, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
is all ascribed unto godliness? what more effectual way could
be devised, to make Church-discipline contemptible to the world?</p>
               <p>23. And all this will tend to disable the Ministers of Christ,
both conformable and non-conformable, from doing any good,
and winning any souls to true repentance. When the Conformable
Preachers should do good, the people will be taught by you to
shun them, or despise them as Idolaters: When the Non-conformists
should do any good, they will be taught by your practice and other
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59274:17"/>
mens calumny, to turn away from them, as such as afore described.
And then how much hath Satan gained? I know another sort of men
are at least as deeply guilty of all these consequents, as you: But that
is no excuse of yours. And though it must be that offence come,
yet wo to them by whom it cometh.</p>
               <p>24. And indeed it would be a heinous aggravation of your sin,
if you should defie Gods Providence, and the large and lamentable
experience of the mischiefs of Love-killing dividing-principles and
wayes. This spirit and way was of old blasted in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
It troubled <hi>New-England;</hi> It injured the <hi>Non conformists,</hi>
and put them to write many books against it (more than the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
did.) The books of Mr. <hi>Perry (Martin Mar-Prelate)</hi> full
of jears and scorn, were unsavoury to all sober men; and his death
the more dishonourable. <hi>Scotland</hi> kept them out thence by Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.
In our late Wars, <hi>Martin-Mar-priest (Overton,</hi> as was
thought, with <hi>Prince, Lilburn, &amp;c.)</hi> quite exceeded <hi>Martin-Mar-Prelate,</hi>
and the Ministers were more scorned than ever were the
Bishops: Seekers, Quakers, and Ranters, have all been generated
(for the most part) by the foresaid <hi>Separating</hi> Principles and Spirit.
I will tell you no more now, what effects it then had on the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and Kingdom, nor what it hath brought on themselves and us.
But <hi>reason</hi> should tell it you; and I will tell you, that now, even
now, to run violently further into the same fire which first burnt up
so much of our Concord, peace, and glory, and turned us into ashes,
and then burnt up the men that kindled it, and is not quenched to
this day, nor like to be in haste; I say to blow this fire still, and
run into it, and back-bite even Non-conformable Ministers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that would but disswade you, and desire you to quench it,
will be an obdurateness so like to <hi>Pharaoh's,</hi> as may be a doleful
prognostick to the guilty, if not to all the Land.</p>
               <p>25. You little know what a pernicious design the Devil hath
upon you, in perswading you to desire and endeavour to pull down
the Interest of Christ and Religion, which is upheld in the <hi>Parish
Churches</hi> of the Land; and to think <hi>that it is best to bring them as
low in reality or reputation as you can,</hi> and to <hi>contract the Religious
Interest all into private meetings:</hi> By which means, 1. The priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
shall keep it under obloquy, suspicion, and contempt: 2. And
shall level the sound with all the rotten Sects in their reputation:
3. And shall leave them no security in Law for their continuance
an hour: 4. And shall keep them still under the censures, discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59274:18"/>
and dangers of the Law. 5. And young rash intemperate spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
among your selves, will be continual endangerers of your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.
6. Or a malicious enemy may at any time put on the vizor
of a friend, and come among you and act a furious part, to make
you odious and overthrow you: 7. And few of the young, the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
or licentious sorts will be your Auditors; And how will
the work of Repentance then be carried on by you? The most will
go to the publick Churches, when you have done the most against
it you can. 8. And when the present generation of <hi>Non-conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists</hi>
are dead, do you think it likely that so many will survive them
of their mind, as are sufficient without the publick assemblies to
keep up the Christian and Protestant Religion in the Land? You
are ignorant if you think it probable. I know that God can do
what he will; But his <hi>Promise</hi> is the measuring object of our faith:
And I think he hath promised no such thing. And I have long fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
lest twenty years wilful contentions, wantonness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will not
be punished with a short rebuke. If you know how great a number
was silenced in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time, and yet that in 1640 there
were not found near half so many Non conformable Ministers as
are Counties in <hi>England,</hi> you may think it is possible it may be so
again. And would you have but one Minister in a County or two,
to keep up all the Interest of Religion? I am not without hope
that God will make men so wise as to unite us, before such a day:
But of that we have no certainty. 9. Yea, could you wish <hi>at this
day</hi> that the Christian and Protestant Religion were kept up by
<hi>none but the unconformable Ministers in private?</hi> No honest man
can wish it, who considereth how many of the 1800 are dead al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and how few are left in most Counties of the Land, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the Congregations that need instruction? I know that it
is commonly said, that God blesseth not their Ministry to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of any souls, and therefore it is as good be without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists.
But this is foolishly spoken. For, 1. Many of them are as
wise and as good men as you. 2. You have no satisfactory account
what hearts are secretly wrought on by their Ministry. They come
not all to you to be confessed. 3. And the worser sort of them
are not worse than <hi>Iudas,</hi> whom Christ sent forth. 4. And there is
much done to keep up the <hi>Christian and Protestant Doctrine</hi> in
soundness, against Infidelity and Popery, where few are brought
to sound Conversion. And so <hi>Gods publick worship, and the hopes of
our Posterity</hi> are kept up. If any of you had rather that all turned
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59274:18"/>
open Infidels or Mah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>metans, my soul shall not enter into your
Counsels. 10. And the <hi>publick Churches will be kept up some or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
If you would have the Protestant Interest in them fall, the
Popery will find them as a house ready swept and garnished, and
will make our latter end worse than our beginning: 11. And I am
perswaded few can be so sottish as to be ignorant, that it greatly
pleaseth the Papists that you are forced into corners, and hold your
exercises of Religion by connivance, against Law; and much more
you will gratifie and rejoyce them, if you could help them to get
down all the Protestant interest in the Parish Churches. And do your
Leaders yet think that the Papists are pleased with that which will
promote the Protestant cause? 12. Many a man as wise and good as
you, whose Judgment is Non-conformable, who liveth where there
are no other Churches, would take it for an unspeakable loss to be
deprived of the benefit of the Parish Churches. For all these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
though I desire Reformation, and will never swear not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
it in my place and Calling; yet I will do the best I can to
get the best Pastors into the Parish Churches, and to promote their
reputation, and the labours of the Ministers there, and bless God
for what is yet there left us; and yet will be one that shall mourn
for the reproach of the solemn assemblies.</p>
               <p>26. Moreover, it is one of Satans plots upon you, to prepare for
the reproach of the Non conformists, when greater necessity shall
drive them to the Parish assemblies and Communion. Do not you
make any doubt of it, but that if the wrath or rigour of superiours
should bring them to the same condition, as the old Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
were, the most of the present Non-conformists would come to
the Parish Churches, even in Common Prayer and Sacraments as
they did. And you are preparing reproach for them, that they may
then be called Changelings, who forsake their former principles
and cause.</p>
               <p>27. And verily you will keep up the Papists hope, that by an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Toleration they may at last come in on equal terms with
you, or by connivance be endured as much as you. And if they be
equal in <hi>England</hi> with you, their transmarine advantages will make
them more than equal, notwithstanding their disadvantages in their
Cause, and in their contrariety to Kingly interest (which <hi>Henry
Fowlis</hi> hath in <hi>folio</hi> most fully and unanswerably laid open.)</p>
               <p>28. And though God in mercy hath at present given us a King
that owneth the Protestant Cause, so resolvedly, as to make a Law
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59274:19"/>
against any that shall report him inclined to Popery, <hi>England</hi>
hath no promise that it shall be so for ever: And if we should ever
have a King more indifferent in his Religion, do you know what
a temptation it would be to him, to pull down the Protestant
Religion, if he found it but in corners, under a connivance, and
found it under the reproach of such crimes as <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

contain? It were the next way to procure the fatal word, <hi>Down
with them even to the ground;</hi> Though I know we have the greater
security against this, because <hi>Popery is so much against Princes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and is the del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>29. In a word, Satan is playing by Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi> no lower a
game, than by turning all the people from the Parish assemblies,
(while there are not in <hi>England</hi> (had they liberty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

of them to live like open Atheists, that give God no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

and all Religion, in most of the Land. These things I see,
and because I see them I do as I have done.</p>
               <p>30. There is another reason that sticks much with me, as
knowing what silly peevish souls are employed in against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but I will add no more.</p>
               <p>Brethren, I have discharged my conscience; Some will hear:
I will bear the censures and obloquy of the rest. Your sins are no
more lovely to me, than the sins of other men; nor no more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to <hi>England:</hi> We all suffer by and for such sins as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.
I am one of the sufferers, and therefore should have leave
to speak. I am long ago engaged in the cause of <hi>Concord, Love,</hi>
and <hi>Peace,</hi> and will not betray it for the shadow of <hi>Purity,</hi> nor
for the pleasing of any party whatsoever; Though no <hi>duty</hi> when
such is to be omitted, nor any sin committed for <hi>Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to prevent the Calumny of <hi>Papists,</hi> and the mis-informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
