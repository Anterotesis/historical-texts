            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe abrupt beginning of the following Paper will not ('tis hop'd) be wonder'd at, when 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, that the whole Excurſion is to be look'd upon as a <hi>Fragment</hi> of a Diſcourſe, from which, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Reaſons, it has been ſeparated in its preſent Form.

            <head>OF THE High Veneration Man's Intellect owes to GOD.</head>
            <p n="1">1. UPON this Occaſion I ſhall take leave to declare, that 'tis not without ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, as well as Wonder, that I ſee <hi>many</hi> men, and <hi>ſome</hi> of them Divines too, who little conſidering what God is, and what themſelves are, preſume to talk of Him and his Attributes as freely and as unpreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditately, as if they were talking of a Geometrical Figure, or a Mechanical Engine. So that even the leſs Pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſumptuous diſcourſe, as if the Nature
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48133:4"/>
and Perfections of that unparalleled Being, were Objects that their Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects can graſp; and ſcruple not to dogmatize about thoſe Abſtruſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as freely as about other things, that are confeſſedly within the reach of humane Reaſon, or perhaps are to be found among the more familiar Objects of Senſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The preſumption and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateneſs of theſe men might be manifeſted by divers Conſiderations, if I had Leaſure to inſiſt on them; but at preſent I ſhall employ but theſe two; 1. That 'tis probable God may have divers Attributes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Perfections, that are as yet unknown to us; and <hi>2ly,</hi> That of thoſe Attributes that we have already ſome Knowledge of, there are Effects and Properties whoſe Sublimity or Abſtruſeneſs ſurpaſſing our Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, makes the Divine Cauſe or Atuhour of them deſerve our High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Wonder and Veneration.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To begin with the firſt of theſe; whereas there are two chief ways to arrive at the Knowledge of God's
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48133:4"/>
Attributes; The Contemplation of his Works, and the ſtudy of his Word; I think it may be doubted whether either or both of theſe, will ſuffice to acquaint us with all his Perfections.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For, firſt, <hi>though</hi> Philoſophers have rationally deduc'd, the Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God from thoſe Impreſſes of them that he hath ſtampt upon divers of his Viſible Works; <hi>yet</hi> ſince the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes which the Creatures point at, are thoſe whereof themſelves have ſome, though but imperfect, partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, or reſemblance: And ſince the Foecundity (if I may ſo ſpeak) of the Divine Nature is ſuch, that its Excellencies may be participated or repreſented in I know not how many ways; how can we be ſure that ſo perfect and exuberant a Being may not have Excellencies, that it hath not expreſſed or adumbrated in the Viſible World, or any parts of it that are known to us?</p>
            <p n="5">5. This will be the more eaſily granted if we conſider, that there are ſome of thoſe Divine Attributes we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48133:5"/>
               <hi>do know;</hi> which being Relative to the Creatures, could ſcarce, if at all, be diſcovered by ſuch imperfect Intellects as ours, ſave by the conſideration of ſome things <hi>actually done</hi> by God. As, ſuppoſing that juſt before the Foundations of the viſible World were laid, the Angels were not more knowing than men now are, they could ſcarce think that there was in God a Power of Creating Matter (which few, if any at all of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks, Epicureans,</hi> to omit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Ancient Philoſophers, ſeem ever to have dreamt of) and of producing in it Local Motion, eſpecially conſidering the puzzleing difficulties that attend the Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the very Nature and Being of the one, and of the other. And much leſs (as far as we can conjecture) could the Angels ſpoken of, have known how the rational Soul and Humane Body act upon one another. Whence it ſeems probable, that if God have made other Worlds, or rather <hi>Vortices,</hi> than that which we live in, and are ſurrounded by, (as who
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48133:5"/>
can aſſure us that he hath not?) he may have diſplayed in ſome of the Creatures that compoſe <hi>them,</hi> divers Attributes that we have not diſcover'd by the help of thoſe Works of his that <hi>we</hi> are acquainted with. But of this more hereafter.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I readily grant, (that I may proceed now to the <hi>ſecond</hi> Help to acquire the Knowledge of the Divine Attributes) that the Revelations God hath vouchſafed us in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which we owe to that <hi>Spirit</hi> which <hi>ſearcheth all things even</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">1 Cor. II. 10.</note> 
               <hi>the Depths of God</hi>) have clearly taught us divers things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their adorable Authour, which the mere Light of Nature either would not have ſhewn us at all, or would have but very dimly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to us. But the Scripture tells us indeed, that the Promulgators of the Goſpel declared to men <hi>the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. XX. 27.</note> 
               <hi>whole Counſel of God</hi> (as far as was neceſſary for their Salvation) but never ſays, that they diſcloſed to them, <hi>the whole Nature of God;</hi> who<note place="margin">1 Tim. VI. 16.</note> is ſaid to <hi>inhabite an unapproachable</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48133:6"/>
               <hi>Light,</hi> which humane Speculations cannot penetrate. Upon which ſcore perhaps it was, that the Jews would have the proper Name of God to be Ineffable, to ſignify, that his Nature is Incomprehenſible. And, though I will not adopt their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet I cannot but take notice, that 'tis at leaſt no mere Talmudical Tradition, ſince we find not, that either our Saviour himſelf, or his Apoſtles (who are introduced ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently making mention of God in the New Teſtament) expreſſed in ſpeaking either <hi>to</hi> him, or <hi>of</hi> him, the <hi>Nomen Tetragrammaton</hi> (or four-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd name!) But not to inſiſt on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures; the Scripture it ſelf that brings ſo much Light to things Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that the Goſpel is called <hi>Light</hi> in the Abſtract, the Scripture, I ſay, informs us, that in this Life <hi>we know but in part, and ſee things but darkly</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. XIII. 12.</note> 
               <hi>as in a Glaſs;</hi> and that we are ſo far from being able <hi>to find out God to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job XI. 7.</note> 
               <hi>perfection,</hi> as to his Nature and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, that even the <hi>ways</hi> of his<note place="margin">Rom. XI. 33.</note> Providence are to us <hi>untraceable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48133:6"/>7. Theſe are ſome of the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations that inclined me to think that God may have Attributes that are not known to us. And this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion perhaps will appear the more allowable, becauſe of what I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to add in anſwer to a weighty Objection. For I know it may be alledged, that beſides the two ways I have mentioned of attaining to the knowledge of God's Attributes, there may be a third way preferable to both the others, and that is, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Being</hi> ſupreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or <hi>Infintiely</hi> perfect; in which <hi>Idea</hi> it may be alledg'd, that all poſſible Perfections are contained; ſo that no new one can be added to it. But though I readily grant, that this <hi>Idea</hi> is the moſt genuine that I am able to frame of the Deity; yet there may be divers Attributes which though they are indeed in a general way <hi>contained</hi> in this <hi>Idea,</hi> are not in particular <hi>diſcovered</hi> to us by it. 'Tis true that when, by any means whatſoever, any Divine Perfection comes to our Knowledge, we may
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48133:7"/>
well conclude, that 'tis in a ſenſe comprized in the comprehenſive No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have of a Being abſolutely perfect; but 'tis poſſible that That Perfection would never have come to our knowledge, by the bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of that general <hi>Idea,</hi> but was ſuggeſted by Particularities; ſo that ſuch Diſcoveries are not ſo much <hi>deriv'd from,</hi> as <hi>refer'd to,</hi> the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we are ſpeaking of.</p>
            <p>The paſt Conſiderations have, I preſume, perſuaded you, that God may have, as divers Attributes, ſo divers Excellencies and Perfections, that are not known to us. It will therefore now be ſeaſonable to Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhew you, that of divers of the Attributes <hi>we do know</hi> that he hath, we men have but an imperfect knowledge; eſpecially in compariſon of that He has of them. Which is not to be wondred at: ſince he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes them in a manner or a degree peculiar to himſelf, and far tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wherein we men poſſeſs them, or rather ſome ſaint reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48133:7"/>It would be very unſutable to my intended Brevity, and more diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to my ſmall abilities, to attempt the making this Good by inſiſting particularly on all the divine Excellencies that we are in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure acquainted with. I therefore hope it may ſuffiſe to inſtance in a couple of the moſt known ones; God's Power, and his Wiſedom. Which two I pitch upon, as being thoſe that men are wont to look on as the Principal, and for which they have the greateſt admiration and reſpect, becauſe we are not able to confer them on our ſelves; as we think we can divers other Vertues and Perfections. For every man eaſily believes that he may be as <hi>Chaſte,</hi> as <hi>Temperate,</hi> as <hi>Juſt,</hi> and in a word, as <hi>Good,</hi> as he pleaſes; thoſe Vertues depending on his own will; but he is ſenſible that he cannot be as <hi>Knowing,</hi> as <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and as <hi>Powerfull,</hi> as he would. And thence he not Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationally concludes, that <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſedom</hi> ſlow from, and Argue, an Excellency and Superiority of Nature
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48133:8"/>
or Condition. The Power and Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God diſplay themſelves by what he does in reference both to his Corporeal, and his Incorporeal Creatures.</p>
            <p>Among the manifold effects of the Divine Power, my intended Brevity will allow me to mention onely two or three, which, though to diſcerning eyes they be very manifeſt, are not wont to be very attentively reflected on. The <hi>Immenſe Quantity</hi> of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Subſtance that the Divine Power provided for the framing of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; and the <hi>great force</hi> of the Local Motion that was imparted to it, and is <hi>regulated</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>And firſt; the <hi>vaſtneſs</hi> of that huge Maſs of matter that the Corporeal World conſiſts of, cannot but appear ſtupendious to thoſe that skilfully contemplate it. That part of the Univerſe which has been already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by Humane eyes, aſſiſted with dioptrical Glaſſes, is almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveably Vaſt: as will be eaſily granted, if we aſſent to what the beſt Aſtronomers, as well Modern as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48133:8"/>
Ancient, ſcruple not to deliver. The ſixt Stars of the firſt Magnitude, that to vulgar eyes look but like ſhining Spangles, are by Artiſts affirmed to exceed, each of them, above a hundred times in bigneſs the whole Globe of the Earth: and as little as theſe twinkling Stars appear to our naked eyes, they do (which probably you will think ſtrange) appear much leſſer through our Teleſcopes; which taking off thoſe falſe lights that make them look to our maimed Sight as they are wont to be painted, ſhew them little otherwiſe than as ſpeeks or Phyſical points of light. And the Sun, which is granted to be ſome millions of miles nearer to us than the other ſixt Stars are, though it ſeem at this leſſer diſtance not to be half a foot broad; is by the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Mathematicians believ'd to be above a hundred and threeſcore times bigger than the Earth. Nay, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the more recent calculations of ſome more accurate Modern Artiſts, 'tis eſtimated to be eight or ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times as big as the Terraqueous
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48133:9"/>
Globe, and by farther Obſervation may perhaps be found yet much vaſter. And it plainly appears by the <hi>Parallaxes</hi> and other proofs, that this Globe of Earth and Water that we Inhabit, and often call <hi>the World;</hi> though it be divided into ſo many great Empires, and Kingdoms, and Seas, and though according to the received Opinion it be 5400 German leagues in Circuit, and conſequently contain 10, 882, 080, 000. Cubick miles in ſolid meaſure, and according to the more modern obſervations have a greater Circumference (amounting to above 26000 miles:) yet this Globe, I ſay, is ſo far from being for its bulk, a conſiderable part of the Univerſe, that without much Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole we may ſay that 'tis in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon thereof but a Phyſical point. Nay thoſe far greater Globes, of the Sun and other fixt Stars, and all the ſolid maſſes of the World to boot, if they were reduced into one, would perhaps bear a leſs proportion to the fluid part of the Univerſe, than a Nut to the Ocean. Which brings into
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48133:9"/>
my mind the ſentence of an Excellent modern Aſtronomer, that the Stars of the Skie, if they were crouded into one Body and placed where the Earth is, would, if that Globe were placed at a fit diſtance, appear to us no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than a Star of the firſt Magnitude now does. And after all this I muſt remind you, that I have been hitherto ſpeaking but of that part of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Univerſe that has been already ſeen by us. And therefore I muſt add that as vaſt as this is, yet all that the eye, even when powerfully promoted by proſpective Tubes, hath diſcovered to us, is far from repreſenting the World of ſo great an Extent, as I doubt not but more perfect Teleſcopes hereafter will do. And even then the viſible part of the <hi>World</hi> will be far enough from reaching to the <hi>bounds of</hi> the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe:</hi> to which the Carteſians and ſome other modern Philoſophers will not allow men to ſet any; hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Corporeal World to be (as they love to ſpeak) <hi>Indefinite,</hi> and beyond any bounds aſſignable by us men.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48133:10"/>8. From the vaſt <hi>extent</hi> of the Univerſe, I now proceed to conſider the ſtupendious <hi>quantity of local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that the Divine power has given the parts of it, and continually main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it. Of this we may make ſome eſtimate by conſidering with what velocity ſome of the greater bodies themſelves are mov'd, and how great a part of the remaining bodies of the Univerſe, is alſo, though in a ſomewhat differing way, indow'd with motion.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt of theſe; the leaſt velocity that I ſhall mention, is that which is afforded by the Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican <hi>Hypotheſis:</hi> ſince according to that 'tis the Earth that moves from Weſt to Eaſt about its own <hi>Axis;</hi> (for its other motions concern not this diſcourſe) in four and twenty hours. And yet this Terraqueous Globe which we think ſo great that we commonly call it the World, and which, as was lately noted, by the recenter computations of Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians is concluded to contain ſix or ſeven and twenty thouſand miles in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48133:10"/>
Circuit; ſome part of this Globe, I ſay, moves at ſuch a rate, that the learned <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> confeſſes, that a point or place, ſituated in the Aequator of the Earth, does in a <hi>ſecond minute</hi> move about <hi>two hundred Toiſes</hi> or Fathoms; that is, <hi>twelve hundred feet:</hi> ſo that a Bullet when ſhot out of a Cannon, ſcarce ſlies with ſo great a Celerity.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But, as I was ſaying, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth is the leaſt ſwift that I had to mention; being indeed ſcarce comparable to the velocity of the fixt Stars; if, with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Aſtronomers, we ſuppoſe them to move in four and twenty hours about the Earth. For ſuppoſing the diſtance aſſign'd by the famous <hi>Tycho</hi> (a more accurate Obſerver than his Predeceſſours) between us and the Firmament to be fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſemediameters of the Earth, a fixt Star in the Aequator, does, as <hi>Mullerius</hi> calculates it, move 3153333 miles in an <hi>hour,</hi> and conſequently in a <hi>minute</hi> of an hour, fifty two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred fifty five miles, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48133:11"/>
a <hi>ſecond</hi> (which is reckon'd to be near about a ſingle pulſation or ſtroke of the artery of a healthy man) 875 miles: which is about, if not above, three thouſand times faſter than a Cannon bullet moves in the Air. 'Tis true that according to the Ptolomean <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> a fixt Star in the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial doth in a ſecond move at moſt but three ſemediamiters of the Earth;<note place="margin">See <hi>Ricciol.</hi> Almag. nov. <hi>lib.</hi> IX. <hi>Sect.</hi> IV. <hi>Cap.</hi> VI.</note> but according to the learned and diligent <hi>Ricciolus,</hi> this velocity (of our fixt Stars) is fifty times greater than in the Ptolomean <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> and threeſcore and ten times greater than in the Tichonian <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> For according to <hi>Ricciolus,</hi> ſuch a fixt Star as we ſpeak of, moves in a ſecond minute (or one beating of the pulſe) 157282 German leagues which amount to ſix hundred twenty nine thouſand one hundred twenty eight Engliſh miles.</p>
            <p>And now I ſhall add (what poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly you have not obſerv'd) that That portion of the Univerſe which commonly paſſes for <hi>quieſcent,</hi> and yet has motion put into it; is ſo
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48133:11"/>
great, that for ought I know, the quantity <hi>of motion</hi> diſtributed among theſe ſeemingly quieſcent bodies, may equall if not exceed the quantity of motion the firſt Mover has communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the fixt Stars themſelves, though we ſuppoſe them whirl'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Earth with that ſtupendious ſwiftneſs that the Ptolemeans and Tychonians attribute to them. For I reckon that the fixt Stars and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, or if you pleaſe, all the <hi>mundane Globes,</hi> whether <hi>lucid</hi> or <hi>opacous,</hi> of which laſt ſort is the Earth, do all of them together bear but a ſmall proportion to the <hi>Interſtellar</hi> part of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</hi> And though I ſhould allow <hi>all</hi> theſe Globes to be <hi>ſolid,</hi> notwithſtanding that it can ſcarce be prov'd of <hi>any</hi> of them; and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſians think the Sun (which they take to be a fixt Star, and therefore probably of the ſame Nature with the reſt) to be extremely <hi>fluid:</hi> though I ſhould, I ſay, grant this; yet it muſt be confeſs'd, that each of theſe ſolid Globes ſwims in an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient fluid of very much greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48133:12"/>
than it ſelf is. So that the <hi>fluid portion</hi> of the Univerſe will in bulk almoſt incomparably exceed the <hi>ſolid.</hi> And if we conſider what is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>fluid</hi> body, as ſuch we ſhall find that it conſiſts in having it's minute parts perpetually and variouſly mov'd, ſome this way and ſome that way; ſo that though the whole body of a liquor ſeems to be at reſt, yet the minute parts that compoſe that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, are in a reſtleſs motion; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſhifting places amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as has been amply ſhewn in a late Tract intituled, the <hi>Hiſtory of Fluidity and Firmneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. And becauſe the quantity of motion ſhar'd by the Corpuſcles that compoſe fluid bodies is not uſually reflected on even by Philoſophers; 'twill not be here amiſs to add that how great and vehement a motion the parts of fluid bodies (perhaps when the Aggregates of thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles appear quieſcent) may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with, we may be aſſiſted to gueſs, by obſerving them when their ordinary Motions happen to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48133:12"/>
or to be extraordinarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by fit conjunctures of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. This may be obſerved in the ſtrange force and effects of boiſterous Winds and Whirlewinds, which yet are but Streams and Whirlepools of the inviſible Air, whoſe ſingly inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible parts are by accidental cauſes determined to have their Motion made either in a ſtreight or almoſt ſtreight-line, or as it were about a common Centre. But an inſtance much more conſpicuous may be afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Mine charged with Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; where the flame or ſome ſubtile Aethereal ſubſtance that is always at hand in the Air, though both one and the other of them be a fluid body, and the powder perhaps be kindled but by one ſpark of fire, exerts a Motion ſo rapid and furious, as in a trice is able to toſs up into the Air, whole houſes and thick Walls; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the firm ſoil, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſolid Rocks, they were built upon.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But ſince the velocity of theſe diſcharged flames may be gueſs'd at,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48133:13"/>
by that which the flame of Gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der impreſſes on a Bullet ſhot out of a well charg'd Gun, which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent <hi>Merſennus,</hi> who made ſeveral trials to meaſure it, defines to be about 75 <hi>toiſes,</hi> or fathoms (that is, 450 foot) in a Second, being the <hi>60th</hi> part of a Minute: if we admit the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Opinion of the Carteſians, that the Earth and divers other Mundane Globes, as the Planets, are turn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their own Axes by the Motion of the reſpective Aethereal <hi>Vortices</hi> or Whirlepools, in which they ſwim, we ſhall eaſily grant that the Motion of the Celeſtial Matter that moves, for inſtance, upon the remote Confines of the Earths <hi>Vortex,</hi> is by a vaſt exceſs more rapid than that of the ſurface of the Earth. And yet we formerly obſerv'd, that a place ſituated under the Aequator does (if the Earth turns about its own <hi>Axis</hi>) move as ſwiftly as a Bullet ſhot out of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. But if we chuſe rather the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chonian Hypotheſis,</hi> which makes the Firmament with all the vaſt Globes of Light that adorn it to move about
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48133:13"/>
their common Centre in 24 hours, the Motions of the Celeſtial Matter muſt be allowed a far greater, and indeed a ſcarce imaginable rapidity.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are mention'd, that we may have the more enlarg'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the <hi>Power</hi> as well as <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of the Great Creator, who has both put ſo Wonderfull a quantity of Motion into the Univerſal Matter and maintains it therein, and is able, not onely to ſet bounds to the raging Sea, and effectually ſay to it, Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhalt thou come, and no farther, and here ſhall thy proud Waves be ſtay'd, but, (what is far more) ſo to curb and moderate thoſe ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly rapid Motions of the Mundane Globes and intercurrent Fluids, that neither the unwealdineſs of their Bulk, nor Celerity of their Motions, have made them exorbitate or fly out, and this for many Ages; during which no Watch for a few hours, has gone ſo regularly. The Sun, for inſtance, moving without ſwerving, under the ſame Circular Line that is call'd the <hi>Ecliptick.</hi> And if the Firmament it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48133:14"/>
ſelf, whoſe Motion in the vulgar <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is by much the moſt rapid in the World, do fail of exactly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleting its revolution in 24 hours, that retardation is ſo regulated that ſince <hi>Hipparchus</hi>'s time, who liv'd 2000 years ago, the firſt Star in <hi>Aries,</hi> which was then near the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it, is not yet come to the laſt degree of that Sign.</p>
            <p n="12">12. After what hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the Power of God, it remains, that I ſay ſomething about his Wiſedom, that being the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to which thoſe that have eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted underſtandings, are wont to pay the Higheſt Veneration, when they meet it even in Men, where yet 'tis ſtill but very Imperfect.</p>
            <p>The Wiſedom of God which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſomewhere juſtly ſtyles <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Eph. III. 10.</note> manifold or <hi>multifarious,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in two differing manners or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. For ſometimes it is ſo manifeſtly diſplay'd in familiar Objects, that even ſuperficial and almoſt careleſs Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors may take notice of it. But there are many other things wherein the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48133:14"/>
               <hi>Treaſures of Wiſedom and Knowledge</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. II. 3.</note> may be ſaid to be hid; lying ſo deep that they require an Intelligent and attentive Conſiderer to diſcover them. But though I think I may be allowed, to make this diſtinction, yet I ſhall not ſolicitouſly confine my ſelf to it; becauſe in ſeveral things both theſe Expreſſions of the Divine Wiſedom, may be clearly obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Objects of this Wiſedom that we ſhall at this time conſider are of two ſorts, the material and viſible, and the inviſible and immaterial Creatures of God.</p>
            <p>In the Firſt of theſe, whoſe aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, or collection makes up the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal World, commonly, call'd <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,</hi> I ſhall briefly take notice, <hi>of</hi> the excellent Contrivance of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar bodies; <hi>of</hi> the great variety, and conſequently number, of them; <hi>of</hi> their Symmetry, as they are parts of the World; and <hi>of</hi> the connexion and dependance they have in relation to one another. And though under the two firſt of theſe heads, I might as well as under the other two, take
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48133:15"/>
notice of many inanimate bodies, as well as of thoſe that are endowed with vegetative and ſenſitive Souls (as Naturaliſts commonly call them;) yet for Brevities ſake I ſhall here take notice onely, of that more perfect ſort of living Creatures that we call Animals.</p>
            <p n="13">13. I. The contrivance of every Animal, and eſpecially of a Humane Body, is ſo curious and exquiſite, that 'tis almoſt impoſſible for any Body, that has not ſeen a diſſection well made and Anatomically conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, to imagine or conceive how much excellent Workmanſhip is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd in that admirable Engine. But of this having diſcours'd elſewhere more fully, I ſhall here onely tell you in a word (and 'tis no <hi>Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi>) that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid on another occaſion. <hi>That the fooliſh things of</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 25.</note> 
               <hi>God are wiſer than Men, and the weak things of God ſtronger than Men.</hi> So we may ſay, that the meaneſt living Creatures of God's making, are far more wiſely contrived, than the moſt excellent pieces of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48133:15"/>
that Humane heads and hands can boaſt of. And no Watch nor Clock in the World, is any way comparable for exquiſiteneſs of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaniſm, to the body of even an Aſs or a Frog.</p>
            <p n="14">14. II. But God's Wiſedom is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended as well by the <hi>Variety,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Number</hi> of the kinds of living Creatures, as by the <hi>Fabrick</hi> of each of them in particular. For the skill of Humane Architects and other Artiſts is very narrow, and for the moſt part limited to one or to a few ſorts of contrivements. Thus many an Architect can build a Houſe well, that cannot build a Ship: and (as we daily ſee) a man may be an excellent Clock-maker, that could not make a good Watch, and much leſs contrive well a Fouling-piece, or a Wind-mill.</p>
            <p n="15">15. But now the Great Author of Nature has not onely created four Principal ſorts of living Engins, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Beaſts, Birds, Fiſhes and Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; which differ exceedingly from one another, as the ſeveral Regions
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48133:16"/>
or Stages where they were to act their parts, required they ſhould do; but under each of theſe comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive <hi>Genders</hi> are compriz'd I know not how many ſubordinate <hi>Species</hi> of Animals, that differ exceedingly from others of the ſame kind, according to the Exigency of their Particular Natures. For not onely the Fabrick of a Beaſt (as a Lion) is very differing from that of a Bird, or a Fiſh, (as an Eagle or a Whale;) but in the ſame <hi>Species</hi> the Structure or Mechaniſm of particular Animals is very unlike. Witneſs the difference between the Parts of thoſe Beaſts that chew the Cud, and thoſe that do not; and between the Hog and the Hare, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in their Entrals; and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Parrot and a Batt, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe between a Whale, a Star-fiſh, a Lobſter, and an Oyſter, (to mention now no other Inſtances.) And if with divers Philoſophers both Ancient and Modern, we admit <hi>Vegetables,</hi> into the rank of living Creatures; the Number of theſe being ſo great, that above ſix thouſand kinds of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48133:16"/>
were many years ago reckon'd up; the manifold diſplays of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mechaniſm, and ſo of its <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> will by that great Variety of living Engins, be ſo much the more conſpicuous.</p>
            <p n="16">16. III. That which much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hances the excellent Contrivances to be met with in theſe <hi>Automata,</hi> is the Symmetry of all the various parts that each of them conſiſts of. For an Animal, though conſider'd in his ſtate of Intireneſs, he is juſtly look'd upon as one Engine; yet really this total Machine (if I may ſo call it) is a complex thing made up of ſeveral Parts, which conſider'd ſeparately may paſs each of them for a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Engine excellently ſitted for this or that Particular Uſe. As an Eye is an admirable Optical Inſtrument to enable a Man to ſee; and the Hand is ſo well fram'd for a multitude of Mechanical uſes, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought ſit to call it the <hi>Organ of Organs,</hi> (or <hi>Inſtrument of Inſtruments.</hi>) It ought therefore highly to recommend the Wiſedom of the Great <hi>yotſer hakkol</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48133:17"/>
               <hi>Former of all things</hi> (as the Scripture<note place="margin">Jer. X. 16.</note> ſtyles him,) that he has ſo fram'd each Particular part of a Man (or other Animal,) as not to let the skill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on that, hinder him from making that part or member it ſelf, and every other, neither bigger nor leſs, nor (in a word) otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, than was moſt expedient for the completeneſs and welfare of the whole Animal. Which manifeſts that this Great Artiſt had the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick under his Eye at once; and did at one View behold all that was beſt to be done, in order to the complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the whole Animal, as well as to that of each member and other part, and admirably provided for them both at once. Whereas many an excellent Artificer, that is able to make a ſingle Engine very complete, may not be able to make it a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious part of a Complex or Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate of Engins. As 'tis not every one that can make a good Pump, that can make a good Ship pump; nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chymiſt that can build an Oven for a Bake houſe, that can make one
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48133:17"/>
fit to be ſet up in a Ship: and we ſee that our <hi>Pendulum Clocks,</hi> that are moved with weights, and go very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly a-ſhore, cannot yet be brought to perform their Office (of conſtantly meaſuring of time) when ſet up in a ſayling Ship.</p>
            <p n="17">17. IV. The fourth way by which God manifeſts his Wiſedom in his Corporeal Creatures, is, their mutual uſefulneſs to one another, in a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either of dependency or of coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. This ſerviceableneſs may be conſidered, either as the parts of the Animal have a relation to one another, and to the whole body they make up; or as intire and diſtinct bodies have reference to or dependency on each other. To the firſt ſort of utility belong the uſes of the parts of the Humane body, for inſtance; which are ſo fram'd, that beſides theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Offices or Functions that ſome of them exerciſe for the good of the whole, as the Stomach for concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aliments, the Brain for ſupplying Animal ſpirits to move the limbs, and other parts, the Kidneys to ſeparate the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48133:18"/>
ſuperfluous <hi>Serum</hi> of the Bloud; there are many other particular parts that have that ſubſerviency to one another, that no deſpicable portion of the Books of Anatomy is employ'd in the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. And divers Conſents of parts, and utilities that accrue from one to the other, are farther diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Diſeaſes, which primarily affecting one part or member of the Body, diſcover that this or that other part has a dependance on it, or a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular relation to it, though perhaps not formerly taken notice of. To the ſecond part of utility belong thoſe parts that diſcriminate the Sexes of Animals, which (parts) have ſuch a relation one to another in the Male and the Female, that 'tis obvious they were made for the conjunction of both in order to the propagation of the <hi>Species.</hi> I cannot here ſpend time to conſider the fitneſs of the Diſtance and Situation of the Sun, the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of its Motion under the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and (eſpecially) the compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that Nature makes by one thing for another, the exceſs of whoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48133:18"/>
would elſe be noxious to men, as the great heats and dryneſs that reign in many parts of the Torrid Zone and ſome neighbouring Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, would render thoſe Countries barren and uninhabitable, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients thought them, if they were not kept from being ſo, by the Ete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians and the Trade-winds, which blow regularly (though not always the ſame way) for a great part of the hotteſt ſeaſons of the Year, and are aſſiſted by the length of the Nights, by the Copious and laſting Rains that fall at ſet times, by the greatneſs of the Rivers, (ſome of them periodically overflowing their banks to great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) and by the winds that in many places blow in the Night from the Land Seaward, and in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Sea towards the Land; for theſe, and ſome other ſuch things, do ſo moiſten and refreſh the Ground, and contemperate the Air, that in many of thoſe Climates which the Ancients thought parch'd up and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabitable, there are large Kingdoms and Provinces that are both fruitfull
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48133:19"/>
and Populous, and divers of them very pleaſant too. But as I was ſaying, I cannot ſtay to proſecute what might be repreſented to ſhew the uſefulneſs of many of God's other ſenſible works to the Nobleſt kind of them Men. But I ſhall rather content my ſelf by adding a few lines, to point farther at the reference that God has been pleas'd to make many other things have to the welfare of Men and other Animals; as we ſee that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the uſual courſe of Nature, Lambs, Kids, and many other living Creatures, are brought into the World at the Spring of the Year; when tender Graſs and other Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive plants are provided for their food. And the like may be obſerv'd in the production of Silk-worms, whoſe Eggs according to Natures inſtitution, are hatch'd when Mulbury Trees begin to Bud, and put forth thoſe leaves where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe pretious inſects are to feed; the aliments being tender whilſt the Worms themſelves are ſo, and growing more ſtrong and ſubſtantial, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects increaſe in Vigour and Bulk.</p>
            <p n="18">
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48133:19"/>18. <hi>There</hi> is one thing, which though it might perhaps have been more properly brought in before, muſt not here be pretermitted. For beſides what was lately ſaid of the excellent Fabrick of the bodies of Men and other Animals, we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly take notice how much more wonderfull than the ſtructure of the <hi>grown body</hi> muſt be the contrivance of a <hi>Semen Animatum:</hi> ſince all the future <hi>parts,</hi> (ſolid as well as ſoft,) and the <hi>functions,</hi> and many of the <hi>Actions</hi> (and thoſe to be variable <hi>pro re nata</hi>) of the Animal to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd, muſt be durably delineated, and as it were <hi>couch'd</hi> in a little por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of matter, that <hi>ſeems</hi> Homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and <hi>is</hi> unquaſtionably ſluid. And that which much increaſes the Wonder, is, that one of theſe latent impreſſions or powers, namely the Plaſtick, or Prolifick, is to lye dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant perhaps above thirty or forty Years, and then to be able to produce many more ſuch Engins as is the Animal it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48133:20"/>[I have hitherto, among the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal<note place="margin">What is included in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratheſis may be skip'd.</note> Works of God, taken notice onely of thoſe Productions of his Power and Wiſedom that may be obſerv'd in <hi>the viſible World.</hi> So that I may be allowed to conſider farther, that not onely the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, but the generality of other Philoſophers, believe the World to be finite: and, though the Carteſians will not ſay it is ſo, but chuſe rather to call it <hi>indefinite,</hi> yet as it is elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhewn, their Opinion is rather a well meant piece of modeſty, than a ſtrict truth. For in reality, the World muſt every way have bounds, and conſequently be finite, or it muſt not have bounds, and ſo be truely boundleſs, or, (which is the ſame thing in other terms) <hi>infinite.</hi> And if the World be bounded, then thoſe that believe a Deity, to whoſe Nature it belongs to be of infinite Power, muſt not deny that God is, and ſtill was, able to make other Worlds than this of ours. And the Epicureans, who admitted no <hi>Omnipotent Maker</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48133:20"/>
of the World, but ſubſtituted <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Atomes</hi> in his Stead, taught that by reaſon the cauſes ſufficient to make a World, that is Atomes and Space, were not wanting; Chance has actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made many Worlds, of which ours is but one; and the Carteſians muſt, according to their Doctrine of the Indefiniteneſs of Corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, admit that our viſible World, or if they pleaſe, <hi>Vortex,</hi> by which I mean the greateſt extent our eyes can reach to, is but a <hi>part,</hi> and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively but a very ſmall one too, of the <hi>whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe:</hi> which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend beyond the utmoſt Stars we can ſee, incomparably farther than thoſe remoteſt viſible bounds are diſtant from our Earth.</p>
            <p>Now if we grant with ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Philoſophers, that God has made other Worlds beſides this of ours, it will be highly probable that he has there diſplay'd His manifold Wiſedom, in productions very differing from thoſe wherein we here admire it. And even without ſuppoſing any more than one Univerſe: as all that portion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48133:21"/>
of it that is viſible to us, makes but a part of that vaſtly extended aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of bodies: So if we but ſuppoſe, that ſome of the Celeſtial Globes, whether viſible to us, or plac'd beyond the reach of our ſight, are peculiar Syſtemes, the conſideration will not be very different. For ſince the fix'd Stars are many of them incomparably more remote than the Planets, 'tis not abſurd to ſuppoſe that as the Sun, who is the fix'd Star neareſt to us, has a whole Syſteme of Planets that move about him, ſo ſome of the other fix'd Stars may be each of them the Centre, as it were, of another Syſteme of Celeſtial Globes: ſince we ſee that ſome Planets themſelves, that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Aſtronomers to be much inferiour in bigneſs to thoſe fix'd Stars I was ſpeaking of, have other Globes that do as it were depend on them, and move about them; as, not to mention the Earth that has the Moon for its Attendant, nor <hi>Saturn</hi> that is not altogether unaccompanied, 'tis plain that <hi>Jupiter</hi> has no leſs than four <hi>Satellites</hi> that run their Courſes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48133:21"/>
about Him. And 'tis not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted, that none of theſe leſſer and ſecondary Planets, (if I may ſo call them) that moves about <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> is viſible to the naked eye, and therefore they were all unknown to the Ancient Aſtronomers, who liv'd before the invention of Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopes. Now, in caſe there be other Mundane Syſtemes (if I may ſo ſpeak) beſides this viſible one of ours, I think it may be probably ſuppos'd that God may have given peculiar and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable inſtances of His inexhauſted Wiſedom in the Contrivance and Government of Syſtemes, that for ought we know may be fram'd and manag'd in a manner quite differing, from what is obſerv'd in that part of the Univerſe that is known to us. For beſides that here on Earth the Loadſtone is a Mineral ſo differing in divers affections, not onely from all other Stones, but from all other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that are not Magnetical, that this Heteroclite Mineral ſcarce ſeems to be Originary of this World of ours, but to have come into it, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48133:22"/>
from ſome other World or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme; I remember that ſome of the Navigators that diſcovered <hi>America,</hi> took notice that at their firſt coming into ſome parts of it, though they found great ſtore of Animals and Plants, yet they met with few of the latter, and ſcarce any of the former, of the ſame Species with the living Creatures of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. Now in theſe other Worlds; <hi>beſides</hi> that we may ſuppoſe that the Original Fabrick, or that Frame into which the Omniſcient Architect at firſt contriv'd the parts of their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was very differing from the ſtructure of our Syſteme; <hi>beſides</hi> this, I ſay, we may conceive that there may be a vaſt difference betwixt the ſubſequent <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> and producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons obſervable in one of <hi>thoſe</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemes, from what regularly happens in <hi>ours,</hi> though we ſhould ſuppoſe no more, than that two or three Laws of Local Motion may be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe unknown Worlds, from the Laws that obtain in ours. For if we ſuppoſe, for inſtance, that every
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48133:22"/>
entire Body, whether ſimple or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, great or ſmall, retains al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a motive Power, (as Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers commonly think that the Soul does, when it has mov'd the Humane Body; and as the Epicureans and many other Philoſophers think all Atomes do, after they have impell'd one aonther) this power of exciting Motion in another Body, without the Movents looſing its own, will appear of ſuch moment to thoſe that duely conſider, that Local Motion is the <hi>firſt</hi> and chiefeſt of the <hi>ſecond</hi> cauſes that produce the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of Nature: that they will eaſily grant that theſe <hi>Phoenomena</hi> muſt be ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diverſifyed, by ſpringing from principal cauſes ſo very differingly qualifyed. Nor (to add another way of varying Motion) is it abſurd to conceive, that God may have created <hi>ſome</hi> parts of matter to be of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>quieſcent,</hi> (as the Carteſians and divers other Philoſophers ſuppoſe all matter to be in its own Nature,) and determin'd to continue at reſt till ſome outward Agent force it into Motion:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48133:23"/>
and yet that He may have endow'd <hi>other</hi> parts of the matter, with a Power like that which the Atomiſts, aſcribe to their Principles, of reſtleſly moving themſelves, without looſing that power by the motion they excite in quieſcent bodies. And the Laws of this <hi>propagation</hi> of Motion among bodies, may be not the ſame with thoſe that are eſtabliſhed in our World: ſo that <hi>but</hi> one half, or ſome leſſer part, (as a third,) of the Motion that is here communicated from a body of ſuch a bulk and velocity, to another it finds at reſt, or ſlowlier mov'd than it ſelf, ſhall there paſs from a Movent to the body it impells; though all circumſtances, except the Laws of Motion, be ſuppos'd to be the ſame. Nor is it ſo extravagant a thing, as at firſt it may ſeem, to entertain ſuch ſuſpicions as theſe. For in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Philoſophy, beſides that the Notion and Theory of Local Motion are but very imperfectly propos'd, there are Laws or Rules of it <hi>well,</hi> not to ſay <hi>at all,</hi> eſtabliſh'd.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:48133:23"/>20. And as for the Carteſian Laws of Motion, though I know they are received by many learned Men, yet I ſuſpect that it is rather upon the Authority of ſo famous a Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician as <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> than any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victive evidence, that accompanies the Rules themſelves: ſince to me (for Reaſons that belong not to this Diſcourſe,) ſome of them appear not to be befriended either by clear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, or any Cogent Reaſon. And for the Rule that is the moſt uſefull, namely that which aſſerts, <hi>That there is always the ſame quantity of Motion in the World; every Body that moves another, looſing juſt as much of its own as it produces in the other:</hi> the proof he offers, being drawn from the Immutability of God, ſeems very Metaphyſical, and not very cogent to me; who fear that the Properties and Extent of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Immutability, are not ſo well known to us Mortals, as to allow <hi>Carteſius</hi> to make it in our preſent caſe, an argument <hi>à priori.</hi> And <hi>à poſteriori</hi> I ſee not how the Rule
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48133:24"/>
will be demonſtrated: ſince, beſides that it may be queſtioned whether 'tis agreeable to experience in divers inſtances that might be given of communicated Motions here below; I know not what experience we have of the Rules by which Motion is propagated in the Heavenly Regions of the World, among all the Bodies, that make up the Aetherial, (which is incomparably the greateſt) part of the Univerſe. So that the truth of the Carteſian Rules being evinc'd neither <hi>à priori,</hi> nor <hi>à poſteriori;</hi> it appears not why it ſhould be thought unreaſonable to imagine, <hi>that other Syſtemes may have ſome peculiar Laws of Motion;</hi> onely becauſe they differ from thoſe Carteſian Rules, whereof the greateſt part are, at leaſt unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.]</p>
            <p n="21">21. But <hi>though,</hi> if we allow of Suppoſitions and Conjectures, ſuch as thoſe lately mention'd, that are at leaſt not abſurd; they may conduce to amplify ſome of our <hi>Idea</hi>'s of Divine
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48133:24"/>
things; <hi>yet</hi> we need not fly to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary ultra mundane Spaces, to be convinc'd that the Effects of the Power and Wiſedom of God, are worthy of their Cauſes, and not near adequately underſtood by us; if with ſufficient attention we conſider that innumerable multitude, and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able variety of bodies, that make up this vaſt Univerſe. For, there being among theſe a ſtupendious number, that may juſtly be look'd upon as ſo many diſtinct Engins, and many of them very complicated ones too, as containing ſundry ſubordinate ones: to know that all theſe, as well as the reſt of the Mundane matter, are every moment ſuſtain'd, guided and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, according to their reſpective Natures, and with an exact regard to the Catholick Laws of the Univerſe; to know, I ſay, that there is a Being that doeth this every where and every moment, and that manages all things without either aberration or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; is a thing, that if we atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively reflect on, ought to produce in us, for that Supreme Being that can
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48133:25"/>
doe this, the higheſt Wonder, and the lowlieſt Adoration.</p>
            <p>The Epicureans of old did with ſome colour of reaſon, as well as with much confidence, urge againſt the Belief of a Divine Providence, that 'tis unconceivable, and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible; That the Gods ſhould be ſufficient for ſuch differing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting employments, as, according to the exigencies of Natures works, to make the Sun ſhine in one place, the Rain ſhower down in another, the Winds to blow in a third, the Lightening to flaſh in a fourth, the Thunderbolts to fall in a fifth; and in ſhort, other bodies to act and ſuffer according to their reſpective Natures. Wherefore we, that upon good grounds believe that God <hi>really does,</hi> what theſe Philoſophers thought <hi>impoſſible to be done,</hi> by any Agents whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are much wanting in our duty if we do not admire an Al-pervading Wiſedom, that reaches to the utmoſt extent of the Univerſe, and actually <hi>performing</hi> what Philoſophers profeſs'd they could not ſo much as <hi>conceive,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48133:25"/>
highly merits that thoſe difficulties which they thought inſuperable, and ſo, a ſufficient excuſe for their <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> ſhould be a powerfull motive to our <hi>veneration,</hi> of that tranſcendent Wiſedom, that without any trouble ſurmounts them.</p>
            <p n="22">22. We have ſeen ſome diſplays of God's Wiſedom as well as Power, by what we have obſerv'd in his Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Works. <hi>But</hi> 'twill be eaſily granted, that ſome of the Divine Perfections, could not be ſo well expreſs'd or Copied upon Corporeal creatures, as upon the Rational and immaterial ſoul of Man, and other Intellectual Beings: as the picture of an Apple or a Cherry, or the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Number, is not capable of receiving or containing ſo much of an excellent Painter's skill, as he may exhibite in a Piece wherein the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind, and the Laws of Opticks, and of decency, may be fully expreſs'd. And it may well be preſum'd, that if we were as famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly acquainted with God's Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real creatures as we are with his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48133:26"/>
ones, we ſhould perceive, that as Spirits are incomparably more Noble than bodies; ſo the Divine Wiſedom employ'd in the Government and Conduct of them, is more glorious than that which we juſtly admire in the frame and management of his Corporeal Works. And indeed let a Portion of Matter be never ſo fine, and never ſo well contriv'd, it will not be any more than an Engine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of Intellect and Will, truely ſo call'd, and whoſe excellency, as well as its diſtinction from other bodies even the groſſeſt and imperfecteſt, can conſiſt but in Mechanical affections, ſuch as the ſize, ſhape, motion and connexion of its parts: which can neither excite themſelves into motion, nor regulate and ſtop the motion they once are in. Whereas true Spirits, (by which I here mean <hi>immaterial</hi> Subſtances,) have by God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belonging to their Nature, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Will, and an Internal Principle, both of acting ſo and ſo, and of Arbitrarily ceaſing from action. And <hi>though</hi> God, as the Sole Creator
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48133:26"/>
of all Subſtances, has, and if He pleaſe may exerciſe, an abſolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all his Creatures, as well Immaterial as Corporeal; <hi>yet</hi> ſince He has thought fit to govern Spirits according to the Nature He has given them, (which Comprehends both Underſtanding and Will;) to create ſuch Intelligent Free, and Powerfull Beings, as good and bad Angels, (to ſay nothing now of men) and to govern them on thoſe Terms ſo as effectually to make them (however they behave themſelves,) Inſtruments of His Glory, which multitudes of them do as ſubtily, as obſtinately oppoſe; to doe theſe things, I ſay, requires a Wiſedom and Providence, tranſcending any that can be diſplay'd in the formation and management of merely Corporeal Beings. For inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Engins may be ſo contriv'd, as to Act but as we pleaſe, whereas An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Humane Souls are endow'd with a freedom of acting, in moſt caſes, as themſelves pleaſe. And 'tis far eaſier for a skilfull Watch-maker, to regulate the Motions of his Watch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48133:27"/>
than the affections and actions of his Son.</p>
            <p n="23">23. And here give me leave to conſider, that Angels whether good or bad, are very Intelligent and active Beings; and that each of them is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with an Intellect capable of almoſt Innumerable Notions, and degrees, or variations of knowledge, and alſo with a Will, capable of no leſs numerous Exertions or Acts; and of having various Influences upon the Underſtanding, as (on the other ſide) it is variouſly affected by the Dictates of it. So that, (to apply this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to my preſent purpoſe) each particular Angel being ſucceſſively capable of ſo many differing <hi>Moral States;</hi> may be look'd upon, as, in a manner, a diſtinct <hi>Species</hi> of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual kind. And the government of one Daemon, may be as difficult a work, and conſequently may as much declare the Wiſedom and Power of God, as the government of a whole <hi>Species</hi> of inanimate bodies, ſuch as Stones or Metals: whoſe Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines them to a ſtrict conformity
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48133:27"/>
to thoſe primordial Laws of Motion, which were once ſettled by the great Creatour, and from which, they have no Wills of their own to make them ſwerve.</p>
            <p>The Scripture tells us, that in the Oeconomy of Man's Salvation, there is ſo much of the <hi>manifold Wiſedom of God</hi> expreſs'd, that the <hi>Angels themſelves deſire to pry into thoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</hi> When our Saviour, having told his Apoſtles that the day and hour of his future coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (whether of the Jewiſh Nation or the World, I now enquire not) was not then known to any; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, <hi>no, not to the Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>

               <hi>but to his Father onely:</hi> he ſufficiently intimates them to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with excellent <hi>Knowledge,</hi> Superiour to that of Men: and that perhaps may be one of the Reaſons why the Scripture ſtyles them <hi>Angels of Light.</hi> It alſo teaches us that the good Angels are vaſtly numerous, and that as they are of differing Orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome of them being Arch-Angels, and ſome Princes of particular Empires

or Nations: ſo that God aſſigns them very differing and important Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both in Heaven and in Earth; and ſometimes ſuch as oblige them, in diſcharge of their reſpective Truſts, to endeavour the carrying on of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering deſigns.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48133:33"/>
the Wiſedom it ſelf. And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that for God to reconcile his inflexible Juſtice, his exuberant Mercy, and all thoſe other things that ſeem'd to claſh inevitably about the deſign'd Salvation of Men, and make them co-operate to it; is a ſtupendious manifeſtation of Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: there being no Probleme in <hi>Diophantus, Alexandrinus,</hi> or <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Pergaeus,</hi> in Algebra, or in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry, near ſo difficult to be ſolv'd, or that requires, that a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of proportions and congruities ſhould be attended to at once, and made ſubſervient to the ſame Ends; as that Great Probleme propounded by God's Infinite <hi>Goodneſs</hi> to his Divine <hi>Wiſedom; the Redemption of loſt and perverſe Mankind, upon the Terms declar'd in the Goſpel,</hi> which are admirably fitted to promote at once, God's Glory, and Man's feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Though what has been ſaid of the Greatneſs of God's Power and Wiſedom, may juſtly perſuade us that thoſe Attributes are Divine and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48133:33"/>
Adorable; yet I muſt not deny that the Repreſentation that I have made of them, is upon ſeveral accounts, very diſadvantageous. For <hi>firſt,</hi> there has not been ſaid of them in this paper all that even I could have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, to ſet forth their excellency; becauſe I had elſewhere treated of that Subject, and was more willing to preſent you with ſome things I had not ſaid before, than trouble you with many repetitions. But if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſo unfit a Perſon as I, the manifeſtation of the Divine Wiſedom had been undertaken by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingeſt Man in the World, or perhaps even by an Angel, he would find himſelf unable fully to make out the matchleſs Excellency of it. For how much Wiſedom has been exercis'd by an Omniſcient Being, cannot be fully comprehended or, conſequently, deſcrib'd, but by an infinite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. <hi>Beſides,</hi> I have conſidered the Wiſedom diſplay'd by God in the Works of His Creation and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with reſpect to <hi>them</hi> not to <hi>us.</hi> For they are excellent, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48133:34"/>
and in their own Nature, and would ſimply upon that account de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the wonder and the praiſes of Rational Beings, as they are rational: as <hi>Zeuxis</hi> juſtly celebrated the skill of <hi>Appelles,</hi> and modern Geometers and Mechanitians admire <hi>Archimedes.</hi> But in this irrelative contemplation of God's Works, a Man's mind being intent onely upon the excellencies he diſcovers in them, He is not near ſo much affected with a juſt ſenſe of the inferiority of His to the Divine Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, as He would be if He heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſider how much of the vaſt Subjects He contemplates, are undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Him, and how dimm and imperfect the Knowledge is, which He has of that little He does diſcover. And now, (<hi>laſtly</hi>) to the other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages with which I have been reduc'd to <hi>repreſent</hi> (and ſo to ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh.) the Divine Attributes; I muſt add, that I have inſiſted but upon <hi>two</hi> of them, God's <hi>Power</hi> and His <hi>Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> whereas we know that He has divers other perfections, as (beſides thoſe Incommunicable ones, His,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48133:34"/>
Self-experience, Self-ſufficiency, and Independency) His Goodneſs to all His Creatures, His Mercy to ſinfull Men, His Juſtice, His Veracity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as I long ſince noted, we may rationally conceive, that He may have divers Attributes and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently divers Perfections, whereof we have at preſent no <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or perhaps ſo much as particular <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,</hi> the inexhauſtible Fecundity of the Divine Nature being ſuch, that for ought we know, we are acquainted with but a ſmall part of the productions of an Almighty Power, accompanied with an infinite Wiſedom, and excited to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it ſelf by an exuberant Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And indeed I ſee not why we may not ſay that by the Notion or <hi>Idea</hi> we have of Him, and by the help of ſome Attributes we already know He has, we may <hi>in general</hi> conceive, that He has other Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that we yet know not <hi>in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:</hi> ſince of thoſe Attributes that we do already know, <hi>though</hi> the irrelative ones (if I may ſo call them)
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48133:35"/>
ſuch as His Self-exiſtence, Eternity, Simplicity and Independency; may be known by mere ſpeculation, and as it were all at once, by appearing to us as comprehended in the Notion of a Being abſolutely perfect; <hi>yet</hi> there are divers relative Attributes or Perfections, that come to be known but ſucceſſively, and as it were by experience of what He has actually done in relation to ſome of His Creatures. As, the Mercy of God was not known by <hi>Adam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before his fall; and God's Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Faithfulneſs to His promiſes, as particularly that of ſending the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in the <hi>fulneſs of time</hi> was not, (not to ſay could not be) known but in proceſs of time, when ſome of them came to be fulfill'd. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince ſome of God's Perfections require or ſuppoſe the reſpective Natures and Conditions of His Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the actings of ſome of them towards Him, as well as ſome of His towards them; we, that cannot be at all ſure that He may not have made many ſorts of Creatures, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48133:35"/>
have had divers relations to them according to their ſeveral States and Conditions, that we are altogether unacquainted with; cannot know but that ſome of the Attributes of God exercis'd towards theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may remain unknown to us.</p>
            <p n="29">29. But whether the Attributes, known and unknown, be thought to be more or fewer; it will not be denyed, but that the Natural and genuine <hi>reſult</hi> of all theſe Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, (which we conceive under diſtinct Notions, becauſe we are not able to ſee them at one view, united in God's moſt ſimple Eſſence) muſt be a moſt glorious Majeſty; that requires the moſt lowly and proſtrate Venerations of all the Great Creatour's Intelligent Works. And accordingly we may obſerve (from ſome of the formerly cited Texts) that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who of all his mere Creatures are the moſt excellent and knowing, are repreſented in the Scripture as aſſiduouſly employing themſelves, not onely in obeying and ſerving, but in Praiſing, and Adoring the

And indeed ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in general, the Creatures are but Umbratile (if I may ſo ſpeak) and arbitrary Pictures of the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: of divers of whoſe Perfections though they have ſome ſignatures; yet they are but ſuch, as rather give the Intellect riſes and occaſions to take notice of and contemplate the Divine Originals, than they afford it true Images of them: as a Picture of a Watch or Man, or the name of either of them written with Pen and Ink, does not exhibite a true and perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of a thing (whoſe internal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution a ſurface cannot fully repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) but onely gives occaſion to the mind to think of it, and to frame one.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48133:38"/>
And what I have ſaid of the Creatures in general, holds true of the Angels themſelves: who by ſeveral preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives do indeed much ſurpaſs the reſt of their fellow Creatures, but yet are but Creatures, and therefore of a Nature infinitely inferiour to God's; as, though a Thouſand is a far greater Number than ten, and a Million than a Thouſand, yet the latter as well as the two former is beyond compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation diſtant from a Number ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be infinite; ſince otherwiſe a finite Number (that by which the leſſer differs from the greater) would be able by its acceſſion to make a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Number become infinite. But to return to what I was ſaying of the Angels. I thought fit to mention both the Nobleneſs of their Nature, the ſplendidneſs of their Apparitions, and the profound <hi>Veneration</hi> and ardent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Devotion</hi> which they pay'd to their Creatour; becauſe we are wont to eſtimate remote things by compariſon, as modern Philoſophers tell us, that we judge the riſing or ſetting Sun and Moon, to be greater

For thus ſince the Scripture propoſes the Angels to our<note place="margin">Jud.

For, <hi>though</hi> the Scripture ſeems not to ſpeak expreſly of any more ſorts of Spirits, than thoſe good ones that retain the name of (the whole <hi>Genus</hi>) Angels, and the Apoſtates that are commonly call'd Devils, becauſe theſe are the two ſorts of Spirits that it moſt concerns us Men, to be inform'd of: <hi>yet</hi> the Scripture, that in the Hiſtory of the Creation does not clearly ſo much as mention the production of Angels, and elſewhere repreſents them, as well the bad as the good, of very differing <hi>Orders,</hi> (as far as we can gueſs by the ſeveral <hi>Names</hi> it gives<note place="margin">Eph.

But to confine my ſelf to things actually exiſtent; beſides His corporeal

and immaterial Creatures and their faculties or powers whereof we have ſome kind of notice, and beſides per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps multitudes of other things whereof we have no particular <hi>Idea</hi> or Conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; He knows thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we men have alſo <hi>ſome</hi> knowledge, in a manner or degree peculiar to himſelf.

When I conſider the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Excellency,</hi> and the numerous <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of the Deity, I cannot without Wonder, as well as Trouble, obſerve, that Rational Men profeſſing Chriſtanity, and many of them Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious too, ſhould wilfully and perhaps contemptuouſly, neglect to acquire or reflect on, thoſe Notices that are apt to increaſe their knowledge of God,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48133:46"/>
and conſequently their <hi>Veneration</hi> for Him. To aſpire to a farther know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, that we may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter adore Him, is a great part both of Man's Duty and His happineſs. God who has put into Men an innate deſire of knowledge, and a faculty to diſtinguiſh the degrees of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in differing Notices, and to reliſh thoſe moſt, that beſt deſerve it, and has made it His Duty to ſearch and enquire after God, and to love Him above all things, would not have done this, if He had not known that thoſe that make a right Uſe of their faculties, muſt find Him to be the Nobleſt Object of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and that which moſt merits their Wonder and Veneration. And indeed what can be more ſutable to a Rational Creature, than to employ Reaſon to contemplate that Divine Being, which is both the Authour of its Reaſon, and the Nobleſt Object, about which it can poſſibly be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd? The knowledge of ſome dead Language, or ſome old ruſty Medal, or the Opinions and Cuſtoms of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48133:47"/>
ſome Nations or Sects, that did not perhaps Reaſon nor Live any better than we doe now, are thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of curioſity, and even of the laborious induſtry of learned Men; and the ſtudy of things merely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, gains Men the Honourable title of <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> But whatever theſe Objects of inquiry be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 'tis certain the greateſt Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries we can make of them are but trifles, in compariſon of the <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Knowledge</hi> of God, which does as much ſurpaſs that of His Works, as He Himſelf does Them. And 'tis the Prerogative of His Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be infinitely above all that He has made; whether we contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the works of Nature, or thoſe of Art, whereof the former are under another Name, His more immediate Works; and the others the Effects of one of His Works; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence are originally His, though produc'd by the intervention of Man. And though it be moſt true, that on the Corporeal World, God has been pleas'd to ſtamp ſuch impreſſes of His
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48133:47"/>
Power, Wiſedom and Goodneſs, as have juſtly exacted the Admiration even of Philoſophers, yet the Great Authour of the World is Himſelf Incomparably Superiour to all His Workmanſhip, inſomuch that, though He could have made, and always will be able to make, Creatures more Perfect than thoſe He has made, by Incomputable degrees of perfection; yet the Prerogative of His Nature will keep Him neceſſarily Superiour to the excellenteſt Creatures He can make, ſince the very condition of a Creature hinders it from being (to name now no other of the Divine Attributes) Self exiſtent and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent. 'Tis therefore methinks a ſad thing, that we Men ſhould grudge to ſpend now and then a few hours in the contemplation and internal Worſhip of that moſt. Glorious and Perfect Being, that continually em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys the Devotion of Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48133:48"/>
the Nativity of the World, and I think they may well be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to have an ardent deſire to obtain a farther knowledge of God Himſelf. Since, as an Apoſtle aſſures us, they earneſtly deſire to look into the truths contain'd in the Goſpel, and the Diſpenſations of God towards frail and mortal Men.</p>

But, not to urge that the Latin ſentence is taken but out of an Apocryphal Book; I anſwer that the <hi>Secret things</hi> of God that are to be left to Himſelf, ſeem to be His unrevealed purpoſes and decrees and His moſt abſtruſe Eſſence or Subſtance, the ſcrutiny whereof I readily acknowledge not to belong to us. But I think there is a great difference between contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating God out of a ſaucy curioſity, merely to know ſomewhat that is not common of Him, and doing it out of an humble deſire by a farther knowledge of Him to heighten our

Reverence and Devotion towards Him. 'Tis an effect of Arrogance to endeavour, or ſo much as hope, to comprehend the Divine Perfections ſo as to leave nothing in them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the enquirer, but to aſpire to know them farther and farther, that they may proportionably appear more and more admirable and lovely in our eyes, is not onely an excuſable but a laudable curioſity.

Suppoſing it then law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to contemplate God, not with deſign to pry into His Decrees and Purpoſes, nor to Dogmatize in points controverted among the learned about His Nature and Attributes, but to excite in our ſelves the ſentiments which His indiſputable Perfections, are by a more attentive view qualified to produce: I conſider that the Devout Contemplation of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides other great advantages that it brings the mind, inſomuch that the Humane underſtanding, like <hi>Moſes</hi>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48133:49"/>
happy Converſation may have upon the graces and vertues of the mind, I take it to be one of the moſt delightfull exerciſes, that the Soul is capable of, on this ſide Heaven. 'Tis generally acknowledg'd that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is one of the moſt pleaſing affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind, which ſometimes when the Object deſerves it, is ſo poſſeſt thereby, as to forget all other things, or leave them unregarded as it often happens in Masks and other pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous and ſurprizing ſhews or ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and as upon a better ground it happen'd to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when being raviſh'd with the glorious transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his and our Maſter upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> he exclaim'd that 'twas good for them to be there, and talk'd of building Tabernacles for thoſe that had Heavenly Manſions; being ſo tranſported with the raviſhing ſight, that the Evangeliſt expreſly Notes that <hi>he knew not what he ſaid.</hi> Now;<note place="margin">Lu. 9. 23.</note> the pleaſure that admiration gives, being uſually proportionate to the uncommon Nature and indearing Circumſtances of the thing admired,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48133:50"/>
how can any admiration afford ſuch a contentment, as that which has God Himſelf for its Object, and in Him the moſt ſingular and the moſt Excellent of all Beings. The wonder produc'd in us by an humble and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Contemplation of God, has two main advantages, above the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have for any of His Works, or of our own. For firſt when we admire Corporeal things, how noble and pretious ſoever they be, as Stars and Gemms, the contentment that accompanies our wonder is allay'd by a kind of ſecret reproach grounded on that very wonder; ſince it argues a great imperfection in our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, to be pos'd by things that are but Creatures, as well as we, and which is worſe, of a nature very much inferiour to ours. Whereas 'tis no diſparagement at all for a humane, and conſequently a finite Intellect to be poſſeſſed with wonder, though it were heightened to amazement, or aſtoniſhment, by the Contemplation of that moſt Glorious and Infinitely Perfect Being, which muſt neceſſarily
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48133:50"/>
exceed the adequate comprehenſion of any Created Intellect. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that there is a farther and much greater (which is the ſecond) advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the admiration of God, above that of other things, for other Objects having but a bounded Nature and commonly but ſome one thing fit to be wondred at, our admiration of them is ſeldom laſting, but after a little familiarity with them, firſt languiſhes and then ſeaſes. But God is an Object, whoſe Nature is ſo very Singular, and whoſe Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo immenſe, that no Aſſiduity of conſidering Him, can make Him ceaſe to be admirable, but the more knowledge we obtain of Him, the more Reaſon we find to admire Him. So that there may be a perpetual viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of our happy acqueſts of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degrees of knowledge, and our eager deſires of new ones. Becauſe we give Him but one Name, we are apt to look upon Him as but one Object of ſpeculation; but, though God be indeed but one in Eſſence or Nature, yet ſuch is His immenſity,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48133:51"/>
and if I may ſo ſpeak, Fecundity, that He is unſpeakably Various in the capacity of an Object. Thus Heaven goes under one Name, but contains ſo many ſixt Stars and Planets, and they by their diverſity of Motions exhibit ſo many <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> that though they have employed the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of Aſtronomers for many Ages, yet our times have in the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial part of the World, made diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries as conſiderable, if not as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as all thoſe of the Ancients; and as our Optick Glaſſes have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected many ſixt Stars, and divers Planets that were unknown to former times, ſo our Navigatours, by their Voyages beyond the Line, have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered divers whole conſtellations in the Southern Hemiſphere. So that though Heaven be an Object, that has been perpetually and conſpicuouſly expoſed to Mens view and curioſity, for ſome thouſands of years, yet it ſtill affords new Subjects for their wonder: and I ſcarce doubt but by the farther improvement of Teleſcopes, Poſterity will have its curioſity gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48133:51"/>
by the diſcovery both of new Conſtellations, and of new Stars, in thoſe that are known to us already. We need not therefore fear our admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God ſhould expire, for want of Objects fit to keep it up. That boundleſs Ocean contains a variety of excellent Objects, that is as little to be exhauſted as the Creatures that live in our ſublunary Ocean or lie on the ſhores that limit it, can be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. To the Wonderfull Excellency of God, may be juſtly apply'd that Notion, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> lays down as a kind of definition of Infinite, namely that 'tis that of which how much ſoever one takes, there ſtill remains more to be taken. If the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect ſhould for ever make a farther and farther Progreſs in the knowledge of the Wonders of the Divine Nature, Attributes and Diſpenſations; yet it may ſtill make diſcoveries of freſh things worthy to be admired; as in an infinite Series or row of aſcending numbers, though you may ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to greater and greater numbers; yet all that you can doe by that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48133:52"/>
Progreſs, is to go farther and farther from the firſt and leaſt term of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, (which in our caſe anſwers to the ſmalleſt degree of our knowledge of God) without ever <hi>reaching,</hi> or which may ſeem ſtrange, but is true, ſo much as <hi>approaching</hi> to an Infinite number, (in caſe there were any ſuch) or even to the greateſt of all numbers: as will be acknowledged by thoſe that have look'd into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of progreſſions <hi>in Infinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="35">35. The two advantages I come from mentioning which the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God has in point of delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs joyn'd to the other advantages of our contemplation of Him, have I hope perſuaded you that they are very much wanting to themſelves, as well as to the Duty they owe their Maker, that refuſe or neglect to give their thoughts ſo pleaſing, as well as Noble, an employment. And I am apt to think upon this account in particular, that Reaſon is a greater bleſſing to other Men, than to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts, who whilſt they are ſuch cannot employ it about God, but with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48133:52"/>
disbelief or terrour; and that on this very ſcore, <hi>Epicurus</hi> was far leſs happy than <hi>Plato,</hi> ſince whereas the latter was oftentimes as it were ſwallowed up in the Contemplation of the Deity; The former had no ſuch glorious Object, to poſſeſs Him with an equally rational and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full admiration.</p>
            <p n="36">36. But now, (to apply this to the ſcope of this whole diſcourſe) though ſo pure and ſpiritual a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is a very allowable attractive; to elevate our thoughts, to the moſt glorious and amiable of Objects, yet it ought to be both the deſign and the effect of our admiration of God, to produce in us leſs unworthy <hi>Idea's,</hi> and more honourable and reverent thoughts, of that Wonderfull and unparallel'd Being. Of whom the more we diſcover, the more we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Him to be Superiour to all His Works, and particularly to our ſelves, who are not of the higheſt Order of them, and who, as mere men, are ſcarce in any thing more Noble, than in the capacity and permiſſion
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48133:53"/>
of knowing, admiring and adoring God. Which he that thinks a mean and melancholy employment, might be to ſeek for happineſs in Heaven it ſelf, if ſo unqualified a Soul could be admitted there. The genuine effect of a nearer or more attentive view of Infinite excellency, is a deep ſenſe of our own great inferiority, to it, and of the great inferiority, to it, and of the great Veneration and fear we owe (to ſpeak in a Scripture phraſe) to this glorious and fearfull Name, (that is, Object) <hi>The Lord</hi>

by God, thoſe mental offerings that conſiſt in High and Honourable thoughts of Him, and in lowly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſentiments of our ſelves in the view of His Excellency, will not be leſs acceptable to Him: ſuch <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and devout fear</hi> (to ſpeak with<note place="margin">Heb 12. 28.</note> the inſpired writer to the Hebrews) being indeed a kind of <hi>adoring God</hi>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48133:54"/>
the more influence and advantages we derive from it: agreeably to which God, is introduced in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſaying of one of His adorers, to whom in the ſame Pſalm many other bleſſings are alſo promiſed, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has ſet his love upon me,</hi>

            <p>We have generally, through Inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitancy, or Vice, or Prejudices, or the Majeſty and abſtruſeneſs of the Subject, ſo great an Indiſpoſition to excite and cheriſh in our ſelves an awfull Veneration for God, and a ſtudious Contemplation of His ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Attributes; that it ſeemed no more than needfull to employ variety of <hi>Arguments,</hi> drawn from different Topicks, to <hi>engage</hi> our own and other Mens minds, and repeated <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcations</hi> to <hi>preſs</hi> them, to an Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, which they neither are, nor are willing to be, acquainted with. This Conſideration will, I hope, be my Apology, if in the preſent Tract I lay hold on ſeveral occaſions, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48133:55"/>
make uſe of diverſities of Diſcourſe, to recommend a Duty, that does very much both merit and need to be not onely propoſed but inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And yet I will not any farther lengthen this foregoing Excurſion, (as I hope you will think it, rather than a mere Digreſſion,) nor any longer forget, that when I begun it, I was diſcourſing of the great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and profound reſpect, with which we ought to ſpeak of God.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48133:55"/>
blemiſhed with dark ſpots: <hi>So</hi> the light of Humane reaſon is but very ſmall and dim, in compariſon of His Knowledge, that is truely called in<note place="margin">Pſal. 36. 9.

            <p>Upon theſe and divers other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, I, for my part, think it becomes us <hi>Men,</hi> to uſe an awfull Circumſpection; not onely when we make Philoſophical Inquiries or Scholaſtick Diſputes about God, that is, when we preſume to <hi>diſcourſe of Him;</hi> but when we ſolemnly deſign
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48133:56"/>
               <hi>to praiſe Him,</hi> for 'tis one thing to ſay <hi>true</hi> things of God, and another to ſay things <hi>worthy</hi> of God: Our <hi>Idea</hi>'s of Him may be the beſt we are able to frame, and yet may far better expreſs the greatneſs of <hi>our veneration</hi> for Him, than the immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>His Perfection:</hi> and even thoſe Notions of them that may be worthy of the moſt Intelligent of Men, will fall extremely ſhort of being worthy of the incomprehenſible God. The brighteſt and leaſt unlike <hi>Idea</hi> we can frame of God, is infinitely more inferiour in reference to Him, than a <hi>Parhelion</hi> is in reference to the Sun. For, though that Meteor appear a ſplendid and ſublime thing, and have ſo much reſemblance to the Sun (without whoſe own beams it is not produced) as to be readily perceived to be his image, excluſively to that of any other: yet reſiding in a Cloud, whoſe Station is near the Earth, 'tis by an immenſe diſtance <hi>beneath</hi> the Sun; and is no leſs <hi>inferiour</hi> to him in bigneſs and in ſplendour; as well as in many other Attributes. He
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48133:56"/>
has in my Opinion the trueſt Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for God, not who can ſet forth His Excellencies and Prerogatives in the moſt high and pompous expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but he who willingly has a deep and real ſenſe of the unmeaſurable inferiority of himſelf and his beſt <hi>Idea</hi>'s, to the unbounded and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd Perfections of his Maker. And here Indignation prompts me to this reflexion, that if [Since] even our Hymns and Praiſes of God the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being deſerve our bluſhes and need His pardon, what confuſion will one day cover the faces of thoſe, that do not onely ſpeak ſlightly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, but oftentimes contemptuouſly, and perhaps drollingly, of that Supreme and Infinitely Perfect Being, to whom they owe thoſe very Faculties and that witt which they ſo ungratefully, as well as impiouſly miſemploy? And indeed, ſuch tranſcendent Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as the Divine ones <hi>muſt</hi> be, might juſtly diſcourage us from offering ſo much as to Celebrate them, if Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Goodneſs were not one of them. I ſhall not therefore allow my ſelf
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48133:57"/>
the preſumption of pretending to make as it were a Panegyrick of God, of whom 'tis very eaſie to ſpeak too much, though it be not poſſible to ſay enough: contenting my ſelf with an humble Adoration of Perfections whereof my utmoſt praiſes would rather expreſs my own weakneſs than their excellency: ſince of this Ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Object the higheſt things that can be expreſſed in words, muſt therefore fall ſhort becauſe words cannot expreſs them. Which aſſertion, though it be a Paradox, yet I think it is not truely an Hyperbole. For we are not able to determine and reach, ſo much as in our thoughts, the greateſt of all poſſible numbers: ſince we may conceive that any one (whatſoever it be) that can be pitched upon or aſſigned, may be doubl'd, trebl'd, or multiply'd by ſome other Number; or may be but the Root of a Square or Cubical Number. By which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (that perhaps you have not met with) you may perceive that any determinate conception that we can have (for example) of God's Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48133:57"/>
(to ſpecifie now no other of His Attributes) muſt therefore be ſhort of it, becauſe it is a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or bounded conception.

               <p>THE reſult of what hath been ſaid in the paſt Excurſion, will, I hope, amount to a ſufficient juſtification of what hath been ſaid at the beginning of this Diſcourſe, about <hi>The High Veneration our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects owe to God.</hi> For <hi>Since</hi> we may well think <hi>in general,</hi> that he hath divers Attributes and Perfections of which we have <hi>no knowledge</hi> or ſuſpicion <hi>in particular;</hi> and <hi>Since</hi> of thoſe Attributes of His that are the moſt manifeſt to us, as His <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſedom,</hi> we have but <hi>a very dim and narrow knowledge;</hi> and may clearly perceive that there is in theſe an unbounded Extent of Perfection, beyond all that we can evidently and diſtinctly diſcern of them: how unfit
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48133:59"/>
muſt ſuch imperfect Creatures, as we are, be to talk haſtily and confidently of God, as of an Object that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted underſtandings graſp, as they are able (or pretend to be ſo) to do other Objects! And how deep a ſenſe ought we to have of our Ineſtimable inferiority, to a Being, in reference to whom, both our ignorance and our knowledge ought to be the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of Devotion! Since our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ignorance proceeds from the numerouſneſs, and Incomprehenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of His (many of them undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered) Excellencies, and our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge qualifies us but to be the more Intelligent Admirers of His conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perfections.</p>
               <p>If we duly and Impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe and the like things, we may clearly perceive, how great an effect and mark of ignorance, as well as preſumption, it is, for us Mortals to talk of God's Nature and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of His Knowledge, as of things that we are able to look through, and to Meaſure. Whereas we ought
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48133:59"/>
whenever we ſpeak of God, and of His Attributes, to ſtand in great awe, leſt we be guilty of any miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion or miſrepreſentation of him, that we might by any warineſs and humility of ours have avoided; and leſt by an over-weening Opinion of our ſelves, we preſume that we have a <hi>perfect,</hi> or at leaſt a <hi>ſufficient,</hi> knowledge of every thing in God, whereof we have <hi>ſome</hi> knowledge; ſince this at the leaſt conſiſts in ſuch Notions, as are rather ſuited to our limited faculties, than any way equal to His Boundleſs Perfections.</p>
               <p>That Higher Order of Intellectual Beings the Angels; though their minds be ſo Illuminated, and their Knowledge ſo extenſive, the Angels themſelves, I ſay, are in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirmed to <hi>be deſirous to pry into the Myſteries of the Goſpel:</hi> whence we may gueſs, how far they are from penetrating to the bottom of what the Scripture calls <hi>the Depths</hi>
