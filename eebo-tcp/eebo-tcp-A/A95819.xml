            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Samuel Vaſſall</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Eſq;</head>
            <p>HUmbly deſires your Honours to commiſerate his ſad
condition, who for want of his juſt debt due to him
from this Common-wealth, formerly placed upon the
Exciſe, is like to periſh. This Honourable Houſe on the 15
of <hi>May</hi> laſt, recommended as their deſires to his Highneſſe the
Lord Protector, that care might be taken for the ſpeedy pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the ſaid debt, being 2591 <hi>l. 17 s. 6 d.</hi> principall, with
the uſe thereof, which doth amount unto 4251 <hi>l.</hi> as
by Auditors account given to his Highneſſe Honourable
Councell appears, and his Highneſſe recommended the ſame
to his Honourable Councell, that care be taken that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
deſires might be ſatisfied, and on the 26 of <hi>May,</hi> their
Honours did order one thouſand pounds to be paid out of
the Exciſe Office, which he received: But ever ſince that
time, he hath waited at the door of the Honourable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
but had no other anſwer but they knew not where to
place it: So for want of the ſaid money his credit is much
impaired, which is more dear then life to him, and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
like to be deſtroyed, if he finde not ſome ſpeedy relief
from this Honourable Houſe; for his Creditors proſecute
him now with more violence, ſeeing their hopes fruſtrate, in
not receiving that money which they hoped for: Wherefore
he humbly deſires your Honours favourable aſſiſtance that
Mr. <hi>Fowel</hi> may be heard, who is to report to the Honourable
Houſe the concluſion of the Honourable Committee appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for his buſineſſe, and that he may receive ſome ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relief,
that he may not loſe his liberty with his credit, and
ſee his poſterity ruined before his face, which will be as a
double death, and ſo bring his gray hairs with ſorrow to the
grave; but he is confident of the Honour and Juſtice of
this Honourable Houſe, that they will never ſuffer him and his
poſterity to periſh, who hath done and ſuffered ſo much for
their ſakes.</p>
