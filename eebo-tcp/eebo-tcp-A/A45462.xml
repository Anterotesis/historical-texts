            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. WHat hath newly been ſuggeſted, in an <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatorie to the Oxford-heads,</hi> by way of <hi>Reply</hi> to my <hi>Digreſſion about the Learned Hugo Grotius,</hi> will receive punctual <hi>anſwer</hi> within the compaſſe of very <hi>few</hi> leaves. But for the <hi>Readers thrift and eaſe,</hi> I ſhall firſt ſet down the words, wherein the <hi>ſuggeſtion</hi> is delivered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From thence, whence in the thoughts of ſome, I am moſt likely to ſuffer, as to my own Reſolves, I am moſt ſecure. It is in meddling with Grotius his Annotations, and calling into quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion what hath been delivered by ſuch a Gyant in all kinds of literature. Since my ingagement in this buſineſs, and when I had well-nigh finiſhed the vindication of the Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture commonly pleaded, for the Demonſtration of the Deity of Chriſt, from the exceptions put into their Teſtimonies, by the Racovian Catechiſme, I had the ſight of Dr. H's Apologie for him, in his vindication of his diſſertations about Epiſcopacy, from my occaſional Animadverſions, publiſhed in the Preface of my Book of the Perſeverance of the Saints. Of that whole Treatiſe I ſhall elſewhere give an account. My Defenſative as to my dealing with Grotius his Annotations, is ſuited to what the Doctor pleads in his behalfe, which occaſions this mention thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This very Pious, Learned, Judicious man (he tells us) hath fallen under ſome harſh cenſures of late, eſpecially upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Socinianiſme, and Popery. That is, not as though he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47753:3"/>
would reconcile thoſe extremes, but being in Doctrinals a Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, he yet cloſed in many things with the Romane intereſt: as I no way doubt, but Thouſands of the ſame perſwaſions with the Socinians, as to the perſon and offices of Chriſt, do live in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Communion of that Church (as they call it) to this day; of which ſuppoſal I am not without conſiderable grounds, and eminent inſtances for its confirmation. This (I ſay) is their charge upon him. For his being a Socinian (he tells us) Three things are made uſe of to beget a jealouſie in the minds of men of his inclinations that way. 1. Some parcells of a Letter of his to Crellius. 2. Some Relations of what paſſed from him at his Death. 3. Some paſſages in his Annotations. It is this laſt alone wherein I am concerned. And what I have to ſpeake to them, I deſire may be meaſured and weighed by what I do promiſe. It is not that I do entertaine in my ſelf any hard thoughts, or that I would beget in others any evill ſurmiſes of the Eternal condition of that man, that I ſpeak what I do. What am I, that I ſhould judge another mans ſervant? He is fallen to his own Maſter. I am very ſlow to judge of mens Acceptation with God, by the Apprehenſion of their underſtandings. This onely I know, that be men of what Religion ſoever, that is profeſſed in the world, if they are Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, Proud, Boaſters, &amp;c. Hypocrites, haters of good men, perſecutors and revilers of them, yea if they be not regenerate and born of God, united to the head Chriſt Jeſus, by the ſame ſpirit that is in him, they ſhall never ſee God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for the paſſages in his Annotations, the ſubſtance of the Doctors plea is, that the paſſages intimated are in his poſthuma, that he intended not to publiſh them, that they might be of things he obſerved, but thought farther to conſider: and an inſtance is given in that of</hi> Col. 1. 16. <hi>which he interprets, contrarie to what he urged it for,</hi> Joh. 1. 1, 2, 3. <hi>But granting what is affirmed as to matter of fact, about his Collections, (though the Preface to the laſt part of his Annotations will not allow it to be true) I muſt needs abide in my diſſatisfaction to theſe Annotations, and of my reſolves in theſe thoughts give the Doctor this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Of the Socinian Religion there are two main Parts; the firſt is Photinianiſme, the latter Pelagianiſme. The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the perſon, the other the Grace of Chriſt. Let us take
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47753:3"/>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the firſt, I muſt needs tell the Apologiſt, that of all the Texts of the New Teſtament and Old, whereby the Deity of Chriſt is uſually confirmed, and where it is evidently teſtified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, He hath not left any more then one (that I have obſerved) if one, ſpeaking any thing clearly to that purpoſe. I ſay, if one, for that he ſpeaks not home to the buſineſs in hand on</hi> Joh. 1. <hi>I ſhall elſewhere give an account: perhaps ſome one or two more may be interpreted according to the Analogie of that. I ſpeake not of his Annotations on the Epiſtles, but on the whole Bible through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, wherein his expoſitions given, do for the moſt part fall in with thoſe of the Socinians, and oftentimes conſiſt in the very words of</hi> Socinus <hi>and</hi> Smalcius, <hi>and alwaies do the ſame things with them, as to any notice of the Deity of Chriſt in them. So that I marvell the Learned Doctor ſhould fix upon one particular inſtance, as though that one place alone were corrupted by him, when there is not one (or but one) that is not wreſted, perverted, and corrupted to the ſame purpoſe. For the full conviction of the truth hereof, I refer the Reader to the inſuing conſiderations of his interpretations of the places themſelves. The condition of theſe famous Annotations, as to the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, is the ſame; not one Text of the whole Scripture, wherein Teſtimonie is given to that ſacred truth, which is not wreſted to another ſenſe, or at leaſt the Doctrine in it, concealed, and obſcured by them. I do not ſpeak this with the leaſt intention to caſt upon him the reproach of a Socinian: I judge not his Perſon: his Books are publiſhed to be conſidered and judged.</hi> Eraſmus <hi>I know made way for him in moſt of his Expoſitions about the Deity of Chriſt but what repute he hath thereby obtained among all that honor the Eternal Godhead of the ſon of God, let</hi> Bellarmine <hi>on the one hand, and</hi> Beza <hi>on the other, evince. And as I will by no means maintain or urge againſt</hi> Grotius <hi>any of the miſcarriages in Religion, which the Anſwerer of my Animadverſions undertakes to vindicate him from; Nor do I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to fight with the Duſt and Aſhes of men; yet what I have ſaid, is, if not neceſſary to return to the Apologiſt, yet of tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I hope, to the ſatisfaction of others, who may inquire after the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47753:4"/>
reaſon of my calling the Annotations of the learned man to an Account in this Diſcourſe, ſhall any one take liberty to pluck down the Pillars of our Faith, and weaken the grounds of our aſſurance, concerning the perſon and grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhall we not have the boldneſs to call him to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for ſo ſacrilegious an attempt? with thoſe then, who love the Lord Chriſt in ſincerity, I expect no blame or reproach for what I have indevoured in this kinde; yea that my good will ſhall find acceptance with them, eſpecially if it ſhall occaſion any of greater leiſure and abilities farther, and profeſſedly to remark more of the Corruptions of thoſe Annotations, I have good ground of expectation. The truth is, notwithſtanding their pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous ſhew and appearance (few of his Quotations, which was the</hi>
