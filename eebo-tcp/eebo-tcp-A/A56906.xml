         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>FOR the Information of any Sober Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
who may ask,</hi> Why ſo many
People, who for the ſpace of Forty
Years paſt, ſome more, and ſome leſs, who
have been both Born and Bred <hi>Quakers,</hi>
have now left the Society of that
People?</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to which, you may hereby under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
That its true ſuch was the unhappineſs
of the Age wherein we Liv'd, that too too
many were both Born and Bred up, yea over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd
in the Gulpb of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> for the
aforeſaid ſpace of Time, whereby we became
as it were faſt rooted and grounded on that
Foundation, by imbibing many hurtful Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian
Principles, which were inſtilled into us
by our Leaders and Teachers; of whom we
may as juſtly complain in one ſenſe, as the
Prophet of the Lord, did from his Mouth,
<hi>Iſaiah 9.16. The Leaders of my People
have cauſed them to Err.</hi> (By their Lies and
Lightneſs,) yet ſuch has been the merciful
Providence of God Almighty to many of His
poor ſinful Creatures, that for ſome conſiderable
time paſt, He of His own good pleaſure, opened
the Eyes of many of our Vnderſtandings,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38154:3"/>
whereby we began to receive from him (Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally)
ſome ſmall glance of Light, which
we readily imbracing, and by our daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
with the Holy Scriptures of Truth,
(which formerly we have been taught to Slight
and Vndervalue, by our Leaders, their Books
and Preachments; and do attribute that to be
the great reaſon, or means, that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
ſo long in Ignorance) our Minds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
more and more Inlightened thereby, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us a true ſight of our Errors and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes,
plainly declaring unto us the great Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
there was for us to embrace the Doctrine
of Chriſt Crucified, and to be obedient to his
Holy Inſtitutions, if ever we intended to be
Chriſtians; A Doctrine that we were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
unto, by reaſon of our Education, aforeſaid,
and taking the Advice of the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi>
to the <hi>Theſſalonians, I Theſ.</hi> 5. 21. (who ſaid)
<hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is
Good.</hi> As alſo the Apoſtle St. <hi>John,</hi> in his
firſt Epiſtle 4. 5. <hi>Beloved, Believe not every
Spirit, but Try the Spirits; becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
falſe Prophets are gone out into the
World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we began to Prove the Spirits of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and to Try their Doctrines, and bring them
to the Tryal of the Scripture, we found a great
incoherence therein, both as to Doctrine and
Practiſe: Alſo Contradicting the Teſtimony
of the Scriptures. Where its ſaid, <hi>Curſed is
he that adds or diminiſheth.</hi> Vpon which
a Religious Concern came upon many, in divers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38154:3"/>
parts of this Nation, who uſed their utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
according to the Abilities given them
of God, not only to inform their Brethren of their
Vile Errors in Fundamentals, but would will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
have been helpful to reclaim them; but
inſtead of their Harkening to wholeſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
they turned a deaf Ear; and it may
be ſaid of them, as it was ſaid in days paſt
by <hi>Thoſe that regarded not the Cry of the
City, nor the Noiſe of the Driver, who
would not hearken to the Voice of the
Charmer, altho' he Charmed never ſo wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
But inſtead thereof, they perſiſt in all
their abominable Errors, Crying out, to deceive
the Simple, <hi>All is Lyes, we are Wronged;</hi>
and yet dare not to appear to Vindicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
unleſs it be with manifeſt Contradictions
to themſelves, by bringing themſelves in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with God Almighty; Saying, <hi>As God
is One, his Truth and People One, ſo we
are One; the ſame that ever we were, ever
ſince we were called to be a People, and are
not Changed nor Deviated in one Point.</hi>
Altho', as <hi>George Whitehead</hi> ſaith, <hi>We ſee
cauſe otherwiſe to Word the mater (then
formerly) yet our Intentions are ſtill the
ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray what Conſequence can there be inferred,
but that they wilfully take on them the Guilt of
all their Antichriſtian Errors? Then to what
purpoſe ſo many particular Perſons giving forth
<hi>Creeds,</hi> Paipably Contradicting the former
<hi>Creeds,</hi> and Books, if we allow them otherwiſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38154:4"/>
to Word the mater, and their Intentions ſtill
the ſame; whoſe Intentions, as by their Books
manifeſtly appear, as can be proved in many
Hundred Quotations, evidently tend to the
overthrowing of the true Chriſtian Faith;
which Doctrine, as contained in their Books,
are Repugnant to all Proteſtant Chriſtians,
by oppoſing Faith in Chriſt Crucified, and his
holy Inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>Give us leave, by the way, to tell thee, That
whatſoever the high Pretentions of any may be
to Chriſtianity, yet in their bold oppoſing the
poſitive Commands of Chriſt, they plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
themſelves to be no Chriſtians, and
from ſuch every ſincere Perſon ought to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
and come out from their Communion.</p>
            <p>If any <hi>Quaker,</hi> or other Perſon, ſhall queſtion
the Truth of what follows, we Offer, for the
Conviction of the former, or Satisfaction of the
latter, to give them a Sight of the Originals

mean other things like the Papiſts, having

their otherwiſe wording of the matter;
but if what theſe Men ſay be true, then
Chriſt did not Die, for that could not be

a Spirit in their Judgment. However the

Nature made but one Perſon. Now I would
farther query with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or any in

Did that bear our Sins on its Body, on the
Tree of the Croſs? Did the Light within
ſhed it's Blood to ſatisfie the Juſtice of
God? Was the Light within conceived and
Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Crucified, Dead,
Buried and Raiſed again? Did the Light
within aſcend to Heaven, and Sit on the
Right Hand of God, to make interceſſion
for us? All this is affirmed in the Holy

then conſequently, the <hi>Quakers</hi> Chriſt is
