         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF it were possible to please all Humours, I would by all fair means endeavour it; for I perceive that Knaves, and Fools have Honester, and Wiser men much at their Mercy. Opinion is the Common people's Idol; they Make it first, and then they Worship it. Nor matters it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow Frivolous and Weak the Ground is, so the Report be strong; for Rumour is not allwaies found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Truth, and Reason; but like a Pestilence, it Rises from a Vapour; Spreads it self; and One soul Breath, suffices to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame the cleerest Soul in Nature. As it is <hi>Vain,</hi> to strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the stream of Popular Affections: so Providence hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d it <hi>Unnecessary</hi> too, by making the meer Conscience of a Noble Action, a large Requital of it. Nor is it Virtue, but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, or Vanity, that looks beyond its proper self, either for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or Applause. Briefly; the worst that Calumny and Malice, can Throw upon a Private Person, is but a <hi>Tast</hi> of the same Cup, whereof, our Lord and M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ster, hath Drank a Deep, and Bitter Draught before us. All this consider'd; our Religion, or Philosophy, serves us to Little purpose, if we Murmur, Shrink, or Transport our selves, under a Fate so Hard to be Avoided, so Easily Born, and so Glorious to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>
            <p>Let me not be Mistaken; As I think nothing more Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
<pb facs="tcp:97347:3"/>
than to appear Disturb'd, for a Pretence-less, and Maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Scandal, while it regards only the Voluntary, and Trivial Contrivers of it: So do I think nothing more Reasonable, when such an Errour shall have wrought it self into a Credit among Sob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r Persons, than by an Open, Calm, and Clear Defence, for him that's Injur'd to Acquit himself. Nor am <hi>I</hi> Ignorant, what Censure waites upon Discourses of this Quality; nor (to deal Freely) much Concern'd: — upon this Principle, that <hi>I</hi> am Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not to Disoblige any One Person that <hi>I</hi> care to Please.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> reckon that <hi>I</hi> have to deal with <hi>Three</hi> sorts of People.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First,</hi> Consists of such as have no hand at all in my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor: Perhaps, no Knowledge, neither of my Cause, nor Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. These <hi>I</hi> desire by any means not to bestow their Time, or Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, upon This Pamphlet, as having no share in the Intention of it. If t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ey will needs be Medaling, 'tis their Own fault, not Mine, the mis employment of that Hour they Cast away upon it. It is One weakness, to Write Vain Discourses, and 'tis Another to Read them Beside; My Business is a kind of Privacy, and it is scarce Good Manners, in a Stranger to Hearken after it. In sober Earnest, did <hi>I</hi> but know to whose <hi>Ear</hi> properly <hi>I</hi> might Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Sense of what <hi>I</hi> Suffer, <hi>I</hi> should not have Committed it to <hi>Paper.</hi> But, as the Case stands, <hi>I</hi> cannot Avoid it; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a <hi>Publique Defence,</hi> can wipe off a <hi>Publique Scandall</hi>; and That way too, 'tis but to save One Blot, and set another; Hazzarding my Discretion, to secure my Honour. It is with <hi>Books,</hi> just as it is with <hi>Meats,</hi> Some are disposed for <hi>Luxe,</hi> and <hi>Gust</hi>; — Others for <hi>Health;</hi> and some again
<pb facs="tcp:97347:3"/>
for pure <hi>Necessity. I</hi> have provided nothing here for Peevish Palates; nor, in Effect, for any other Persons than such as <hi>I</hi> would make my Friends, and Those <hi>I</hi> Love to Treat with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and Plainnesse. In Fine; hee's a Rude Guest, that Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to a Table Un-invited, disparages his Entertainment: and hee's a Partial Iudge, that blames Another, for Writing that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Necessity, which he himself may Read, or let alone, at pleasure.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> sort, is a <hi>Mistaken</hi> Party: such as have either been <hi>Mis-led,</hi> out of an <hi>Fasinesse</hi> to Credit loose Reports; or by the Current of a Common Vote, Induc'd to an Assent, to what they could not Contradict, and to take <hi>Probabilities</hi> for <hi>Truths,</hi> wanting the means to Discern One, from the Other. These a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the Onely Persons <hi>I</hi> consider, as properly the Subjects of my Care, and Trouble. — <hi>I</hi> would not have my <hi>Suppos'd</hi> Faults, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Really</hi> Theirs. Nor is it less Their Interest, to <hi>Know</hi> the Truth, than Mine to <hi>Tell</hi> it. My <hi>Reputation</hi> lyes at stake, Their <hi>Justice:</hi> and the same Act, that Frees me from a <hi>Misfortune,</hi> Delivers Them too from an <hi>Errour.</hi> It is to <hi>These</hi> then that <hi>I</hi> Dedicate this Demonstration of my Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; not doubting but that such as have made this Apology <hi>Necessa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some people Erre out of <hi>Facility,</hi> and <hi>Heedlesnesse; I</hi> shall bestow a Little <hi>Counsel</hi> upon them: But then there is a <hi>Serious</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

that is not mov'd, but by fair <hi>Likelihoods,</hi> and Strong Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of <hi>Reason,</hi> and Those <hi>I</hi> shall endeavour to prevaile upon, by Evidences of <hi>Fact.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I do accompt that <hi>Babbling Levity,</hi> to <hi>Malice</hi> but what <hi>Chance-Medly</hi> is to <hi>Murther</hi>; perhaps no harm Intended, but a man's <hi>Kill'd</hi> with <hi>Fooling:</hi> beside the Breach of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and the Violation of <hi>Sociable Justice.</hi> This as to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>

            <p>Consider next in point of <hi>Honour</hi>; how Ignoble 'tis to Wound a man behind his <hi>Back</hi>; nay in his <hi>Sleep;</hi> that neither <hi>Knows</hi> his <hi>Enemy,</hi> nor <hi>Feels</hi> the <hi>Wound,</hi> till he is Lost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all possibility of <hi>Defence,</hi> or <hi>Resistance.</hi> Can any thing be <hi>Meaner,</hi> than, for no <hi>Provocation</hi> Given, and for no <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> Expected, to ruine an <hi>Unknown</hi> and (perhaps) <hi>Guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse</hi> person, past all power of Reparation?</p>
            <p>Nor is the Humour more <hi>Discreet,</hi> than <hi>Noble.</hi> It is a <hi>Weaknesse</hi> that Proclaimes it self; and Prints a Marque, and Character of <hi>Folly</hi> upon whoever uses it. Is any man esteemed

(where Two Prime men were a <hi>Saleman,</hi> and an <hi>Ostler</hi>) In this Extremity, nothing was left unsaid, that might Infame me: and with so strong a Confidence too, that the best Friends I had, were stagger'd at it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Commission</hi> was Decry'd for <hi>Counterfeit</hi>; The <hi>Design, Rash,</hi> and <hi>Foolish</hi>: — The <hi>Instrument,</hi> as <hi>much</hi>; — The <hi>Menage, worse</hi>; There were two tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

My Answer was, (with a Respect to their Civility) to this effect: That if I could be so great a <hi>Knave,</hi> as soberly to Contradict my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in order to the Saving of my Life; I was not yet so great a <hi>Fool,</hi> as to be Hang'd, with my Confession about my Neck. The time appointed for my Execution, being the <hi>Thursday</hi> following,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97347:11"/>
The Lords Ordered my Reprieve, commanding MILLS, (the <hi>Iudge-Advocate</hi>) to bring in my <hi>Charge,</hi> upon <hi>Wednesday.</hi> He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared accordingly, but with an Excuse, that he wanted Time to Prepare it; however upon <hi>Friday</hi> it should be Ready. It was then Providentially Demanded; whether they meant to Hang me First, and then Charge me; and if they Intended to execute me in the Interim? He told them, Yes; For <hi>the Commons had pass'd an Order that no Reprieve should stand good, without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Both Houses.</hi> Hereupon, they desired a Conference; but the <hi>Commons</hi> had Voted also, <hi>That no Private Businesse should be Mov'd in Ten dayes.</hi> This notwithstanding; with great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, it was Debated, and my Reprieve confirm'd, for 14. daies: and after That, Prolong'd, in Order to a further Hearing. In this Condition of Expectancy, I lay almost 4. years, a Prisoner; and only an Order betwixt me, and the Gallows. I am the more Particular in This, because I have so many Honorable Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to prove the Truth of every Syllable I say: and yet in this Extremity, I had as much to do to Preserve my Credit among my Pretending, Friends, as to Defend my Life against the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>MY first Step out of <hi>Prison,</hi> was into <hi>Kent,</hi> and There, (God knows it) had my Soul depended upon a strict Account for every Thought, and Moment; I could not have employ'd more Care, and Zeal, in the Performance of my Duty, than I did: Yet in the very height of our Successe, being grown to a Considerable Body, even out of Nothing, It was Suggested that <hi>L'estrange</hi> was <hi>False</hi>: But That Opinion was soon Quieted, by a Discriminating Oath to the Commissioners at <hi>Rochester,</hi> which made those very Persons that had privately aspers'd Me, to withdraw; and diverse of them afterward appear'd openly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us. Upon the Dissolution of the Party, I Cross'd the Sea; and There I found the main Miscariage of the Businesse Cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Me; but still by Those that Ruin'd it Themselves.

At last, upon the Conjunction of the County-Forces, finding some Dangerous, and Unseasonable disagreements, even among themselves; besides some Scruples started against Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, I thought it the best Service I could do them, to render that Command I had, to the Commissioners, and leave Them to Respond, both for the Conduct, and the Issue of the Rest. Nor having done This, did I quitt my Duty; but after the losse of <hi>Maidstone,</hi> I mov'd the Committee at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (although in vain) to give another P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Bayl, to Appear at any time within 12. Months, upon Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p>After that Bond given, I challenge the World to say, where
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97347:12"/>
ever I exchang'd Syllable either with the <hi>Protector,</hi> or his <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi>: or that ever I Communicated, Directly, or Indirectly, with any man of the Party, upon Publique Business. Nay more: Let any man prove that I did ever disown my First Judgement: — That ever I took any <hi>Engagement</hi>: — That I ever held any Particular Converse with any person of Differing Principles: — or, in Fine: — Let it appear that ever I either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined any Rationall means of serving my Prince, my <hi>self,</hi> or Diverted <hi>others</hi> from it; Nay if I am not able to Evidence the contrary; and that I have steadily, and Positively employed all the Faculties, and Interests I had in the World, in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, I am content to suffer, as if I had been the Murtherer of his Father.</p>
            <p>During the Rule of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> there was small Encouragement, to Form any Design, unlesse upon his Person. For Betwixt diverse Renegado-<hi>Royallists,</hi> and Mercenary Male-contents of his own Party, it was scarce possible to Act without Discovery: beside, that he was <hi>Quick</hi> and <hi>Cruell.</hi> (Two great Advantages over a slavish People) His <hi>Death</hi> in 1658. opened the way most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a <hi>Change,</hi> but That which entred upon it, in 1659. was of all others (I think) the Least expected.</p>
            <p>Severall of the Old Members finding the Councell of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers at a Stand, (having Cast off their new Protector) Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Army</hi> to Invite <hi>their Return to a Discharge of their Trust as before Apr.</hi> 20. 1653.

In Testimony hereof, <hi>We are to give you the Thanks of the People of England</hi>; and to assure you, that they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97347:19"/>
are not less <hi>pleased</hi> with your <hi>Method</hi> of promoting the Publick Good, than they are <hi>Obliged</hi> by those <hi>Affections</hi> which have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed you to endeavour it. Particularly, they are exceeding glad to find, that the City hath entrusted such Persons in the Businesse, as, beside all other due Qualifications for the Employment, have This also; that they were never Parties in the Quarrell. It hath been our Care likewise, to proceed by the same rule; and for this Reason, <hi>If Both Parties should be taken in, there might (possibly) be some Animosities started sufficient to obstruct the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding:</hi> And again, <hi>should Either of them be lest out, the matter would (probably) be carried by Faction.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This we are commanded to represent, rather as a <hi>Fair Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> than an <hi>Absolute Necessity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the next place, we are to inform you, that the Engagement you sent us, found so prone a Reception, that we reckon it, with us, a greater difficulty to Find an Enemy to the Intent of it, than to Subdue any whatever, that shall presume to appear against the Promoters of it. We do however hold our Selves bound to assure you, that we are perfectly resolved to Joyn in the Charge, and Hazard of the Dispute, with you: and that we are as Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous in This Cause, as if the Treasure of the Nation had but one Master, and the Strength of it, were but directed by the Same Mind. The List of the Subscribers, we have here in Town: If you desire to see it you may: but if Otherwise, we offer to your Prudence to consider, if it may not be of more Advantage, and Security to the Businesse in hand, rather totally to conceal the Subscribers, if not also the Commissioners themselves. For the Thing it self, we are not only Willing, but Desirous to make That Publique.

                  <p>It is <hi>one</hi> thing for a Person of Honour freely to communicate his Thoughts and Reasonings, (although in favour of a possible

                  <p>To hasten the dispatch of that little we have to say, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this, are of that number to whom your Letter directs. We shall proceed according to our Duties, and Instructions, and briefly acquaint your Excellency with the sense of those that have entrusted us.</p>
                  <p>We shall begin (my Lord) with the <hi>Concession</hi> of what wee much <hi>Suspect</hi>; and take for <hi>Granted,</hi> that the Letter so inscribed, is really <hi>Yours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are next to return you the <hi>Thanks</hi> of your <hi>Country-men,</hi> for the expressions of your <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> therein contained; and <hi>particularly, — that in the head of your Army, you have rather chosen Arguments of Reason, than of Force. — That you propose the word of God, for your Rule; and the Settlement of the Nation, for y<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ur End. — That you take notice of many Factions, and Interests introduced, and yet professe a service to None of them. — That you so earnestly desire to Compose Old Differences at Home, and to Prevent New Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs from Abroad. — And finally; That you submit the Result of all, to a Fair, and Rational Examination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To <hi>profess,</hi> and to <hi>persue</hi> all this, is but <hi>like your self</hi>; and <hi>to these purposes,</hi> we shall not stick to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> at your <hi>Feet.</hi> If upon Discussion of the Reasons you alledge, we assume the Liberty which your Candour allows us, of declaring wherein we differ, we beg to be understood with all tenderness toward your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; to whom, as a stranger to our late Oppressions and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, the state of our Affairs, and Affections, may probably be misrepresented.</p>
                  <p>To observe your own Method; our Letter to the <hi>Speaker, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the recalling of the Secluded Members</hi> was the <hi>occasion</hi> of <hi>Yours</hi> to <hi>Us,</hi> which sayes, that;
<q>Before these Wars our Government was Monarchical, both in Church, and State; but <hi>(as the case now stands)</hi> Monarchy cannot possibly be admitted for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97347:23"/>
in these Nations; because it is incompatible with the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Interests which have ensued upon the Quarrel: <hi>viz.</hi> the Presbyterian, Independent, Anabaptists, &amp;c. (as to Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks) and the Purchasers of Crown, and Bishops Lands, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited Estates, &amp;c. (as to Civils) by which means, the support it self is taken away; so that the Constitution, qualified to fix all Interests, must be that of a Republique: To which, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Members of <hi>1648.</hi> will never agree, many of them being Assertours of Monarchy, and Disclaimers to all Lawes made since their Seclusion: Over and above, that the Army al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so will never endure it. The Conclusion, This; that it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us to desist from that Paper, and rely upon the Promises of this Parliament, for a due Representative: — a Provision for succeeding Parliaments, and a Peaceable Settlement; than by an unseasonable Impatience to embroil the Nation in a fresh Engagement.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence it appears, that we might be allowed a Free Parliament, but for Four Reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>The Major Part Inclines to Monarchy, and they that have swallowed the Revenues of the Crown, declare against it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Entangled Interests of this Nation can never be United, but under a Republique.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Army will never endure it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>It would beget a new War,</hi> whereas <hi>this Parliament promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to settle us in a lasting Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To all which, in Order, and <hi>First,</hi> concerning <hi>Monarchy</hi>; (not as the thing which we contend for) we (onely) wonder why it is <hi>Prejudged,</hi> and particularly, by <hi>those</hi> Persons who have <hi>sworn</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> it. But, my Lord, you have hit the Reason; they have <hi>Gained</hi> by <hi>Dissolving</hi> it, and they are afraid to <hi>Lose</hi> by <hi>Restoring</hi> it. Having put the <hi>Father</hi> to <hi>Death,</hi> whom they <hi>Covenanted</hi> to <hi>Preserve</hi>; they <hi>Abjure</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> whom they Fear to <hi>Trust.</hi> By <hi>Force</hi> they would <hi>Maintain,</hi> what by <hi>Force</hi> they have <hi>Gotten.</hi> In effect, the <hi>Question,</hi> is not so much, what <hi>Government,</hi> as what <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi>:

                  </p>
                  <p>Whether we <hi>have</hi> Reason, or <hi>not, in this Particular,</hi> let your Excellency Judge.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Objection against a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> is drawn from the <hi>Necessity</hi> of a <hi>Republique, to reconcile all Interests.</hi> To This, we offer, <hi>First,</hi> that it is not <hi>Necessary</hi>; next, that it is not so much as <hi>Effectual,</hi> to that purpose; and <hi>Lastly,</hi> that a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> ought to <hi>Introduce</hi> it, if it were both the <hi>One</hi> and the <hi>Other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>First</hi> we prove thus, <hi>It is not the Form of Government, but the Consent of the People, that must Settle the Nation: The Publike Debt, must be secured out of the Publique Stock: and That disposed of by an Engagement of the Publique Faith, to such Ends, and purposes, as the Representative of the Nation shall deem expedient for the Good of it.</hi> In like manner may all other Interests be secured; whether of <hi>Opinion,</hi> or <hi>Property,</hi> under what Form of Government soever a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> shall think fit to unite us. That it is not <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,</hi> enough is said. We are now to deduce from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Text, that a <hi>Free-State</hi> would be as little <hi>effectuall</hi> also, as to our concerns. You are pleased to intimate the <hi>Dangerous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the People to Monarchy</hi>: and to Ballance the <hi>Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the <hi>Right,</hi> and the <hi>Universall Vote</hi> of <hi>the Nation,</hi> with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests</hi>

of some <hi>Few</hi> persons, <hi>that would Rule us</hi> Themselves, (for that's the English of the Settlement they propose.) By this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, a <hi>Republique, excludes the Negative,</hi> and more <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Interest,</hi> in <hi>favour</hi> of a <hi>Small,</hi> and a <hi>Partial</hi> one: and if it be granted, that a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> will never agree upon a <hi>Free State,</hi> it follows necessa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ily, that <hi>That Form will never doe</hi> our Businesse. <hi>Lastly,</hi> what Government soever is <hi>forced</hi> upon us, must certainly <hi>expire</hi> with the <hi>Force</hi> that imposes it; and the <hi>Voice of the People</hi> (in this case) <hi>is the Declaratory Voice of Providence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third Difficulty is. <hi>The Army will never endure it.</hi> This is to say, <hi>You are to be Govern'd by the Sword.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To <hi>Conclude</hi>; The <hi>Fear of a New War,</hi> and <hi>the Promise of a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Composure,</hi> are the <hi>last</hi> Suggestions of <hi>Disswasion</hi> to us.</p>
                  <p>Alas, my Lord, doe we not see that <hi>Parties</hi> are uniting against us, <hi>Abroad,</hi> and we conspiring against our <hi>selves</hi> at <hi>Home?</hi> How <hi>certainly</hi> shall we be <hi>Attempted,</hi> and how <hi>easily Overcome</hi>; without such a <hi>Medium</hi> to <hi>Reconcile</hi> us All, as may <hi>Please</hi> us All! <hi>but we are promised fair.</hi> We beseech you Lordship to consider the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misers.</hi> Are not <hi>These</hi> the People that <hi>vow'd</hi> to make our <hi>Last, a Glorious King?</hi> Just such a <hi>Glorious Nation</hi> will they make of <hi>Us.</hi> Did they not next <hi>Abjure</hi> a <hi>Single Person</hi>; and yet after that, <hi>set up ANOTHER,</hi> with <hi>Another Oath?</hi> Not to pursue this Subject further: <hi>These</hi> Men we dare not Trust, nor <hi>any other of that Leaven</hi>; we have have no thoughts but of Justice to all Interests; and in order to that Settlement and Good we wish the Nation, we shall empower our Representatives with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of all we are worth, and most remarkably evidence our selves, My Lord,</p>

               <p>This is not, to lessen the esteem of Holy Orders; neither to fix a rash, irreverend Censure upon the Ministry: No Man reveres the Character of a Church-man more than my self. But 'tis to shew the World, how much our <hi>Pamphlet-Merchand</hi> is steer'd, by Interest, and Passion, and how little, by Reason, and Truth.</p>
               <p>The grinning Whelp, now, betwixt snarling, and fawning, would fain perswade the General, and his Officers, and all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side] that the Resolve of Non-Addresses, by the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, was introductive to the <hi>MURTHER</hi> of the King. <hi>Murther,</hi> I say, that's the Plain English of what he stiles —<hi>A MOST NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE ACT OF IUSTICE</hi>; His Method lyes through direct Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions to the Universal Rules, of Logique, Truth and Honesty.</p>
               <p>By this Insinuation, he charges that Exorbitance upon the two Houses, and drawes an inference, from the Impardonable Quality of that Action, to the Necessity and Reason of pursuing it. This, he pretends to make appear, in <hi>spight of Ignorance, and Envy, from the Commons Declaration, in persuance of the resolve of Both Houses, conteyning the Reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I shall observe in order, and First, I'll prove that the vote of Non-Address, was not properly an Act of the two Houses; or if it were so, that it did not rationally direct to the Kings Life.</p>
               <p>Secondly. That Declaration of the Commons, (SINGLY) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the Reasons of the resolve of Both Houses (Joyntly) does not amount eitheir to a justification, or intention of taking the Kings life,—No not though I should grant the Members Free, — which <hi>I</hi> cannot; and the Authority Full: which I do not.—To the First.—</p>
               <p>They were under a Force.— Upon a Debate in the Commons House, concerning the Answer to the 4. Bills, presented to him <hi>Dec.</hi> 24. 1647. and debated, <hi>Ian.</hi> 3. Commissary <hi>Ireton</hi> deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself after this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King hath denied safety, and protection to his People by denying the</hi> 4. <hi>Bills, that subjection to him, was but in lieu of his protection to his People; this being denyed, they might well deny any more subjection to him, and settle the Kingdom without him: That it was now expected, after so long patience, they should shew their Resolution, and not desert those valiant men who had engaged for them, beyond all possibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and would never forsake the Parliament, unless the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forsook them first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence naturally results the menace of the Army, in case the Parliament should forsake them; and <hi>Ireton</hi> understood the Souldjery too well to mistake them.—</p>
               <p>As yet; here's nothing Capital pretended against the King.</p>
               <p>After some more debate <hi>CROMWELL</hi> urged,—<hi>that it was now expected, the Parliament should govern and defend the Kingdom, by their Own Power and Resolutions; and not teach the People any longer, to expect safety and Government from an Obstinate man, whose heart God had hardened: That those men, who had defended the Parliament, from so many dangers, with the expence of their Blood; would defend
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:97347:56"/>
them herein with Fidelity, and Courage, against all Opposition. Teach them not by neglecting your Own, and the Kingdomes safety, in which their own is involved, to think themselves betrayed, and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This Speech, concluded the debate; and the better to Impress his meaning, he laid his hand upon his sword, at the end of it. If this be not a Force, what is? The Power and Inclination of the Army, being the only moving Arguments to obtain the Vote. The Question was then put, and Carried for <hi>no more Addresses.</hi>— But no pretence still that extends to Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> shall appeal now to the Declaration it self; to which our Regicidall Babler refers the world for satisfaction.</p>
               <p>First, the Sectarians had stoln a Vote, <hi>Ian.</hi> 4. to Engarrison Whitehall, and the Mews: (the Lords not mentioned in the case) their manner of obtaining it, was this. 'Twas Noon, and the Independent party called to Rise. The Presbyterians went their wayes to Dinner: the Independents staid and did their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</p>

                  </gap>ngaging to defend them with their Lives, &amp;c.— Is this a Force yet?</p>
               <p>Soon after this; comes forth a Declaration, and Reasons, &amp;c. Drawn by a Committee appointed, by the Independents, &amp;c. So that even That too, was a piece, Contrived by the Designers of our Mischief, and by a Force, Extorted from the Sober rest, that would have saved us. This appears, from the interpose of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97347:56"/>
Presbyterians, to moderate the Eagerness of it, upon the debate. The last 4. lines of the said Declaration will be sufficient to stop the mouth of any Reasonable person, as to the point of life; (even without the Violence; which undenyably produced the rest.)

               <p>Lastly, We may publish the Declaration, of the Reasons, for no further Addresses: and try, it that way, we can either make a Party among themselves, or with the People. We may so bring it in, it shall be dangerous to reply upon, for fear of disobliging, and as unsafe to let alone, for fear of seducing.

                  <hi>That nothing may be omitted on my part, I must here take notice of the Bill for pressing of Souldiers, now depending among you my Lords, concerning which I here declare, that in case it come so to me, as it may not infringe or diminish my Prerogative, I will pass it.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay</hi> moved that <hi>Smalling</hi> be sent for, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon Oath by the COMMITTEE that penned the said De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration; but upon motion of the Presbyterians he was ordered to be examined at the COMMONS-BAR. <hi>Smalling</hi> came, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Warrant, but no notes, so this Chimera vanished.</p>

               <p>Now if you please go on.</p>
               <q>AS for our parts, we very well recount the Series of past transactions, and do remember that in <hi>February 1647.</hi> when the two Houses of Parliament passed their Resolves of making no further Address, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to lay him wholly aside, they never were in a greater state of security and freedom, never passed any thing with greater deliberation; and never the least disturbance or alteration arose in either of the Houses against those Resolves, untill some Persons in the Commons House other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise affected, and who by procuring Elections of Persons fit for their turn to serve in Parliament in vacant places, brought in new men of the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>amp (as is known) like themselves; and thereby out-balancing the old Patriots, gained the Major Vote of the House; and so with heat, and by design; obtained a revoking of those resolves which had been passed by both Houses in a time of temper, upon most serious Consideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that though we shall not take upon us <hi>ex absoluto</hi> to justifie the interposure of the Souldiery afterwards, and their Exclusion of the Adverse Members, (it being a transcendent Act, not to be measured by ordinary Rule, and which nothing can justifie but Supreme necessity) yet This we can truly say in their defence: In Iudgment and Conscience there was so indispensable a necessity, that had they not interposed, those Principles and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of the Common-wealth, upon which the aforesaid Resolves of both Houses were founded, had been utterly shipwrackt, and the whole Cause and its Defenders most inevitably have sunk together, seeing the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97347:61"/>
same heady confidence in treaty was then given to the Father, which too many now encline to allow unto the Son, who were first engaged against them in the War, and held out to the time of the last treaty: whom (of all other Men) his party do hate upon that accompt; and, if they had an opportunity, would be sure to make them fall the severest Sacrifices to the Revenge and Memory of his Father.</q>
               <p>THis is already Sifted, and a little Picking will serve the Turn here. A Cavalier, I find, is onely an Honest man that crosses a Fantan; but the <hi>Old Patriots</hi> it seems, were the <hi>Minor part</hi> of the <hi>House</hi>; and That's enough to entitle the Nation to the Ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fit of the Treaty resolved upon. For Sir (if you'l give us leave) we'l be governed by the <hi>Major</hi> part. It's true, your <hi>Supreme neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> is a pretty popular Sophism. But,</p>
               <p>As necessity ha's no Law, so is it none; nor in any case pleada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble against Law, but by the Judges of the Law, which at all hands, is confessed to be the Parliament, and the Major part of the Two Houses in conjunction with the King have ever denominated That.</p>
               <p>I must needs take a little pains to correct the Gentleman, in his next Fleere upon the Presbyterians. He hangs like a Cock-sparrow upon <hi>the aforesaid Resolves of both Houses</hi> (which is but an old Trick of laying a Knaves Bastard at an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest mans door) and then he preaches most <hi>Infallible Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to the <hi>first engagers, whom</hi> the <hi>King will be sure to sacrifice to the Revenge and memory of his Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This opinion or rather suggestion of his, opposes all Principles of Honesty, Generosity, and prudence, which fall within the latitude of the case. Nay, Taking for granted, the very entrance upon the War Justifiable.</p>
               <p>There might be then a Question, Now there's none, They intended only a Reformation, here's a Dissolution.

These goodly pieces are Christen'd, PLAIN ENGLISH, — and AN ALARUM. I suppose they are Twins, the Issue of the same Brain, as they are related to the same main End. I had nigh finish'd a Reply upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>inde they correspond so aptly, and so universally, to the same seditious Purpose, that there's not any Interest 'scapes their Malice and Attempt. They advance their Dispute, and March, together; that what they cannot gain by force of Argument, they may be ready to Essay by dint of Sword. PLAIN EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GLISH is a reasoning of the case: first with the General, claiming, from his Engaging for the Publick Liberty, a title to his aid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in favor of a private and enslaving Faction. It labours then, to puzzle the Presbyterian into a jealousie of the Kings faith and honour, and consequently into a doubt of his own safety, should His Majesty be restored: Nay, not content to blaspheme the Kings Integrity by a bold censure of his secret thoughts; the shameless Beast (the Author of it) proceeds to charge the secluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with the guilt of the Kings bloud, upon a senceless inference drawn from <hi>the Declaration of both Houses</hi> in 1647, touching the <hi>Reasons</hi> of the <hi>Votes for non-Address.</hi> His aim is here, to perswade them to accuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>How those Votes were obtained, I have shewed at large, (in answer to PLAIN ENGLISH) and it suffices: the whole Nation knows, that though the Plague was in both Houses then, yet All were not infected; the Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers only had the Tokens, (nor all these neither:) so that at last, the seclusion of so many as opposed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital prosecution of the King, amounts to a clear Act of discrimination; a <hi>separation</hi> of the <hi>clean</hi> from the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</hi>

                     <p>To disabuse the multitude, (if any should be mad enough to be deluded by so gross a cheat) I'll lay the juggle open, in as few and familiar words as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssible.</p>

                     <p>His second page places the Legislative power in the Army, challenging their promise; <hi>That before they would SVFFER themselves to be disbanded, or divided, they would see the Government of these Nations establisht upon the just and secure fundamentals, and constitutions of Freedome and Safety to the People, in relation as Men, and Christians, and that in the way of a Common-wealth, or Free-state-Government, without a King, single Person, or House of Lords.</hi>

                     <p>The General's Commission expired upon the Tenth of <hi>February,</hi> so he was free the Eleventh.

Nay, suppose their Arguments were more rational than they are, and that the King were a Person as famous for Cruelty, as he is for Clemency, you were still safe. You are below the stroke of Revenge.

Nay, look into their Morals, even toward those, that with the loss of Bloud and Peace, have rais'd them: how Thanklesse and how A varicious are they? Examine now their Principles of Courage, and their Military Vertues: do they not sneak into Committees, and there dispose of all the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of your Unchristian Hazzards? <hi>YOV kill the</hi> HEIR, but <hi>THEY divide the</hi> INHERITANCE.</p>
                     <p>Having abundantly perplex'd the mindes of his weak Brethren, he's as intent, now, how to entangle the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests</hi> of the Nation. The man is willing to do any thing that may help on the work of undoing All; and here he's ballancing Accompts: — casting up how many millions will pay the Court-debts, and repair the Losses of His Majesties Friends. For that I think the next Parliament may as well compose the Difference, as either he or I: this only I may say, 'tis not the care of the Publick which imploys him so much. <hi>His sins are greater than he can bear.</hi>

                     <p>All this is nothing, compar'd with what he has yet to tel you. Observe him well, and ask him, how he looks when he lies? <hi>Vpon his knowledge, the Militiaes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved

to cut the Soldiers throats in their beds.</hi> Why does he not discover who they are? Still the bloudy 11th. and 21th. of <hi>Febr.</hi> runs in his Head; <hi>The Villanies of that night,</hi> how hardly does he digest them! and then <hi>the Catalogue of Saints (the Holy-ones of the Rump)</hi> that nettles the Bum terribly. That <hi>marks</hi> them out for a <hi>Massacre,</hi> he sayes. The Worthies have behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves well the mean while, that call themselves the People. Why, at the worst, if the People have a minde to destroy themselves, they cannot begin better than at the Breech; that's a good way from the Heart.</p>
                     <p>The Story of your <hi>Governor</hi> is every bodies tale. I'll only take the Applicable part; <hi>We love the</hi> TREASON, <hi>but we hate the</hi> TRAYTOR. 'Twas you Betray'd your Countrey's trust to the Army. They love the Treason, but they hate the Traytor. ('Tis as fit as if it had been made for you.)</p>
                     <p>Now your <hi>Advice,</hi> which is scarce worth a Fee; for —you propose things Impossible: <hi>Rendezvous first,</hi> you say: why you Phansie, sure, that the General is of the Plot; and that his Officers are all mad; and then you propose a Confederacy, as 'twas at NEW-MARKET: your little Agitators, &amp;c. — Fie, Fie! Gentlemen, here's the difference of the Case; the Nation then was with the revolted Party against the Great ones: Now, they're Unanimously against you, in any such Design. Your General is a Gentleman and a Soldier; and every Man that is either, (in the Kingdom) will die at's Feet: His Officers are Persons that understand Honour, and the Discipline of War. There's not a man among them, but when he comes to passe a Sober Thought upon so base an action as a Mutiny, would rather Perish than promote it.</p>

Could I believe, the Conscience of that Traytor that advises you to this, would let him Sleep, I should believe his Councel but a Dream, 'tis so remote from any due Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of right Reason. Come, shall I Counsel you a little? Be obedient to your Superiors; Compassionate to your Countrey; Just to your Equals: <hi>In fine,</hi> serve God, and honour those whom he hath set over you for your Good.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not the Fool's Reviling of his Betters, that mends your Cause, or makes ours worse. <hi>There are</hi> (as he sayes) <hi>Ropes twisting,</hi> I believ't, but they are for such Imps as himself. He tels you, <hi>Gallows are setting up for the executions of your friends</hi>; (and he accounts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self one of your friends) who knows what may come on't?

Hereupon the General placed four Companies of his own Regiment in the Tower; and the Council of State issued forth a Proclamation against <hi>Lambert</hi> and his Complices, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring all persons whatsoever to be assistant to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of them. The Citizens repair'd their <hi>Posts</hi> and <hi>Chains,</hi> strengthened their Guards; and (in short) the whole Nation was as vigilant as possible to disappoint the Grand Conspiracy of the Phanaticks. About this time they made several Attempts in order to a general rising; but by the care and Conduct of the <hi>Council,</hi> the General, and the Militia, all came to nothing; the heart of the Design was almost broken: and yet they would not leave their Pamphleting.
