            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

C. as I haue heard alleged &amp; put for the to vnhable that enterprise of peopling &amp; replenishing with the Englishe Nation the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whiche with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> one of her Maiesties Counsell, Mayster <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> his Sonne hath vndertook to bring to passe, maketh m√©e that I can not holde from you my so singuler fr√©ende those ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments wherewith through conference had with him vpon his sayde attempt by reason of our greate familiaritie h√©e hath fully persuaded and satisfied m√©e. Ch√©efly bycause I woulde confirme you in that whiche he hathe a little broke vnto you, and partly bicause I would not haue you wauer in your promise, thorow the vaine allegations of some, which eyther are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant altogither of his purpose or whose vnderstanding can not stretche to a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of so greate aduice, or of suche who are of base and cowardly courages in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of matters of great importance: or els of enuious disposition, partely also

bicause I would not haue his moste com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable enterprise in his absence defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for the greate affection I beare him, whom I know most sufficient to answer euery point, article, and obiection, can b√©e layd ageinst him in this behalf, although I haue nothing but that whiche through muche conference I haue drawen from him.</p>
            <p>And firste by the way holde this for a <hi>maxime,</hi> that there hath bene at no time any notable attempt taken in hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enuy, doubt, and defaring. The reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> is, that bicause they are actions appertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the increase or furtheraunce of a whole gouernement, they are also muche noted, wherein euery man will haue his verdit. Some as is aforesayd not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing halfe, wil answere at the first as they are affectionate to the partie or countrie. Others that haue bet their braines a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to vnderstand y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> whiche their conceit wil not stretche vnto, take it vnpossible.

they conceiue the likelyhode, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mend the thing, yet they neuer are inwardlye resolued of their doubtes superstitiously afrayd to enter into any vnvsual dooings, but the last gr√©eued to s√©e honest woorkes attempted, &amp; likely to be brought to passe (while they line idle) to hide their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygence, enuiouflye slaunder and deface all good purposes. Suche is the nature of man, but I wil now to the matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ireland</hi> is a large Cuntrie, commended wonderfully for the fertilenesse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious site therof, wherin the Kings of England haue had footing and continuall gouenement these foure hundred y√©eres and more But so as the barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at no time fully subdued, through their often rebellion, haue bene rather an anoy and charge to this Kealme of England, than otherwise, whiche some men haue imputed to the impossibilitie therof, or to the euil gouernment of Deputies, which eyther haue bene neglygent or corrupt. But Maister <hi>Smith</hi> to see and knowe the truthe, trauayled thither in the companie of Sir <hi>V Villiam Fitzwilliams</hi> now Lord Justice there, minding after serche <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of made (for now beganne the desire of this
<pb facs="tcp:477:4"/>
attempt to root in his hart) to declare his opinion, if h√©e thought it myght be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and hath founde that the decay of the gouernment there hath not chaunced bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the planting at the firste of the Englishe Nation (so muche as it was) was not for the time substancially done, nor by the negligence and corruptnesse of the gouernours there, wherof within our remembraunce hath bene a successiue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of noble, iust, wise, and sufficient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. But hathe growne by the necessitie whiche hath constrayned the gouernours to giue protections &amp; pardons vnto moste heynous rebels and outlawes, after they haue spoyled, murthred, &amp; made hauocke of the good Subiects, for lack of sufficient forces where with to attache and execute the sayde malefactours, by reason of the spare supplye at all times made to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> by the Prince, who at the firste inhabyting thereof mynding more the kyngdome of <hi>Fraunce</hi> and thinking all to little for that purposed Conquest, neglected <hi>Ireland</hi> as a matter of smal importance, then worst looked to, when England it selfe was a prise or rewarde to them that best could besturre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>selues of the houses of <hi>Yorke</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:477:4"/>
and <hi>Lancaster.</hi> And if you wil marke the Stories, you shal finde great reasons that haue moued the Prince too h√©e spare of charges in that cuntrie, and a consequence of decay in that gouernment.</p>
            <p>About the time of the first entrie of the Englishe in <hi>Ireland</hi> made that they bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to settle, arose y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> Barons warres in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that weakened and decayed all at home. <hi>Fraunce</hi> was chargeable too b√©e mainteyned with many garrisos, a great waster bothe of men &amp; money, yet a thing whereto the Princes were more bent tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to <hi>Ireland:</hi> so that we may easly perceiue and iudge, that the Jrishe whiche yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned vnsubdued, taking aduantage of the time, whiles the ch√©ef that had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie there, were called ouer to vpholde their factions here, possessed againe their land, and expelled the new inhabitants: found without hed and scarce yet wel set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, whiche could not be recouered againe so soone, bicause suche as were come ouer after they had wasted themselues in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile warres, and had in the meane time lost their landes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> lost also their credite with such as at the first aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnder them, by reason they had forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:477:5"/>
and lefte them open to the spoile, nor the Princes being eaten out also with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile discord &amp; with the charges of <hi>France,</hi> vnto which they were more addicted, had the treasure to spare for the reformation therof. Only king <hi>Ruhard</hi> the second in hys owne person attemptyng the same, was ouertaken with Eiuile discension &amp; deposed, whiche hath euer since discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Successours personally to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pt the like. Thus home warres still increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, with the Armies in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> (a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring graue of this Nation) and lastly the losse therof, so weakned and impoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risshed the Crown of England, that both people and money wanted therein, much good land lying waste for lacke of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunts, that it was more time to recouer by rest that which was wanting at home than to send abrode that could not be spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And the Princes contented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>selues if they myght onely preserue a footyng or entrye into <hi>Ireland</hi> wyth some small charge, wherby the gouernours were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streyned for wante of supply by protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and pardons to appease euery rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, which otherwise to represse and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish they were not sufficiently furnished.
<pb facs="tcp:477:5"/>
This perceiued of the Irishe, made them that vppon euery light occasion they will flie out, and satisfied with bloud and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, will not without protection &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don be brought in. The Englishe race o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerrumie and daily spoiled, seeing no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of maletactors did buy their owne peace, alied and fostred themselues with the Irishe, and the race so nourished in the bosonie of the Irishe, perceiuing their immunitie from lawe and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente degenerated: choosing rather to maintain themselues in the Irish mans beastly libertie, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to submit themselues and to liue there alone, and not the Irish in the godly awe of the lawes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. This degenerating and daily decay of the English manners by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the countrey, discorageth those that haue not perfectly wayed all that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, to attempt any new enterprise. The Prince seeing no manne forwarde therin, is weryed with the continuaunce of the yerely great charge which hir ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie liberall aboue hir predecessoures hath borne more willingly, and to this, the first entring of the English, their first inhabiting, the order and manner therof,
<pb facs="tcp:477:6"/>
is almost worne out of memorie and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, their decay and wasting daily to be seene.</p>
            <p>All these things when my frend being then in Ireland, had informed him selfe of, by diligent inquifition, he fell to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what way were fittest for oure time to reforme the same, and if it were refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, I meane the whole countrey reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Englishe men, what profite that coulde be to the estate of Englande, hath sithens his returne tolde me diuers times, that he thought Irelande once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited with Englishe men, and polliced with Englishe lawes, would be as great commoditie to the Prince as the realme of England, the yerely rent and charges saued that is now laide out to maintaine a garrison therein, for there cannot be (sayeth he) a more fertile soile thorowe out the world for that climate than it is, a more pleasant, healthful, ful of springs, riuers, great fresh lakes, fishe, and foule, and of moste commodious herbers. Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land giueth nothing saue fine woolle, that will not be had also moste abundantly there, it lacketh only inhabitants, manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and pollicie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:477:6"/>As for the meanes how to subdue and replenishe the same (sayth he) they were easie to be deuised, if the Qu√©enes maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie wold once take it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> hir, with army maintained at hir charges: but sith hir highnesse is not bent thereto, what other meanes is to be folowed, he hath h√©ereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his first offer to the Qu√©enes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Counsell declared: which is that which he nowe foloweth, and so many that haue not in them selues the will or grace to do so well, do impugne, which I wil h√©ere defende and persuade you in as a thing moste reasonable, faisable, and commendable.</p>
            <p>He hathe taken in hande withoute hir Maiesties pay to win and replenish with Englishe inhabitantes the countrey cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Ardes</hi> in the Northe of Irelande, and some partes thereto adioyning: <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What (say they) it is not possible to win or inhabite any parte of Irelande, without the Qu√©enes pay, hir forces and expences. And yet the first entry with the Englishe men made into Irelande, was in <hi>Henrie</hi> the secondes time, with his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, by <hi>Strangbovve</hi> Earle of <hi>Chepstow</hi> at his owne charges, and the charges of his adherentes, at what time the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was replenished with inhabitants, &amp; deuided only into fiue kingdomes: who with a smal number entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, &amp; subdued y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> which is nowe called <hi>Lemster,</hi> which he possessed and held qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, plantyng it with Englyshe inhaby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and placing Englishe Lawes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the King enuying his proc√©edings, and fearing to haue so great a Subiect, enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to surrender his right, whiche h√©e did. And this was the first foting of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe men in that Land, not by the Kings power, without which as I haue sayd, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers hold an opinion, no good can be ther done.

            <p>Let thus many exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ples suffize to shew that the enterpryse is possyble, and hath often bene done. If they wil not, yet let reason serue, that if a hundred or two of footmen, and fiftie or a hundred Horse ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Qu√©enes pay to mainteine, can keepe and defend the <hi>Arde,</hi> then so many horsemen and footmen aswel payed and mainteyned, can also and as sufficientlye

            <p>Wel (wil you say) I graunt that thr√©e hundred are sufficient to defend the <hi>Arde.</hi> But when euery man is retired, to dwel vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> his own, then wil the enemy (which wayteth hys tyme on euery side) in the winter nights, spoyle this time one, &amp; the next time another, so that you shal neuer haue rest nor profite of the soyle, nor liue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out feare, as it happeneth many times vppon the frontier of the Englyshe pale, for all the Qu√©enes Maiesties garryson. To this as n√©ere as I can, I wil repeate his words, who at the time I alledged it to him smiled and sayed, I haue not yet forgotte all mine Accidence by this text. <hi>Foelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> which was wont to make m√©e take h√©ede, to doo that in schoole, for whiche I saw another beaten, I stand as it were in a thr√©e want way, wherof one parte lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth right, and I haue s√©ene two take se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall

            <p>Moste of those that haue taken in hand before this, to winne and inhabite in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> haue after the place once possessed, deuided themselues eche to dwell vppon his own land, &amp; to fortesie him selfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, trusting with his owne strength, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inuasion were made to preserue him selfe therein.

So they degenerated as is aforesayd, and in time all was frustrate. Yet the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of <hi>Ophally</hi> vsing that order, lyeth at this day so safe, that they put for the their

            <p>Others whom the Qu√©enes forces doo defende, when the enemies growe strong vpon them and begin to spoyle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, haue of the garriso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> sent vown to defend them, so flyeth the enemie to trouble an other quarter, or els for beares for the time, till the garrison b√©e called away to a place of more need, or that the husbandmen eaten out with cesse, when he is wery, by peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath obteyned too b√©e cased of them, who be no sooner gone, but the enemie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to wast him ageine.

            <p>The thirde way is that w√©e must take, firste to chuse a place so n√©ere as w√©e can that is naturallye strong, When after it is wonne not too suffer the Souldiour too be dispersed, wel to let the owner repaire to his portion, but so as a souldiour in his st√©ede be alwayes on the frontier, least of all to truste to be dayly defended by the

            <p>The <hi>Arde</hi> which is my demaund, and the n√©erest parte of all <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shere,</hi> and the Caste parte of England, I take to be a p√©ece of ground as easie to be wonne, inhabited, safely kepte and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as any platte within the Kealme of <hi>Ireland,</hi> being a reache of land (as it were of purpose bayed out from the mayne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, to wall in so muche of it as woulde make so faire and commodious a lake and herber as the hauen of <hi>Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> is) fasshioned like an Arme bente in the Elbowe, annexed no where to the mayne but at the one ende as the Arme to the shoulder. The bredth of whiche en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie is aboute fiue Miles, as by the platte h√©ere vnto annexed may be more plainlye seene. That straight once kept and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, all the reste of the Countrie muste of necessitie become quiet and safe, and thus shall it be defended.</p>
            <p>Upon the sayed entrie shall be raysed strengths where all the souldiors which
<pb facs="tcp:477:10"/>
are mainteyned by the Cuntrie, shall lie in garrison for diuers good consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s, keping there continuall scoute watche, &amp; warde so narowly, that one single person vndiscried shal not be able to enter or fl√©e out of the Countrie. By this meanes the Cuntrie is not onely safely preserued, the border aswel as the middest, but the Irish wil alway k√©epe them selues aloose, for feare of Scarbrough warning, if they should harbour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>selues any thing n√©ere a garrison that lyeth ready to take euery aduauntage vpon them. And to the ende the Souldiours should be the more bigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, I am minded to lay all the very fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Lande denided by proportion, to the strengths where the garrisons lie, so that euery Souldiour shal put in his share to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the sowing and manuring therof, and receiue his parte of the Corne and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profite that is too b√©e gathered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whiche shall come to him besides his maintenance from the Cuntrie. This for his owne gaine sake which lyeth in most daunger of all, will make him haue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eye to his charge, and be the more iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the enemie,</p>
            <p>As for hauyng the Qu√©enes ayde and
<pb facs="tcp:477:11"/>
garrison, I haue good hope it shal not n√©ed for sith y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> euery Souldiour is made May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and owner of his land, to him and to his heires for euer, will he not think you looke as well and as carefully to that, as hee would if h√©e had sixe pence sterling a day of the Qu√©enes Maiestie, whereof he should be sure not past for a yeer or there about, and then to go whither he would. Now if he keepe and desende this, h√©e is a Gentleman, a man of liuelyhode &amp; of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritaunce, and who hath and shall haue, his ground ploughed and eared for him without his paines, for that we haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for, if hee lose it, he loseth his owne inheritaunce, and hindreth his posteritie. And if by his owne charges and costes he doo obteine it, and bring it to ciuilitie and good obedience to his Prince, how muche more <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>auour, grace, and renown dooth h√©e delerue at hir Maiesties hand, &amp; as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her highnes charge, this he shal do, so as reason is, he hath it the better cheape, the larger estate in it, and the lesse incu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered.</p>
            <p>What difference I pray you is there in the end betw√©ene the charges without the Queenes ayde, to go to win the sayde
<pb facs="tcp:477:11"/>
Countrey, and inhabite it, or else to goe dwell, being sette in by the Prince, in a countrey which hir maiestie huth wonne and lefte vnto the inhabiters to defende, nothing but the charges of the first win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which is one yeares charge or two, for which charges to haue in recompence a larger estate, and to paie an easier rent, In faithe I iudge you nowe sufficiently informed, and that you do take this a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more reasonable, and surer way, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to couet h√©erein at the firste getting the Princes aide, which if you shal haue done it were reason we should both pay bigger rente, &amp; haue worse estates, as they haue alreadie in other places of Irelande, on that sorte lately wonne.</p>
            <p>Nowe you s√©e I haue not only answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you to your questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, and resolued you of your dout, but haue opened to you a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete of mine enterprise, which maketh many that know not so much, condemne me for taking it in hande.</p>
            <p>There resteth yet master <hi>Smith</hi> said I one poynt to be alleaged h√©erein which is this, that there are not many can beare this first charge, and be willing to doe it also. With that he paused a while, and
<pb facs="tcp:477:12"/>
there replied again as foloweth. If there be any thing that may hinder in dede this enterprise, or make it vaine, it is that, that you haue nowe spoken of, namely good councel slowly folowed: but you shal heare what likelihoodes and hope I haue to the contrarie.</p>
            <p>I am sure you are persuaded, that all enterprises are very much either furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or hindered by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> times in which they are taken in hand. For if <hi>Amintas,</hi> grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to the great <hi>Alexander,</hi> (the estate of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> being then small and weake) had taken in hande the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, he had neuer done it: nor <hi>Philip</hi> which prepared the <hi>Macedonians</hi> to such an enterprise, whome by sundry conquestes vppon his neighbors, he had fleshed to the warre, and by continual exercise had made them almost perfect souldiours, for now desired they nothing but worke, and the spoile of some riche kingdome. Which when <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> perceiued, he toke the aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the time, and had good successe: so you may s√©e the time and inclination of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> was in d√©ede of more effect to bring the enterprise to passe, than
<pb facs="tcp:477:12"/>
               <hi>Alexanders</hi> onely disposition coulde haue bene, who was but a yong man, and not much experienced at that time.</p>
            <p>More examples I will not vse, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto you that my greatest hope is in the time wherein I am, which I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on this sorte.</p>
            <p>England was neuer that can be heard of, fuller of people than it is at this day, and the dissolution of Abbayes hath done two things of importance heerin: It hath doubled the number of gentlemen and mariages, whereby commeth daily more increase of people: and suche yonger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as were wonte to be thruste into Abbayes, there to liue (an idle life) sith that is taken from them, must nowe s√©eke some other place to liue in. By thys meanes there are many lacke abode, and fewe dwellings emptie.</p>
            <p>With that our lawe which giueth all to the elder brother, furthereth much my purpose. And the excessiue expence bothe in diet and apparell, maketh that men which haue but small portions, can not maintaine them selues in the emulation of this world, with like countenance as the grounded riche can do: thus stand we
<pb facs="tcp:477:13"/>
at home.</p>
            <p>Then went I to examine the estate of Countreis abrode, and found, that all the Countreis adiacent round aboute, were as wel peopled or better than we be, or else more barren, so that except we might master and expel the inhabitants, it wold not auaile. But therfore, or for any other cause, to fall in variance with <hi>Fraunce</hi> or <hi>Spaine,</hi> were but as the rubbing of one boughe against an other with the winde, where bothe fret, neither increaseth. <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> besides that is barren, is ruled by a frend king, and peopled sufficiently. <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is the Qu√©enes inheritaunce, many countreis there, as that which I demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d, giuen to hir by acte of Parliament of the same realme, others hirs by dissents, the which lye almoste desolate: To inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite &amp; reforme so barbarous a nation as that is, and to bring them to the knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and lawe, were bothe a godly and commendable d√©ede, and a sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t worke for our age.</p>
            <p>All these things happening togither in my time, when I had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>sidered, I iudged surely, that God did make apte and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this nation for such a purpose. There
<pb facs="tcp:477:13"/>
resteth only to persuade the multitude al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie destined therto, with will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to take the matter in hande.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore vse the persuasions which <hi>Moses</hi> vsed to <hi>Israel,</hi> they will serue fitly in this place, &amp; tell them that they shall goe to possesse a lande that flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth with milke and hony, a fertile soile truly if there be any in <hi>Europe,</hi> whether it be manured to corne, or left to grasse, There is Timber, stone, plaister, &amp; state commodious for building euery where aboundant, a countrey full of springs, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and lakes bothe small and greate, full of excellent fishe and foule, no parte of the countrey distant aboue, viij. miles from a moste plentifull sea, or land wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to beare lode.</p>
            <p>You say wel, (sayd I then.) But men are more moued by peculiar gaine: than of respecte they haue to common profite. Mary answereth he: they shal haue their peculiar portions in that frutefull soile, being but as a vootie to be deuided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongs them.</p>
            <p>And this shall be the quantitie which a foote man shall haue, <hi>videlicet,</hi> a plowe lande, which containeth a C. and. xx. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres
<pb facs="tcp:477:14"/>
Jrishe, but you will vnderstande it better by English measure. A plowland shall containe. CC. &amp;. lv. acres of earable grounde. Then can there not lie in any country almost, (especially so full of bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes as that soile is) so muche earable lande together, but there will lie also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled therewith sloppes, slips, and bottomes fitte for pasture and meading, and commodious to be annexed to the same plowlande, so that the whole may amount to. CCC. acres at the leaste. I pray you tell me, if you had so much good grounde in Essex, would you not take it for a pretie farme, and yet a horsse man shall haue double, <hi>videlicet,</hi> sixe. C. Acres of ground one with an other at the least, wherof there is. v. CCCCCx. acres ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the rest medow &amp; pasture, I bel√©eue you would call that in Essex a good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and yet these are the least deuisions, I purpose to make, sauing a ploweland or two in euery parish that I thinke good to deuide to laborers and artificers, but I am not of the manner thereof yet fully resolued.</p>
            <p>This is good sayde I, if a man mighte haue it as easely rented. Judge you I
<pb facs="tcp:477:14"/>
pray you saith he. They shall pay for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Acre of eareable lande one penie star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as for the pasture and medowe, they shal haue it as reasonable as the eareable in some places better cheape, according to the goodnesse of the ground. But this is the greatest rent: I must haue vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry such plowland one able English foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or vppon his two plowlandes, one horsse man, maintained to be ready at all times for the defence of the whole cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>try, abiding eyther vpon the same plowland, or else vppon the frontier, which may be peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ture. x. or. xy. miles distant at the vttermosts, moste commonly nearer.</p>
            <p>I intend not that this lying in the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier shall be continuall, but one shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue an other by quarters, some in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, and some resting them selues at home in the Country, &amp; it may be, (which I hope in my time to s√©e) all Irelande re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and no neede of garrison in al the countrey, when y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> seruice shall cease also.</p>
            <p>This portion sayde I, that you speake of, me thinke if it be in f√©e, so easily rented should make your enterprise a fit matche for yonger brothers, such as haue but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities, stipendes, and deade stockes to
<pb facs="tcp:477:15"/>
liue on. For by this meanes should they be proutded of an house, and pretie lande belonging vnto it, sufficiente to yeelde wherewith to make a friend drinke, and many such farmes make a man rich. But I feare me it can be onely profitable to suche as dwell vppon the same, as it is in some places of England, where the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen haue vpon their wide Lordships, great prouision of corne and cattel, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in most of their rent is payde, but that is so cheape there, that a greate deale to be solde, yeldeth but a little money, wherby they may giue meat and drinke to a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but paye wages to a fewe, so that he that should not dwell there him selfe, after the souldioure were founde, and the rente paide, shoulde either haue little or nothing for his owne share: bisides if the owner him selfe be not there, to manure or to s√©e the same manured, howe shoulde he gather profite thereof? or who woulde farme it for him, or y√©elde him rente for his lande? This is a doubte in deede that wil make many stay I tel you, who wold otherwyse aduenture. Nay in good soothe is it not (sayd he) as you shall h√©ereafter perceiue.</p>
            <p>

be the first starued, not b√©eing Maister of his owne. From which exactions that he might be fr√©e, there is no part of the Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie but he would s√©eke to, and geue for Lande wonderfull rents, paying them in suche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>moditie as the ground will y√©eld, be it Corne, Butter, or Cattel. You may haue Farmers out of the Ile of <hi>Man,</hi> and other poore men out of England, so they may be ayded at the firste with some stock of Corne and Cattel. It is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care at the begynning after the lande is deuided, I for my part wil indeuer my self to persuade the one freendly to depart his commoditie with an other: but I feare the sw√©etnesse whiche the owners shall find in the Irish Churle, giuing excessiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wil hinder the Countrie muche in the peopling of it with the Englishe Nation, makyng men neglygent to prouide Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe Farmours, but thereof there is one <hi>prouiso</hi> in our instructions from her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Counsel.</p>
            <p>Now wil I tel you what rent the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may reap of his Land, <hi>videlicet,</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Corne, Butter, Parne, Cattel, &amp; such like, my counsell shalbe that euery man, sith their land is deliuered, suche as is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb facs="tcp:477:16"/>
should continue the same vnder til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and receiue his rent in Corn, which tilling of their Land that it be so done, is also prouided for in the sayd instructions, bicause it settleth the occupier, and what with tending his fallowe, reaptyde, s√©ede time, &amp; thrashing, it bindeth alwayes the occupier to the Lande, and is a continuall occupation of a great number of persons, a helper and a mainteyner of Ciuilitie in my opinion. As for the rent, I wuld haue one rate therof thorow all the Cuntry, of euery plowland a like. I think two pecks Irishe doo conteine foure Englishe Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shels, of an Irish Acre, which is two En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Acres and a half quarter, were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable betw√©ene the Lord and Tenant, so that the Tenant should pay onely that rente for the errable grounde, hauing the Medowe and Pasture into the bargaine for maintenaunce of his Teame. Of this rent by my counsell the one parte should beare Wheate, and the other parte Otes and Barly. By which meanes one plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande may y√©elde y√©erely to the owners thirtie quarters of Wheare, and asmuche Otes and Barlie, towards the finding of his Souldiour, and payment of his rent.
<pb facs="tcp:477:17"/>
As for the victualing of his sootman soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour, I parpose to vndertake for v. quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Wheat and fiue quarters of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, sufficiently to finde euery suche foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and for ten quarters of Wheat and ten of Barley &amp; Otes, to find euery horse man and his horse in continual garrison, for one whole yeere. The footemans wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and the rente wil be disdischarged for ten quarters more, the horsemans wages and rent for twentie. Peraduenture you wil say I allowe with the most, and that lesse will serue, yet hath the owner of one plowland forty quarters of Corne de cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro at the y√©ers end, and the owner of two plowland foure score.</p>
            <p>But what shal he do with that Corne, will you say, Mary sell it, for ordinaryly Corne beareth the same price there that it beareth in England, &amp; saue of very late yeeres, it hath bene accustomed too bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes d√©erer. And yet there is another way more aduantageous, than the sale of Corne in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that wil be acloyd ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, if at the beginning before our parte b√©e thorowly peopled, w√©e fall to turning all the Lande as afore is sayd to Tilling, not b√©eing able to spende it, therefore is it
<pb facs="tcp:477:17"/>
necessary, and I am fully persuaded, that the Qu√©enes Maiestie furthering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting &amp; ciuilitie of the North (whiche encreaseth more by k√©eping men occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Tyllage, than by idle followyng of heards, as the <hi>Tartarians, Arabians,</hi> and Irishe men doo) will giue ful libertie for the transportation of Corne out of y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> sayd Cuntries into <hi>England, Fraunce, Spaine</hi> or other place, whereas the Market shall serue best, and therupon will lay a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Custome. For this cause shal there be one Hauen with common Oranyers made vpon the Key, sufficient for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the Corne of the Cuntry, and one Porte Town builded, so soon as we may begin to be any thing settled. More of the order heerin I wil tell you another time, but comforte your selfe with this in the meane tyme, that Corne in <hi>Spaine</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes good marchandize, and bringeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ready money. The cut betw√©ene the Cuntries, short, streight, &amp; not fiue dayes iorney. How say you now, haue I not set forth to you another <hi>Eutopia?</hi> but I looked when you would bid me stay and declare first how to get it before al these be done<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sith you will not aske m√©e, of mine owne

proper motion I wil tel you.</p>
            <p>If these declarations of mine in so fit a time and Countrie, where God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the Nation to such enterprise, may allure any nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ber to take it in hand, were they but sixe or seauen hundred, which I take to be but a small number to be got in all this Realme. What should let that in a cuntrie almost desolate (except but of suche of y<hi rend="sup">‚Ä¢</hi> Englysh race as wil b√©e glad of this enterprize) w√©e might not inhabite &amp; dwel in safetie? It may be sayd that at the first, the Irishe wil assemble and put vs backe. Alas sixe thousande of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> dare not set vppon seauen hundred Englishe men, hauing the aduauntage of a trench, scarce in the plaines. But if w√©e will k√©epe our selues close for a while, they must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie for lacke of victuall disperse them selues, and giue vs libertie with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage ouer them to breake forth &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede with our enterprize, &amp; who is there now of the Lords in the North can make two thousand men. <hi>Onell</hi> though he ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with him all the Lords of the Easte side of <hi>Ulster,</hi> and the Scottes is not able to make three thousand fighting men. As for <hi>Odennel, Mon Guyer, O Rayly,</hi> &amp; the
<pb facs="tcp:477:18"/>
               <hi>Barons</hi> sonnes, whiche be the greatest of the North, I take it certein, that they wil not hazard their Cuntries with any new Rebellion, but had rather liue contented with peace, sauouring and finding ayd at the Englyshe mens handes, as they haue bene accustomed to do. And yet I hope wel of the rest, bicause I wil not (so neer as I can) doo them any iniury.</p>

            <p>Many say, that they shal go into a place where they shall want meate, housing, &amp; all things necessarye, for that no Prince yet hath bene able to victuall his Army ther, sufficiently in their iorneys, besides that the Souldiour is alwayes constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to march thorow the Bogges and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and in the nighte to lodge vppon the Grasse without meat and Fire.

            <p>Be of good courage therefore, &amp; resolue your selfe to be a partaker with him in person. The enterprise is commendable, and not only to the encrease of his nation and honor of his countrey, but very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to them that are doers therein, if it be brought to good passe, which is assured, if reason may serue, or the like at any time (as before hath often bene s√©ene) hath taken effecte, and the aduenture is small, not to the tenthe parte of the gaine. He is prouided alreadie I know, of singulare good Captaines, and the promisse of an hundred Gentlemen alredy at the leaste, hauing not yet opened the matter but to his frends. As for him selfe you shal finde him vigilant and carefull, coueting more the well dooing heereof, and the safetie of his companie, than the glory of victorie in any rash attempt, more desiring to please and profit euery man, than loking for ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious curtesie and reuerence.

I speake this by experience and long proofe that I haue had of him.</p>
            <p>Graunt it (wil you say) that h√©e for his part be suche an one, but all those whom he shall haue assembled out of euery part of this Realme, shall not b√©e of so good a Nature, as peraduenture hee is of, some be disdainful, proud, and insolent, some couetous, and other of quarellous disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a few of these are inough to disturbe the whole companie. Quarels beginne of small trifles, and by partes taking, come in the ende to greate matters. Besides in the particion, one wil be angry bicause he was not preferred to that commodyous seat or this good dwelling, and bicause hee hath not so muche Land as an other, but of this hope I also to satisfie you.
