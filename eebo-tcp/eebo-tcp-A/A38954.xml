            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CEREMONIES OF THE MARRIAGE OF THE KING of SPAIN, WITH Madamoiſelle, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O ſoon as the Peace between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> was ſign'd at <hi>Nimmenghen,</hi> and that the Ratifications were exchanged, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> applied himſelf to nothing with greater diligence and affection, than to a ſtrict confirmation of the ſame Peace by a new Alliance with the King of <hi>France;</hi> the features of <hi>Madamoiſelle,</hi> and the continual Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums of her Wit and pleaſing diſpoſition, made him take a reſolution to ſend an extraordinary Ambaſſador to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire her in Marriage.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe <hi>Don Paolo Spinola,</hi> Marqueſs <hi>de les Balbaſez,</hi> who had been chief in the Embaſſy of <hi>Spain,</hi> at <hi>Nimmenghen;</hi> being choſen, arrived at <hi>Paris</hi> the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1679, and in a particular audience which he had of the King at St. <hi>Germaine en Lay</hi> the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> demanded <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle</hi> in Marriage for the King his Maſter: To which the King made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the aſfair was of importance, and that he would conſider of it.</p>
            <p>The Embaſſador returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> and made his publick Entry the 11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June;</hi> and two days after had publick audience of the King at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines.</hi> At laſt upon the 12<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the King after he had diſcourſed the Queen, Monſieur, and <hi>Madamoiſelle,</hi> gave audience to the Embaſſador; and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52111:3"/>
at the ſame time told him, That moſt gladly he conſented to the demand of <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi> by the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de les Balbaſez</hi> immediately diſpatched a Courier to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> to give the King of <hi>Spain</hi> the knowledg of the News which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected with ſo much impatience.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> alſo ſent another Courier to the Duke <hi>D' Eſtrees</hi> his Ambaſſador at <hi>Rome,</hi> to demand of the Pope a Diſpenſation of the Lett of Conſanguinity; which demand was alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeconded by another Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier from the Marqueſs <hi>de les Balbaſez,</hi> to the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche,</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor at <hi>Rome</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Pope readily yielded to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; and becauſe it is the cuſtom to give theſe Diſpenſations to the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, they were therefore given into the hands of the Marqueſs <hi>de Liche,</hi> who ſent them to the Marqueſs of <hi>Balbaſez.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had intelligence, that the King of <hi>France</hi> had conſented to his demand of <hi>Madamoiſelle;</hi> and becauſe it was neceſſary that ſome perſon ſhould eſpouſe her in his behalf, he ſent a blank Procuration, deſiring the King of <hi>France</hi> to fill it up, as ſhould be moſt to his own liking. So ſoon as this News was made publick at <hi>Madrid,</hi> it cauſed a unanimous and univerſal rejoycing. The whole City ſeemed to be all in a flame for ſeveral days. The young Lords ſtrove to outvy each other in magnificence of Feſtivals; and the common people cry'd, That they had been always happy in Queens ſent them out of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while, the Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi> the Marſhal, Duke of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> the <hi>Sieur Colbert,</hi> Miniſter and Secretary of State, who had been nominated by the King to draw up the Articles of the Marriage, ſign'd them the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> together with the Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 20<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Balbaſez</hi> had publick audience of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and gave him the King his Maſters Procuration, and the Popes Diſpenſations. Immediately the King of <hi>France</hi> deputed the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> for the perſon that was to eſpouſe <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi> in behalf of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Some days before he had nominated the Prince and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> to attend the Queen as far as the <hi>Pyrenean-Hills,</hi> and had ordered the Marſhal of <hi>Clerembauts</hi> Lady to wait on her, as Maid of Honour, and the Daughter of the Marſhal <hi>de Grancy,</hi> as Madam <hi>Dreſſer,</hi> till ſhe came to the place who were to attend her upon the Frontiers, were ordered to ſtay.</p>
            <p>Some days after the King of <hi>France</hi> thought meet to appoint <hi>Fontain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau</hi> as the moſt proper place for the Grandeur of the enſuing Ceremonies; and therefore ordered that the Contract ſhould be there ſolemnized upon the laſt of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which purpoſe he departed from St. <hi>Germaines</hi> with the Queen, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> Madam, and <hi>Madamoiſelle,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Fontainbleau</hi> at ſix a Clock in the Evening.</p>
            <p>The 28<hi>th</hi> the <hi>Sieur Pompone,</hi> Miniſter and Secretary of State, to whom the King had given the Procuration of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Popes Diſpenſations, went to the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> to ſhew him the Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and afterwards carried the ſame with the Diſpenſations to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> who as Grand Almoner of <hi>France,</hi> was to perform the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of the Nuptials.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52111:3"/>
The 30<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Eve of the day aſſigned for the Ceremony of the Marriage was performed the Ceremony of the betrothment; In the Morning <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi> received the Communion, and at five in the Evening ſhe went to the Kings Apartment, where all the Princes of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily made their viſits to her. At ſix of the Clock the <hi>Sieur de Saintot,</hi> Maſter of the Ceremonies, came to give the Queen notice that the King was in his Apartment, and that it was then time for her to bring <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi> to him. Immediately the Queen of <hi>France</hi> began to ſet forward, led by the Knight <hi>de Vieville</hi> her Knight of Honour, and by the Marqueſs of <hi>Haute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> her firſt Squire. Next to her proceeded <hi>Madam,</hi> led by the Count <hi>de Vaillae,</hi> her Knight of Honour, and by the Marqueſs of <hi>Brom</hi> her firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquire. After her went <hi>Madamoiſelle</hi> led by Monſieur the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> who gave her the right hand; and by <hi>Monſieur</hi> who gave her the left hand. She had on a Mantean of Tiffany interwoven with gold, the train whereof ſix Ells in length, was carried up by Madam <hi>Valois</hi> her Siſter. <hi>Madamoiſelle d' Orleans,</hi> Madam Grand Dutcheſs of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> all three Daughters of the deceaſed <hi>Monſieur,</hi> and Great-Grandchildren to <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, followed after; after whom went <hi>Madamoiſelle de Blois, Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle de Nantes,</hi> and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Vernevil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen coming into the Grand Cabinet, found there the King ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a place raiſed on purpoſe, attended by the Prince of <hi>Roche ſur Yon,</hi> the Count of <hi>Vermandois,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Maine,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Vernevel.</hi> Behind him was a great Chair with elbows; before him a Table, and upon the Table a little Scritoire. The Queen placed her ſelf upon the left hand of the King, having alſo an elbow-Chair behind her. The Princes and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes that attended her, aſcended the Scaffold, and placed themſelves upon the right and left hand of the King and Queen, after the manner of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater.</p>
            <p>Upon the right hand of the King was Monſieur the Dauphin, Madam, <hi>Madamoiſelle de Valois, Madam</hi> the Grand Dutcheſs, the Prince of <hi>Roche ſur Yon, Madamoiſelle de Blois, Madamoiſelle de Nantes,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Vernevel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the left of the Queen were <hi>Monſieur, Madamoiſelle, Madamoiſelle D' Orleans,</hi> Madam <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> the Count of <hi>Vermandiiſe,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Maine,</hi> and the Dutcheſs of <hi>Vernevel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the interim, the Chevalier <hi>de Lorrain,</hi> accompanied by the Marqueſs of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> Grand Maſter of the Ceremonies, and by the Sieur <hi>de Bonnevil,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductor of Ambaſſadors, were gone in the Kings Coaches to fetch the Marqueſs <hi>de les Balbaſez,</hi> whoſe Lodgings were in the <hi>White-horſe Court;</hi> and having croſſed the whole Court, where was drawn up a Company of the <hi>French</hi> Guards, and another of <hi>Switzers,</hi> the Drums of which Companies beat all the while; he conducted him to the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who received him at the end of the Court, and walked not above two paces before him. Then the Ambaſſador deſired him to go the King in order to the Betroth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. As they came out, the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> went firſt, and they took Coach in the Kings Coach at the foot of the <hi>Horſe-ſhoo-ſtairs,</hi> alighted at the <hi>Sphinx</hi> Stair-caſe, where a hundred of the Guard of <hi>Switzers</hi> were ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on each ſide of the Stairs. At the door of the Guard-Hall they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> Captain of the Guards of the Body, who conducted him into the Kings Cabinet, where the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> entred, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

the Ambaſſador on his right hand, and the <hi>Chevalier de Lorrain</hi> on his left. After which, the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> went and placed himſelf between <hi>Madam</hi> the Grand Dutcheſs, and the Prince of <hi>Roche ſur Yon;</hi> and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador applied himſelf to the King to complement him in behalf of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> be-covered while he ſpoke, as were all the Princes of the Royal Family, and the Chevalier <hi>de Lorrain</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>At what time they aſcended the Scaffold of State, the Chancellor of <hi>France</hi> aſcended alſo, and took his place according to cuſtom, at the right hand of the Chair of State. The Duke of <hi>Geſures,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Geſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> the D. of St. <hi>Agnan,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Beauvilliers,</hi> firſt Gentlemen of the Chamber, the Prince of <hi>Marſillac,</hi> Grand Maſter of the Wardrobe; the Marqueſs of <hi>Tilladel,</hi> Maſter of the Wardrobe, aſcended the Scaffold likewiſe, to place themſelves behind the King, while the D. of <hi>Montauſier</hi> put himſelf behind the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> as firſt Gentleman of his Chamber.</p>
            <p>When the Ambaſſador had ended his Complement, he retreated to the ſide of the Scaffold over-againſt the King, where he ſtayed with the Chevalier of <hi>Lorrain</hi> upon his left hand. Then the Sieur <hi>Pompone</hi> advanced toward the Table, and ſo ſoon as the King and the Queen were ſeated in their Chairs of State, he read with a loud voice the beginning of the Contract. But he had ſcarce read over one part of the Conditions, before the King told him it was enough, and preſently ſign'd the Contract.</p>
