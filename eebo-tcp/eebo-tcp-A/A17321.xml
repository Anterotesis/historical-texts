            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His text contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the faithful and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent keeping of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandementes, with a promise of life annexed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. And the doctrine that is to be gathered from the same, ariseth part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the maner of speaking that is there vsed, and partly from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. The manner of speaking is to be considered in the two first wordes, <hi>My sonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein is to be obserued, that
<pb facs="tcp:17387:4"/>
whosoeuer is the partie that spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, he speaketh not like an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour nor like a king, nor like a Iudge, nor like a maister, of his absolute power, I will and command, &amp;c. But he persuadeth like a father, most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly and tenderly. Hee doth not say, <hi>My slaue, nor my ennemy, nor my seruaunt, nor my subiect, nor my friend, nor my brother,</hi> which is much: but he saith, <hi>My sonne,</hi> which is more; a name of loue, and a title of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test loue that can be.</p>
            <p>The loue of a Prince is great, the loue of a friend is great, the loue of a brother is great, the loue of hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and wiues is great, but the loue of father and mother to their children, is like the loue of <hi>Ionathan</hi> to <hi>Dauid:</hi> It is wonderfull passing <note place="margin">2. Sam. 1. 26</note> the loue of Princes, the loue of brethren, the loue of neighbours, the loue of husbandes and wiues, &amp; and passing the loue of women and all loues. For (saith <hi>Esay) can a woman</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:17387:4"/>
               <hi>forget her child?</hi> As if he should say, <note place="margin">Esa. 49. 15.</note> it is impossible. Therefore hee that here speaketh in the person of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and saith, <hi>My sonne,</hi> perswadeth by all loues, and sheweth that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer hee counselleth or reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, it is not of mallice, or enuy to hurt vs, but of singular loue and care to doe vs good.</p>
            <p>We are further to consider of two principall circumstances: one is of the person that spake these words: the other is of the partie to whom they were spoken. Now the question is not of his fatherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vnto his children: for of that we are persuaded: nor of his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authoritie ouer his children, for that is graunted, nor of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens duetie towardes him, for that is acknowledged: but now the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of his person, and who it is, that heere saith, <hi>My sonne,</hi> that hee might be reuerenced: and who they are to whom this title of Sonnes
<pb facs="tcp:17387:5"/>
doth belong that they might not neglect to doe their dutie.</p>
            <p>If thou knewest (saith the Lord Iesus to the woman of Samaria) who it is that <hi>saith vnto thee giue mee drinke, thou wouldest haue asked of him,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and hee would haue giuen thee water of life.</hi> So if wee knewe who it is that heere saith, <hi>My sonne,</hi> and giueth counsell like a father in matters of this life, we would aske of him, and he would giue vs counsell to eternal life.</p>
            <p>Let vs know then who it is that saith, <hi>My sonne,</hi> whose voice is it? what, is it the voice of God or of man? is it from heauen or from earth, or from whence is it? For the better finding out of this point wee are to consider that as these names of Father and Sonne be often vsed in this booke of <hi>Prouerbs,</hi> so they are not alwaies the words of one, and the selfe same partie. They are som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be vnderstood of God and
<pb facs="tcp:17387:5"/>
of his Church: as in the 1. chapter, verse 8.</p>
            <p>They are sometimes to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of <hi>Salomon</hi> and the members of Gods Church, as chap. 4. ver. 1. They are somtime to be vnderstood onely of <hi>Dauid</hi> the father of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Chro. 28. 9</note> the sonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> as in cha. 4. verse 3. 4. Sometime they are the wordes of <hi>Bethsheba, Salomons</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto <hi>Salomon</hi> her sonne, as in chap. 30. ver. 1. But most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are the wordes of God and <hi>Salomon</hi> togither, and are spoken to the members of the Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and so they are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode, when there is no manifest difference, as there is in the places before mentioned.</p>
            <p>In this exhortation, these words <hi>My sonne,</hi> are to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the words of God the common father of all his creatures, but especially of his Church in generall, and they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the wordes of <hi>Salomon</hi> a notable
<pb facs="tcp:17387:6"/>
instrument in the Church of God, <hi>My sonne,</hi> saith God, &amp; my son saith <hi>Salomon:</hi> for this is Gods worde, though <hi>Salomons</hi> writing, because <hi>Salomon</hi> writeth as the holy Ghost inditeth, <hi>My sonne,</hi> saith God, by the ministery of <hi>Salomon,</hi> naming no body, because he speakes to euery one that will follow his counsell, of what nation, or of what countrie, or of what language, or of what yeares, of what estate and conditition soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he be, <hi>My sonne,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon</hi> in the person of God, naming no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet speaking to all that shal either heare or read his writings, that at the verie entrance, (the dores being of loue) they may be in loue with the whole frame of his counsell, &amp; haue a delight to dwell therein. <hi>My sonne,</hi> saith God, by the ministerie of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that wee might perceiue what loue hee beareth to vs, and knowe what dutie we beare to him: <hi>My son</hi> saith <hi>Salomon</hi> in the person of God,
<pb facs="tcp:17387:6"/>
to teach all teachers with what affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to teach the Lords people, and to shewe all hearers what accompt they must make of their teachers. <hi>My sonne,</hi> saith God, to teach vs that all his care is to doe vs good; and if we follow his counsell, it is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our selues, hee is neuer the better for it: and therefore that all our care and studie must be to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance him, and to direct all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his glorie, as he hath directed his glorie to our good, So that these wordes <hi>My sonne,</hi> are to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after a double manner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; First as spoken by God the first authour of them, next as procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from <hi>Salomon</hi> the minister of God, and so much briefly for the persons by whom they were spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The persons which are called sonnes.</head>
               <p>NOw we are to consider of the persons that are called by the
<pb facs="tcp:17387:7"/>
title of sonnes, and because God is first in order, we will first see of whom hee speaketh, in this place, when hee saith, <hi>My sonne,</hi> for many be called the sonnes of God, in the scripture, and they are of three sorts, some are by nature the sons of God, some are by adoption the sonnes of God, and some for their exellencie, are called the children of God. By nature, none is the sonne of God, but Iesus Christ onely, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten from all eternitie, of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 14. Pa. 2. 7. Pro. 8, 25.</note> nature, and substance. By a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption all the faithfull are his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom God hath elected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all worldes, that he might call them in his time appointed by the liuely preaching of the Gospell, and the effectuall working of his spirite in their hartes, vnto the blessed and certaine hope of eternall glorie, in the kingdome of heauen, being first iustified by the righteousnesse of the Lord Iesus christ, the naturall sonne
<pb facs="tcp:17387:7"/>
of God. These are called sonnes by adoption, or made sonnes, which before were no sonnes at all. As if a king should take in a begger, nay a traitor and make him his heire, euen so did God with vs, and such fauour did he freely shew to so many of the sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> as it pleased him to adopte, and to make his children, wherein appeared the wonderfull loue of God to vs ward, of which <hi>S. Iohn</hi> speaketh, by way of administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Behold, (saith he) what loue the father hath giuen to vs, that we <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3, 1.</note> should be called the sonnes of God, as if it were to be wondred at, and not to be expressed.</p>
               <p>The Angels are called the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. <hi>Iob</hi> 1. 6. &amp; <hi>Iob</hi> 2. chap. and 1 verse. <hi>When the children of God stood before the Lord, Sathan came also and stood amongst them. &amp;c.</hi> And they are so called, partly for their excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t state and condition, but principally, for their willingnesse and readines,
<pb facs="tcp:17387:8"/>
to doo the will of God.</p>
               <p>Sometime also the Lord is called our father, in respect of our creation onely, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Haue we not all</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>one father? hath not one God made vs?</hi> and in <hi>Esa.</hi> 64. 8. <hi>But now thou O Lord</hi>

In this respect God is a common father not <note place="margin">Luk. 3. last.</note> onely to all his creatures in generall, but to the very reprobate also, for he created them also, and he made them good saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> but they <hi>found out many inuentions,</hi> but we shal neuer find that God vouchsafed to call any reprobat in the scripture, by the name of his sonne. <hi>Non tam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanti reprobos dignatur honore.</hi> He did neuer honour them with so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a title.

<pb facs="tcp:17387:8"/>
appearance, but when they come before the Lord, whose waies are not our waies, and whose thoughts <note place="margin">Esa. 55. 8.</note> are not our thoughts, the case is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. If any shall obiect and say that there is neuer a father without a childe, and that they be relatiues, and therefore seing as God is called a father of the reprobate, in respect of creation, the reprobate may at the least be called the sonnes of God, though they be not the sonnes of God, as the elect are: they are to know, that some are called fathers in the scriptures, Metaphorically, which were but the first inuenters of thinges, and in that respect they are called fathers, as <hi>Iaball</hi> the sonne of <hi>Adah,</hi> the wife of <hi>Lamech</hi> is called <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 20.</note> the father of such as dwell in tents, for he was the first inuenter of tents. And <hi>Iuball</hi> his brother is called in <note place="margin">21</note> the next verse, the father of such as play vpon the Harpe, and vpon Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes or pipes: shall we therefore
<pb facs="tcp:17387:9"/>
call the tentes <hi>Iabals</hi> children, or must the organs and pipes be called the sonnes of <hi>Iuball.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So God is called the father of the reprobate, because he first created them, but yet they can no more be called the children of God, than the tentes might be called the children of <hi>Iabal,</hi> or the harps and organs the children of his brother <hi>Iubal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when the scriptures do speak of God, as he is a father not onely by creation, but also by adoption, then is the title of sonnes also there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal bestowed vpon those whom he hath created, because he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so adopted them to be haires of his kingdome through Christ, but it is limited onely to the elect, which do receiue him by faith, as in <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. <hi>As many as receiued him, to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he gaue prerogatiue, to be called the sons of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So doth the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine the title of Gods children onely to the godly. <hi>As manie as are</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:17387:9"/>
                  <hi>led by the spirite of God</hi> (saith he) <hi>are the sonnes of God.</hi> And because the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 14.</note> and all hypocrites wil boast of the spirite, as well as the children of God, as <hi>Zidkijah</hi> said hee had <note place="margin">1. Kin. 22. 24.</note> the spirit of God as wel as <hi>Michaiah,</hi> therfore the scripture hath put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the giftes of the spirite, and the spirite of sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for <hi>Saul</hi> may haue the spirite of <note place="margin">1. Sam. 11. 6.</note> God, that is, some giftes and graces of Gods spirit, as knowledge, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, courage, strength, pollicy, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wealth, &amp;c. as the wicked and thereprobate may haue, to their condemnation, but the spirite of sanctification or holinesse, which worketh newnesse of life, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth both the affections within, and all the actions without, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per onely to the elect children of God indeed.</p>
               <p>And least anie shoulde deceiue themselues, The Lord Iesus hath laid downe an euerlasting rule; <hi>By</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:17387:10"/>
                  <hi>their fruits you shall know them.</hi> And <note place="margin">Math. 7. 16.</note> the fruits of the spirite (saith S. <hi>Paul)</hi> are these, Loue, Ioy, Peace, Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffring, <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22. 23. 24.</note> Patience, Goodnesse, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenesse, Faith, Meekenesse, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp;c. Against which there is no law that is to condemne them: for they that are Christs haue crucified the fleshe with the affections and Iustes. But there is a kinde loue, and ioy, and peace, and suffering, &amp;c. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the children of darkenesse, because Sathan in his members can counterfeit whatsoeuer God doth commaund, and there is amongst the members of the Church malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in shew, whatsoeuer the church of God militant haue in trueth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sathan doth change himselfe into the likenesse of an angel of light, it is a hard thing to discerne the one from the other: therefore hath the Lord ioyned his word and his spirit togither, by which as by a true tuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, all false loue is discerned from true loue: and all false peace and
<pb facs="tcp:17387:10"/>
false ioy, is tried from true peace and true ioy, and so of the rest: and therfore is the word called <hi>the sword of the spirite,</hi> because it doth not try <note place="margin">Ephes. 6. 17.</note> nothing, nor worke any thing ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily but by the word of God. And last of al, least Sathan should abuse &amp; delude the children of God, with the manifold corruptions, imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and rebellious thoughtes of their heartes, and make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thereupon, that they haue not the spirit of God. They are to know that the spirite of God in the elect is not alwaies felt in themselues, nor perceiued in them by others in a like measure, but it is in them as the sunne, which sometime shineth and sendeth foorth her light, dispersing the clouds, and somtimes againe is hidden vnder the cloudes. It is in them as the ebbing and flowing of the sea. It is in them as the waxing and waning of the Moone. It is in them as the fire when it is kindled, and when it is raked vp in the ashes.
<pb facs="tcp:17387:11"/>
And it is within them, as the sap of the tree is in Winter and Sommer, sometime in all the branches, and sometime gone to the roote.</p>
               <p>And as the elect are like Trees planted by the waters side, which doe bring forth fruite in due season: <note place="margin">Psa. 1. 3.</note> so the same trees haue both a sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering and a wintering: a spring time, and a fall of the leafe: when winter come they seeme as though they were dead, but in summer they shall waxe fresh and greene againe. The fruits of the spirite in the elect children of God, are likewise like the fruit of the tree, which is first in the sap only, then it commeth into buds, and then into blossomes: whereof some are smitten with bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, some are nipped with frost &amp; cold, &amp; some are eaten with worms; but if they escape al these, then from blossoms they come to be appls: and at the first they are green and louely, and many doe lust to eate of them,
<pb facs="tcp:17387:11"/>
but they are still hard and harshe, but in time they come to their full growth. And when they are ripe, then are they eyther shaken downe with the winde, and swine deuour them, or beaten downe with cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and theeues do steale them; or if they be fairely gathered, yet are they pluckt from the tree that hath borne them, then are they bought and sold: whereof some perish, and are cast out of dores: the fairest and the sweetest, is brought either to fire to be rosted, or to the boord to be pared and cut in peeces, and so to be eaten: then the tree is naked and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be dead, but the next spring doth fetch all againe. So are the fruites of the spirite in the adopted children of God, first in the sap of faith only which is hidden in the heart: then it commeth into good thoughtes, then into good wordes, then into good workes by degrees: but many times they are
<pb facs="tcp:17387:12"/>
nipped and smitten in the bud or in the blossome: that is either in thoughts, or wordes, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer come into workes. The workes likewise of the godly are at the first faire and freshe, but yet hard and harsh: and when they are come to any perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they are either wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken and deuoured by beasts, or smitten with persecution: then are they bought and solde, and euerie man handleth them as they list. In a worde, the fairest, the pleasantest, and the best of our workes must be pared and picked for dainty mouths and queasie stomackes, and in the end consumed of all, and then are our labours come to their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherher they be of Church or common-wealth, and then doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods children thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues naked and dead, but there is no cause why they should: for as all that fruit when it is so and so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, doe prooue that sap is in the
<pb facs="tcp:17387:12"/>
tree; so all the fruites of the elect, whether they perishin the bud, or in the blossome, or in the ripening, or howsoeuer they be handled: yet they proue that the sap of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite is in them, and the next spring of Gods grace will fetch all againe. But then they doubt of themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause perhappes they haue not so much fruit as they had, or so much as others haue: but there is no cause why they shold doubt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues: for though they haue not so much as they had, yet it is as good, and sound as that which they had, it is not counterfait and fained, but it is in trueth that which it seemeth to be, and so long they may care, but they neede not to feare the want of Gods spirite in them: for it is not so materiall, how much faith, or howe much zeale, or how much loue, or how much patience a man hath; but how good faith, howe good zeale, how good loue, &amp; how good pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb facs="tcp:17387:13"/>
a man hath: whether the faith, loue, zeale, &amp;c. be true, or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, from the heart, or in hypocrisie, must be the question. That as men say of fruit, this is but little, but it is good; heere be not many of them, but those that are of them are verie daintie, they are right of such and such a kind. So the children of God may say, My faith is but little and weake, my loue is not so much as I would it were: my zeale is but litle, and my patience is but small: but it is true faith, and true loue, and true zeale, and true patience, euen from the verie heart root without dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, O Lord increase it and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it. And thus much for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the children of God by creation only, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God both by creation and adoption. And thus much of the spirit of God, both in the one and in the other.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come to the matter
<pb facs="tcp:17387:13"/>
in hand. We haue heard who be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the sonnes of God. how this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is giuen to the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> how to Angels, and how to men hath been also declared, but to imagine that in this place it were spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Lord Iesus, were no lesse than blasphemy, because he was euer without sinne, and to enquire, whether it were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Angels or no, were vaine curiositie.</p>
               <p>Now if it be man to whom the Lord saith, <hi>My son,</hi> as it is indeede, O Lord what is man, that thou doost speak so kindly to him? or the sonne of man that thou doest so regarde him. Againe, if it be spoken to man, how art thou O Man, gotten into such fauour with God, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thou hadst lost? How happy and honourable are those men, which are the sonnes of God. But is it spoken to me in deede? what, to sinfull and miserable man? and are the sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> among the sons
<pb facs="tcp:17387:14"/>
of God, as Saul was amongst the prophets, is the prodigall son come home againe? is it for him that such costly robes are brought forth? and is it he that his father went out to meete, and so louingly embraced? is this he whom he saluted with such sweete kisses, and teares of ioy? was it for him, that the fat calfe was killed? and is all this feasting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing for his returne, as though he had neuer offended? surely so it should seeme. But what shall man now giue vnto God, for so greate loue and fauour, or how shall we shew our selues thankfull, for such kindnesse vndeserued? Surely this is the Lordes doing, and it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull in our eyes, but that our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit may encrease to the further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of our iudgmente, and comfort of our faith, we will by the grace of God, set downe certain pointes, to consider of, and by this text to be examined. First we will
<pb facs="tcp:17387:14"/>
consider how or by what meanes we are come into this fauour with God, and how we are come by the knowledge thereof. Secondly we will see the exellencie of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God aboue other men. Thirdly we will enquire what duety the children-of God do owe vnto God their heauenly father, wherby they may shew themselues thankful for such fauour restored. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we will consider, why the Lord both here and els where vseth these wordes, <hi>My sonne,</hi> Last of all we will see what may bee gathered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them as they bee the words of <hi>Solomon.</hi>

               <head>How we are made the sonnes of God.</head>
               <p>NOw touching the First point, if we be the sonnes of God, then God is our father, the church of god is our mother, the members of the church be our bretheren, and the kingdome of heauen is our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. This purchase the father hath bestowed vpon vs, the sonne hath
<pb facs="tcp:17387:15"/>
bought it for vs, and the holy ghost hath sealed vnto vs. Of this coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God is the author, the sonne of God is the purchaser, and the spirite of God is the certifier. It is freely graunted, it is fully discharged, it is certainely assured, and shall be for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer possessed. This prerogatiue as it is great, so the first cause thereof was the infinite loue of God, in his son Iesus Christ. It is the free gift of the father, so saith the sonne, <hi>Feare not litle flocke, it is youre fathers pleasure to giue you a kingdome.</hi> It is the free gift <note place="margin">Luke 12. 32.</note> of the sonne, so saith the Lord Iesus, <hi>My sheepe heare my voice and follow me,</hi>

                  <hi>and I giue vnto them eternall life.</hi> It is also the gift of the Holy Ghost, so saith the prophet <hi>Dauid, Lord let thy good spirite lead me into the land of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 143. 10.</note> and therefore it is no way merited or purchased by our selues while we liue, nor gotten by any friendes for vs, when we are deade, (as <hi>Papists</hi> teach) for nothing can be

               <p>The euidence or assurance which we haue to shew for this priuiledge, is Gods promise, which is surely ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in heauen, by the eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the holy Trinitie, as it were, by an euerlasting Act of Parlement, neuer to be repealed, wherunto the father, the word, and the spirite, do beare sufficient witnesse, If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we receiue the witnesse of men, the witnesse of God is greater.

Should I be familiar with Athists, or Papists, or Belly-gods, or scoffers at religion, as though they wer my fathers frends, when they bee his deadly foes? Shoulde I carry two faces in one hood?

Is this a life for the seruauntes of God, if not for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, much lesse for his children.

shalbe constrained with shame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to say, These were no doubt the children of God, these were good men, these were true profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors indeed: for such fruites and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects doe follow their profession, as are not commonly seen in the liues of others.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, to conclude this point. Let not the king go like a Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar: Let not the captaine runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way like a coward: Let not the tree <note place="margin">Iud. 9, 9, 15.</note> loose his fatnesse, to do as the bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would doe. And let not a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian liue like Antichrist: Let not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers liue like infidels, nor let not the sonnes of God liue like the sons of Sathan: But, as in our houses, as in our apparell, as in our feastinges, as in our furniture, in euerie thing els, we striue to haue matches, and all our thinges sutable. So likewise, let vs striue to haue our titles, and our liues, our names and our quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, our profession and our practise
<pb facs="tcp:17387:30"/>
sutable and answerable the one to the other. Finally, let euerie one that calleth God his father, in the <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 19</note> name of the Lord Iesus, depart from iniquitie, least heereafter the Lord Iesus bid him, depart with the works of iniquitie. Heere be two depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges. <note place="margin">Mat. 25, 41. &amp; 7, 23. Luke, 13, 27.</note> If we take the first now, we shall be free from the other heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: but if we will not heare nowe of a departing from iniquitie, which we ought, we shall heereafter heare of a departing with our iniquitie, which wee would not. The first is somewhat painfull, but it is infinitly gainfull. The second is most feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and for euer intollerable. And thus much of the duetie of Gods children in regard of their titles.</p>
               <p>Nowe let vs see why the Lord both in this place, and so often in this booke of Prouerbes, doth vse these wordes, <hi>My son,</hi> as also, why he doth not say, <hi>My sonnes,</hi> in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number, seeing hee speakes to
<pb facs="tcp:17387:31"/>
all the church in general; but, <hi>My son,</hi> in the singular nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, as though he spake but to one alone, that so we may make that vse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for which they were left vnto the Church.</p>
               <p>And least wee should thinke this to be more than neede, wee are to knowe, that as the holyest speaketh nothing in vaine, so doth hee not speake anie worde at all aduenture, but in singular wisedome, and in most excellent order hath hee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led euerie Treatise, and placed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sentence, euerie word, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie letter. To great purpose it is don, and ought accordingly to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: for, when heauen and earth shall passe, not one iot or tittle of <note place="margin">Matt. 5. 18.</note> Gods word shall passe: but euerie worde of God endureth for euer, and shall remaine as faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in heauen, either with vs, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vs in the day of the Lord: <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 89</note> Then shall all Gods argumentes, and reasons, and persuasions be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:17387:31"/>
foorth to giue euidence against vs if they doe nothing preuaile now. Then shall euerie word of admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and euerie worde of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and euerie word of loue, and kindnesse, and euerie title of honor and dignitie come forth, and plead hard against all such as haue turned the deafe eare vnto them: yea they shall also crie loud for vengeance vppon all those men which either in worde or deede, haue offered them anie disgrace, especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest their friendes vppon the face of the earth like strangers of an other countrey, when they catch their forraigne ennemies within their owne liberties, for euerie worde of GOD is sent from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by God, as Embassadours of a farre Countrey one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deale for God. Therefore it shallbe wisedome for vs to regard them now and to giue them good entertainement, while they remaine
<pb facs="tcp:17387:32"/>
amongst vs, or els when we trauaile into their country where they dwell (which will not be long) and think to find reliefe at their handes, they wil then serue vs, as we serued them, and put vs in minde of our discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous dealing against them, when they were amongst vs, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> told his bertheren of their crueltie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">Gen. 45. 3, 4,</note> him, when they went into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipte, for succour, where he bare rule, and they had nothing to doe, then were they both afraide and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed, and so shall we be too, if we doe not repent.</p>
               <p>Well go to then, we will not lightly passe ouer this preface, as we haue don, as if they were but words of course, for there is more in them then we thinke there were, for in deed, there is more contained in these two wordes, <hi>My sonne,</hi> than (some thinke) can be gathered out of two chapters, yea ij books. I will not say the whole booke of God,
<pb facs="tcp:17387:32"/>
butl et vs see, why the Lord vseth to speake so vnto miserable men, and why he speaketh in the singular number, as to one alone, when that which he saith concerneth not only one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the whole church of God, that we may also vse them to that ende, for which they were set downe.</p>
               <p>Surely the Lord of mercy, (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where of we be made, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Psa. 103. 14.</note> that we are but dust, full of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and corruption) frameth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his worde to speake accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. And albeit, he sometime vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth himselfe in fearefull wordes of might and maiesty, to shewe his power and soueraigntie ouer vs, yet sometime againe he speaketh as a tender father, alluring his children with sweet wordes of comfort, and encouragement, for if mount Sinay should still smoke, and burne with <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> fire, <hi>Israell</hi> would die for feare. If <hi>Moses</hi> should not couer his face <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 30. 33, 35.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:17387:33"/>
with a vaile when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from talking with God, they wer not able to behold him, If the Lord of hosts should alwaies send strong windes before him, to rend the mountains, and to split the Rockes in pieces, <hi>Eliah</hi> himselfe durst not come out of his caue, but if a still and a soft voice come after the winde, the earthquake, and the fire, then will <hi>Eliah</hi> beginne to peepe out, and <note place="margin">1. King. 19. 11 12, 13.</note> boldly to stand vp, but he will not go beyond the entring of the caue, as bold as he is, and his face must be couered with his mantle too.</p>
               <p>Here therefore, and often in this booke, the Lorde of heauen and earth, speaketh no otherwise, vnto his church than a father doth to his child, <hi>My sonne,</hi> (saith he) yea he taketh vpon him the person of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and speaketh like a father most louingly, kindly and alluringly, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>My sonne,</hi> partly to persuade vs to heare our duetie, partly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb facs="tcp:17387:33"/>
and confirme vs in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our duetie, partly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs, when we be in troble for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our duetie, but principally to teach vs, that whatsoeuer obedience we yeeld vnto God, wee must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it with a sonne-like affection, and whatsoeuer fauour God shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto vs, it commeth from a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly compassion. And lastly that al our obedience is accepted of him, and all his loue, is bestowed vppon vs, onely because wee are his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Christ, but for no cause of worthinesse that is in our selues.</p>
               <p>So that these wordes, <hi>My sonne,</hi> (proceeding from God to men) are words of persuasion, they are words of encouragement, they are wordes of comfort, and they are wordes of instruction: They are in a word like the tree of life (in the Reuelation) that beareth twelue manner of fruit, euerie moneth; whose very leaues <note place="margin">Reu. 22. 2.</note> do serue to cure the Nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:17387:34"/>
If any shall say, Can all this come out of these two wordes? I say to them, as <hi>Philp</hi> saide in another case to <hi>Nathaniel, Come and see.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 46.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But are they not of power suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to persuade? Surely where the spirite of grace is, they are sufficient: for, when nothing can preuaile with a childe, the loue and authoritie of his father shall preuaile with him: especially, if the thing be honest and lawfull which is commanded. One word of his fathers mouth shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade more than 1000. of another.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>How these wordes, My sonne, do serue to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade, and to moue affection.</head>
               <p>NOw our heauenly father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth vs nothing but things honest &amp; lawfull, neither can he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing els; for it is against his nature: but our rebellious hearts naturally doe go against the hearing of them: therefore wee had need of some oratour to persuade vs, and that might vse some good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
<pb facs="tcp:17387:34"/>
and strong reasons to moue our affections. The Lord doth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore become that Oratour himselfe, but all the fine eloquence, and al the strong argumentes by which hee would mooue affection, are in these wordes, <hi>My sonne,</hi> as if he should say, If thou wilt heare no bodie, O thou rebellious person, yet thou wilt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the voyce of thy father; if thou wilt not regard thy Father which begat thee, and brought thee vp, whom wilt thou regarde? Thy father speaketh, heare him.

If thou be my sonne, heare me, and if thou louest me as I loue thee, heare mee. If thou hast felt the power of my loue, if thou haue tasted the sweetnesse of my
<pb facs="tcp:17387:35"/>
loue, If thou haue known the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my loue, which I haue shed abundantly vpon thee, when I gaue Iesus Christ for thee, I know thou wilt not stoppe thy eares, but wilt both regard me and obey me, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>souer reasons or persuasions thou hast receiued, or maiest receiue of the worlde, or the deuill, or thy owne false heart, to the contrarie. Nowe when the Lorde woulde speake all this in one worde, hee sayth, <hi>My sonne:</hi> Therefore let vs remember that GOD calleth vs sonnes, and wee call him father: for wee say, <hi>Our father, &amp;c.</hi> and it sufficeth. Nay more (saith the Lord) Remember that I call thee not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a sonne, but my sonne: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou haue not onely a father, but that I am thy father, no man, nor Angell, nor anie person of meane estate, but the almightie God of heauen and earth, the King of kinges, and Lord of lords, euen
<pb facs="tcp:17387:35"/>
the King of glorie, and the Lord of hostes, mightie in battaile, whose <note place="margin">Psal. 24. 8.</note> glorie is infinite, and his Maiestie is incomprehensible, who filleth the earth with the riches of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <note place="margin">Psal. 104. 24. Psal. 8. 1. 3.</note> whose wisedome, power, and goodnesse doth shine in euery part of the worlde, who telleth the Starres, and calleth them all by <note place="margin">Psal. 147. 4. 9</note> their names, whose dwelling is in the Heauens, and the Earth is his footstoole, at whose presence the Heauens and the Earth are moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and melted, euen such a one is thy Father, and if thou wilt not be mooued when suche a one spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and calleth thee his Sonne, then it goeth hard. Remember a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that I am thy father, and such a one doth call thee his sonne, as might haue forsaken thee for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but hee did not, he could haue destroyed thee in thy sinnes, but he did not: hee could haue made thee a prey to the deuill, but hee did not:
<pb facs="tcp:17387:36"/>
hee coulde haue plagued thee with infinite plagues, but hee did not, he coulde haue shut vp thy bodie and soule in the chaines of darkenesse, in Hell fire for euer, but hee did not. Againe hee was not bound to make thee his son and heire, yet he did it: he was not compelled to spare thee, yet he did it, he sawe no reason why he should blesse thee so many ways, yet he hath blessed thee manie waies: thou couldst not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade him, yet hee was persuaded: thou hadst nothing to say for thy selfe, yet hee was satisfied: thou wert his ennemie, yet hee became thy friend: in a worde, thou wert the childe of the Diuell, and the heire of endlesse perdition, yet hee made thee the childe of God, and an heire of euerlasting saluation, such a one is thy father: therefore if thou contemnest the wordes of such a Father, remember whom thou contemnest. I coulde presse
<pb facs="tcp:17387:36"/>
thee with my power, but I doe woo thee by my loue. I might haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaied my flagge of defiance against thee, and haue saide my rebell; but loe, I haue put out a flagge of truce, and displaied my colours of loue, when I call thee <hi>My sonne,</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this, <hi>My sonne,</hi> and be persuaded. Thus wee see howe the Lord doth as it were adiure vs by the loue, and authoritie of a father, and by the loue and duetie of a sonne, to heare his word, and obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandementes.</p>
               <p>Therefore doe these two words, <hi>My sonne,</hi> runne from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so often in this booke of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs, whatsoeuer matter almost he hath in hand. <hi>Father and Sonne,</hi> must go before as common Oratours to get attention, and to mooue affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: to shew vs that if anie thing will draw a man to God, it is the feeling and consideration of his loue in Christ: and hee that will not yeeld,
<pb facs="tcp:17387:37"/>
when hee is thus charmed, will hee euer be wonne? And hee that shall runne from God, when hee seeth the white auncient, with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of mercie and fauour dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaied, when wil he come and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himselfe to God?</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, That lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">Prou. 22. 1.</note> fauor is aboue gold and siluer: meaning, that it is not onely more worth, but that it is of greater force, and will bring greater matters to passe, and yet we know that money will doe much: but is not the kings fauour without his paie, better than the kings paie without his fauour? and what good shall the goodes of his subiectes doe him, without their heartes and good will?</p>
               <p>This knew the old counsellers of <hi>Salomon</hi> well inough, and therefore when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> (who succeeded <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon)</hi> asked them, what course he <note place="margin">1. King. 12. 7.</note> should take, to winne the heartes of the people, they gaue him counsell
<pb facs="tcp:17387:37"/>
to speak kindly vnto them at the first and they would be his seruantes for euer, meaning that some token of loue, or shewe of a kind affection towardes them, would more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with them, than any thing els. Shall the hope of <hi>Rehoboams</hi> loue make his subiects serue him for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and shall not the assurance of Gods loue make vs serue him, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer? Shall the kind words of <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the king of <hi>Ifrael,</hi> win the heartes of his people for euer, and shal not the kind wordes of <hi>Iehouah</hi> the king of heauen and earth, win the hearts of his people for euer and for euer vnto himselfe? besides that <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> had neede to speake kindly to his subiects, or els it is the worse for himselfe, <hi>Iehouah</hi> needeth not to speake so, for if we neuer loue him, it is not the worse for him, but for our selues, yea if we be righteous, we are righteous for our selues, and if we all perish, God wil not loose a <note place="margin">Iob.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:17387:38"/>
whit of his glory, shall we not then listen vnto the Lord when he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth so kindly vnto vs, and hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the flagge of Truce, with, <hi>My sonne,</hi> the badge of loue vpon it. When God commaunded <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham to sacrifice his sonne Isaac, he was</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 3. 10, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>ready to do it.</hi> So deare was the loue of God vnto him, but if all the world besides had persuaded him therevnto, he would neuer haue yeelded. God doth not commaund vs to sacrifice our sonnes, but our sinnes, least they sacrifice vs, now if we thinke our selues as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to God as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, we wil not spare them, though they be as necessarie for vs, as our right hand, or as profitable vnto vs as our right eye. If <hi>Iudas</hi> had been the child <note place="margin">Mat. 27.</note> of God, as he was the child of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? would he haue sold the loue of Christ for 30 pieces of siluer? no, nor yet for 30 thousande worldes, but so it is with all Hipocrites, and
<pb facs="tcp:17387:38"/>
reprobate persons, (which are best knowne to the searcher of hearts.) They cannot be persuaded, that God is their father in Christ, their spirites are not assured by Gods spirit, that God doth loue them. They conceiue of the Lord, as of their enemie, and therefore as they could neuer feele the sweetenesse of Gods loue, in their soules, so they can neuer afford him their loue in their liues. Whervpon it commeth to passe, that the least temptation in the world, the least feare of mans displeasure, and the least shew of pleasure and profit, doe easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade them to doe any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst god, against his glory, against his word, and against his feruantes, as <hi>Baalam</hi> did, who serued for the wages of iniquitie. <note place="margin">Num. 23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But the faithfull indeed, hearing <note place="margin">Iud. 11.</note> God calling them his sonnes and his daughters, (hauing the spirit of sanctification, to assure them of
<pb facs="tcp:17387:39"/>
their adoption, they (I say) do fall into the reckoning of Gods vnspea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable loue in Christ, vnto them, (howbeit not all at one time, nor alwaies alike) &amp; he that is not now, may be hereafter, but when they consider of it indeed, they do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall resolue with themselues, (in token of thankfullnesse) to serue the Lord, in righteousnesse and true holines all the daies of their life (yet still depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding vpon God by prayer) and herein (through Gods grace) they are resolute, whatsoeuer dislike of men or hinderance in the world or daunger to their owne liues, they might purchase for their labor? And thus wee see, what an Orator the loue of God is. Therfore when the Lord saith, <hi>My son,</hi> let vs looke for no more eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to entice vs, nor reasons to persuade vs, for heare is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence inough, &amp; reasons inow, and learning inough, and fathers inow to persuade any man that
<pb facs="tcp:17387:39"/>
hath the spirit of God in him, and whosoeuer doth not find the cords of Gods loue, and authoritie strong inough, to knit his hearte vnto the statutes of the Lord, he hath good cause to suspect himselfe as yet, that he is not the child of God.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Why, My sonne, in the singular number, and not my sonnes.</head>
               <p>NOw we will see, why the Lord saith not <hi>My sonnes,</hi> in the plurall number, seeing as he speaketh to all his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but <hi>My sonne,</hi> as if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned but onely one body. This is partly for the particular encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confirmation of euery one in his duety, and partly for the particular comfort of euery one of Gods children, when he shall be troubled for doing of his duety, for when the Lord in particular shall giue euery one his charge, then if any man be offended at him, he may shew his warrant, and say thus, Sir
<pb facs="tcp:17387:40"/>
the Lord did not speake generally to all, least one should post it off to another, but he speaketh particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to me, aswell as to another, and therefore I am discharged: for when the Lord speaketh indefinitly meaning none, he excepteth none.

               <p>And good reason, for do we not owe all to him of whom we haue receiued all? Of God we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:17387:41"/>
all that we haue: for in him we liue, and moue, and haue our being: <note place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> doe we not therefore owe him our life our mouing, and our being, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whatsoeuer we are, or whatsoeuer we haue? And is it not reason that if a man hath bought a thing wholly, and wholly paid for it, that he shuld haue it wholly to himselfe? howe much more ought the Lord to haue the whole seruice both of body and soule, seeing hee hath bought all, and paid for all? Therefore nowe, we are no more our owne men, but the Lords: therefore hee saith, <hi>My sonne,</hi> As if he should say againe; If thou hearkenest to anie, hearken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee: if thou beleeuest anie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me: if thou louest anie, loue me: if thou fearest anie, feare me: if thou obeiest anie, obey me: if thou standest for anie bodies credite or glorie, stand for mine: If thou doest praise anie bodies workes, praise mine: and if thou returnest thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing

to any, returne them to mee, and to my vse onely: for now, by vertue of the league and couenaunt wherinto thou and I be entered, thy hearing is mine, thy faith is mine, thy loue is mine, thy feare is mine, thy obedience is mine, thy praises are mine: in body and soule, and in euery part and member therof, thou must be wholy mine, and no bodies else, and therefore remember, that I do not call thee, Our son, as though some other were my partner in thee, but I call thee, <hi>My sonne,</hi> because I <note place="margin">Esay 48, 11.</note> will not giue my glorie vnto any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

Thou wilt not. And will the Lord take it in good part if thou deuide thy loue betweene him, and another, seeing he hath maried thee wholy to himselfe? No surely, hee will not be serued by the halfes, hee
<pb facs="tcp:17387:42"/>
will be a sole father, and a whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or els no father, hee will haue thee his sonne onely, or els no sonne at all: hee will haue all our seruice, or els none of our seruice. And if the diuell hath any interest at all, he shal one day haue interest in al, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance: for he taketh possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole man by some one member of the body, or by some one affection of the heart, as men take state of a house by the ring of a dore. And hee keepeth possession aswell by the loue of one sinne (if it raigne in a man) as by a thousand: euen as men keepe possession of a house, aswell by one man within, or a childe, as by a thousand, if they be not expelled.</p>

               <p>What shall we doe then? why, what if the world say, giue mee thy heart? Say, thou mayst not; it is the Lordes alreadie.

               <p>All this is in generall, but now more particularly, suppose I bee a man of wealth and countenance likely to beare office in the church of God, or in the common wealth, what if I be called to the place of a chiefe Maiestrat amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, may I not refuse it? Thou art not thy owne man, but the Lords, the calling is not mans, but Gods, therefore thou maist not refuse it. But what if ease and selfeloue would persuade me to buy it for euer?

and become a minister? Surely by praier and supplication thou maiest help, but keepe thy standing: for thou art not thy owne man to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe thy place at thy pleasure. As for the ministery, it is to be born by such as haue gifts and calling for it, as the Arke was to be carried by Leuites, and not by Oxen.

               <p>But why doth the Lord suffer the vngodly so to vexe his Children? surely, because they are his rods to whip them withall; but when hee hath wel corrected his children, and worne his rod to the stumps, the rod shalbe cast into the fire: and as scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of the kitchen, to scoure his vessels of honour, so doth the Lord vse all the wicked ennemies of his Church, euen the greatest Tirantes that euer were.</p>
               <p>But, why doth our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keepe his children so bare and so poore as they be manie times? Neuer maruell at that: for thou thy selfe (being a father) keepest thy child bare, and giuest him neuer a pennie in his purse: thou puttest him

<pb facs="tcp:17387:54"/>
treated and oppressed, as Israel was; then wee must be hated and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was, and then wee shall haue it. The worlde will hate vs, our foes will hate vs, and our friendes will hate vs, if wee feare God, but God will loue vs, and that is our comfort: Father and mother will forsake vs, but God will <note place="margin">Psa: 27. 10.</note> take vs vp, and that is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.

<pb facs="tcp:17387:54"/>
And Sathan will sift vs, as wheat is <note place="margin">Luke 22. 31. 32.</note> sifted, if we weare as good as <hi>Peter,</hi> if he may haue his desire, but be not afraid, for I haue prayed for thee, saith the Lord Iesus, that thy faith may not faile, yea the Lord doth fight for vs, and with his louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour he will defend his children, as <note place="margin">Psa 5. 12.</note> with a sheild.</p>
               <p>This is more (I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse) than man can found with the plummet of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man reason, neither is it alwais seen with the eies of our body. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 7.</note> Gods children must learne to walke by faith, and not by sight. And therfore is our waiting on god made an article of our faith, <hi>I beeloue in God the father almightie &amp;c.</hi> That which must vpholde our faith is Gods promise, and his power. So was <hi>Abraham</hi> vpholden and was persuaded that God would be as good as his word, though he saw no worldly reason for it, and if we <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 21.</note> could giue a naturall reason for that,
<pb facs="tcp:17387:55"/>
as wee may doe for thinges of the world, then were our trusting in God an article of reason, but not an article of faith. And these two can not stand together, for faith doth beginne, where reason doth end, that when all meanes doe faile vs, yet faith may vphold vs, in the promises of God.</p>
               <p>And thus we see, how these two words, <hi>My sonne,</hi> do not onely persuade vs to here God, and bind vs entirely to serue him, without halting in our calling, but they serue also to comfort vs, and to cheare vs vp, when the crosse doth meete vs in doing, or rather in neglecting the dueties of our calling.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>How these words, <hi>My sonne,</hi> do serue for instruction.</head>
               <p>LAst of all, for our instruction the Lord saith, <hi>My son,</hi> to teach vs that if we doe willingly heare him
<pb facs="tcp:17387:55"/>
when he teacheth vs, if we diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obay him when he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, and if we patiently suffer him, when he correcteth vs, he will (no doubt) haue a fatherly care ouer vs, he will accept of our sacrifices, and heare our praiers, he will also be mercifull to our sinnes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs our offences, he will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs from hell, and bring vs into heauen. But all this is neither for our hearing, nor for our obaying, nor for our suffering, nor for our praying, nor for our working, but because we are first his adopted children in Iesus christ. It is not for any worthinesse that is in vs, but for the worthinesse of the Lord Iesus, by whose meanes we are become his sonnes &amp; his daughters, we are not therfore made the sons of God, because we heare his word, because we obay his commaundements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we beare the crosse, or for any other thing that we haue done, or
<pb facs="tcp:17387:56"/>
possibly can doe, (as <hi>Papists</hi> hold) but therfore we heare him, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we obay him, and therefore we suffer him, and therefore we loue him, because we are first made his children in the Lord Iesus.</p>
               <p>Our good workes are not the cause of our election, but Gods elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the cause of our good works, for he hath chosen vs, (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle) <hi>in him that is in Christ, before the foundation of the world, that wee</hi>

father of lightes, is of a brighte and liuely colour, but so soone as they come into our vessels, they chaunge their colour and looke of another hue. There is neuer a praier that we make, but hath his wants of feeling, or want of humbling, or faith, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, or something is wanting, and it is stained with the contrarie. There is neuer a sermon that we make, or heare, but hath some stain, and pollution in vs, There is neuer a grace that we say, but is likewise blemished for want of some grace, our whole seruice is idle and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, for when did we talke, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vanitie? when do we giue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some sauour or other of Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie? when do we heare, without wearines? or when do we pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tediousnesse? and when we doe pray for pardon, what toies and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies do stain our prayers? that when we haue praied, we had need to pray againe, that God would forgiue our

prayers, for do we not thinke least of God, when we pray vnto him, and doth not our deuotion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly end with our prayers? If we suffer any thing, is it without some impatience and distrust? will not a little murmuring and grudging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, haue a hand in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? will we not appoint our heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father, either where to strike, or when, or with what, or how long, or how much, or how litle, or one thing or other: as though he knew not what to doe without vs? And when (I pray you) doe we rest har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely well contented with his good pleasure and will? If we obtaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which we desired, doe we not still desire more like <hi>Achab?</hi> If <note place="margin">1.

causes how hoate are we, in Gods causes how cold are we? in excerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of prophanenesse how bold? but in the excercises of holinesse, how bashfull is the best of vs? and (that which God doth most abhorre) do we not waxe proud of those good things which God doth worke in vs, and by vs, as children are proud of their new clothes, which their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents do put vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them? or of saying a grace, which with much ado) their parents haue taught them? In one word, that litle good that is in vs, is it not matched (as I said) and manie times ouermatched with muche euill? And that litle that is in vs, or done by vs, it is of the Lord also that worketh both the will and the deed. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth reward that, what <note place="margin">Philip. 2. 13.</note> doth he, but crowne his owne gifts in vs? and that according to that promise, and couenant, which hee sware to our forefather <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his seede for euer. So that wee
<pb facs="tcp:17387:58"/>
may now safely conclude as <hi>(Paule</hi> doth) It is neither in him that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 16.</note> nor in him that runneth, but in God that sheweth mercie. All this, and much more being considered, how should we doe if wee were not first the sonnes of God in Christ our Lord? would our workes abide the triall of Gods iustice? Alas poore wretches that we are, the least staine of thought (though it were neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sented vnto) would send vs pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hell for euer. But now, being first the sons of God by Iesus Christ, being assured of Gods loue in christ, and pleading nothing but his mercy onely, in the merites of Christ, wee may be bold to go vnto our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly father: for if any man sin, wee haue an aduocate with the father, Iesus <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 1.</note> Christ the righteous, whose righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse pleadeth for our vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse: through whose stripes we are healed, &amp; through whose bloud <note place="margin">Esa. 53. 5.</note> wee may be bold to enter into the
<pb facs="tcp:17387:59"/>
holy place: with him the Lord is <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 19.</note> well pleased, in him the Sonnes of GOD are well accepted; and without him, wee are wholly reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
               <p>Therefore saith Saint <hi>Iohn, Blessed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>are the dead which die in the Lord:</hi> that is, in the faith of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus: for they shall rest from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <hi>and their workes shall followe them:</hi> that is, God accepteth of them, and their workes which are in the Lord, but none els. By this place our Papistes woulde prooue that our workes doe merite hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. But from hence wee may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more truely, that none haue a right faith in Christ, but those which haue good workes to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie them, when they dye in the Lord. But to gather heereupon, that they merite, wee cannot: for then they shoulde goe before our being in the Lord, and be a cause thereof: but nowe we see, that they
<pb facs="tcp:17387:59"/>
followe our being in the Lord. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the workes doe not beautifie the man in the Lord, but the man in the Lorde doth beautifie the workes, as the Temple sanctified <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 17. 19.</note> the golde that was vpon it, but was not sanctified by the golde: and as the Altar sanctified the offering that was vpon it, but was not sanctified by the offering. And this is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee hath done them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> they are done in the Lord by faith, (without which whatsoeuer is done, is sinne) and the Lord in him by his spirit, doth sanctifie them vnto himselfe.</p>
               <p>Last of all, the Argument doth not hold, our workes are rewarded; therfore they merite: for then none should be rewarded, but he that did merite first: then the seruant should be before the heire, because hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth more paines than the other doth, and yet the heire hath the land, because he was the sonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb facs="tcp:17387:60"/>
So, we are first borne the sons of God by faith in Christ, and so we are made fellow heires with him of <note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 12.</note> Heauen: and then followe good <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> works; not as a cause why we should haue th'inheritance, but as fruits fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing from a thankefull minde. But they of the popish Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no children, and doing nothing but of seruile feare, can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is good: for first, they faile in the matter of their good workes, putting in practise the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men in stead of Gods <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 9.</note> preceptes. Secondly, they faile in the maner of doing: for that which they doe, is done to a wrong end, and with a wrong affection: for it is too iustifie themselues thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Luke 18. 11.</note> God, as the Pharisie did: and therefore this white flagge of truce, <hi>My sonne,</hi> is not put out to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue broken the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of peace.</p>
               <p>Our Popish merit-mongers are
<pb facs="tcp:17387:60"/>
like the elders of the Iewes, which went to Christ in the behalfe of the Centurion, for his sicke seruaunt. They besought him instantly (as though they might not be denied) <note place="margin">Luk. 7. 4. 5.</note> and they tell him forsooth, that the Centurion is worthie of so much fauour, as that the Lord Iesus should come to him, and heale his seruant: for proofe whereof, they alleage two strong reasons, (like our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes) One is, He loueth our nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Another is, He hath built vs a synagogue: so plead our Papistes; we are worthy (O Lord) of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, we haue deserued so much at thy handes: or such a one that is nowe gone hath deserued so much, as that thou shouldest receiue his soule: for he loued vs well while he liued, hee was an honest man, hee made vs good cheere, hee kept a good house, hee filled our bellies, and our purses too. Besides that, he hath built vs a stately synagogue,
<pb facs="tcp:17387:61"/>
goodly Churches, and Chappels of ease, he mended our hie-waies, he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected such a Colledge, such a friery, and such a Nunrie. Againe, such a <note place="margin">K. Iohn. Prince of Orange. K. of France</note> man is a good Catholique, Lord: for he helped the Priest to say Masse, he gaue his consent to the poisoning of such a king, and the murthering of such another, hee did what hee could to dispatch all christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, because they are not of the Popes Religion, so zealous a catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique was he: But Lord he made a conscience of euery thing, he would not eate a bit of flesh, nor so much as an egge in Lent, or vpon a friday, he woulde neuer go out, before hee had crossed himselfe before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: his house was neuer without a Crucifix, nor his windowes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a picture of the Trinitie: a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of good workes more hee did, which the tally will not holde, and those are for his honest neighbors, which will giue any thing for them.
<pb facs="tcp:17387:61"/>
Therefore Lord thou must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie receiue his soule when hee is dead, or els thou doest him great wrong. And thus wee heare howe Papistes plead, like the elders of the Iews, for the Centurion and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes.</p>
               <p>But what saide the Centurion himselfe? O Lord (saith he) trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not thou thy selfe, for I am not worthy, that thou shouldest enter vnder my roofe: neyther did I thinke my selfe worthie to come vnto thee: but onely speake the worde, and my seruaunt shall bee <note place="margin">Luke 7. 6.</note> whole. And this message (saith the Euangelist) hee sent to Christ by his friendes, as if they which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his worthinesse and workes were his ennemies, and not hys friendes. But howe did the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus like of this message? Surely, he maruelled at such humilitie, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the faith of the Centurion, euen by the name of greatfaith, to
<pb facs="tcp:17387:62"/>
shew that merit-mongers haue no faith at all, except the Deuils faith.</p>
               <p>Now to end this pointe. If any man be the child of God in Christ, let him also become a new creature, and liue as becommeth the sonnes of God, let no man say, If I bee the child of God, I need not care what to doe, or (as the manner of many is) GOD is mercifull, and Christ died for our sinnes, what need we feare? for as there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ, so they which are in Christ liue, not after the flesh, but after the <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> spirite. On the other side, If thou feele thy self a new creatur in Christ, and transfourmed into the likenesse of the sonnes of God, then faint not vnder the crosse, for thy heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father will beare thee vp in his arms, plead not for thy selfe, by any thing that is in thy selfe, but appeale to the mercy of thy heauenly father, and say, Lord he whom thou louest
<pb facs="tcp:17387:62"/>

                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 3.</note> said to christ for their brother, Lord he whom thou louest is sicke. And claime the promise of God thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father in his sonne Christ, and then feare not thy sinnes <hi>My sonne,</hi> saith God, for I euen I, will do them <note place="margin">Esa. 48. 11.</note> all away, euen for my names sake, and for my sonnes sake, in whom thou art my sonne, and in whom I am well pleased.

               <p>When a lion roared vpon <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> the spirite of strength came vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Sampson,</hi> and he rent him in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <note place="margin">Iudg. 14. 6. 8. 9.</note> Not long after in the same Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he found a swarme of Bees with their stings, but therewithall he found a Hony-combe to feede vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So our sinnes and the Deuill roared vpon vs, and thought to haue deuoured vs. but our true <hi>Sampson</hi> Iesus Christ, hath torne
<pb facs="tcp:17387:63"/>
him in pieces, which went about like a roaring Lion, seeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure vs. Now if we looke into our owne heartes, (which are as a Lions den) we shall find (after this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) not a swarme of Bees, (as <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> did in the Bellie of the Lion) but a swarme of corruptions and sinnes with their stings, like prickes in our flesh to humble vs, but there withall <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. 7.</note> we shall find Honny to comfort vs, euen a rich Hony-combe of Gods mercies to feede vpon, if the spirite of faith and courage be in vs, as the spirite of strength and boldnesse was in <hi>Sampson,</hi> and then we may say plainly, as <hi>Sampson</hi> said in a riddle, <hi>Out of the eater came meate, and out of the strong came sweetnesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for what is stronger than a Lion, and what is sweeter than Hony. But we may say, <hi>What is stronger than sinne, and what is sweeter than mercy?</hi> What sight more terrible than the blacke flagge of defiance, with <hi>My Rebell,</hi> (the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
<pb facs="tcp:17387:63"/>
of vengeance vpon it?) What more comfortable than to see that pulled in, and the white flagge of truce put forth, with <hi>My sonne,</hi> the words of mercy and peace vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it? <hi>My Rebell</hi> is gone, <hi>My sonne</hi> is come in the steede. The Lord take away the Rebellions of our heartes, and graunt vs so to keepe his conditions of peace, that we may be his sonnes indeed, and find peace to our consciences for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Thus we see, that as the Lord did once bring light out of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so our heauenly father hath wrought comfort out of sinne to all his children in Christ Iesus, blessed <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 4.</note> be his name for euer. And thus much for these wordes <hi>My sonne,</hi> as proceeding from God to man.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>My sonne, as being the wordes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon considered.</head>
               <p>NOw if we consider them as they be the wordes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:17387:64"/>
more may be gathered from them, for as God was the Authour, so <hi>Salomon</hi> was the publisher, God is our father indeede, <hi>Salomon</hi> is but Gods minister, and speaks like a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to all, that of all he might win some, <hi>Salomon</hi> was a king, yet he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth counsell like a Preacher, and teacheth men how to order their liues according to the word of god, and therefore he calleth himselfe a Preacher. So should rulers and men in authoritie giue their inferiours <note place="margin">Eccle. 1. 1.</note> counsell like Preachers, and though they be not Preachers by office, yet by their graue counsell and holy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, they may and ought to be Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and so should all men be. But now if men speake like Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and can giue craftie counsell to serue all mens turnes, they are the men: but if any speake like a holy Christian, or like a diuine, or like a Preacher, he is acconted a Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, a foole, and called a Preacher
<pb facs="tcp:17387:64"/>
in derision, well, <hi>Salomon</hi> though he be a king, and no Preacher, yet he giueth the charge on the Iudgment seat like a diuine, and he counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth like a Preacher indeed, but he speaketh like a father, and from a fathers affection, with desire not to shew himselfe, but to profit his auditors and his readers, therefore see how he tempereth his counsels, and his doctrine, with wordes of loue, saying, <hi>My sonne,</hi> as if that were the onely way to win men to God. So when the Apostle would make <note place="margin">Gala. 4. 19.</note> the Galathians in loue with his doctrine, he calleth them his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yea, his litle children, this is to teach al teachers how to make their doctrine most profitable vnto their auditors, they haue put vpon them the persons of fathers, therefore with a fatherly affection they must teach the Lords people and humble them as children, especially weake ones, which are but comming on.
<pb facs="tcp:17387:65"/>
But those that are falling away and sinne of mallice and wilfullnesse, are to be handled after another maner, and therefore it is that <hi>Salomon</hi> in this booke hath so much adoe with fooles and scorners, though he speake to some as to babes, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And that kind of teaching, is of loue too, and from the spirite of God, yea when <hi>Paule</hi> ratled vp <hi>Elymas</hi> the sorserer, calling him a man full of subtiltie and mischeife, <note place="margin">Act. 13. 9. 10.</note> a child of the deuill, an enemie of all righteousnesse, and a peruerter of the straight waies of the Lord, it is said of him that he was full of the holy ghost. As this doth not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronise bitternesse of spirite, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely rayling in any: so it serueth to proue, that a minister of GOD may sometime (as occasion serueth) deale roundly in laying open of sin, and seuerely thunder the iudgment of God, neither can we without sinne charge him with railing or
<pb facs="tcp:17387:65"/>
malice, or choller (as the manner of some is) to charge the preachers of the word of God. <hi>My sonne,</hi> saith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon:</hi> to teach vs that wee must speake with a louing and kinde affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but not with a couetous and vainglorious affection, if euer wee will winne men to God: <hi>My sonne,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> to teach vs that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we teach doctrine, or correct maners, or reprooue sinne, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce iudgements, we should first see that there be that kinde affection in vs towardes the parties with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue to deale, which is in fathers towards their children: and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue will sweeten all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, and all our admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; make them in time go down into the stomack, if they were as bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as any pils, if men be not whollie giuen ouer of God. My brethren, (saith <hi>S. Paul)</hi> in all his Epistles: as if he made as much reckoning of them as of himselfe, and to shewe them
<pb facs="tcp:17387:66"/>
that he wished them to do nothing, but that hee himselfe woulde helpe them in it, and doe it with them. <hi>You haue manie instructors,</hi> and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 15. 16.</note> (saith the Apostle) but not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fathers, but in Christ Iesus I haue begotten you through the Gospell: wherefore I pray you be followers of me: to teach vs how to make the people become our followers: Oh the loue, the patience, the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the wisedome of a father, how great is it? or ought it to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his children? so great should be the loue, the patience, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and the wisedome of the minister of God: As <hi>S. Paul</hi> teacheth <hi>Timothie</hi> for want whereof much <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 11.</note> learning and eloquence is shewed: <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2, 24. 25.</note> many argumentes and aucthorities are spent, many admonitions and doctrines are deliuered both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely and priuately, by Ministers and Magistrates, and of all sorts, and little or no fruite come vp after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:17387:66"/>
the affection is not first sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the spirite of loue. This is also a lesson for vs, if we be houshol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or maisters of families, (for they must be preachers too in their families after a sort) if wee woulde haue our counsell and correction doe good, with those that are vnder our gouernment: let them see our tender affection, and a fathers loue both in our words and deedes.</p>
               <p>In the 7. of <hi>Luke</hi> it is said of the <note place="margin">Luke 7 8.</note> Centurion, that hee had many ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes vnder his aucthoritie, and they were all at his becke, most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to obey him in anie thing that he set them about: but how did hee bring them to any such good order? surely it is said that his seruants were deere vnto him: that is, hee made a speciall reckoning of them, and was a father vnto them. So let all mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, make a reckoning of their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: for if thy seruant can perceiue that he is deere vnto thee, thou shalt
<pb facs="tcp:17387:67"/>
in time worke him like wax to thine owne minde, except hee hath solde himselfe to worke wickednesse.</p>
               <p>If thou be a husband and wouldst win thy wife to God, or if thou be a wife, and wouldest winne thy hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to God, draw you on one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other with the sweet words of loue, speaking kindly one to another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause gentle wordes doe pacifie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as water quencheth fire. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <note place="margin">Pro. 15. 1.</note> what counsell the auncient counsellors of <hi>Salomon</hi> gaue vnto <hi>Rehoboam</hi> king of Israel, that hee <note place="margin">1. Kin. 12, 7.</note> might winne the heartes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: speake kindly vnto them, saide they, and they will serue thee for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer after. So, speake one to another in kinde wordes, and you will loue one another for euer after. Wordes spoken in season (saith <hi>Salomon)</hi> are <note place="margin">Pro. 25. 11.</note> like apples of gold with pictures of siluer: what wordes more seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than wordes of loue and kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? but wordes of despight and
<pb facs="tcp:17387:67"/>
reproch, are alwaies out of season, and shall neuer do good. Sometime one worde of kindenesse may giue grace vnto all the rest of the speech: and one worde of reproch and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight may spill all thy counsell, if it be neuer so graue, and godly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: for a little leauen sowreth the whole lumpe.</p>
               <p>This we see by daily experience, if a man say but (thou) to some one, he cannot beare it, doest (thou me) will hee say againe? An other againe will take some one worde more to heart, than all the rest: oh that same one word (will hee say) went to my verie heart. The Iewes which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Lord Iesus, woulde not vouchsafe to giue him his name, when they talked of him, or with him; but to shew their vtter dislike of him, they vsed to say, Is this he, or art thou hee that wilt doe such a thing, Is not this hee, whom they <note place="margin">Ioh. 7. 15. 35</note> go about to kill? They woulde not
<pb facs="tcp:17387:68"/>
say, Is not this Iesus Christ? or the sonne of God? Againe, whither will hee go that we shall not finde him? This is a most despightfull kinde of speaking, and doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray a bundance of malice, that is hidden in the heart. And is it not so betweene some Husbandes and Wiues, and their neighbours? they coulde speake one to another, but disdaine and anger will not suffer the one to affoord vnto the other their names and their titles, least they shoulde be put in minde of those dueties which these names require, whereout Sathan sucketh no small aduauntage; and these are like the spirituall Iewes. Whereas manie times the verie name of hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or wife, or brother, or sister, or neighbour, or sonne, or seruaunt, or maister, doth helpe not a little to persuade the minde, and to win the affection: yea the verie mentioning of those names doth oftentimes
<pb facs="tcp:17387:68"/>
leaue a print of duety behind in the conscience. Many think themselues sufficiently discharged if they speake the truth: It is no matter they thinke after what maner it be done; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to preuaile by boysterous terms, nicke-names, and wordes of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, but they are deceiued: for if termes of loue, and kindnesse will not preuaile, words of reproch and hatred, shall neuer preuaile, except it be to make thinges worse, and this will be the end of it, while they doe so vnkindly hunt one another, the diuell doth hunt them both, vntill both of them become a praie vnto the diuell, like men which make themselues a pray vnto the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, while they striue to eate vp one another at law.</p>
               <p>Now on the other side, if teachers must shew themselues like Fathers, then by the same lawe the people must shew themselues like children.
<pb facs="tcp:17387:69"/>
If the minister must for his parte seeke them with a fathers affection; then they for their parte must not be wanting with a sonnelike affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. His authoritie for God bindeth them to reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce him as the minist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, &amp; to obay him as if God himselfe did commaund them, for for they are embassadours for Christ or in Christs stead, and do entreate <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 20.</note> vs to be reconciled vnto God. And in the 2. Cor. 5. 20. the Apostle saith that God doth beseech vs through them: We must know then, when Gods minister in the excercise of his ministerie doth persuade, God doth persuade, when he doth threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vs, God doth threaten vs, when he doth promise vs any thing, God doth promise it, when he doth shew patience, it is Gods patience, if he doth forbeare thee, God doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare thee, and all this is done for thy good, therefore they that abuse the ministers patience, (as he is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister)
<pb facs="tcp:17387:69"/>
do abuse Gods patience, which God vseth towards vs for no other purpose, but to draw vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; which if we abuse to serue our own turn, we do but heape vnto our selues wrath, against the day of <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note> wrath.</p>
               <p>Your murmurings are not against vs (saith <hi>Moses)</hi> but against God. <note place="margin">Exod. 16. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>He that receiueth me,</hi> saith Christ, &amp;c. <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 40.</note> He that despiseth you, despiseth me.</p>
               <p>Therefore touch not mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed <note place="margin">1. Chr. 16. 22</note> (saith God) and do my Prophets no harme, because they <note place="margin">Psa. 105. 15.</note> are my Prophets, not to prophesie vnto me, but for me vnto you. Are we now at libertie (thinke we) to here them or not to heare them, at our pleasure? because some speake roughlye, and some smoothlye, may we now (without sinne) cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the preachers of the word, buy and sell them behinde their backes, or gibe and iest at them with our mouthes? may we descant and play
<pb facs="tcp:17387:70"/>
vpon their wordes (as the maner of some is) and escape in the end? may we ly in waite for them and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray them? may we smite them with our tongues, as the Iewes do smite <hi>Ieremie?</hi> may we thinke any thing, wel gotten that is gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from them? <note place="margin">2. Sam. 2. 26</note> Or may we make more account of any, yea of the oddest companion in the worlde, than of Gods minist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. May any thinke to doe this, and a great deale more, which is vsed in the world, and not to be called to account for it one day? Will there not be bitternes in the end? as <hi>Abner</hi> said to <hi>Ioab.</hi> But stay, thou art a father and hast children, and doest trye by all waies and meanes to do them good, what if thy child shuld mock thee or iest at thee, when thou doest speak in earnest to him for his good, wouldst thou be contented? what if he should turne his backe vpon thee in contempt and goe his way, when thou callest him? Or what if
<pb facs="tcp:17387:70"/>
he should turne againe and smite thee, when thou doest reproue him for his faulte? but what if he should betray thee into the handes of his enemies? wouldst not thou thinke thy cost well bestowed vpon him? wouldst thou take pleasure in such a monster? Nay, wouldst thou not wish rather that he had neuer seene the sunne? But if a child ought not so to handle his naturall parentes which haue begotten him, and brought him forth into the worlde, shall any man thinke it lawfull so to handle his spiritual father by whom he is begotten to God, and brought vp to the hope of life euerlasting.</p>
               <p>The eye (saith <hi>Salomon)</hi> that mocketh his father, &amp; despiseth the <note place="margin">Pro. 30. 17.</note> instruction of his mother, let the Rauens of the valley pickè it out and the young Eagles deuoure it. But the eye that mocketh the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of God his heauenly father, or despiseth the instruction of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:17387:71"/>
minister his spirituall father, let the Deuils of hel picke that out, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he repent let the infernall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits deuour it.</p>
               <p>But some will say, if he were lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as other men be, if he were of yeares and grauitie as some men be, if he were a good fellow as some men be, if he would flatter &amp; please as some men do, if he would preach seldome, as some men doe, if he were in place of authoritie as some men be, and did come with counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce and credite, as some men do, then would we heare him and reuerence him, and regard him, and maintaine him, as now we do not.</p>
               <p>Now imagin that thy child should make such an apoligie for himsefe, when he hath dishonored thee, and say, father do not meruaile, though I regard you not more than I do, for you are but a young man, you are but a plain man, you are but a poore man, you are but a simple man, and
<pb facs="tcp:17387:71"/>
haue no learning, I haue more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning than you, and can teach you, what though you giue me meate and drinke, &amp; apparell, what though you haue brought me vp to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet it is not in such plentifull and fine maner as some haue, nor you do not handle me so daintilie, nor make so much of me as some do vse their children, &amp;c. Therfore I care not for you, if you had these properties as you haue not, I would regard you as now I doe not. The application hereof I leaue to euery mans conscience, but this let euery one be assured of, that he which despiseth Gods minister, despiseth his father, and he that betrayeth Gods minister, that begat him to the faith, betrayeth his father. And will not God be auenged of such vnkindnes, yea the heauy iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God shall pursue such vnkinde and vnnaturall beasts, vntill they be rooted out of the earth, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial

If Preachers were lawyers, or Phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they should be often consulted with and in better sort than they be, or if Preachers were players, and their blacke gownes turned into blew coates with a badge on the sleeue, doubtles the chiefest of the towne would heare them, and they should lacke no audience, if we be sicke in body, send for this doctour, and that doctoure: both shall be heard without controllment, yea, and shall they not vse vs at their pleasure?

they shall order the matter as they list, but many mens soules are sicke to death, being ready to yeeld vp the Ghost, and to go to hell, but the phisitions of the soule, are seldome or neuer sent for, and euery one is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (for the most part) to appoint the preacher his text, how he shall ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle it for matter and maner, this was no fit text (saith one) this was ill hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and worse applied (saith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) why doth he not preach vpon the Epistle and the Gospell (saith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother) one saith, there he went besides his text, another saith, he stood too long, or hee spake plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, another saith, he hath a bad vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, and spits much, another saith, this is too high for me, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not vnderstand him, another saith, this is common stuffe, I knew this before, some say, what hath he to doe with Maiestrates, must he be medling with the Maiestrates office, some say, what neede he speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

images, what hurt do they, some say, he neuer speaks any Latin, I warrant you he is no scholler, and another is much troubled in his conscience, because the preacher hath gathered notes out of other mens workes, but if he hath any notes before him in his bookes, to helpe his memorie, Oh, that is a haynous matter, and then he is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into a deepe pit indeede, let him get out as well as he can, for poore <hi>Ioseph</hi> was neuer in such a pit as this is.

               <p>There is no question but that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things might be better handled than oftentimes they are. But for
<pb facs="tcp:17387:74"/>
the sinnes of the people it commeth to passe, that many times (if not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally) the Lord doth strengthen the meditations of the minister, he dulleth his wits, and maketh his tounge to cleaue fast to the roofe of his mouth, giuing no edge to his doctrine, no comfort to his studies, nor any blessing to his labours. But the cause hereof may be, and no doubt is partly in the speaker, and partly in the hearer, and want of prayer in both is the cause thereof, this knew the Apostle well inongh, and therefore he doth earnestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the Ephesians in al their praiers <note place="margin">Eph. 6. 18. 19</note> to pray for him, that the dore of vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance and boldnesse might be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vnto him.

What blessing can we hope for, when our sinnes doe call for a curse? What fruite can we looke for, when we sow among the thornes? What reformation can there be, where there is no resolution to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend? What feare of God, when we respect only a man? What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is there in heauenly thinges, when our minds are set vpon earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters? And finally, what peace can we possesse in our consciences, when our whole life is a warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God? as <hi>Iehu</hi> said to <hi>Iehoram,</hi> What peace canst thou looke for, <note place="margin">2.

when the whoredomes and witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craftes of thy mother <hi>Iezabell,</hi> are yet great in number? Therefore let vs wash and be cleane, that is, let vs repent and amend, and then let vs goe about the holy things of God.</p>
               <p>If we can not be so cleane as we should, (as <hi>Who can say his heart is</hi>
