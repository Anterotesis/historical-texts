         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I now deuide it twaine: my aunswer is, that to
glut men with delight, may make them surfeit, and so
in expecting thanks for my paynes, I should remaine
condemned by generall misliking. Beside, a Booke
growing too bigge in quantitie, is profitable neither
to the minde nor the pursse: for that men are now so
wise, and the world so hard, as they looue not to buie
pleasure at vnreasonable price. And yet the first parte
will entice them to haue the second, when (it may bee

occasions, and raise some benefit toward buying the

second parte. Againe, the other part will be new at the
comming forth, where now it wold be stale: for such
are affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s now a daies, that a booke a sennight olde,

Emperor succeeding <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
the founder of that aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
and famous Cittie, was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Remicius,</hi> who gouerned
so iustlie, and with such excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
honour: as not onelie his
Subiectes intirelie looued him,
but of the kingdoms about him he was so feared and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced,
that his Empire increased more large then in the
time of his Predecessors. This <hi>Remicius</hi> was of such a
princely and munificent minde, that no Knight whatsoeuer
<pb facs="tcp:1616:6"/>
came into his Court, without verie honourable receite and
bountifull rewardes: expressing the good nature of a vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Prince, whose déedes were helde of no small reckoning
amongst his verie enemies. He maried with the King of
<hi>Hungarias</hi> Daughter, a Princesse for witte and beautie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
with any of her time, which caused her to be so especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
loued of her Lord the Emperour, as hee altogeather
gaue ouer y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> exercise of Armes: notwithstanding, his Court
did not diminishe one lote of the former glorie for good and
hardle Knights, but dailie increased in such sort, as he tooke
great delight to haue yong Princes, Knights and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
nurtured and educated from their verie infancie in his
Pallace, especiallie after the Empresse had brought him a
Sonne, which was named <hi>Caniano,</hi> at whose birth was no
little reioycing through the whole Empire. Within two
yéeres after, she was likewise deliuered of a goodlie Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
named <hi>Griana,</hi> who growing to fourtéene yéeres of age,
was of such rare beautie and singuler good grace, as those
that behelde her, estéemed her for the chiefest péece of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manshippe
that euer nature framed.</p>
                     <p>Héereupon it chaunced, that <hi>Tarisius</hi> Sonne to the King
of <hi>Hungaria</hi> (who had béene brought vp in company with
the yonge Prince <hi>Caniano)</hi> fell into such amorous conceite
of the yong Princesse, as hee deuoted him selfe onelie to her
seruice, béeing vnable to conceale y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obiect of his affections,
but that time made her acquainted with the cause of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration.
Manie meanes he founde to entise her good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards him, but she carrying a religious zeale to loue in
some other climate, made no reckoning of his imporunate
and dilligent seruice, which drewe a Hell of tormentinge
thoughts vppon <hi>Tarisius,</hi> séeing his sute and seruice so dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
despised. Neuerthelesse, (to compasse his intent) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
his Cozin <hi>Caniano,</hi> to cause a Tryumphe bee publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
whereunto all Knights might be summoned, as well
straungers as others: not doubting but hee should spéede so
well in déedes of Armes, as thereby hee might deserue the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1616:6"/>
loue of the faire <hi>Griana,</hi> and so afterwardes make meanes
by the Empresse to demaunde her in mariage, all which hée
concealed from his Cozin <hi>Caniano:</hi> who verie gladlie didde
consent to what <hi>Tarisius</hi> had requested, watching oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
to finde the Emperour his Father at leysure, when
he made his highnesse acquainted with the whole enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
of himselfe and his Cozin <hi>Tarisius,</hi> desiring him that
all Knights might haue warning for preparation, against a
day the next Moneth appointed for the purpose. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
was verie well pleased with his Sonnes requeste,
accounting himselfe highlie honoured by his demaunde:
whereuppon he caused Heraulds of Armes presentlie to bée
dispatched, to signifie his intended Tournament through al
Countries farre and néere. In the meane while <hi>Tarisius</hi>
coulde not rest daie nor night, but still endeuoured to doo
what he iudged might please the Princesse <hi>Griana,</hi> to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as yet he had not vttered the effect of his longing desire, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
by exteriour actions he dailie made shewe sufficient of
his tormenting passions. But it so fell out not long after,
that one daie in her walking he had sorted her alone from al
the other Ladies &amp; Gentlewomen, in a place commodious
for a Louers discourses, where falling from one argument
to another, the furie of his oppressions imboldened him so
far, that at length he brake with her in manner folowing.</p>
                     <p>Madame, you are not ignoraunt of the honourable assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
that is appointed at the feaste ensuing, when I hope to
receiue the order of Knighthoode, and if it shall like you to
thinke so well of mee, as to graunt mee one request, easie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for you to affoorde me, perswade your selfe that I shal
imagine my fortune equall with the happiest Knights that
euer liued, in that it may be the onelie meane, whereby I
shall enioy the prize and honour of the Triumphe. <hi>Griana</hi>
knowing assuredlie that <hi>Tarisius</hi> bare her great affection,
as I haue before rehearsed, returned him this aunswere.
In sooth Cozin, it would please me meruailous well, to bee
the meane of so good fortune as you promise your selfe. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse,
<pb facs="tcp:1616:7"/>
I haue not learned so little modestie, as to grant
anie thing, before I knowe what is desired. When <hi>Tarisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
vnderstoode her modest excuse, he perswaded himself that
he should nowe obtaine that of her, whereof vntill that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
he had liued in despaire: whereuppon, the teares stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in his eyes, he began in this manner. I humblie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séech
you good Madame, to take in worth what I am to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with, for when I determined to smoother my
gréefe in secrete, the extremitie of my affection grew to such
a surplusage, as it brake the stringes of my thoughts almost
vowed for euer silent, to reueale that to you which my selfe
dare but reuerentlie thinke, such is my feare to displease
you: otherwise, I knowe no meane canne warrant me
from suddaine and cruell death, so setled is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vnspotted loue
I bare you, which when I striue to ouercome; and my selfe
also, the more I would decrease it, the more it augmenteth,
and that so strangelie, as while you are in presence, my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
forsaketh euerie part of mée, to liue in you onelie. For
which cause I haue determined (if you thinke it good) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
you of the Emperour your Father for my Wife, and
if he regarde me with so much honour: the Realme of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia</hi>
may well challenge, and my selfe likewise, the highest
roome in earthlie felicitie, hauing a Mistresse of such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
qualitie. In the meane time, if you please to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
on me anie Iewell or fauoure, commaunding mee to
weare it as your Knight and Seruaunt: you shall wel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
how aduenturous loue will be in defence of my right,
by the aduantage I shall recouer in the vertue of a gifte so
acceptable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Griana,</hi> who made but slender account of his passions,
and béeing not well pleased that he held her with such vaine
discourses: modestlie returned him this aunswere. If you
had such regarde of me as I well deserue, you woulde not
attempt me with spéeches so vnfitting my hearing: for if
your desire be such as you giue me to vnderstand, you ought
to make it knowne to the Emperor or Empresse, who haue
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1616:7"/>
greater authoritie ouer me then I haue my selfe. Therfore
I desire you hencefoorth not to aduenture the like on perill
of your life, otherwise I shall let you knowe howe highlie
you offend me: on which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent for this time
to pardon your want of discretion, in that I perceiue my
selfe to be the onelie cause thereof, in graunting you time
and leysure thus priuatlie to assaile me, for which ouersight
I repent mee at the verie harte. With which wordes shee
floong away and left him alone, declaring by her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
to be offended with his request, in that shee desired
rather to die then accept him for her Husband, or to allowe
him the name of her fréende. If then <hi>Tarisius</hi> was driuen
into a quandarie, wee néede not meruaile: wherefore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
as he was, and not caring greatlie whether hee went,
he entred the Empresse Chamber, where shee and her Son
<hi>Caniano</hi> stoode conferring togeather, without saluting the
one or other, he satte downe in a Chaire, and gaue such bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sighes, as the Empresse hearing, was somewhat moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
therewith, doubting he had either receiued some greate
iniurie, or els coulde not prouide himselfe so sufficientlie as
he would for the Triumphe, wherupon she left her Sonne,
and calling <hi>Tarisius</hi> aside, thus began with him. Nephewe,
I sée you verie melancholie, which makes me to iudge, that
you want some néedefull thing for the Tournament, which
my Sonne hath caused to be published. With which words
she beheld <hi>Tarisius</hi> more wishlie then she had doone before,
and perceiued the teares to trickle down his chéekes, which
made her more desirous to knowe the cause of his gréefe, but
his hart was so confounded and shut vppe in anguish, as hée
could not speake one word to her. Neuerthelesse, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
who loued him as her owne Sonne, founde so manie
meanes to perswade him, as in the ende he disclosed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue
he bare to <hi>Griana,</hi> and the aunswere likewise which shee
made him: whereby I am assured (quoth he) that nothing
but death can cease my torments. The Empresse (who of
her selfe did manie times determine to make that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age)
<pb facs="tcp:1616:8"/>
perceiuing nowe howe fitlie the occasion offred it selfe,
began to resolue on the consumation thereof: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
her Nephewe, in excusing the Princesse <hi>Griana,</hi> spake
as followeth. Doo you Nephewe mislike the aunswere of
my Daughter? beléeue me therein she didde but her dutie:
for she cannot dispose of her selfe béeing yong and vnder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule,
but the Emperour and I, whom you ought firste to
make acquainted with your request. But since I perceiue
how you are affected, I promise you I will confer with my
Lorde the Emperour, and hope to preuaile so well in the
cause, as you shall spéede of that you moste desire. As they
continued these discourses, they were giuen to vnderstande
by a Messenger, that the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> the Kinges son
of <hi>Macedon</hi> was newlie arriued, with a braue companie
of Knights. But his comming to the Emperour was not
as his vassaile or Subiect, because the kingdome of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
was at that time no way beholding to the Empire, but
onelie to sée the faire yong Princesse <hi>Griana,</hi> the renowne
of whose beautie and vertues had so peirced his thoughtes,
as before he sawe her, he loued and honoured her, so that for
this cause onlie he iournied to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he was
verie honourablie entertained bothe of the Emperour and
his Sonne <hi>Caniano</hi> as also of the Empresse and faire <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi>
who oftentimes hearde him reckoned and estéemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the most honourable and gracious Princes, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

would gladlie it should sorte to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte,
as commonlie Women are
couetous of their owne desires, therefore no meruaile if shée

alone with the Emperour, and smoothlie couering the baite

graunt her one request, whereof shee woulde not willinglie
be denied. The Emperour neuer before hearing her so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate,

But for <hi>Griana,</hi> her affection was els where, for she bare a

in sorting vs so commodiouslie togeather, that I may shewe

I sweare to you vpon my knightlie faith, that your gracious

which among the infinite number of your princelie

In bréefe, it is the Princesse <hi>Griana</hi> your Daughter, whose

or that I haue enterprised it, without the good liking of the

and the hope of yours during my aboade héere, hath taughte

me to place my loue with discretion, and continue it wyth

Right déerelie did the Emperour loue the Prince <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi>
as had he béene his owne Sonne <hi>Caniano,</hi> his knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
valour and manifold other vertues iustlie inducing hym

if his promise made vnto <hi>Tarisius</hi> did not binde him to the

me good Cozin, I am not a little agréeued that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
satis-fie your gentle request, for that <hi>Tarisius</hi> Nephewe

I past my promise for my Daughter, and dailie I expect the
Ambassadours comming from <hi>Hungaria</hi> to finishe the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
so that I had rather loose the best of my Citties, then it
should be said I falsified my worde. Notwithstanding, of one
thing I can assure you, that you are far higher in my grace
and fauour then he: yet necessitie is without lawe, and the

                     <p>Greatlie abashed was the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> séeing in

his life since his comming to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> and so nypt
in the heade was he with the Emperours answere, as hee
stoode a good while in a studie not speaking a worde, at last
he began thus. God forbidde that so great a Prince shoulde
breake his promise by my occasion: neuerthelesse, my truth
and loyaltie to your highnesse shall not any way diminishe,
but I shall remaine the most forward in duetie, of any that
owe seruice and alleageaunce to your Maiestie. Neyther
will I (sayd the Emperour) imagine the worse of you, but
loue you rather better then I did before. Then entered di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Noble men and Gentlemen, which made them breake

off from further spéeches, and <hi>Florendos</hi> taking his leaue,
went to his Chamber, so full of gréefe and extreame heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
as easilie he could haue béene induced to commit some

                        <hi>Tarisius,</hi> had I made tryal of this inconuenience before,

as no enemie whatsoeuer would wish to another. But

to die for her loue I shall account my selfe

knewe with what content I take my destenie: but fayre
<hi>Griana,</hi> would God I had either not séene thée at al, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had béene fauourable to me in choise. At which words
the extremitie of his passions tooke away the libertie of his
spéeche, so that he could not finish what hee woulde gladlie
haue spoken, but falling from his bedde to the grounde in a
swoune, amazed one of his Esquires that was in the nexte
Chamber, who hearing the fall, ran in immediatlie, where
séeing his Maister lying deade [in his iudgement] ran and
called <hi>Frenato,</hi> who was Cozin to <hi>Florendos,</hi> and one that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1616:14"/>
knewe most of his priuate affayres, notwithstanding, hee
was ignorant in the cause of this accident, who taking him
vppe in his armes, with colde water and vinagre caste in

opening his eyes, and séeing his Cozin so busie about
him, breathing foorth two or thrée bitter sighes, saide. My
déere fréende and Cozin, I beséeche you hinder not the ende
and issue of my life, for béeing out of all hope to recouer my
Ladie <hi>Griana,</hi> there is no meane left to maintaine my life.
When <hi>Frenato</hi> heard these wordes, hee doubted that the
Prince had receiued some contrarie aunswere from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
as concerning the marriage betwéene him and his
Daughter, for whose loue onelie hee left the kingdome of
<hi>Macedon:</hi> wherfore, he perceiuing that she must bee the
onelie meane to ease his torment, hee began thus roundlie
to aunswere the Prince. And what of this? must you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dispaire? Alas (said <hi>Florendos,)</hi> what would yee haue
me doo? the Emperour hath long since past his promise for
her to <hi>Tarisius,</hi> as his highnes assured me by his own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
Uerie well Sir (answered <hi>Frenato)</hi> but doo you know
if she haue giuen her consent? I promise you I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that she loues him not, but that her fauourable regarde
is much more towardes you then him: and for you saye so
much, to morrow will I sounde the bottome of this matter,
so that (if I can) I will frustrate the Emperours intent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<hi>Tarisius.</hi> Doo you in the meane time but learne to
dissemble your gréefe, and shewe not your selfe <hi>mal content</hi>
for anie thing that hath béene saide: but bee of good chéere,
and referre your fortune in this case to the successe of myne
endeuours. These and such like perswasions <hi>Frenato</hi> vsed
to the Prince, whom he thus left in his Chamber, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the Pallace as was his manner. All this while
the Emperour bethought himselfe, on the spéeches that had
passed betwéene him and <hi>Florendos,</hi> which made him the
night following, to discourse theron with the Empresse, per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swading
her, that hee coulde more willinglie accept of hym
<pb facs="tcp:1616:15"/>
for his Sonne then <hi>Tarisius.</hi> But she who highlie fauoured
her Nephewe, reprooued his opinion with manie answers,
so that by importunate intreaties, teares, and other subtill
fetches, which Women are wont to vse to accomplish theyr
desires, she so farre disswaded the Emperour, as hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
her againe not to giue her to anie other, then to him to
whom he first past his worde. Of which wordes the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

deuised, by what meanes she might fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time forward
so much as in her laie, hinder <hi>Florendos</hi> from speaking
to her Daughter: whereupon, she dailie kept the Chamber
of presence, and helde a more strickt looke on <hi>Griana</hi> then
before shee had doone, which greatlie increased the passions
of <hi>Florendos,</hi> and brought him into so weake estate, as the
learned Phisitions coulde not deliuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of his sicknes,
to the no small gréefe of the Emperour, but especiallie of

be that anie liuing creature, can
deserue so gréeuous punishment

<pb facs="tcp:1616:16"/>
her Damoselles, the Daughter of her Nurse named <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
whom aboue the rest she trusted most, and to her she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in manner following. <hi>Cardina,</hi> thou knowest the loue
I alwaies bare thy Mother, and for her sake howe well I
haue thought of thée, I haue knowne thée long time a true
and faithfull Seruaunt: but nowe <hi>Cardina</hi> is a time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde
all other, to make tryall of thy truth, and to witnesse
thy loyaltie to me, onelie as thou art sure, so to bee secrete,
and so secrete as I must put my life and honour into thy se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie.
<hi>Cardina,</hi> who was wise, and of good gouernement,
hearing <hi>Griana</hi> vse such earnest spéeches: imagined that
she would commit no commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> matter to her trust with such
coniuration, whereuppon she modestlie returned thys aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.
Madame, rather had I be torne péecemeale in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then anie thing you commaunde for secrete, shoulde by
me be reuealed without your licence: and so assure your
selfe, that while I liue, you shall finde mee as faithfull in

Princesse) had other opinion of thée, listen nowe therefore
what I shall commaunde thée. I haue vnderstoode for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<hi>Cardina,</hi> that the gréeuous sicknes of the Prince <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos,</hi>
is caused by verie earnest loue which hee beares to
me, &amp; for I account it great pittie to loose so good a Knight,
doo so much as take the paines to goe to him from me: and
saie I desire him to bee of good chéere, and if there bee any
thing in my power may doo him good, I will gladlie accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
it, as she that loues him as her own selfe, and to assure
him thereof, saie I sende him this Ring, which I wyll him
to kéepe as a pledge of my loue. Madame (answered <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na)</hi>
Fortune spéede me so well, as my paines may giue ease
to both your passions: and might my sentence like you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
I knowe no Knight so worthy your loue as <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos.</hi>
Goe then (sayd <hi>Griana)</hi> and returne againe so soone as
thou canst. So went <hi>Cardina</hi> straite to the lodging of the
Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> at the entraunce whereof, shee met the
Prince <hi>Caniano</hi> so heauie and pensiue as might be, because
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1616:16"/>
he perceiued his Fréend to consume awaie euerie day more

stept aside, and would not be séene of <hi>Caniano:</hi> who beeing
gone, shee went vp to the Chamber, where when shee was
readie to enter, she hearde the Prince co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine in this sort.
Ah poore wretch, must thou néedes die without anie hope
of remedie? And as he would haue procéeded on, <hi>Cardina</hi>
stepped to him, and after she had saluted him, said to him se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretelie,
that the Princesse <hi>Griana</hi> had sent her to him, to
vnderstand of his health, and beléeue me good Prince (quoth
she) I neuer sawe Ladie so sorrowfull for your sicknes, as
she is. She commendeth her selfe to your honour most har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilie,
and hath sent you this Ring, as an earnest of the looue
she beares you, desiring you to bee of good chéere and comfort
your selfe, because she desires to sée you, to confer with you
of matters that concerne you bothe néerelie. These wordes
so rauished the spirit of <hi>Florendos,</hi> as a good while he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
whether he dreamed, or that hee might giue credite to
what he hearde: for albeit he knewe the messenger so well
as anie in the Courte, yet coulde he not perswade himselfe
that hee was so fortunate. At length (betwéene hope and
dispayre) he tooke the Ring, which he entertained with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
deuoute kysses, and embracing <hi>Cardina</hi> so well as hee
coulde, thus answered. Alas my swéete fréende, may it bee
possible that my Ladie hath such regard of him, who neuer
was able to doo her anie seruice? Doubt not thereof my
Lorde (aunswered <hi>Cardina)</hi> and if you will declare your
loue answerable to hers in vertue, you must giue testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
thereof by comforting your person, that she may sée you
so soone as may be. Ah fayre Uirgin (quoth he) let my whole

Fayre Sister, at this time when you ought to shewe the

to be merrie, séeing the Emperour my Father hath pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uided

<hi>Tarisius,</hi> who I am sure loues you as his owne life. Ah bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(quoth she) I knowe not what should mooue him so to
doo, séeing I neuer thought so well of him: and more gladlie
could I entertaine mine owne death, then bee constrained
to loue where I cannot. These words did <hi>Tarisius</hi> easily vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstand,
notwithstanding he made shewe as though he did
not: but going to the Empresse he desired her to stay there
with the Emperour, séeing the Ambassadours were come
<pb facs="tcp:1616:20"/>
from the King his Father, that what was begun as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him and <hi>Griana,</hi> might nowe be finished according to
her promise. Uppon this occasion, the Empresse called
<hi>Griana</hi> aside, and with smoothe and swéete spéeches began
to breake with her, howe for her good shee had induced the
Emperour, to giue her in marriage to her Cozin <hi>Tarisius,</hi>

then considering with her selfe, how she shoulde be enforced

and her Sister taking her vp in their armes, conueyed
her into her Chamber, and soone after into her bed, when

their Pages stayed with their Horses, wheron they moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1616:21"/>
leaue her whom he loued so déerely, for being out of all hope
to sée her againe, he estéemed his life of no value or account.
In which impatience, he rent his comelie locks of haire, and
haled his flesh with great violence, whereuppon <hi>Frenato</hi>
thus spake to him. Why howe nowe my Lorde? wyll you
in séeking honour wound your selfe with shame, or in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to loose your selfe, and her also for euer? Beléeue me Cozin,
this verie hardlie beséemes you, that the subtill dealing of a

No no good Cozin, it is now no time to declare these shewes
let vs therefore make spéede to our companie, and if you
thinke good, we will sende one secretlie backe to the Cittie,

cannot comprehende my torments, thinke you it is possible
for me to liue, leauing that rare creature in such perrill, for
whose loue a Hell of gréefes hath martired my soule? By
my knightlie faith I sweare, that death is a thousand times
more welcome to me, then to be maistered by this one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that I shold liue an hower out of her gracious seruice.
Well well Sir (sayd <hi>Frenato)</hi> what you may not doo now,

<hi>Florendos</hi> perceiuing his Cozin did aduise him for the

spurres to their Horses, stayed not till they ouertooke y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rest

arme themselues to helpe <hi>Tarisius:</hi> for by this time hadde
the two Knights which escaped, aduertised in the Courte,
that they tooke <hi>Florendos</hi> as he was climbing the Garden
wall, to goe to dishonour the Princesse <hi>Griana.</hi> At which
report the Emperour was so mooued, as he went in greate
furie to his Daughters Chamber, whom he founde in her
bed, more likelie to die then liue: but necessitie (whereof
manie doo often make a vertue) made her couer her weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
with a faire shewe of courage, so that when she see him
enter, shee wrapped her selfe in her might Mantle, &amp; came
before him, to whom hee beganne in this furious manner.
Thou leude Gyrle, darest thou conceiue the thought to doo
mee this dishonour? by my Crowne for this thy presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I shall make thée such an example to all other, as thy
heade from thy shoulders will scant quite thy fault. <hi>Gria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
hearing him speake so roughlie, answered him againe
thus mildlie. My Lord and Father, I beséeche you to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me, you accuse me, and I know not whereof: if I haue
doone euil, it is in you to chastise me as you shal please, and
if I be innocent, vouchsafe good Father not to condemne
mee. Ah varlet (quoth hee) this excuse shall little profite
thée. So taking her verie rudelie, he locked her in a strong
Tower, whereof he carried the Keye himselfe: then went
he to <hi>Tarisius</hi> his lodging to sée how he did, for it was told
him that he was in daunger of his life, where he found the
Empresse heauilie wéeping, but he caused her to goe to her
Chamber, and commaunded his Chirurgions to looke dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentlie
to his Nephewe, and not to spare any cost to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
his health. Nowe because they which searched for
<hi>Florendos,</hi> could not finde him, the bruite and rumor was
qualified, and the Emperour went againe to his Chamber
till the morning, when the Empresse hearing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was in prison, tooke it verie heauilie, and knéeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before
the Emperour, desired him that she might fetch her
foorth: but he was so angrie, as her wordes coulde doo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with him, yet he graunted that shee shoulde goe see

her, and tooke her the Key, when she entering the Tower,
founde her sitting on the ground so blubred with teares, as
was lamentable to beholde, but when she behelde her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
she arose, and dooing her reuerence, coulde not speake
her teares so ouercame her. The Empresse that loued her
déerelie, séeing her in this gréeuous estate, had much a doo

which ill agrées with your credite and calling) haue
rather thought best, to grant <hi>Florendos</hi> enterance by your
Garden, at such a suspected howre, as while you liue, your
honour will be hardlie thought on: for two of <hi>Tarisius</hi> his
Knights, who thought to take the Traytour, are slaine,
and my Nephew himselfe daungerouslie escaped. <hi>Griana</hi>
hearing him called Traitour whom shee so highlie looued,
and that shee herselfe was accused, by that which ought to
excuse her, answered. Madame, and my gracious Mother,
as yet I am ignoraunt of the cause, that hath mooued the

to spende the remainder of my following daies thus

Daughter (said the Empresse) doo not discomfort your selfe
in this sort, the Emperour had some reason (in regarde of
the loue he beares you, and the outragious tumult which
happened) to doo as he hath doone: but I hope in the end all
will sort to the best, and that you your selfe shall remaine
contented. Manie other spéeches passed betwéene them, till
at length y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empresse left her and departed, for she thought
long till she was with the Emperour, to let him know the
talke betwéene her and <hi>Griana:</hi> which shee didde without
omitting anie thing, notwithstanding hee was more seuere
to his Daughter euerie daie after. Then sent hee for the
Ambassadours, and thus he began with them. My Lordes,
at this time I am aduised, that you shall returne to your
King my Brother, for in respect of the accidents which you
haue séene to happen: I will craue pardon for this tyme,
referring matters ouer till some other time, when thinges

vnhappie houre, that without desert you must indure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment
for me? What satis-faction maie your <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi>
liue to make, in requitall of this iniurie? When didde
you euer merit to be so hardlie intreated for him? Beléeue
me, coulde you bee discharged so soone as I coulde wyshe it,
bolts, locks nor walles coulde holde you a thought whyle,
yet wyshing is no action, euerie thing is contrarie to me, al
helpes refuse me, and death likewise denies me: but by my
sworde (and therewith he started vp) in spight of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
I will deliuer you. <hi>Frenato</hi> séeing him rise in such a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
came and tooke him by the arme, demaunding what he
would haue. Death (quoth he) if I could, for it gréeues mee
to liue anie longer. You speake verie wiselie (quoth hée in
mockage) is all this for the imprisonment of <hi>Griana?</hi> is it
not better she should be there, then in the custodie of <hi>Tari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius?</hi>
her captiuitie you know cannot long endure, but were
she married she could neuer be recouered. Therefore let
good hope perswade you, and now send an other Messenger
with spéede to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to know what accidents haue
happened since, and to practise the meane to speake with
<hi>Cardina,</hi> who will certifie you from <hi>Griana,</hi> what is or
may be doone in these affayres. This counsell liked well
<hi>Florendos,</hi> whereuppon he presentlie dispatched a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of trust, who with all dilligence did execute the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
of his Maister, for in good time he arriued at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
when <hi>Griana</hi> had libertie to speake with her
Gentlewomen: which when he hearde, he was not a little
glad, whereupon he searched earnestlie till he hadde founde
<hi>Cardina,</hi> to whom he deliuered his Maisters minde, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1616:24"/>
in what sad and heauie plight he left him, desiring her
with all spéede to certifie the Princesse thereof, and what
seruice she would commaunde him to his Maister. <hi>Cardina</hi>
knowing how glad the Princesse would bee, to heare these
tidings from <hi>Florendos,</hi> went to séeke her Sister <hi>Lerina,</hi> to
whom she imparted what you haue heard, and she well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
of the time and place, discoursed the same to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
vnséene, and not suspected of old <hi>Tolomestra.</hi> How ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
she was of this message, I cannot vtter, nor you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
but shee was resolued, neuer to haue any Husbande
but <hi>Florendos,</hi> and therefore to comfort him, she deuised to
write to him that he might hope as wel as she did: but wel
she knewe not how to accomplish her intent, by reason shée
wanted pen, inke and paper, and she was forbidden to haue
anie. Notwithstanding, she so well pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>swaded her woman
<hi>Tolomestra,</hi> as (feigning to wryte to the Emperour her
Father) she recouered the meane to execute her desire. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
withdrawing her selfe apart, first she wrote a Letter to the
Emperour, and afterwards one to <hi>Florendos,</hi> wherein she
desired him not to be offended, albeit things fell out not to
his lyking: for (with the fauour of Fortune) the end would
be as pleasant to him, as the beginning had béene vnhappie
to them bothe, withal, that as he desired to prolong her life,
he shoulde doo nothing to the preiudice of his owne person.
These two Letters thus written &amp; sealed, she called <hi>Tolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestra,</hi>
and gaue her that she had written to the Emperor,
desiring her to carrie it presentlie to his Maiestie, by whose
departing, she had opportunitie to conferre with <hi>Lerina:</hi> in
bréefe she desired her to goe séeke the Esquire, that he might
returne to his Maister with the Letter she sent him, which
she did effectuallie, and the gentle Esquire made no little
hast to his Maister. Who receiuing the Letter from hys
Mistresse <hi>Griana,</hi> was not content alone to read it, but kist

sending <hi>Tolomestra</hi> backe with this aunswere. Say
to <hi>Griana,</hi> that séeing she was so aduenturous to incur my

neuer looke on her while I liue, if she match not with <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risius</hi>

which she with all her hart desired, yet doo what iniurie to

drewe verie néere at hand, when the Emperour (by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

sée her, bringing with him the Prince <hi>Tarisius:</hi> who bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus entred y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Towre, they founde her in such gréeuous

had against her, it mooued the teares to stande in his eyes,
which he shaddowed so well as he coulde, framing his spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to her in this sort. Well Daughter, it likes you to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

me, in that which concernes your honour and profit,

me, for wilt thou or not (before I leaue thée) I wil giue
thée to him whome I haue promised. Then taking her by

I giue thée heere <hi>Griana,</hi> from henceforth account of
her as thy Wife: and holde thée, héere is the Key of the
Tower, kéepe her in thine owne custodie, and héereafter
thinke of her as thou findest occasion. Well sawe <hi>Griana</hi>
that perforce she must obey her Fathers will: wherefore
with great wisedome couering her secrete thoughts, with
extreame teares deliuered this aunswere. Alas my good
Lord and Father, I neuer thought y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> your highnesse would

                        <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risius</hi>

me most in opinion is, that our néere alliaunce in kindred,
is sufficient to continue the loue betwéene the King his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and you, without anie such néedelesse séeking of newe
vniting. And moreouer good Father, his education in your
Court with my Brother <hi>Caniano</hi> and me, since our verie
<pb facs="tcp:1616:26"/>
yongest yéeres to this present, hath béene of such equall and
familiar condition: as it séemes to mee impossible to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
him with that intire duetie, which women must and
ought vse to their Husbands. Wherfore my good Lord and
Father, I perswade my selfe (vnder your correction) that
you should support me in this iust request: the rather in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of my present estate, which may induce you somwhat
to conceiue: that the obsequies of my buriall is more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to be solemnized, then those holie ceremonies y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> shoulde
be vsed at my marriage. And with these words she powred
foorth such aboundance of teares, as the Emperour knewe
not what to answere: but ouercome with pittie withdrew
himselfe, leauing <hi>Tarisius</hi> with her, who hoping to haue
better words of her, said. Madame, I beseeche you not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
your selfe, for anie thing the Emperour hath saide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
me, for I wil not anie thing to your discontent, and
rather would I suffer all my life, then cause the least doubt
to encurre your dislike: hoping y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in time to come you wyll
take such pittie on mee, as béeing perswaded of the loue I
heare you, and the reuerend desire I haue to doo you seruice
you will graunt that with good will, which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
striues to gaine perforce, assuring you y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nothing can
be more gréeuous to mee, then the harde dealing which he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
hath béene vsed towards you. And to the ende you
may resolue your selfe of that I say, your Father hauing
deliuered me the Keye of your prison, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> guarde of your
personne, I here commit bothe to your gentle pleasure. So
kissing the Keie, he laid it by her, and without expecting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
aunswere, with great reuerence hee departed, leauing
her with <hi>Tolomestra,</hi> so rapt into a slumber or traunce, as
her Kéeper would not for pittie trouble her. The Princesse
in this silent passion, thought that shee sawe a fierce Lyon
before her, with open throate readie to deuoure her, and
néere at hand she espied an armed Knight, to whom shee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
for her defence, crying, that for Gods sake he would
shéeld her from the beast, but the Knight with stearne and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1616:26"/>
angrie countenaunce thus answered. I wil not defend thée,
but with my Sword will take thy life from thée. Thou hast
so much offended the heauenlie powers in disobedience to
thy Father, as I ought rather to deuide thy head from thy
shoulders, then to hinder this beaste from deuouring thee.
Thinkest thou to contrarie their diuine pleasures? Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

thée, and shroude thy shame, in regard of the fruite in

héereafter. If y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> dooest not, thou diest an euerlasting death,
from which thou canst haue no meane to defende thée. The
Knight did so affright <hi>Griana,</hi> as she promised him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
the Emperours commaundement without fayle:
whereupon the Knight and the Lyon vanished awaie, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
her (as she thought) by a fayre Fountaine, enuironed
with Trées and diuersitie of flowers, the swéete sent wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was so pleasaunt and odori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>erous, as made the chéereful
bloode to reuiue againe in the Princesse, and with brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
foorth a vehement sigh, she awaked, inuocating on
the powers to pardon her transgressions, and promising to
obey the wyll of her Father, albeit she could hardlie forget
<hi>Florendos</hi> so soone. Within two or thrée daies after, the
Prince <hi>Tarisius</hi> came to visite her, to whom she shewed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
countenaunce then she had doone, and as they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uising
togeather in amorous talk, she said. Beléeue me Syr
<hi>Tarisius,</hi> you haue vsed such honest and gentle courtesie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
mee, as hencefoorth I giue my selfe wholie yours:
therefore béeing sorrie for my long disobedience to my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and you, tryumphe nowe <hi>Tarisius</hi> in the honor of my
loue. If these wordes pleased <hi>Tarisius,</hi> it is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for ioy whereof hee went presentlie to the Emperour,
and made him acquainted with these happie tydinges: so
that (to make short) after manie promises and solemne
oathes to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Princesse, not onelie to accept her as his spouse
and wife, but as his soueraigne Ladie and Mistresse, hee
broughte her with him to the Emperour, who hearing
<pb facs="tcp:1616:27"/>
the resolution of his Daughter, embraced her, and tooke
her into as good conceite as euer he did.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding, <hi>Tolomestra</hi> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to attend
on her still, wherefore <hi>Griana</hi> knewing her time to drawe
néere, and hardlie could she conceale her fortune: after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
difficult doubts and feares debated in her thoughts, at
last she imparted the whole to <hi>Tolomestra.</hi> The olde Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman
after manie motherlie rebukes, for the fault co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
as the daunger imminent, thought better yet to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
this misaduenture, then to publish that which woulde
displease manie, and profite none: so leauing to reprehende,
when care and comfort was more required, at that instant
the Princesse was deliuered of a goodlie man childe. Thus
in the ninth Moneth, after the returne of <hi>Florendos</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Macedon,</hi> on Mondaie at night about eight of the
clocke, the Princesse had her howre of deliueraunce: when
<hi>Tolomestra</hi> receiuing the Childe, sawe it so beautifull and
wel fourmed, as it gréeued her meruailouslie, to think what
hard fortune it brought with the birth. For the honour of
the Mother could not bee defended, but by the price of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
life: wherefore hauing wrapped it in swadling clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
which the Princesse had prepared of some valew, shee
brought it to the sorrowfull Mother, saying. Trust mee
Madame, it much displeaseth me that wee must thus loose
this louelie childe, whom I could haue estéemed happy, and
the Mother likewise, if it might liue without displeasure:
but he swéete babe must suffer the punishment for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
whereof he is not anie way culpable. Alas (saide the
Princesse) what shall we doo? would God it weare deade, or
out of daunger: then taking it in her armes, and washing
his face with flooddes of teares, after manie swéete kisses,
thus said. Ah my little deintie, and must I néedes leaue
thée? must the safetie of thy life remaine in the mercie of a
straunge Womanne, who not knowing thy Parents, may
deale with thée discourteouslie? well, if thou die, thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will not be long after thée. And as shee thus mourned
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1616:27"/>
ouer her infant, shee perceiued on his right chéeke a lyttle
marke in likenesse of a Crosse: which made her call her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to remembraunce, and the words of the Knight, that
promised good fortune to the Childe, which made her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
a comfortable hope, whereupon, about his necke shee
tyed a fayre Crucifixe of golde. Nowe was the night verie
farre spent, and <hi>Tolomestra</hi> feared they shoulde be preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
wherfore (quoth she) Madame it is time to determine
of some thing, leaue muzing I pray you anie longer on the
Childe, and let me goe carrie it to <hi>Cardina</hi> to be borne forth
of the Court. The wéeping Mother séeing shee councelled
for the best, for her last adiewe sealed manie swéete kisses
on the face of the infant, and so in great gréefe deliuered it
to <hi>Tolomestra,</hi> who went and found <hi>Cardina,</hi> to whom she
gaue it: and she without anie tariance mounted on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
&amp; not knowing what way shee tooke, rode on which
way Fortune guided her. Uerie doubtfull was she howe to
be discharged of her carriage, for she feared to let any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in the neighbour Uillages haue it, least so the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
might be discouered: for that it was commonlie blazed
through the Empire, that the Princesse was imprisoned
for the loue of <hi>Florendos.</hi> At length the daie began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
when she perceiued herselfe on a high Mountaine,
which was verie thicke sette with Palme and Oliue trées:
then she alighted from her Horse, and made a little bed of
sweete Hearbes, wherein she layd the Childe, hoping some
body would passe by that would take compassion on it. So
committing the tender infant to the protection of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
she returned to the Cittie in very good time.</p>

it so louinglie, as euery one thought it to bee <hi>Gerrards</hi>

it so among the Palme trees, hee caused the Childe to bee

dauncing, and other delights, the woeful Princesse thought
on the great iniurie she had doone to <hi>Florendos,</hi> accounting
herselfe the most vnhappy on the earth, and to herselfe thus
sorrowed. Ah my deere freende, what wylt thou say when
thou hearest these tydinges, that I am become so false and
disloyall to thee? what excuse may pleade for me to thée? by
good reason may I for euer bee excluded from theyr compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
who haue kept their fayth inuiolable to their freendes,
and continue in profession of their vnchangable affections,
for neuer did Woman commit such treason as this that I
haue doone: and yet (my Lord) altogeather against my wil,
as my wofull hart may giue euident witnesse, which shalbe
thine while it remaines in thys miserable bodie, which
<hi>Tarisius</hi> must nowe haue, though in iustice it be thine. And
in thys sort continued her dolorous complaints til night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched,
when she must yeeld that honor to <hi>Tarisius,</hi> which
with better wyll she could haue affoorded <hi>Florendos.</hi>

her Father caused her to be so honourablie conuaied, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séemed

taking her leaue among the Ladies, the Empresse came to

<hi>Palmerin</hi> thus leauing <hi>Dyofena,</hi> chanced to find
his Mother <hi>Marcella</hi> alone, to whom he said. Mother, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séeche
you graunt me one request that I shall demaunde of
you. That will I my Sonne (quoth she) if it be in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to doo. Understand then good Mother (quoth he) that I
haue oftentimes dreamed how I am not your Son, so that
I knowe not what to saie, vnlesse you please to assure mee
better. When <hi>Marcella</hi> heard these wordes, she was stroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in a studie: but <hi>Palmerin</hi> was still so importunate, as
at last she thus answered. In good faith (faire Freende) I

thee as if thou wert mine owne Sonne: and so what
words <hi>Dyofena</hi> had before reported, <hi>Marcella</hi> confirmed,
taking him with her into her Chamber, where she shewed
him the costlie swadling clothes that he was founde in, and
the Crucifire likewise that hung about his necke, which he
intreated her to bestow on him, to the ende (quoth he) that
for your sake I may kéepe it while I liue. <hi>Marcella</hi> woulde
not denie his request, but put it about his necke herselfe.
From which time forwarde, <hi>Palmerin</hi> shewed himselfe of
more cheereful disposition, deuising how he might compasse
the meane to goe seeke his fortune, wherto his sundry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions
had so often incited him. And as none can shunne
what is ordeined him by diuine prouidence, not manye
daies after, as he was walking alone vppon the Mountain,
he heard a voice cry verie pittifullie for helpe and succour:
whereuppon <hi>Palmerin</hi> ranne that waie which hee hearde
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1616:33"/>
the voice, where hee behelde a Lyon gréedilie deuouring a
Horse, and <hi>Palmerin</hi> hauing no weapon to defend himselfe
withall but a staffe, verie hardilie sette vpon the beast, gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
him such a stroake betwéene the eyes, as he fell down
dead to the grounde, then comming to him hee hearde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
saide: I haue my Freende in some parte reuenged
thy wrong. Alas Sir (ꝙ he) had you not béene, my life had
perished, for as I trauailed on my iourney, this Lion furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie
sette vpon me to deuoure mee: which the rest of my
companie perceiuing, tooke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to flight, leauing mée
as you founde mee. The best is (said <hi>Palmerin)</hi> that you
haue escaped with life: and if you please to goe with mee
not far hence, where I haue béene nourished, you shall haue
the best entertainment that I can make you. My Freende
(quoth the Straunger) you haue alreadie doone so much for
me, as if you will goe with me into the Countrey where I
dwell, I haue wherewithall to reward your trauaile rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
Is it farre hence Sir, said <hi>Palmerin?</hi> In the Cittie of
<hi>Hermida</hi> (ꝙ he) in the Realme of <hi>Macedon</hi> I dwel, from
whence I parted a moneth since w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my merchandise, which
I haue left at <hi>Constantinople:</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence returning home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
this vnlooked for mis-fortune befeil mee, which had
made an ende of me without your assistance. As they were
thus conferring togeather, one of the Strangers seruaunts
came to looke him, and finding him so happilie escaped, was
not a little ioyfull, reporting that he had left his companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
not farre off. Returne then said his Maister, and wil them
come to me to the next Uillage, where I meane to haue my
wounds dressed, which the seruaunt performed immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and all this while stoode <hi>Palmerin</hi> in debating with
himselfe if he should thus leaue his Father <hi>Gerrard</hi> or not:
at length [after manie opinions] fearing if hee returned
home againe not to finde the like opportunitie, concluded
to depart with the Stranger. So was hee sette on a verie
good Palfray, &amp; setting forwards to <hi>Macedon,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> night they
were entertained in a verie good lodging, where the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

one, howe by the ayde of <hi>Palmerin</hi> his life was preserued,
for which cause he accounted of him as of his owne Sonne.
All this while <hi>Gerrard</hi> and his Wife little thought of this
mishappe, but expected <hi>Palmerins</hi> returne till darke night,
and séeing he came not as he was wont: both he &amp; his wife
the next daie searched the Mountaines, but they could not
finde him, which made <hi>Gerrard</hi> to question in himself, what
euil he had offered him, that should make him thus depart.
Nowe durst not his Wife <hi>Marcella</hi> tell him, the talke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene

This spéeche had the Merchant with his fayre Wife, who
embracing <hi>Palmerin,</hi> said: That nature had omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

to mannage great Horses, to fight at al maner of weapons,

Knights, to talke of Armes and honourable exployts, and in

                     <p>Whereat <hi>Estebon</hi> meruailed so much, as faling in talke

hope to kill the Serpent, which hath béene the death of so
manie valiant Knights. And what occasion said <hi>Palmerin,</hi>
mooued them to fight with the Serpent? That will I tell
you, answered the Dwarffe. The King <hi>Primaleon,</hi> father
to the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> whom you séeke, thrée yéeres since
fell into a verie strange disease, for which no remedie can
yet be found, notwithstanding the dilligent endeuours of
the Quéene, and Ladie <hi>Arismena</hi> her Daughter, one of the
fairest and most vertuous Princesses that euer was hearde
of: who séeing her Father in such daungerous estate, hath
often assembled the best Phisitions in the whole worlde,
who haue practised al possible means to recouer his health,
yet hither to all hath béene to no purpose. Whereupon she
sent to an auncient Knight, the most skilfullest in the arte of
Nigromancie this daie liuing, who returned this answere:
that he should neuer bee healed, except hee bee first washed
with the water of a Fountaine, which standeth on the top
of the Mountaine <hi>Artifaeria,</hi> whether fourtimes a yere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
three Sisters, Magitians of the Isle <hi>Carderia,</hi> to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vertuous Hearbes which there they wash, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they frame all their enchantments. This place is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb facs="tcp:1616:36"/>
by the Monster wherof I tolde you, that no man as
yet durst approche it. Which newes when the Princesse
<hi>Arismena</hi> vnderstood, hoping by strength of men to recouer
the water and vanquish the Beast, leauied a great number
of Souldiours well appointed, who were no sooner entered
the Mountaine, but the Serpent came furiouslie foorth of
his Den, throwing fire and smoake out of his mouth, and
beating his winges togeather with such terror, as the very
hardiest durst passe no further, but were all glad to take
themselues to flight, yet coulde they not depart with such
expedition, but the greater part of them paid their liues for
their bolde attempt, the Mountaine was so stored with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Beares, Wolues, Harts, Tygres, Ounces, and other
wild rauenous Beastes that deuoured them. Nowe at

thinking by their Prowesse to performe more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the

againe aliue. And why goes not the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> him
selfe, said <hi>Palmerin,</hi> that is estéemed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> most valiant Knight
thorow all <hi>Greece?</hi> Alas Sir, said the Dwarffe, some other
matter hath so drowned his minde in mellancholique, as
he liues like one that dispiseth himselfe. While y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Dwarffe
continued his discourse, the desire of honour and renowne
did so liuelie touche the spirit of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> as he said to him
selfe. It may be that <hi>Arismena</hi> was the Lady, which in
my sléeping thoughts visited mee so often, if the Destinies
haue vowed her mine, why should I feare the Serpent, or
all the other Beastes wherewith this Dwarffe doth so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
me? Haue not I slaine a Lyon alreadie with a staffe?
Tush the more daunger is in the place, the more honor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
vpon the victory. If I leaue my life there, I am not
the first, if I returne with conquest, I shall be beyonde anie
yet in fortune: therefore fall out as it will, no perrill shall
dismaie me from giuing the aduenture, whereupon he sayd
to the Dwarffe. But tell me my Freende, hee that bringes
the water from the Mountaine to the King, what aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1616:36"/>
shall he deserue? My Lord, (quoth hee) it hath beene

one man more will hazarde his life in this enterprise,
albeit I should receiue but thanks for my frauaile, wylt
thou goe with me? That will I (aunswered the Dwarffe)
if you please, and neuer will I forsake you while breath is

procéede from your selfe: yet taking him by the hande, shee

I neuer knewe my Father or Mother, nor any of my kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred:
notwithstanding, mine owne hart makes mee iudge
no lesse of my selfe, and more gladlie would I die, then doo
anie thing that were not vertuous, and well woorthie the
name of a Gentleman. And trust me, said <hi>Florendos,</hi> I am
of the same opinion: this night therefore you must obserue
the religious watch as is accustomed, and to morrowe will
I giue you your order, and put the spurre on your héele my
selfe. <hi>Palmerin</hi> on his knée humblie kissed the Princes
hand, and continuing in talke togeather, <hi>Florendos</hi> tooke a
great delight in beholding him, so that hee demaunded his
name and Countrey. My Lord, quoth he, they which found
me amongst the Palme Trées, on y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Mountaine of Oliues,
not farre from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> haue giuen me the name of
<hi>Palmerin.</hi> By mine honour said <hi>Florendos,</hi> I ought wel to
know the Cittie whereof you speake, as the place wherein
my déerest affections tooke their first life, and not long since,
are bequeathed to death, awaiting nowe but the howre to
be discharged of the burden.</p>
                     <p>Thus hauing in his companie his vnknowne Sonne,
begotten by him on the Princesse <hi>Griana,</hi> knew little that
his loue had sorted to such effect: neuerthelesse, nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
him to like so well of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> as none in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Courte
contented him more then he. And longer woulde they haue
continued their talke, but that faire <hi>Arismena</hi> interrupted
them, asking <hi>Palmerin</hi> if he woulde discharge her of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
he demaunded. That doo I Madame (quoth hee) and
in requitall thereof, dedicate the whole circuit of my life to
your gracious seruice: and to begin my deuoire on your be
halfe, so soone as I haue receiued my Knighthoode, I wyll
take my iourney towards the Serpent, in hope to bring the
water that must recouer the King your Fathers health. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
good Sir, said she, God forbidde that you should fall in
such daunger by my meanes. I know well aunswered <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin,</hi>
                        <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1616:37"/>
that I can die but once, and if it be nowe, then am I
dispatched, and if I escape, I shall doo that whereof many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haue failed, and this is my resolution faire Madame.
Beléeue me, said <hi>Florendos,</hi> me thinkes you are as yet too
yong, to finish an action wherein consists so great daunger,
I praie you therfore referre it vnto such, as haue had more
experience in Armes then as yet you haue. My Lorde, saide
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> in other matters I shall obey when you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand,
but this I must desire you not to disswade me from. Well
then, quoth <hi>Florendos,</hi> séeing you will néedes haue it so, I
am content, you shall in the meane while kéepe mee compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie:
as for Sworde and Armour, trouble not you selfe to
prouide ame, because my selfe will furnish you sufficientlie.
Thus all daie <hi>Florendos</hi> accompanied <hi>Palmerin,</hi> demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of him what things he had séene in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and
falling from one discourse to another, he asked him what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squire
he had to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on him. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shewed his Dwarffe
called <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> such a deformed and euill fauoured felow,
as euerie one that saw him laughed hartilie, whereuppon
<hi>Palmerin</hi> said to <hi>Florendos.</hi> By my faith my Lorde, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séemelie
as he is, I thinke so well of him, as I should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
if he were anie waie iniuried. Assure your selfe, said
<hi>Florendos,</hi> that he will stand you in great stedde when you
haue no néede of him, and looke y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> you leaue nothing behind
you, that you néede to fight against the Serpent, and trust
it in his discretion to bring after you. When <hi>Vrbanillo</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
euerie one test so with him, he was halfe angrie, and
in some choller thus said to the Prince. I can no waie, my
Lord, better my shape or proportion, but if I liue, this little
deformed bodie of mine shall giue you to vnderstande, that
I beare so good a minde, as where my Maister leaues his
life, I meane to finish mine, and though in meane while I
can doo him no other seruice, he shalbe assured of my trueth
and loyaltie. But not offended (Owarffe my good freende)
saide <hi>Florendos,</hi> for I thinke well of thée and of thy beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour:
And so because the Tables were couered for Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb facs="tcp:1616:38"/>

of Azier, the goodliest and most beautifull that euer was
séene, vpon the Shéelde béeing portraied a Ladies arme,
hauing her hande fast closed togeather: the Damosell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
before the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> began thus. I pray you
my Lord to pause a while, till I haue conferred a little with
<hi>Palmerin. Florendos</hi> was greatlie amazed at this accident,
in that he had neuer séene the Damosell before: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
he returned this answere. Faire Damosell &amp; my
Fréende, good leaue haue you to saie what you please. Then
comming to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and falling on her knées before him,
she saide. Sir <hi>Palmerin,</hi> a Knight that hath authoritie to
commaund me, and whom as yet you doo not knowe, hath
sent you by me this Helment and Shéelde, wherein you shall
find y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verie secretes of your hart. And if you desire to know
whence this honour procéedeth, it commeth from him who
hath prooued the effect héereof, and that knowes more of
you néerest affairest then you doo your selfe, albeit as yet
he hath neuer séene you. Damosell, saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> where
maie I finde the learned man that hath thus honored mee,
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I may remunerate with my chéefest endeuours heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after?
You cannot as yet know him, saide the Damosell. I

she said. My Lorde, the same Man from whom I haue
saluted <hi>Palmerin,</hi> gaue me in charge to saie to you, that you
<pb facs="tcp:1616:39"/>
should not feare or doubt to dubbe him Knight: but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
your selfe, that both by Father and Mother hee is so
noble as he dooth well deserue it, and him héereafter you
will loue beyond all other, for by him you shall enioy the

licence to staie with you, I humbly desire you to excuse my
departure. Swéete Maide, saide <hi>Florendos,</hi> may your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

the Damosell, leauing <hi>Palmerin</hi> on his knée before the
Prince, who taking the Sworde that sometimes belonged
to <hi>Gamezio,</hi> Knighted him, saying: And maist thou prooue
as famous and fortunate, as my hope perswades mee thou
will. Then was he honourablie conueyed to the Pallace,
where the faire <hi>Arismena</hi> vnarmed him, and couered him
with a rich Mantle of white Satten, imbroydered all ouer

should ouercome his melancholly, and fearing his losse
without hope of recouerie: yet néedes would he be gone the

him to staie eight daies longer. <hi>Palmerin</hi> béeing soone after
alone by himselfe, he remembred the wordes of the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
who promised him to finde the secrets of his hart in his
Shéelde: whereupon he well aduised himselfe, and sawe
that the hand portraied in the Shéelde, had the same marke
which the Ladie had, that appeared to him in his sléepe,
whereat not a little maruailing, he said within himselfe. It
must néedes be without all doubt, that he which sent mee
this present, knoweth full wel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scope of my fortune, for I
am well assured, that the Ladie which spake to mee in my
sléepe, when I abode in the house of my Father <hi>Gerrarde,</hi>
shewed me her hand, with the selfe same marke I sée heere
pictured: by which I may perswade my selfe, that she will
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1616:39"/>
not cease to follow and finde me out, vntill such time as I
maie speake with her. Whereuppon he founde himselfe so
suddainlie inueigled with her loue, as he thus complained.
Ah <hi>Palmerin,</hi> well maist thou sée that long thou canst not
resist this impression, but whence should this humour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séede?
to loue her thou neuer sawest, nor knowest where is
her abiding? If it fall out that tho diest in thy pursuite,
these passions shall so haue a small ende, and I gaine y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>test
felicitie that I can desire. By this time had he spent
the eyght daies, which he promised <hi>Arismena</hi> for <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi>
companie, when as well to begin the searche of her hee
loued so well, as to ende the aduenture he intended of the

him, but leauing them rode on his way, his Dwarffe
thus comming to him. Beléeue me my Lord (quoth he) hee
is to be accounted ouer foolish hardie, that at the weapons
point séekes to offende you: I dare boldlie affirme my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
by euidence of the fortune of these foure Knightes. In
that, said <hi>Palmerin,</hi> thou maist be deceiued, but God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
fréende to iustice and equitie, and enemie to such as
goe against them. But because you shall know the occasion
why these foure Knights would haue taken the glass from
<hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> you must note that they were all Sonnes to a
great Lorde of a Castell, which was a daies iourneie off the
Mountaine <hi>Artifaeria,</hi> who hauing intelligence by Shéepe-heards
and other pesants, what good fortune had befallen
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> to kill the Serpent, and bring away the fatall
water, repined greatlie thereat: for the Lorde did highlie
mallice the King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> because he had enforced him
to surrender a Manour, which he against all right, held fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
one of his Sisters, and for this cause, knowing that by the
vertue of that water the King shold recouer his health, hée
sent his foure Sonnes to take it from <hi>Palmerin,</hi> whose suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
in their attempt fell out as you haue heard. Now <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
by this time is come to <hi>Macedon</hi> to the King, whom
with great reuerence he saluted on his knée: when y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> King
embracing him so well as he could, saide. Trust me my good
Fréende, next God I must néedes estéeme you dearest, for
<pb facs="tcp:1616:43"/>
that as he by his Godhead hath made me breath this ayre,
though weake and sicklie: by diuine prouidence hee hath
sent you to restore me my bodilie health, from hencefoorth
therefore I shall intreate you to commaund mee and mine
at your pleasure. My gratious Lorde, saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> the
heauens giue me successe to doo you seruice, for I knowe no
Prince liuing this daie, for whom I would more gladly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
my life. I thank you good Sir, quoth the King, but
the gréefe I haue sustained for the sorrow of my Sonne <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos,</hi>
brought me into such a long and lingering extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
as well may I blesse the time, that by your good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
am so happilie deliuered: let me therefore entertaine
you as my seconde Sonne, and perswade your selfe of such a
Father, who wil loue you as if you were his owne naturall
Childe, in that I and the greater part of my Kingdom shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
at your disposition. Woorthy Sir, saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilie
might I be reputed amongst the worst in the world,
refusing the honour you please to offer mee, especiallie in
such an extraordinarie kinde of fauour: for the rest, (bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus accepted in your princely grace) I haue sufficient
béeing furnished with Horse and Armour to doo me seruice.
With these wordes the King embraced him, and méere ioy
caused the teares to trickle downe his chéekes: so that
<hi>Palmerin</hi> staied longer with him then he made

I am sorrie, quoth the King, that the Duke my Nephew is

Yet let me intreate you, that finishing your intent with

                     <p>These wordes did <hi>Ptolome</hi> heare the Sonne of <hi>Frena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>

                        <hi>Florendos</hi> had kept since y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time he was his Page,

if the King woulde mooue <hi>Palmerin</hi> to take him

denyed, whereupon, knéeling before the King, hee beganne
thus. If it so please your highnes, that at your handes I

at these spéeches, and gaue order for his prouision of néede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
occasions, til euening came, when he entered the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,

would so further y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole course of his time, as might stand

in the morning, the King accompanied with his Sonne

where finding <hi>Ptolome</hi> on his knées, hee gaue him his

they both tooke their leaue of the King and <hi>Florendos,</hi> and
departed with the Gentleman towardes the Duke of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,</hi>
making such good expedition in their iourneye, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

performed so well: as by priuie signes made to the Sinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,
at length they got in without any danger. The Duke
hearing tydings of their arriuall, left his Chamber &amp; came
to welcome <hi>Palmerin,</hi> whome hee entertained with great
honour, spending the most part of the night in familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

                     <p>Your arriuall, Sir Knight, dooth arme mee with such
assured hope, as by the helpe I shall receiue at your hande,
mine enemie (I trust) shal not outbraue me as he hath doone
hitherto: and therfore you with your worthie companion,
are bothe so welcome as you can desire. My Lorde, (quoth
<hi>Palmerin)</hi> the King that sent me to you, hath bounde me to

The Duke returned his noble offer manie thankes, and
walking into the Hall, the Duchesse there expected the
comming of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> so after manie welcoms and courtlie
embracings, the Tables béeing couered, they sat downe to
Dinner: all which time, <hi>Palmerins</hi> eyes were fixed on the
Duchesse Daughter, who was one of the fairest Uyrgins
that euer he sawe, and so busied was his thoughts in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her, as hee gaue small regarde to the Dukes wordes,
who reported what shamefull iniuries the Countie had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him from time to time, and howe manie skirmishes
had passed betwéene them since the beginning of the wars.
Thus spent they the Dinner time, till the Tables beeing
withdrawne, and the Duchesse with her Daughter gone
into their Chamber, the Duke questioned with <hi>Palmerin</hi>
as concerning <hi>Ptolome,</hi> who was verie néere allied to the
Duke: and so with discoursing of nouels of <hi>Macedon,</hi> as
also the doubtfull affaires of the warres, they passed the

departing to their Chamber, <hi>Palmerin</hi> coulde take no rest,
the beautie of the Duchesse Daughter so troubled hys

was not alone thus passionate, but on the other side the
yong Ladie became as amorous of him: but Fortune wold
not permitte their loue, as you shall heare more héereafter.
The Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie hauing al this while maintained very straight
siedge, intending now to loose or gaine al, gaue fierce assault
vppon the Cittie: first calling all the cheefest Lordes and
Captaines of his Armie, moouing them with earnest and
Souldiour like perswasions, to foresée all aduauntages, and
to encounter their enemies with magnanimious and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

notwithstanding they were in number farre beyonde
them, and meruailous well prouided of all necessaries. But
then <hi>Palmerin</hi> remembred a suddaine pollicie to preuent a
mischéefe, for as the enemie retired to prepare for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
assault, he called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most part of the best Knights that
the Duke had, willing each one betake himself to his horse
and follow him, leauing the rest well appointed for defence
of the walles. The Counties power sounding the alarme,
and comming roughlie againe vpon the Cittie: <hi>Palmerin</hi>
with his company priuilie issued foorth at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Posterne gate
on the backs of the enemies, and gaue such a braue onsette,
as they were forced to forsake their scaling Ladders to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
this encounter. There were manie strokes deliuered
on either side, the Countie &amp; most part of his Knights bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on horsebacke, which made them holde the longer play
with <hi>Palmerin</hi> and his men: notwithstanding, the Countie
séeing such a hardie attempt giuen on a suddaine, and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
freshe supplie woulde come from the Cittie, with feare
began to retire, and with one of his Bretheren laboured to
resist this sharpe assault, but <hi>Palmerin</hi> and his companie
gaue them small time to rest, laying on loade with meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
fiercenes, whereat the Countie was so offended, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> he gaue him such a cruell stroke on the
Helmet, as he fell therwith to the ground, yet did he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
recouer himselfe againe, and requited the Countie with
so sound a salutation, as he made him tomble from his sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
headlong to the earth, at what time on the other side
<hi>Ptolome</hi> had so canuazed the Counties Brother, as he sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him a quittaunce with his sword for his life. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
the Counties Souldiours to dispayre of their successe,
and <hi>Palmerin</hi> with his traine to follow them so closelie, as
they were glad to take themselues to flight, leauing theyr

Maister ouerthrowne in the Armie, where hee was troden
to death with the trampling of the Horses. Thus did the
victorie remaine to the Duke, his enemies scattering in
flight gladde to saue their liues, whom <hi>Palmerin</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to follow no further, least gathering themselues togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againe, and espying aduauntage, they might so endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
them: for oftentimes the vanquished too narrowly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued,
recouer courage &amp; daunte the pride of the conquerers.
For this cause he returned with his men into the Citty, the
Duke vnderstanding the foyle of his enemie, which made
him with a great number of woorthy Cittizens to goe méet
<hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Ptolome,</hi> whome embracing hee thus enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
Ah good Knights, by you is my estate recouered, and
the death of my Sonnes reuenged on the murderer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dispose of me and myne as you shall thinke beste: to

and will héereafter what I can, for the great kindnesse of
the King of <hi>Macedon</hi> your Uncle, who hath honored mee
in sending me to you, and other recompence I neuer did or
will séeke. As they thus parled togeather, the Duke percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the blood on <hi>Palmerins</hi> Armour, that he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in manie places, wherefore (quoth he) I sée you are sore

mounting on horsebacke, they rode to the Pallace, where
<hi>Palmerin</hi> was lodged. Béeing brought into his Chamber,
the Duchesse and her Daughter holpe to vnarme him,
when the Ladie dressed his wounds, perswading him there
was no daunger in them to be feared. Thus each one depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting,

of his Maisters comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
the next day when <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rana</hi>
came with her Mother to
visite <hi>Palmerin,</hi> shee tooke the

I thanke God and you, for
in you two consists the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of my Maisters health. As howe quoth shee? Thus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
said <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> the first day that he behelde you, hee
gaue the whole possession of himselfe so firmely to you, as
day &amp; night he meditates on your diuine perfections, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1616:47"/>
in requital of his seruice to my Lord your Father, and
his Countrey, whose liues and yours he hath defended, him
selfe shalbe repayed with suddaine and cruel death: for had
he not come for your safetie, well had he escaped this daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
extreamitie. Then séeing (fayre Madame) that his
valour hath béene the meane of your deliueraunce, doo not
so degenerate from gentle nature, as to kill him that gaue
you life. Why my Freend (quoth she) what wouldest thou
haue me doo? To loue him, swéete Madame, quoth he, as hée
doth you. Alas, sayd she, thou mayst assure thy selfe, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> none
can wysh thy Maister better then I doo, béeing my duetie
and his desert: with which wordes shee chaunged colour
with such modest bashfulnes, as it might be perceiued shee
could hardly master her affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Which when y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Dwarffe
behelde, as one not to learne his lesson in this arte, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
himselfe by the very lookes of <hi>Laurana,</hi> that his May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
loue would sort to happy ende, and thereuppon he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the matter thus. I thinke Madame, that you
wysh my Maister as well as anie, but that is not enough,
vnlesse your wysh agrée wyth his in this poynt: that you
graunt your selfe his onely Lady and Mistresse, as hee hath
vowed himselfe your Knight and Seruant. If it may please
you to wysh this good to my Maister, vouchsafe this fauour
as a president of your lyking: that so soone as he shall finde
himselfe better in health, you wyll but consent to speake
with him alone, in some such conuenient and vnsuspected
place, as hee may haue liberty to acquaint you with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of his thoughts. Alas (quoth she) how should I so doo,
without offering too much impeache to mine owne honour?
Madame, saide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Dwarffe, the night giues fauour to loues
swéete enterprises. By this time the Duchesse was ready
to depart, which <hi>Laurana</hi> perceiuing, sayd to the Dwarffe.
Assure thy Maister from me, that I am more his the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> myne
owne, and I will doo for his welfare what I may with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie.
By reason of their departure, the Dwarffe coulde
not make her answere, but shaddowing the matter as hee
<pb facs="tcp:1616:48"/>
had doone before, went about his Maisters busines, till hee
came and found him alone, when he discoursed all that had
past betwéene the Princesse and him, which so well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Palmerin</hi> as nothing coulde more: because he perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
himselfe, as I haue saide alreadie, that this was shee
which the thrée Sisters promised him, by whom he shoulde
receiue the honour that destinie allowed him. For thys
cause thence forwarde he was verie desirous to knowe her
name, commaunding <hi>Vrbanillo</hi> very straightly to enquire
it, which hee did, informing his maister that her name was
<hi>Laurana:</hi> whereupon he well sawe that hee was deceiued,
in that the Sisters had named his Mistresse <hi>Polinarda,</hi>
and therefore he resolued to withdraw his affection, and to
depart thence so soone as he should be able to beare Armor.
But it may be easilie presumed, that when one hath so far
ventured in loue, that he perceiues himself beloued, as the
Dwarffe perswaded his Maister: hardly can hee giue ouer
so faire a beginning: yet héere it fell out contrary, as you
shall well perceiue, that the ende was more suddaine then
the beginning. <hi>Palmerin</hi> now knowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princesse name,
began to vse other countenaunce to her then hee was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed,
but shee good Lady (in his excuse) conceiued better
opinion then she had cause: yet as it euermore falleth out
in loue, that when Ladies sée themselues but slenderly
courted by their Fréendes, they growe importunate in
their amorous desires, so came it to passe with <hi>Laurana,</hi>
who perceiuing herselfe not solicited by <hi>Palmerin</hi> as shee
was wont, one night somewhat late shee called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Dwarffe,
and thus began. Howe comes it to passe (my good Fréend)
that thy Maister is not of so pleasaunt disposition, as heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
he hath béene? it may be thou hast not let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
my last salutation, or els feare with-holdes him from
following his determination: I pray thée doo the message
of my earnest good will to him, and tell him that I long to
impart our affections togeather, to the ful resolution of our
desired thoughts, which I haue found the way vnsuspected
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1616:48"/>
to accomplish, so please him to come to my Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
at night, where I shall not faile to expect his presence.
When the Dwarffe heard <hi>Laurana</hi> vse these words, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his Maister was still in his former cogitations, thus
aunswered. Trust me fayre Madame, within these fewe
dayes my Maister is become so mellanchollie, as I haue
manie times feared his death, and I am sure hee hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause to torment him so, but onely the fury of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
loue he beares you: yet séeing you haue promised
him such gracious fauour, let me alone to change this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasaunt
humour. Fayle not then quoth shee, to let him
know my minde. I goe presently, said the Dwarffe, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with these long desired tydings. So taking his
leaue, he went to his Maisters Chamber, whom he founde
fast a sleepe, when not daring to awake him, let stay hys
message till the next morning, and so laide him downe to
rest: at what time sleepe had thorowly possessed him, he be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gan
to cry and complaine so loude, as his Maister hearing
him arose, and demaunded of him the cause of his lament.
Alas my Lorde (quoth he) neuer in all my life was I so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted,
me thought that one of the fayrest Ladies that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
eye lookt on, helde a naked sworde against my throate,
saying. Uile and villainous creature as thou art, darest
thou presume so much to offende me, as to make thy Lorde
and Maister amorous of Lady <hi>Laurana,</hi> and to forsake me?
iustly doost thou deserue to dye on this weapon for thy pail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lardise:
and if héereafter thou carry any message to preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
my right, assure thy selfe that I wil chastise thée in such
sort, as all deformed villaines shal receiue example by thée.
I tell thée Traytour, <hi>Palmerin</hi> his fortunes climbes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then the name of <hi>Laurana,</hi> and where he is more looued
for the royaltie of his linage, then for his base and Pastoral
education. With which wordes shee gaue me such a stroke
on the heade with her sworde, as I (fearefull of my life)
cryed so loude as you say you hearde me. This motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made
<hi>Palmerin</hi> easily perceiue, that <hi>Polinarda</hi> had made thys
<pb facs="tcp:1616:49"/>
threatning to the Dwarffe for <hi>Laurana:</hi> which concealing
to hims<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

drie conceiued this fonde vision: I praie thée sléepe, &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
me no more with such idle passions. The Dwarffe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
him to rest, but <hi>Palmerins</hi> thoughts all night were
hammering on this Dreame, so that he resolued to departe
thence the next morning, and séeke els where his aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
séeing hee was admonished by so manie aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
So at the daie rysing he called the Dwarffe, and
commaunded him to prepare his Armour, for hee intended
to take his leaue of the Duke. <hi>Ptolome</hi> hearing this, and
hauing noted beside all that the Dwarffe tolde his Maister
in the night. Dissembling the matter, as was his manner,
he came and bad <hi>Palmerin</hi> good morrowe, who aunswered
<hi>Ptolome</hi> in this manner. My déere Fréend, I haue concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
none of mine affaires fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thée, since the time we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
our knighthoode, and parted togeather from the Courte
of <hi>Macedon:</hi> nowe therefore shall I impart to thée what I
haue determined.</p>
                     <p>It is so, that vrgent occasions constraines me presently
to leaue this Countreie, and henceforth to frame my course
which way Fortune will direct me, by which occasion I see
we must be enforced to leaue each other: notwithstanding,
let me intreate that our absence may no way impayre our
fréendshippe, not doubting but in good time we shall meete
togeather againe. In meane space, if you sée the King or
Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> forgette not the humble duety of theyr
vowed Seruaunt I beséeche yée, who dedicates his life and
honour in all attempts to their gracious fauours. By God,
said <hi>Ptolome,</hi> let who will doo the message for me, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
death nor daunger shall seperate me from you: but I
wil beare you companie while life and soule hold together.
If you be so resolute, said <hi>Palmerin,</hi> shame were it for mee
so to refuse you. Set forward then when you please (quoth
<hi>Ptolome)</hi> for we neither must nor will depart, thats flat.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1616:49"/>
So béeing bothe armed they came to the Duke, who mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
much to sée them so prepared, and therefore demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
whether they went. My good Lord, answered <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
in that your Countrey is nowe quieted, wee must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
you for our departure, because waightie affaires in
other places doo so commaunde vs. How happens it fayre
Fréendes, saide the Duke, that you will so soone leaue mee?
My Lorde (quoth <hi>Palmerin)</hi> wee are so enforced, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we humblie intreate you, not to be offended. If your
affaires bee such saide the Duke, lothe am I to hinder you,
commaunde of me and mine what you please, for all remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
at your disposition. Most humble thanks did <hi>Palmerin</hi>
and <hi>Ptolome</hi> returne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke, and ere they went to horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
they came to take their leaue of the Duchesse &amp; <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rana,</hi>
who was well nie deade, séeing her hope deceiued, for
she expected the night comming, when shée and <hi>Palmerin</hi>
should conferre togeather of their loue: but séeing him now
departing, she was out of all hope to sée him againe, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
gréefe whereof so ouercame her, as giuing a greate
shrike shee fell in a swoune. The Ladies and Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

woulde not reueale to anie, for the reason you hearde
discoursed before: and rather would she entertaine her own
death, then make knowne a secrete of such importaunce:
wherefore hauing somewhat recouered herselfe, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

breathed foorth her sorrow. Ah <hi>Palmerin,</hi> easilie hast thou
kindled the fire, which with great shame thou leauest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming

<hi>Laurana</hi> before the Duchesse, not sparing to discharge the
whole burthen of her oppressed hart, her Mother not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

swéetelie promised to worke so with <hi>Palmerin,</hi> as he should

mounted on horsebacke, and accompanied with <hi>Ptolome</hi>

<hi>Ptolome,</hi> that we shape our course towarde <hi>Rome,</hi> where

and so they trauailed eight daies togeather, not méeting
with any aduenture worthy to be spoken off: till at length
they met a Damosell heauily mourning, who saide. Alas,
what will shee saie whose trust was onelie in mee, hauing

yet could finish the aduenture: whereuppon I was thys
daie trauailing towarde the Emperours Courte of <hi>Greece,</hi>
and heereby I met with two Knights, who hauing hearde
the cause of my long trauaile, made proofe of their fortune
one after another, and bothe failed, whereat they were so
offended, as they tooke the Casket from me perforce, and
are gone there with I knowe not whither, which dooth so
gréeue me, in respect of her losse towards whom I am, as
death woulde be more welcome to mee then life. Faire
Uirgin, saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> doo not discomfort your selfe, but
she we mee which way they rode that dealt with you so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteouslie.
Gentle Knight (quoth shee) if your hap be to
restore my losse againe, you doo the most gracious acte, that

to honour (whereof the one is in Crunson Armour, bearing
in his Shéelde thrée Lyons heades) tooke this waie by the
woode, and as yet I am sure they canne not be farre hence.
Then <hi>Palmerin</hi> clasped his Helmet, and taking his Sword
and Launce, desired <hi>Ptolome</hi> to garde the Damosell and
follow him, galloping that way which she had shewed him:
and by the time he had rid two miles, he espied them he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

he receiued a small wounde on his shoulder, in recompence
whereof, he gaue one of them a pasport into another world,
and laid so lustilie on the seconde, as he set him quicklie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
his saddle. When the third sawe his companions at so
harde a reckoning, he said to himselfe. By my faith he spake
not vnaduisedlie, that said: <hi>A safe escape is better then a
bad tarrying.</hi> And allowing this sentence for currant in
his owne opinion, gaue the spurs to his Horse, making hast
away with the Casket so fast as hee coulde: but <hi>Palmerin</hi>
béeing somewhat better mounted, got such aduauntage of
this runaway, as with his sword he parted his right arme

when opening the Casket, he tooke great pleasure in behel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

me Lady, he that wrought this enchauntment, dyd
more by his arte, then I can by my cunning, and in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
you may trauaile long enough, before you finde him
that shall quit your expectation. The more wil be my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
quoth the Damosell, béeing tyed by necessitye to such a
Knights fortune. When <hi>Palmerin</hi> sawe that his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
had failed, he doubted whether he should take it in hand
or no: yet séeing hee coulde spéede no worse then other had
doone, he said to the Damosell, will you any thing with me
before I aduenture my selfe, for my Fréende shall not bee
<hi>mal content</hi> for a fellowe. Gentle Knight, quoth she, I wyll
nothing, but that you make me the like promise your fréend
did. Of that doubt you not saide <hi>Palmerin:</hi> so laying hande
valiantlie on the Sword, without any great labor he drew
it foorth, béeing the richest and goodliest Sworde that euer
was séene. Ah good Knight, sayde the Damosell, happy bee
the day of thy natiuitie, for thou hast deliuered me from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
labour. The Sword is yours, but by your promise
you stand bound to goe with me where I shall conduct you,
to doo that shall please my Lady to commaund you. Leade
the way Damosell quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and be sure we wil not
leaue thy company. So mounted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Damosell on her Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray,
and tooke the way towardes <hi>Rome,</hi> where she that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
her the Casket remained in deuotion, and with such
spéede they dispatched their trauaile, as they arriued at the
Gate of a strong Castell, where the Damosell alighted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
<hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Ptolome</hi> to expect her returne awhile.
The Gate being opened, she went straight to her Mistresse
and her Sister, who béeing gladde of her comming, demaun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded

Knights in this Countrey, with whome I long time
remained not hauing anie Childe, till at length it pleased
God to sende me a Daughter, so faire a creature as euer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

but fiue yéeres aged. My Lorde and Husbande learned in

what shall happen to thée after my death, and that one shal
take perforce from thée, not onelie such goods as I leaue
thée, but also thy faire Daughter, to helpe which extremity,
I haue somewhat prouided for thée before my departure.</p>
                     <p>Thou shalt finde in my Cabinett a Sworde, which I
my selfe haue enclosed in a Casket, and haue sette so manie
inchaunted spels on that Sword, as no man shal be able to
drawe it out of the scabbard, vnlesse he be the best approued
Knight in the worlde, and he it is that must giue thée suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
and helpe to recouer againe thy losse. Too true fel out
my Husbands spéeches, for soone after <hi>Darmaco</hi> the Gyant
came hither, and as his custome was to abuse whome hee
listed, so tooke he from me the best of my Castelles, and in
despight of me tooke my Daughter from me, saying that he
would giue her to one of his Sonnes in marriage, a villain
far more vicious then the Father, &amp; so deformed, as nature
standes ashamed at her owne workmanship. Nowe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
I would not consent to this vnséemely marriage, such
goods as was left me, hee violentlie tooke from mee, thys

thus robde me of my goods and my Daughter, whose youth
(béeing as yet but tenne yéeres olde) is the cause that the
Giant hath not consumated the marriage. And if it shal like
you to doo thus much for me, you shall not onelie fulfil your
promise to the Damosell that brought you hither, but you
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1616:53"/>
shall doo a déede acceptaple to God, profitable to me, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to my poore Childe, and honorable for euer vnto your

if <hi>Darmaco</hi> haue doone you this wrong, in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Giants

my promise binde me to your Damosel, I would not passe
so lightlie out of this Countrie, ere I compelled him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
to recompence this iniurie, and this shall I (God wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling)
doo to morrowe, so please you I may bee conducted to
him. Ah gentle Knight, saide the Ladie, what I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Heauen will no doubt repay thee: And because it was
nowe somwhat late, after they had spent a little more time
togeather in conference, these Ladies accompanied him and
<hi>Ptolome</hi> into their Chamber, and taking their leaue, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Knights to their good rest for that night, which
they passed with quiet repose, and on the next morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were armed, they demaunded their guide of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
that shoulde direct them the way towardes the Giant.
Then she called the Damosell that carried the Casket, and
two Knights of her owne, whom shee commaunded to goe
with <hi>Palmerin:</hi> so committing him to God and good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
they tooke their waie straight to the Castell of <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maco,</hi>
where they arriued in the euening, when they espy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Squire on the walles, who was appointed there to
kéepe the watch, to whom <hi>Palmerin</hi> saide. My Fréende, I
praie thée if <hi>Darmaco</hi> bee within, cause him to come foorth,
for I would speake with him. And what woulde you with

<hi>Palmerin,</hi> to vse himselfe more courteouslie then hee hath
doone heeretofore, and that hee woulde doo right to a good
Ladie whom he hath disinherited, namely to sende her her
goods and her Daughter againe: and if my intreatie may
not preuaile with him, bidde him if hee dare come to the
Combatt, wherein I will make him confesse vnder my
Sworde, that his actions haue béene villainous, traiterous,
and disloyall. In good sooth Sir, aunswered the Squire in

derision, you may séeme to haue reason, and they that sent
you likewise, but your iourney I feare me will not amount
to so much: therefore if you will be ruled by me get you go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
vnlesse you are willing to leaue your heade for a signe

too good an edge, and mine arme too sound stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, to leaue
a Iewell of such price so easilie: goe therefore when I byd
thée thou wert best, otherwise assure thy selfe if I vanquish

he hath not beene within for this howre and more, yet is
his Sonne <hi>Mordano</hi> héere, who can bid you welcome as

demaunding of <hi>Palmerin</hi> what he sought for? I tolde thy

in short time he came foorth very well appointed, with

a verie lustie Courser, so prauncing towards <hi>Palmerin,</hi> hee

will spare thy life, and suffer thée to waste thy time in one

God sheelde me, quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and béeing mooued wyth
these rough wordes of his enemie, he encountred <hi>Mordano</hi>
with such courage, as their Launces beeing broken, bothe
of them were dismounted, <hi>Palmerin</hi> not hurt, but <hi>Mordano</hi>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1616:54"/>
was wounded on the right side, the trunchion of <hi>Palmerins</hi>
Launce beeing left in his bodie. Notwithstanding he rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
himselfe quicklie, and came furiouslie towardes <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin,</hi>
and gaue him such a cruell stroke on the head, as the
bloode beganne to trickle downe his face: which when he
perceiued, and howe it stoode him in hande now to be ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous,
he requited <hi>Mordano</hi> with so sounde a greeting, as
he parted one of his armes quite from his bodie, and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
him likewise that he fell to the ground, but recouering
himselfe, he ran towardes the Castell and <hi>Palmerin</hi> after
him. The Seruaunts of the Castell, séeing their Lordes
Sonne in such danger, with Iauelinges and other weapons
came against <hi>Palmerin,</hi> whom they had murdered, if <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome</hi>
and the two Knights that were sent with him, had
not speedilie come from their close ambush to defende him,
and so manfullie did they behaue themselues, as they droue
them into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> base Court, where <hi>Mordano</hi> fell deade at <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomes</hi>
feete, who deferring no time, presently with hys
Sworde tooke his heade from his shoulders. The seruants
this séeing, dispersed themselues &amp; ran into corners, so that
<hi>Palmerin</hi> and his companie had no bodie left to resist them,
some lying there wounded to the death, and other escaping
foorth at a backe Gate, which they made fast after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> least
they should be followed. When <hi>Palmerin</hi> sawe all thinges
fall out so effectually, hee called for the Damosell and the
Knights that came with him, who beeing not a little glad
of this great good fortune, desired first to séeke for <hi>Esmerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
their Ladies Daughter, for they were well assured that
she was in the Castell. Searche in euery place, quoth hee,
and because the night drewe on, the Gates were made fast,
and there they determined to lodge for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> night. In meane
while, the Damosell went about the Castell, and neere the
Giants Chamber she founde <hi>Esmerinda,</hi> who immediatlie
knowing her, came running and caught her louingly about
the necke: for before, (not knowing that her companie had
conquered the Castell) she and three other W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:1616:55"/>
kept her companie, were greatlie feared, but nowe the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosell
gaue her perfect assuraunce, that all was doone for
her deliuerie, and by the onelie Knight for prowesse in the
worlde, whom her Ladie Mother had thus sent thither.
As they continued this talke, <hi>Palmerin</hi> came to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom the yong Gentlewoman <hi>Esmerinda</hi> humbled
herselfe on her knées: but he taking her vp, embraced her
with these speeches. Prettie soule, your Ladie mother hath
great desire to sée you, will not you goe with vs to her? Sir
Knight, ꝙ shee, I neuer in my life desired any thing more,
then to sée my Mother: but I greatlie doubt that the false
<hi>Darmaco</hi> will meete vs by the way, for he went this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the funerall of one of his Sisters, and it will bee to
morrowe before his returne, when if hee hap to meete vs,
we are but deade. Let me deale for that good Ladie, saide
<hi>Palmerin:</hi> I haue learned alreadie to kill the Sonne, I

<pb facs="tcp:1616:57"/>
and if there be anie thing els to doo, Lady I am readie now
to performe it. You haue doone so much for me, saide she, as
nothing remaineth more to be desired, vnlesse of your boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
you will cause me to receiue what the Giant tooke from
me by force: for séeing he is deade, they that with-helde it
from me, will nowe willinglie, restore it againe. That shal
be likewise accomplished, quoth <hi>Palmerin:</hi> but because hee
and <hi>Ptolome</hi> were sore wounded as you hearde, they staied
to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> and sent <hi>Crispino</hi> with his Cozin and a good
sufficient traine, to demaunde the Ladies Castell and her
goods. They that helde it of the Giant, vnderstanding his
death, made present deliueraunce thereof, and committed
themselues to the Ladies mercie: whether shee sent her
Daughter, so soone as <hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Ptolome</hi> were healed,
to whom the Subiects vowed their faith and allegeaunce,
and with great Triumphes honoured the mariage of <hi>Cris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pino</hi>
and <hi>Esmerinda.</hi> On the morrowe, as the Knights sat
at meate, there entred the Hall a Squire, who said to <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin,</hi>
that a Damosel staied without to speake with him.
Let her come in, quoth he, &amp; saie her pleasure. The Squire
bringing her into the Hall, she fell on her knées before <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin,</hi>
saying. Sir Knight, doo you not knowe mee? No in
good sooth, aunswered <hi>Palmerin.</hi> Beléeue mee (quoth the

                        </gap>metime I did you, and whereof I am sure you haue heard
good account. Then <hi>Palmerin</hi> knewe her (she bringing the
Shéelde and the Helmet when <hi>Florendos</hi> knighted him)
whereuppon he rose from the Table, and embracing her,
said. Faire Damosell and my fréende, I pray you pardon
me, for the length of time since I first saw you, did quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
you from my remembrance: pleaseth it you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
me anie seruice? Sir Knight, said the Damosell,
when I presented you the Helmet and Shéelde, wherwith
you tooke your order of Knighthoode, you promised mee (if
you remember) that you would vse it with right good will,
in anie affaires the Knight had that sent it you, and when
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1616:57"/>
he should require such performaunce: nowe is the time to
confirme your déede with your worde, for hee hath sent mée
to you with humble intreatie, that without anie staie, you
goe where I shall conduct you, otherwise you are the onelie
cause of his death. God shéelde me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such mis-fortune said
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> rather woulde I goe with you presently from
the Table. So doo I pray you, (quoth she) for I haue hast.
Then he called for his Armour, and the table withdrawne,
he went into his Chamber to arme himselfe, and so dyd
<hi>Ptolome</hi> also: returning, they tooke their leaue of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and mounted on horsebacke, the whole companie bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so sorrie for their departure, as <hi>Esmerinda</hi> came to the
Damosell, saying. I promise you Damosell, you haue doone
vs wrong in mine opinion, to hinder vs of the presence of
so good a Knight. Ladie, aunswered the Damosell, thinke
you he was borne for you onelie? content your selfe with the
good you haue receiued by him, and suffer such as haue néed
of his prowesse, to receiue his assistaunce as you haue doone.
And good reason saide <hi>Esmerinda,</hi> if it be to so good an end,
that no resistaunce bee offered when helpe is required. So
departed the two Knights with the Damosell which waie
she guided them, and verie desirous was <hi>Palmerin</hi> to bee
with the Knight that sent to seeke him: because hee would
gladlie know, of whence hee was that wyshed him so wel,
as his message declared by the Damosell the same daie hee
was Knighted.</p>

ridde with the Damosell, when
<hi>Palmerin</hi> at length desired her
to tell him, what hee was that

whereto she aunswered, that sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he was so desirous to knowe,
listen, ꝙ she, and I shall report
the whole vnto you. The Knight
we speake of, is disce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of verie
royall bloode, béeing Uncle to the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> that
raignes at this present, as also to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empresse of <hi>Allemaigne</hi>
the verie best séene in Nigromancie this daie liuing. This
noble man is named Prince <hi>Adrian,</hi> who neuer liked to
liue in the Court of the King his Brother, but contented
with what patrimonie his Father left him, at length ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with a verie beautifull Ladie, of whom in time hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
a Sonne named <hi>Dyardo,</hi> which Sonne his Brother
the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> nourished vppe in his Court with his
owne Sonne. So mutually in loue agréed these two yong
Princes, as after the death of the aged King, the yong <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardo</hi>
should ioyn the rule with his Cozin the King: who
tooke to Wife y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her with him into this Countrey, in companie of her
Sister, a Princesse so wise and vertuous as euer liued. It
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1616:58"/>
so came to passe, that <hi>Dyardo</hi> my Lords most noble Sonne,
framing his thoughts to the inspirations of loue, affected so
highlie the other Sister, as he determined neuer to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
other to his Wife, if he might compasse what he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
For her good Ladie, he coulde not be deceiued in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
desires, he found her loue so equall with his, yet did
they shaddow their affections so discreetlie, as none coulde
perceiue them, but <hi>Domarto</hi> the traiterous Countie of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meque,</hi>
one of the best Knights in all this Country, were he
as familiar with vertue and honestie, as he is with mallice
and disloyaltie. This Traytour enterprised to match with
the Queenes Sister, beloued as you haue hearde by my
Lordes worthy Sonne, and thereuppon after manie sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
made knowne his intent vnto her, whereof she made
so slender account, as shee forbad him any more to trouble
her. <hi>Domarto</hi> séeing my Lorde <hi>Dyardo</hi> his onely hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
in loue, intended a mallicious villainie: and on a
suddaine accused the Prince, that he intended to poyson the
King, so to obtaine the Crowne, as discended of a neerer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinitie.
And as it often falleth out in such cases, when
one séekes to crosse an others fortune, there is no time flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in following such drifts: euen so this Traytor, finding
the yonge King alone, began his matter in this coullorable
sort. My gracious Lord, the faith and allegeaunce I owe to
you highnesse, bindes me to make your princelie cares ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with such newes, as, God is my witnes, said the
Traitour (lifting his eyes and hands to heauen) mine own
death were more welcome to me, such is the loue I beare
them whom it concernes, béeing al so neere allied to you in
birth, as sorie I am they shoulde bee detected: but in your
regarde my gracious Lorde, the action touching you in such
sort as it dooth, let me die rather then spare any liuing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature,
no not mine owne Sonne, had nature giuen mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
This néedelesse exordium haue I made to so foule an
occasion, albeit truth néedes no coullers or eloquent figures
and therefore in bréefe my Lord, this is the summe. I am
<pb facs="tcp:1616:59"/>
crediblie enformed, that your highnesse Cozin the Prince
<hi>Dyardo,</hi> and Madame <hi>Cardonia</hi> Sister to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéene, haue
laid the platforme to poyson your Maiestie, and this haue
they attempted, by the procurement of olde <hi>Adrian</hi> your
Uncle, who pretends that the Crowne of <hi>Bohemia</hi> is his.
I knowe not whether it be for want of discretion or no: but
howsoeuer it be my Lorde, you shoulde not leaue such a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainie
vnpunished. The King began greatlie to meruaile
at these newes, and knewe not well what to think: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
he aunswered the Countie, that he coulde not beleeue
this accusation. But the Traytour set so smoothe a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
on the matter, and did auerre it still with such stout
protestations, as hee induced the King to beleeue him: so
that a daie or two after, the King béeing walking in hys
Garden, séeing <hi>Dyardo</hi> &amp; <hi>Cardonya</hi> at the Quéenes cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
windowe, secretlie conferring of their amorous affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
commaunded them bothe to be carried to prison. The
Countie glad thereof, prouoked the King still with such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
against them, as immediatlie he woulde haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bothe
doone to death: but that the Quéene and the Lordes of hys
Counsel, founde meanes to quallifie his displeasure, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
what discredite his highnes shold receiue, if he did not
suffer them to be openlie conuicted of their offences. All this
while good Princes, were they ignoraunt of this detection,
till at length the King discoursed the whole matter to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and likewise who was their accuser: nor did the Countie
faile to maintaine his wordes openlie, offering to make it
good in fight, against any that durst say the contrary, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had two Cozins, hardie and valiant Knights, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators
likewise in this faction, there could be none found
that would enter the Combat against them. Which when
the noble Prince <hi>Adrian</hi> vnderstoode, very gréefe had well
néere slaine him, in respect he had no Child but this <hi>Dyar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
as also for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hee was accused with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hee neuer thought.
Héereupon he went presently to the King his Nephew, and
preuailed so well with him, as he obtained the space of two
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1616:59"/>
Monethes, to bring with him one or two that might main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the innocencie of him, his Sonne <hi>Dyardo,</hi> and the
Princesse <hi>Cardonia,</hi> against the Traytour <hi>Domarto</hi> and
his Cozins. And this is the cause he sent mee to seeke you
foorth, in hope that you are as much his Freende as hee is
yours, which you may somewhat perceiue, by the freendlie
presents he sent you by mee to <hi>Macedon.</hi> So helpe mee
God, saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> you haue reported a most strange dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and neuer did I think, that such treason could enter
the thoughts of any Knight, or other inferior person. All this
is true, quoth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Damosell, and it is appointed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Prince-<hi>Dyardo,</hi>
with his aged and crazed Father, shal defend their
owne causes, without séeking helpe of anie other: but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
as yet receiued the order of Knighthoode, and therfore
is constrained to desire your assistaunce. And that shall I
doo with all my hart, saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> would God we were
there where he expecteth vs, for the desire I haue to sée
him, as also to vnderstande what he knowes of my follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fortunes. Those matters are hid from mee, quoth shee,
yet this haue I hearde him say diuers times, being in talk
of you, that he accounted you the most honorable Knight in
the worlde: and that if he euer chaunced to sée you, he wold
aduise you to goe to the Emperour of <hi>Allemaignes</hi> Courte,
to be the knightly Seruaunt to the Princesse <hi>Polinarda.</hi>
When <hi>Palmerin</hi> heard the name of <hi>Polinarda,</hi> he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
that it was her name, whome hee had so manye times
séene in his fraunces, for which cause he asked of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosell,
what the Lady was of whom shee spake? My Lord
quoth the, <hi>Polinarda</hi> is Daughter to the Emperour, and
Niece vnto my Lorde <hi>Adrian,</hi> the most beautiful Princesse
that euer eye behelde. By my faith, saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> more
easily may I be induced to graunt her my seruice, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intend I to trauaile, when I haue finished your Lords
busines. So rode they with much more haste the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, tyl
at length they came to the Cittie of <hi>Almedya,</hi> where the
King remained, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince <hi>Adrian</hi> expecting <hi>Palmerins</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:1616:60"/>
comming, which when he hearde, hee came to meete him,
eache embracing other with meruailous courtesie, and the
good olde man with the teares in his eyes thus saide. Ah
good Knight, what may counteruaile this your exceeding
paines, to maintaine the right of my Sonne and mee, who
are falselie accused of such villainous treason, as (on the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill
of my soule) we neuer did imagine? Thereof am I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainlie
perswaded, aunswered <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and therfore am I
come to enter the Combat with him, that dare affirme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
Mine olde age, quoth <hi>Adrian,</hi> might excuse mee
henceforth from bearing Armes, but béeing vnable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
so vile a slaunder, so long as life and soule will holde
togeather, shal I doo my deuoire: so please your companion
to make the second, as olde as I am I will be the thirde, for
the trayterous Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie hath two of his Cozins y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> take part
with him. And if my fortune so fall out as I die in this try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
I shall receiue my lot very contentedlie, if mine eyes
might first beholde mine iniurie reuenged. I pray you said
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> goe presently to the King, to the ende that hys
highnesse may graunt vs the fielde, for my Freende and I
thinke long till we haue made your accuser knowe his tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie.
<hi>Adrian</hi> immediatly went to the King, and on his
knées thus began. My Lorde, you knowe that the Countie
of <hi>Ormeque</hi> hath accused mee, my Sonne <hi>Dyardo,</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<hi>Cardonya,</hi> of the cryme of <hi>Lesae Maiestatis,</hi> and in
that we all are innocent, I am readie to maintaine, that he
hath falsely and malliciously belied vs, which I my selfe
will approoue vpon him, or two more with me, against him
and his Cozins, if they dare enter the fielde with him in
this quarrell, where we will either make known their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainie,
or receiue the reward belongs to disloyall Traitors.
As for the wrong which you (my Lord) haue doone me, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Uncle, and my Sonne <hi>Dyardo</hi> your Cozin ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine:
that I referre to God to recompence, and to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
knowledge you shall receiue of mee héereafter, béeing
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>owe too olde to bee a Traytour, and my Sonne too louing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1616:60"/>
to proue disloyall. The King was abashed to heare his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
speake so audaciously, doubting nowe whether he should
giue credite to what had béene reported, especially against
him, so neere his highnes in bloode, who so liberally offered
to enter the Combat: notwithstanding his white heade and
aged body made him vnfit for such actions, wherefore hee
thus aunswered. Good Uncle, impute not mee any thing
faultie in your accusation, and that the proofe shall mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
that must be made. The Countie beeing present, was
strooken in a quandarie at these wordes, and gladly he wold
haue demed this former slaunder, but he could find no waie
cleanlie to doo it: wherefore seeing of force he must néedes
enter the Combat, he boldly fell on his knées before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King
with these wordes. My Lorde, what I haue saide is verie
certaine, and most true it is, that by the counsell of Prince
<hi>Adrian,</hi> héere present, his Sonne practised with Lady <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donya,</hi>
to poison you, that he might be King: which to make
good, there is my gadge, on the behalfe of my selfe and my
Cozins. Thou lyest Traytor in thy throate, said olde <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
I take thine offer: and as he woulde haue gone on with
further spéeches, <hi>Palmerin</hi> stept before the King, saying.
Worthy Lorde, séeing the effect of the wordes must be put
in execution, which haue béene heere spoken on bothe sides
before your Maiestie: may it please you the Prince <hi>Dyar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>
and Lady <hi>Cardonya</hi> may be sent for, to take with vs
their oathes as in such cases is required, and in meane time
let eache one goe put himselfe in equipage for the Combat.
Good reason said the King, and presently hee commaunded
the Princes to be brought, who beeing come, <hi>Palmerin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
where they were that tooke part with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
whereupon he presented his Cozins, the one named
<hi>Edron,</hi> proude and arrogant, and the other <hi>Edward</hi> of selfe
same qualitie. These two tooke their oathes with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that the Princes accused, conspired the Kinges death, in
such sort as hath béene before declared: and olde <hi>Adrian,
Dyardo,</hi> and fayre <hi>Cardonya</hi> sware the contrary. But it
<pb facs="tcp:1616:61"/>
is true, and I wil not denie it (said the Prince <hi>Dyardo)</hi> that
I haue and doo loue Ladie <hi>Cardonya,</hi> as much or rather
more then mine owne selfe, yet neuer did I cary any other
intent, but to request her in holie wedlocke, so pleased the
King and Quéene to like so well thereof as we coulde. But
that euer I intended treason or villainie, it is most false,
and Countie thou liest in thy throate, and thy copartners
that haue sworne with thee. It is sufficient, said <hi>Palmerin:</hi>
but my Lord, ꝙ he to the King, if wee be conquerers, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
shall bee deliuered, and the accusers hanged? What
saie you Countie, quoth the King? Good reason Sir, the like
doo we request if we be victors. Will you (saide <hi>Palmerin)</hi>
that eache shall helpe his fellow as he findes it conuenient?
What els? said the Countie, that is expedient. While this
talke endured, <hi>Edron</hi> regarded so well <hi>Palmerin,</hi> that hee
espied the Sworde which the Damosell carried in the Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
and brought to that Courte as she did to others, which
shewing the Countie, he saide out aloude. Where did the
deuils finde this Knight to giue him this Sworde? Belike
they gaue him strength to drawe it out, els he might haue
failed as manie other did: the Damosell was vnwise to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
it in such bad sorte. At which wordes <hi>Palmerin</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
angry, returned <hi>Edron</hi> this rounde au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(Knight) there is in thee more brauery and foolishe glorie
then manlie action, thou blamest mee before thou knowest
me, but ere you and I part, Ile finde better reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
on you, and beate better gouernment into your pate
with this sword that likes you not. This caused euery one
wishlie to beholde <hi>Palmerin,</hi> the King remembring that he
had séene the Sworde, which none in his Court coulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
to conquere: whereuppon he estéemed so well of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin,</hi>
as he commaunded <hi>Edron</hi> to silence, and all to goe

on his stomacke, called now for reuenge, wherefore
couching his Launce, he encountered him with such a full
carrire, as his Launce passed through his bodie, and <hi>Edron</hi>
tombled dead to the ground. In the meane while, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

so sore wounded as he could hardlie helpe himselfe: as for
<hi>Ptolome</hi> and <hi>Edward,</hi> they had astonied each other with
falles from their Horsses, but they recouered themselues
quicklie, and with sharpe strokes beganne to charge eache

vnhorssed, and therfore to recouer his honour, he came with
great furie towardes his enemie: which <hi>Palmerin</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
stept betwéene them, saying. To me Countie, to mee,
who wil bid more for thy heade then anie in the field. With
which wordes he reached him such a sure stroke on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head,
as made the fire flie foorth of his eyes: notwithstanding, as
a man of good courage, he stept aside, &amp; thrusting his sword
into <hi>Palmerins</hi> Horse throate, enforced him quickly to take
him to his féete: but all the worse for him as it fell out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde,
for <hi>Palmerin</hi> hauing beaten him out of breath, he
flong away his weapon, and caught him about the middle,
where they tugged so long togeather, that <hi>Palmerin</hi> get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him downe, and his knées on his belly, with his sword
soone tooke his heade from his shoulders. All this while
<hi>Ptolome</hi> had good play with his enemie, and after manie
daungerous woundes receiued on either side, at length hee
had the better of the daie by killing his aduersarie. Then he
and <hi>Palmerin</hi> went to the Iudges, who giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sentence

to contract a marriage betwéene him and his Niece
<hi>Polinarda,</hi> presenting her to him in his visions, as hath
béene declared. Hee thus deceasing, the King highly discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
at his Uncles harde fortune, caused him to be buried
in most sumptuous maner, making him a Tombe in forme
of a Piramides, the most excellent &amp; stately that euer was
in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and ouer against it, were hanged the bodies of
the Countie and his two Cozins, for his Trophe. Thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
thing quieted, and the funeralles of the Prince <hi>Adrian</hi>
solemnized, <hi>Palmerin</hi> woulde presentlie depart towardes
<hi>Allemaigne:</hi> but <hi>Ptolomes</hi> woundes were so daungerous,
as he was constrained to staie longer then he intended. In
the meane space, the King did them all the honour could be
<pb facs="tcp:1616:63"/>
deuised, in hope to stay them still in his Court, but it was
impossible, for <hi>Palmerin</hi> told him, he must néedes goe to the
Emperour, about affaires of very great importaunce. I

of the Gentlewoman, the bridegrome could haue
none, so highlie estéemed she her first loue: and continued
in opinion towards him so firme, as she graunted him ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce
into her Chamber at an appointed time, where hee
murdered her Husbande, and carryed the Lady with hym
whether he pleased. The bruite heereof was so soone spred
abroade, as the mother of the murdered Gentleman heard
thereof, whereuppon she made her complaint to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
who immediatlie sent to summon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other before him:
but they refusing to come, and hauing taken themselues to

as the Lady with her louer, at length were taken, &amp; hauing
confessed the trueth of their offence, sentence was giuen on

offender so gréeued heereat, as hee went to one of his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,

His Sister séeing him in this extreamitie, (as no

wherewith he should kill the Emperour and his Children,

failed to haue doone, but mine Uncle <hi>Adrian</hi> vnderstanding

and the people ranne on heapes from one place to another:
which made him remember what the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> had

for his Hoste in great feare came running to him, saying.</p>

will I fight with him, and if I die, I shall accompanie
many other in vnfortunate successe. With these words hee
tooke his Launce, and galloped that way where hee hearde
the tumult, which was at the Emperours Castell, where
the enchaunted Knight was shooting his arrowes at the
windowes he espied open. Ioyfull was <hi>Palmerin</hi> to finde
him in so fit a place, where his Lady <hi>Polinarda</hi> might giue
iudgment of his valour, which opinion did so renewe hys
courage, as presently he marched towards his enemie, who
held in his hande a <hi>Persian</hi> Bowe, with an arrow in it, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to shoote, hauing a great sorte more at his backe in his
Quiuer: he was of vnreasonable stature, yet with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce
sterne and couragious, all which could not dismay
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> but called to him in this maner. Proud Knight,
that by the ayde of deuils and euill spirits hast committed
monstrous cruelties: it is nowe time that hee whom thou
seruest should haue his pray, which is thy soule into endlesse
perdition. And so without staying for any aunswer, hee ran
valiantly against him: but the enchaunted Knight taking
his aduauntage, shot an arrowe at him so violently, as if
pierced through his Armour to the bare flesh. <hi>Palmerin</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
broken his Launce, with an yron Mace he had, he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
such a stroke to the Knight, as hee brake his Bowe in
two peeces, and the blowe falling on the head of his Horse,
made him therewithall fall deade to the grounde. The
Knight hauing recouered himselfe, tooke a Mace that hung
at his saddle Bowe, and came against <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who was
nowe on foote likewise: so layd they on loade terribly with
their Maces, that the Emperour and his Lordes and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
hearing the strokes, came to the windowes to see the
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat, little thinking that any one durst presinne to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with his enemie, yet all this while the Knights neuer
breathed, though theyr Sheeldes and Armour were very
much mangled, and their bodies wounded in many places.
<pb facs="tcp:1616:65"/>
And because <hi>Palmerin</hi> sawe the sight endure so long wyth
the Mace, he threw it downe and tooke him to his Sword,
wherewith he did so bumbaste him about the heade, as hee
could scant tell where to strike againe: but the Knight on
a suddaine lifting vp his Mace, gaue <hi>Palmerin</hi> such a stroke
betwéene the head and the shoulders, as made him reele to
and fro amazedly, yet comming to himselfe, and seeing the
Knight faint with his great expence of bloode, closed with
him, and casting his legge behinde him, threw him to the
grounde, when setting his foote on his brest to kéepe him
downe, with his sworde he parted hys head from his bodie.

                     <p>The Combat béeing thus ended, and the enchaunted

so please your highnes to affoorde me such fauour. With all
my hart Sir, said she, shall I entertaine you towardes the
Emperour, and on mine owne behalfe will prouide better
for you then I will speake of: and did it like you, I woulde
accept you for a Uirgins Knight héere, and none other.
Whereuppon shee called her Daughter <hi>Polinarda,</hi> saying.
Faire Daughter, this Knight as yet hath little acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1616:66"/>
in the Court, I praie you sée his entertainment maie
be good, because his desire is to make staie with vs, and for
your owne part, looke that you intreate him well, with this
request, that you accept him for your seruaunt, and he shall
be your Knight. And are you bothe agréed Ladies, said <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin?</hi>
Heauen forsake me if I refuse honour of so high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
And as they woulde haue procéeded on, the Emperor
came in and brake off their talke, and comming to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
saide. Madame, I beséeche you haue good regarde to
the health of this Knight, and let our Chirurgions not tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
the time with him, for I perswade my selfe, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted
Knight with his venomed arrowes, hath woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him with great daunger inwardlie, and hath besides
sore brused his bodie with the weight of his Mace. But
<hi>Palmerin</hi> hauing <hi>Polinarda</hi> so néere him, neither minded
his woundes or what the Emperour had spoken, his obiect
more delighted, then his woundes gréeued him, then the
Emperour taking him by the hande, saide. I pray you my
déere Freende to bee of good comfort, dispayre not for anie
thing I beseeche you, and bee aduised by them y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> haue care
of your health, for you shall want nothing if my Crowne
will purchase it. So departed hee and the Empresse, with
their Daughter <hi>Polinarda,</hi> whome loue had already so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigled,
that she (béeing yet but tender of yéeres) found her
selfe so restrained of her libertie, as scant she knewe howe
to dissemble this suddaine affection: and from that time
forward she became so sadde and pensiue, as one of her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
the most fauoured and familiar with her, named <hi>Brio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella,</hi>
Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> well perceiued it,
yet durst shee not presume to demaunde, whence procéeded
this strange alteration, but so circumspectly did she regarde
the Princesse, as she well noted the grounde of her gréefes.
Whereuppon it happened, that one time amongst other,
they two béeing alone togeather, <hi>Brionella</hi> iudging that her
Ladie delighted to heare spéeche of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> nowe to hitte
the nayl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> on the heade, she thus began. What say you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
<pb facs="tcp:1616:67"/>
(by your fauour) of the newe come Knight? did you
euer sée a brauer and more accomplisht Gentleman: Upon
my faith Madame, in mine opinion, I thinke that nature
hath wrought all her perfections in him, and fauoured him
aboue all other Knights in manhoode and Chiualrie. Ah
<hi>Brionella,</hi> aunswered the Princesse, thou art not alone of
this opinion, for I euer thought as much though I kept it
in silence: would God I had as great authoritie ouer him,
as he alreadie hath gotten ouer me. Is the matter so with
you, saide <hi>Brionella?</hi> it shoulde séeme you are in looue with
him then. To tell thée the trueth <hi>Brionella,</hi> quoth shee, I
am, and did I not doubt foure other hath preuented mee, I
would aduenture to make him mine. In good sooth Madam,
said <hi>Brionella,</hi> you two béeing vnited togeather in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall
league of loue, well might it bee reported the
most honourable match, and of the two noblest yong Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
through the whole worlde: and séeing you haue made
a choyse so worthie, dismay not good Madame, but proceede
in your determination. Thus deuised the two Ladies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who was no lesse in affliction for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> looue
of <hi>Polinarda,</hi> whom hee had searched with so gréat payne
and trauaile, and had nowe founde with so high good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
If loue was so earnest with him before in his sléeping
visions, hauing not séene her: much more vehement was
the impression nowe, hauing her in presence. Whereupon
the day folowing, he called for his garments, and as he was
making himselfe readie, the Emperour by one of his Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
sent him the good morrow, desirous to vnderstande
in what plight he felt himselfe. Good Sir, aunswered <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
to the Gentleman, I beséeche you doo my humble du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to the Emperour for this great courtesie, and you may
thus assure him, that (heauen be praised) I féele my selfe
in so good estate as euer I did. Which the Emperour hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
was highlie contented, and sent to desire his companie
to the Chappell, where <hi>Palmerin</hi> (neuer before so through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
touched with the forcible assaults of looue) glaunced so
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1616:67"/>
manie swéete lookes on the Princesse <hi>Polinarda,</hi> and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
so many sighes, the secrete Ambassadours of his harte,
as it was a heauen to him to be in these passions. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
and all the traine returned from the Chappell, they
went to meate, and <hi>Palmerin</hi> beeing placed right against
<hi>Polinarda,</hi> was in such fits as hee knewe not what counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
to vse: for his couller went and came in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as the Princesse might easilie iudge the cause of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
wherupon she presentlie presumed, that she had more
interrest in his thoughts then ere she looked for. The like
opinion conceiued he of her, yet was no other testimony de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
on either side, then sad countenances, the reuealers
of a tormented spirite. Thus continued these two louers,
till the Tables were withdrawne, and then the Lords and
Ladies fel to dauncing, in which delight and diuers other,
the whole day was spent, till the Empresse and her Ladies
departing to their Chambers, the good night on all sides
was reuerently giuen: when <hi>Palmerin</hi> went to his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in such an agonie, as more likelie to die then liue, hee
threwe himselfe on his bedde, where hauing sighed and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
long time gréeuously, at length hee brake foorth into
these tearmes. Ah <hi>Palmerin,</hi> vnhappy, wretched and moste
miserable, nowe art thou entred into such a Laborinth, as
impossible is it for thée to get out again with life, but what
shoulde mooue thee to so high an enterprise, béeing no way
able to equall her that is second to none? Alas, nowe doo I
plainlie sée the small credite is to bee reposed in Dreames,
and that the visions I saw in my Father <hi>Gerrards</hi> house,
on the Mountaine <hi>Artifaeria</hi> and els where, are friuolous
illusions, and of no account: with them may I ioyne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made mee by olde <hi>Adrian,</hi> who boasted to knowe so
much of my fortunes, for looue is not of such power on my
behalfe, that faire <hi>Polinarda</hi> either can or will make anie
reckoning of me. Then <hi>Palmerin</hi> resolue thy selfe suddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to die, that this inuisible and consuming fire, which by
little and little melts thée away, may bee extinguished, and
<pb facs="tcp:1616:68"/>
thy selfe eased. With these wordes he breathed foorth such
an extreame sighe, as <hi>Vrbanillo</hi> the Dwarffe (being néere)
hearde him, who doubting least any newe mischaunce had
happened, by the priuie woundes she enchaunted Archer
gaue him, made hast to know the cause of this euill. Ah <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banillo,</hi>
quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> I finde my selfe farre worse then
deade. What my Lorde, sayd the Dwarffe, now you ought
to be of best disposition, will you deceiue vs with this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
The Emperour neuer gaue you bad countenaunce
since your comming, whence then shoulde procéede thys
straunge conceit? No no <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> quoth hee, it is not the
Emperor, but a Lorde of greater power then his Maiestie.
It is Looue my Lad, the strickt commaunder of the stoutest
mindes, he hath conquered mee, and well I knowe I shall
die, if thou doo not finde the meane to helpe mee. By my
fayth my Lorde (quoth the Dwarffe) so please you to tell
me howe and wherein I may helpe you, let me die a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande
deathes if I doo it not. Understande then my good
<hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> sayd <hi>Palmerin,</hi> that this strange alteration, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the diuine lookes of my péerelesse Mistresse <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narda,</hi>
whose fiery beames haue searched so narowly euery
corner of my thoughts, as I must die because I loue too déer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
But couldest thou make knowne to her the least parte
of my insupportable vexations, may bee shee woulde haue
some pittifull remorse of my martirdome: for well may it
be iudged, that a Lady accomplished with so many vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perfections, must néedes bee stored with sweetnes, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and pittie. Not vnlike my good Lord, said <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi>
but doo not you remember how I was punished, when in
the like case I ventured to sollicite your looue to <hi>Laurana,</hi>
Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Durace?</hi> by my fayth my Lorde,
I shall not forget it while I haue a day to liue, and am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde
to fall againe into the like daunger. And this spake
<hi>Vrbanillo</hi> with such a grace, as <hi>Palmerin</hi> coulde not but
laugh, noting with what feare the deformed felow gaue
it foorth, whereupon he sayd. Thou needest not be dismaid,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1616:68"/>
if she that smote thée in thy sléepe bee that <hi>Polinarda,</hi> for
whose loue I am thus torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, &amp; for whom I was borne,
as many haue enformed me: I pray thée therefore speake
to her, and dreade no coullers. It is good, saide <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi>
that you woulde haue mee more hardie then you are your
selfe: speake to her your selfe if you dare, for I dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
it for feare of my life. If thou doost it not (quoth
<hi>Palmerin)</hi> assure thy selfe thou shalt neuer henceforth serue
me. Nay then (quoth the Dwarffe) I will rather put my
selfe in ieoperdy, to be better beaten then I was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last time
before I will loose so good a Maister. I pray thée doo, sayde
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> in respect thou séest the earnestnes of mine affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Feare not (quoth the Dwarffe) albeit you were a
great deale more fit to breake the matter then I: but I wil
gadge my life to gaine you the Ladie, and héereupon they

quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> were he better, hee is yours and his
Maister likewise, then called hee <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> who knéeling
to vnderstand his Maisters pleasure, hee saide: <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi>
I haue giuen you to my Ladie <hi>Polinarda</hi> as her man, will
you not serue her honourablie and truelie aboue all other?
Yea my Lorde, quoth he, next after you, but you will I not
leaue while I liue, although you woulde disdaine my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.
Good reason hast thou, said the Princesse, and wel am
I pleased it shold be so: yet during y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of his stay heere,
you shall forsake him and abide with mee. For y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Madame,
quoth the Dwarffe, I am well contented. Then looke you
faile not, said the Princesse, hencefoorth to giue your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce.
These spéeches were thus vsed as it were for pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
that shee might thereby deceiue the iudgments of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
but her whole intent was, to know of <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> if
his Maister were affected to any other Ladie, by whose
meanes her loue might be frustrate. For as you haue heard
a little before, that loue had brought her vnder such obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunce,

the Ladies with <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> who knewe so well howe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
himselfe, as from thence forward he grew so familiar
amongst them: as he woulde enter their Chambers when
himselfe pleased, vnder couller of attendaunce on the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<hi>Polinarda,</hi> from time to time to mooue his Maisters
messages. But at length she preuented him in this sort, for
béeing alone at a windowe in the presence Chamber, shee
called the Dwarffe, and making her entraunce by other
occasions, she asked him whose Sonne <hi>Palmerin</hi> was. God
knowes Madame, quoth hee, for I doo not, nor himselfe

neither: but of this I can assure you, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> neuer was Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Chiualrie better imployed by any then by him, for since

to the Dwarffe. I beséech thée <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> by the faith and

honour and aduantage. You haue so coniured mee, faire
Madame, quoth the Dwarffe, as death shall not make me
hide what you please to command, if it lye in me to resolue
you. Knowe then <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> said the Princesse, that I looue
thy Maister as well as my Brother <hi>Trineus,</hi> and am desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to knowe of thee, what Ladie it is hee estéemes aboue
all other, because when I knowe her, I may loue her the
better for his sake: withall, that I may commend the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
happines, whose fortune is to be loued of so braue a
Gallant. Well perceiued the Dwarffe, that now or neuer
was the time to bestirre himselfe, according to the promise
he made his Maister: wherefore hee aunswered the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
in this manner. Beléeue me Madame, were it to anie
other, I would not reueale such secrets of my Lorde as you
desire to knowe: but to you that are his Lady &amp; Mistresse,
I am content to bewraie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole. Suffiseth then Madame,
that he loueth in such sorte, as if the heauens sende him not
remedie the sooner, vnpossible is it that his life should long
endure: for I sée him so far beside himselfe, and tormented
<pb facs="tcp:1616:70"/>
with so manie passions, as euerie howre his death is expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
What will ye Ladie that I say? hee complaines, hee
sighes, and daie by daie is in such dispaire for his Ladies
loue: as happie might I haue accounted him, had he neuer
séene her, or that his daies were as short as his desires. If
then <hi>Polinarda</hi> were in doubt (not iudging herselfe to bée
shée) it may easilie bee imagined, and presently was shee
brought into such perplexitie, as the vermillion couller in
her chéekes began to change, such suddaine feares possessed
her, and so manie sundry opinions thwarted her conceite, as
faine she woulde haue spoken, but coulde not of long time,
wherby the Dwarffe discerned the cause of her alteration,
yet he dissembled what he sawe, and thus continued on his
discourse. Nowe considering (faire Madame) the high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
of my Lorde, may she be estéemed happy (as you saie)
that shall cause the losse of the best Knight liuing this day?

as that she would loue and fauour him, as he dooth &amp; hath

Princesse, when I knowe the Ladie, I will, and beside, if
she doo not regarde his passions as she ought, I will intreate
her at my request to be more pittifull. These wordes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
a suddaine iealouzie in her, that shee shoulde promise
to another what she desired her selfe: yet earnest to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued,
she vowed to fulfill her promise, and therefore desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to tell her name. So you will giue mee your
worde Madame, quoth the Dwarffe, not to take in ill parte
what I shall saie, I will satis-fie your request presently. Be
léeue me, saide the Princesse, I will not, rather perswade
thy selfe, that héerein thou doost me great pleasure. Ah fayre
Princesse, quoth the Dwarff, it is for you and no other that

my Lord is thus tormented, it is for you that heé liues and
dies a hundred times a daie: swéete Ladie haue pittie on
him, and séeke not the losse of so good a Knight, who looues
you déerer then his owne life. At which aunswere shee was
supprized with incredible pleasure, yet feigning the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
she saide: Is it I? and howe long I praie you? By my
faith Madame, quoth he, that can I not well tell yee, but I
haue hearde him say of long time, more then foure yeeres
before he was Knighted, hee vowed himselfe yours: since
which time, all his honourable actions hath hee onely dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to your praise. So that to finde you, hee left the King
of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and his Sonne <hi>Florendos,</hi> of whom hee was
estéemed as no man the like, yet that honour hée forsooke to
doo you seruice: and for your loue he yéelded himselfe as vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile
to the Emperour your Father, and gaue himselfe your
Knight if you deigne to accept him. When <hi>Polynarda</hi> had
well hearde the Dwarffe, (albeit her harte floted in ioyes)
yet could she so well commaunde her thoughts, as shee see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to make smal account of his words: notwithstanding,
she returned him this aunswéere. I promised thée <hi>Vrbanil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
not to conceiue ill of ought thou shouldest tell me, nor doo

you would please to vouchsafe him time and place, hee will

Maister, aunswered the Dwarffe, as you haue good occasion
to repute your selfe, the moste fortunate Knight that euer
bare Armes. Then <hi>Palmerin</hi> embracing him, saide. Ah tell
me what they are, hast thou spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with diuine <hi>Polinarda?</hi>
takes shee anie pittie on my consuming cares? That dooth
she my Lorde, quoth the Dwarffe, and commandes you by
me, [if you be so vowed hers as I haue perswaded] y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hence
foorth you depart not the Emperours Courte without her
leaue. Then recited he the whole talke betwéene them, and
lastlie the pleasure she conceiued in so good tydings, so that
she accepted him onelie for her Knight. While y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Dwarffe
continued this discourse, <hi>Palmerin</hi> was rauished with such
inwarde ioy, as with a great sigh, he said. Oh heauens, how
doo you fauour me? nowe sée I well, that my seuerall appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions
on the Mounts of Oliues and <hi>Artifaeria,</hi> are prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinations
ordeyned to mee by your gracious prescience: I
beséeche you therefore humblie, that what you haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
may soone come to effect, for the regarde of incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Polinarda.</hi> Then demaunded hee, by what meanes he
might attaine to speake with the Princesse? She sayth, ꝙ
he, that you shall dailie haue her in the presence, or in the
Empresse Chamber, and there may you safely impart your
whole minde vnto her. But I haue other newes to tel yee,
for I vnderstand certainlie, that the Emperour intendes a
matter greatlie for your aduauntage: he minds to morrow
to visite one of his Castelles neere at hande, and there to
passe the time in honour of the Ladies, will haue a Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
There (better then any where els) may you and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linarda</hi>
conferre togeather: therfore courage your selfe, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1616:71"/>
goe keepe comanie with my Lorde the Emperour, it may
bee himselfe will acquaint you with this enterprise. Now
credite me <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> thou hast doone so
much for mee, as I shall neuer recompence thée while I
liue: but I pray thée tell mee, did shee not at the first take
my message strangelie? That did she (quoth the Dwarffe)
when I perswaded her that you loued a Lady in such sorte,
as hardlie coulde you liue without her fauourable regarde:
then she thinking it was some other and not herselfe, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
couller meruailous passionatlie, but let it suffise you,
that she is as deepe in loue as you are or can be. So went
<hi>Palmerin</hi> to the Emperour, who calling him to him, saide.
My noble Freende, I shal make knowne to you, what hath
béene concluded in your absence, the Ladies of our Courte
haue beene so long lockt in, for feare of the enchaunted
Knight whom you haue slaine, as they haue desired to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
a little: for which cause, and to pleasure them, I am
thus determined. Two leagues hence haue I a goodly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell,
enuironed with woods and pleasant Meddowes, there
may wee hunte the wilde Harte and Bore with other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times:
but nowe haue I caused Scaffolds and other proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to be made there for a Tourney, and fortie Knightes
will I appoint in this action, tenne against tenne, and the
first conquerers shall keepe the fielde against tenne other
that shall reuenge the tenne vanquished, so hauing all iou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
they shall fight at Barriers with rebated swordes, and
the brauest Champion shall haue a rich Iewell, which the
Empresse hath prouided for the purpose. Nowe woulde I
haue you one of the ten challengers, and my Nephew <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nareno</hi>
on the Defendants side, for him doo I esteeme one
of the best Knights in my Courte: will you not doo thus
much at my request? God forbid, saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> that I
shoulde refuse any thing you please to commaunde. These
newes were immediatly published through the Courte,
which made euery Knight speedilie to prepare himselfe, in
hope to be of the number of the fortie, that should performe
<pb facs="tcp:1616:72"/>
the Tourney: and thus they priuilie imparted to their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
howe they would breake both Sword and Launce for
their loue. Among whom <hi>Ptolome</hi> was not the last, for he
so affected the yong Princesse <hi>Brionella,</hi> as he had made her
sole Mistresse of his hart, yet coulde he not find the meanes
to acquaint her therewith: but the next day, as shee rode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Ladies, they had good leysure to conferre togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and before they arriued at the Castell, they discouered
thorowlie to eache other their affections, promising mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
such a iust consent in loue, as the one should bragge of
the others happines. While they continued their amorous
discourses, <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who had newlie presented himselfe to
<hi>Polinarda,</hi> was greatly discontented, because so soone as he
came to her, the Empresse called her, and left not talking
with her till they alighted from horsebacke: notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
before night, he gayned recompence for that disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
for after Supper, the Emperor and the Ladies went
a walking by a goodlie Riuers side, there to disporte them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in the coole of the euening. Nowe was it the merrie
Maie moneth, when the fieldes were richlie decked with
Natures Tapistrie, and <hi>Cupid</hi> gaue oportunitie to hys
Subiects, to contemplate theyr swéete and affable desires,
and well came it to passe for <hi>Palmerin,</hi> while <hi>Trineus</hi> and
<hi>Ptolome</hi> were conuerssing with the Empresse: that he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his Mistresse by the arme, walked with her amongst
the faire flowers, and seeing the time and place serue him
so well, trembling (as supprised with a vehement passion)
thus began. Madame, your gracious nature will not count
it strange, but rather take it in good part, that I a Knight
errant, and as yet vnknowne among courtlie assemblies,
should presume to make known a secrete to you, which my
selfe dare not imagine without reuerence, &amp; death can cause
me declare to none: nor may I procéede without some assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of my vncertaine hope, by her diuine pittie that giues
me life. And although the wordes of my Dwarffe haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
me with your princely fauour, sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to expel all
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1616:72"/>
feare and suspition of reproofe: yet such is the height wher
to I aspire, as the greatest Monarche in the worlde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>anne
scantly deserue, then well may I estéeme my selfe vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But doubting whether your spéeches were such, or
that my Dwarffe (as such as he often may doo) hath repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
more then he had in charge: I am desirous, (trusting on
your benignitie and speciall fauour aboue all other) to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande,
if your pleasure bee so highlye to honour mee,
as henceforth to accept me for your Knight and Seruaunt.
And if such vndeserued grace may fall to my lot: I shall not
onely acknowledge, that Fortune hath directed my course
to the onely place of honour, but shall haue good occasion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
to make knowne by my Knighthoode, that I am the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
of the most faire Princesse. Héerein good Madame,
you shall not dissent from reason, if I hauing lost my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
by beeing onelie yours, want the modestie that shoulde
sheelde me in your high regarde: therefore may you swéete
Ladie in mine excuse, accuse loue and your celestial beauty,
bothe stronger to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande then I to gainesay. My Dwarff
hath let you knowe (as he tolde me) part of the paine I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
for your sake, which you cannot but thinke well off, in
that my destenie so commaunded mee, long time before I
sawe or knewe you, not alone in visions, but by manifest
sollicitings, so that in search of you, I haue suffered such tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
as maruaile it is that nature coulde make me able to
sustaine. Notwithstanding, I account all right happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed,
if I may gaine fauour in your gracious eyes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it is vnpossible for me to liue: for there is no part
possessing life or spirite in mee, that is not vowed to your
onelie seruice. These words were dipt in teares, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red
with manie a bitter sigh, which mooued <hi>Polinarda</hi> to
such compassion, as taking him by the right hand, she began
to playe with his fingers, her trembling testifying her
secrete afflictions: and breaking off <hi>Palmerins</hi> discourse, as
he thought to haue continued longer, thus aunswered. Syr
Knight, it seemes by your countenaunce that you dispayre
<pb facs="tcp:1616:73"/>
of something, or els haue more fortitude then I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.
Esteeme you mee of so simple iudgment, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your valour and knightly perfections, I shoulde not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
my selfe happy to haue so braue a Champion? Let it
suffise you, that what <hi>Vrbanillo</hi> tolde you, is true, and in
regarde of the paine you suffer for my loue, and fancying
mee so firmelie as you doo: beléeue mee good Knight, you
feele no gréefe, but it is as familiar with me, so that what
thought you haue of mee, the like haue I of you, as time and
the vnspotted loue I beare you shall witnesse, in meane
time promise me not to depart my Fathers Court without
my consent. And because I sée the Ladies approching, refer
we the rest till some other time, when wee shall haue more
leysure to conferre togeather: and tell mee nowe if you bee
determined to ioust to morrowe? That will I Madame,
quoth hee, if it please you to commaunde me. In sooth saide
she, I will not hinder ye, because I knowe the honor of the
Tourney will be yours: for my sake therefore shall you
were this Bracelet, as a signe of my fauour and pledge of
my loue. So taking off her Bracelet, shee gaue it to <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
who receiued it with no little content: and so concluding
their talke, because manie Knights and Ladies came about
them, they walked where the Emperor and the Empresse
were, deuising with <hi>Ptolome</hi> and <hi>Trineus.</hi> Nowe because
darke night drew on, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> euening dewe was dangerous,
they returned to the Castell, entending the next day after

ordering himselfe to run first, tooke a strong Launce,

am sure you will bestowe some gift on Sir <hi>Palmerin,</hi> in

swéete blushing in the Princesse countenaunce, not a little
reioysing that he whom shee loued, had carryed awaie the
prize from all the other Knights: so with a prettie modest
smile, she tooke a chayne of Gold from about her neck, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Sée heere Sir <hi>Palmerin</hi> what I giue yee, this gift is
to tye and chaine you in such sort, as you may neuer depart

well perceiuing, that without her

<pb facs="tcp:1616:76"/>
her desires, wherefore without any longer stay, shee thus
began with her. My chosen Freende, I would make known
one thing vnto thée, which death can compell me discouer to

speeches, in respect of my calling, not doubting but in time
to recompence any paine thou takest for me. Fayre Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
said <hi>Brionella,</hi> in that you doo me such honor, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

of the Princesse, knewe not readilie what to aunswere, but
séeing that by these meanes she might more easily conferre
with <hi>Ptolome,</hi> whom shee likewise intirelie loued, thus
spake. It is no wonder Madame, you béeing so incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as I knowe no Prince liuing of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you are not woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
if you haue resolued your loue on noble <hi>Palmerin,</hi> in
that there is no Knight in the worlde better deserues you,
his rare chiualrie beeing such, as it cannot otherwise bee,
but that he is discended of royall linage, béeing accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with so many speciall perfections. Therefore Madam,
so like you, I haue deuised well for your purpose, as thus.
You knowe my Chamber window standes so commodious,
as you may with safetie confer with him at pleasure, which
you may let him vnderstande by his Dwarffe, and appoint
him time as you shall thinke conuenient. This counsel did
not a little content y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Princesse, because she longed to chatte
with her louer, and therefore concluded at his departure to
appoint <hi>Palmerin</hi> his time. Nowe was the Chamber of
<hi>Brionella</hi> ioyning to the Cittie wall, and had a goodly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
into the fieldes, and <hi>Palmerins</hi> lodging was néere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, facing the wall as the other did: so that one might
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1616:76"/>
easilie passe betwéene the lodgings, nothing béeing betwixt
them but a little Garden, brauelie decked with flowres,
and goodlie fruite Trées. The time appointed, <hi>Polinarda</hi>
called the Dwarffe to her, saying. <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> thou shalt goe
to thy Maister from me, and after thou hast saluted hym
with my manifolde well wishinges, wil him this night to
come secretlie to Lady <hi>Brionellas</hi> Chamber, where at the

misdoubt my Lady <hi>Brionella,</hi> for I haue made her acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with all my secrets. And because thy selfe maist conduct
him to the place, come, and I will presently she we it thee.
So went the Dwarffe with <hi>Polinarda</hi> to <hi>Brionellas</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where hauing séene the windowe, and gladde to carrie
such tydings to his Maister, beeing well assured howe they
woulde content him: he departed, and tarried not long on
his message, because <hi>Palmerin</hi> thought each howre a yeere
to heare from his Mistresse, wherefore hee beholding the
Dwarffe comming, tooke him in his armes, and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
what newes he had brought him? The Dwarffe with
a cheerefull countenaunce thus aunswered. My Lord, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
speede you as luckilie, as the newes that I bring you
doo well deserue. By this beginning, <hi>Palmerin</hi> perceiued
that he brought such tydings as he long looked for, which
was, howe he might speake with the Princesse: wherfore
embracing him againe, he commaunded him to make report
of that his sweete Mistresse had giuen him charge. Then
the Dwarffe deliuered, howe the Princesse had great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to see him, and where shee did intende to speake with
him. Which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        </gap>illed with vnspeakable
ioyes, he recorded the words to himselfe with many ittera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the more often he spake the words, the more his
delights increased. But tell me, (quoth he to the Dwarffe)
didst thou marke the place well, where I must talke with
my Goddesse? Thereof doubt you not my Lorde, sayde the
Dwarffe, for I shall not faile to bring you surely thither, if

her selfe, in company of Lady <hi>Brionella</hi> shewed it me. How
am I beholding to her, said <hi>Palmerin,</hi> for this high fauour,

which <hi>Ptolome</hi> reputed for his great auaile: thys

togeather, and séeing the time readie to countenaunce theyr
enterprise, tooke eache of them a rich Mantle, and wyth
theyr Swordes vnder their armes, went out at a windowe
vppon the walles: and albeit the passage was somewhat
daungerous, yet loue had so encouraged them, as without
regarde of daunger or fortune, they came to the windowe
which the Dwarffe shewed them, not séene by any. <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narda</hi>
who was most attentiue, hearing the trampling of
theyr feete, sayde to <hi>Brionella.</hi> Is not this <hi>Palmerin?</hi> So
opening the Casements, they sawe <hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Ptolome</hi>
attending like dilligent Seruants. If then bothe parties
were pleased it is not to be doubted, nothing in the worlde
more contenting them then the sight of each other. And
truelye <hi>Palmerin</hi> and the Princesse had great reason, for
beside that their fatall destenies did so prouoke them, theyr
equal natures were so commendable and correspondent, as
though they had neuer séene, yet were they borne to loue
togeather. Now was <hi>Polinarda</hi> very brauely acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in a gorgious night Mantle, and such soft white silkes, as
the shewed more bright then the morning Starre, her firie
pointed lookes so wounding <hi>Palmerin,</hi> as rapt vppe as it
were into a second heauen, he remayned silent a long time,
not able to speake a worde. The Princesse was likewise in
the selfe same conceit, and so ouercome with regarde of her
Paramour, as she continued mute, and was loth to giue the

and like-warme blood of his hart, deliuered manifest eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
how truelie he loued the Princesse, who bearing him
companie in all arguments of loue, thus answered. I doubt
not Sir <hi>Palmerin,</hi> but the looue you beare mee is excéeding
great, noting your earnest affections, and the great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
you haue sustained in searche of me, and no other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
doo I request to be perswaded by, béeing as vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in affection towards you, as you are to me, for proofe
whereof, this attempt maie suffise, that against my duetie
I should be séene thus secretlie, in a place so suspicious, and
time so vnnecessarie. But if I haue offended héerein, accuse
those séemelie perfections which I haue regarded in you,
and the confidence I repose in your good conceit, coupled
with the honourable estimation y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is generallie reputed in
your vertues. Pardon me (swéete Ladie) saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> if
by my longing desire to speake with you, I haue in anye
thing displeased, for earnest good will to doo you seruice,
constrained me to be thus importunate. The matter is far
from anie desert of offence, quoth the Princesse, for hither
are you come by my commaundement, to the ende that wee
might sée one another, and talke of such thinges as neerest
concerne vs: and therefore resolue your selfe good Knight,
that I esteeme you aboue all other, and promise you by the
faith of a Princesse and loyall Fréende, to die rather then
anie other shall be Lorde of me. Which verie words, so ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished
his sences, as verie hardlie he could sustaine himself:
whereuppon <hi>Polinarda</hi> put her hande out at the windowe,
which he in often kissing well marking, behelde the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter

hee, this is the token that makes me the happiest man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
As howe I pray you? saide she, what know you héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
Then <hi>Palmerin</hi> discoursed all his dreames and visions,
and bréefely ranne thorow repetition of his whole life, how
the wise <hi>Adrian</hi> had sent him the Shéelde of Sable, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

in was figured a hand fast closed togeather, signifying the

I was desirous to know the meaning of that Sheeld, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I sawe a Siluer hand closed, which you bare the first day
of the Tournament, béeing nowe not a little glad that you
haue so satis-fied me. Afterwarde <hi>Palmerin</hi> made knowne
to her, the marke himselfe had on his face, which agreed
with hers in perfect likelihoode. O God (quoth she) happie
be the time of this meeting, blame me not my Lorde to bee

haue so appointed: this will cause mee to liue in more hope
of good successe, then before I did, and that our amitie will
sorte to such ende, as our two harts shall bee combined in
one, yet let mee sée I beséeche you the marke on your face,
howe neere it resembles this on my hand. She fetching a
Taper which burned in the Chamber, lifted vp his comelie
locks of hayre, and sawe them bothe shaped in one forme,
wherefore suddainly setting awaie the light, shee embraced
<hi>Palmerins</hi> heade in her armes, and sealed many swéete kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
on his amiable Charracter. The like louing salutation
passed betwéene <hi>Ptolome</hi> and <hi>Brionella,</hi> at another Case<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Windowe, with sollemne vowes and protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
neuer to faile in their loue, and this to be the place for
conuersing on their desires, till Fortune affoorded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

but that the Dwarffe came to his Maister in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
My Lorde, I thinke you can neuer finde time to make

you all? in sooth it is time you were in your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
<hi>Palmerin</hi> who was lothe to depart from the pleasure
of his thoughts, made small account of the dwarffes words
and continued on in amorous deuises: but the Princesse a
litle more fearefull then he, seeing the Dwarffe said true,
and lothe to be séene suspitiously, said. My Lord, it is time to
breake off, but I pray you faile not of your promise, let vs

<hi>Agariell,</hi> valiant, wise and
vertuous, hauing thrée Sonnes,
whereof the second was the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest
Knight at Armes, being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Lewes.</hi> This King <hi>Agariell,</hi> the more to honour hys
Knights and noble Gentlemen abyding in his Realme, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to keepe open Court for all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>mmers, as none
of his predecessors euer did the like before him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sent abroade his Heraldes, Gentlemen of his escuyrie
and others, to summon his Lords and Barrons of <hi>Fraunce,</hi>
that on a day appointed they would all méete at the Court.
And because none shoulde be ignoraunt what hee intended,
he requested that all Gentlemen professing Armes, at the
feaste of Easter following, shoulde repaire to <hi>Parris,</hi> beeing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1616:79"/>
the heade and cheefest Cittie of his Realme. The Queene
likewise aduertised al Ladies and Gentlewomen, at whose
commaunde euery one obeyed, so that in fewe dayes the
Courte was furnished with Lordes and L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dies: nothing

                        </gap> thither. Now
was the Duke aged, a man of good prouidence, and a tryed
Knight, hauing matched in marriage with the King of
<hi>Denmarks</hi> Sister, a yong beautiful Ladie, and of vertuous
education: the Duke hoping to haue issue by her, because
by his first Wife he could not haue any. The King aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of the Dukes comming, commaunded his Son <hi>Lewes</hi>
with an honourable traine to goe entertayne him, which he
did, so that many solemne reuerences passed betweene the
Duke and him, as also to the Duchesse, whom as he welco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with manie salutations, so did he earnestle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>template
her excellent beautie, reputing her fairer then the fayrest,
and on a suddaine became amorous of her, such a violent
breach made loue into his hart at the very first sight of her.
In this great and vnlooked for vexation, hee conducted her
to the lodging was prepared for the Duke, dissembling so
well as hee coulde his newe desire: but so vehement was
his oppression, as without returning againe to the King,
he went to his Chamber. Prince <hi>Lewes</hi> béeing thus alone
by himselfe, Loue not a little tryumphing of his new pray,
tormented his thoughts with so manie conceits, as all the
night he spent in sighes and dolorous laments, his mind stil
trauailing by what meanes he might compasse his intent.
Sometimes he thought it vnpossible in respectet of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Duke,
then againe as easie because of his age, a contrarie too y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse:
all which imaginations wrought so diuersly in him,
as his spirite forsaking counsell &amp; reason, made him breake
foorth into these exclaimes. Ah heauens, haue you
beautie with such excellencie, as to cause me endure a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more then mortall? Ah mine eyes, too lauishe were
<pb facs="tcp:1616:80"/>
you in beholding her, who cannot chuse but vtterly disdaine
thée, thou hast no acquaintaunce with her, and therefore let
thy death chastise thy boldnes. Yet mayst thou bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in thine opinion foolish man, perhappes in offering her
thy seruice she may accept it, for the Duke is old, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to die, howe happy were it for thee to be his executor for
his Ladie? Dispayre not then man, for things thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
are easiest oftentimes in performance. In these and
such like tearmes hee spent the night, and séeing the fayre
morning salute him at his Chamber windowe, he arose, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
that day to bewray his passions to the Duchesse,
and knowing that the Duke would goe visite the Quéene,
accompanied with many Knights he came to bid him good-morrow,
which the Duke taking very kindly, requited him
with many thankes, ignoraunt that for the faire Wyfe, he
was so courteous to the olde Husband. The Duke hauing
taken his way to the Queene, <hi>Lewes</hi> kept company wyth
the Duchesse very mannerlie, wayting oportunitie to dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
his affections, and reuiewing her beautie so perfecte
and rare, not able longer to hold, beganne thus. It is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
Madam, if fayre beautie should be so bitter, as a man
cannot surfette but hee must néedes die. The Duchesse not
knowing of whom the Prince spake, nor as yet regarding
that he was in loue, aunswered. In sooth my Lord, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
hath small reason, that shee shoulde vse you so hardlie, yf
you meane it by your selfe. In bréefe Madame, quoth hée, it
is you haue wounded me, and none but you can ease my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions:
if then (swéete Lady) you retaine such pittie, as
all your other excellencies shewe you to haue, you wyll not
disdaine to giue me remedie, which if you doo, for euer I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
your Knight and loyall Fréende. And in mine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Madame, you can not well refuse me, séeing Fortune
hath béene such an enemie to you in marriage, the Duke
beeing olde and full of mellanchollie, you yong, tender and
daintie as may be, hee more méete to kéepe companye wyth
<hi>Atropos</hi> the mortall Goddesse, then liue with a Saint of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1616:80"/>
so rare perfections. But had my luck beene such, before you
were espoused to haue knowne you, I woulde with valoure
haue hindered your briding so, or Fortune should haue foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
denied me: for such is my religion in looue, as better
death then discontent, and had I béene Lord of <hi>Europe,</hi> you
had béene Ladie. Notwithstanding Madame, so like it you,
I may be your Freende and knightly seruaunt: for Loue
wants no wyles to compasse desire, and my sute is modest
if you count it not vnséemely. The Duchesse, whom swéete
loue could easilie entice to folly, hardly might resist a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
conquest: wherefore chaunging countenaunce, and not
daring to reueale what she gladly would, sayd. Trust mee
my Lorde, your speeches are not comely, to violate chaste
wedlocke is so monstrous, as you can haue no priuiledge to
aske, nor I to graunt, and therefore content ye. This aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
albeit it was sharpe, and scant pleasing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince,
yet loue so perswaded him, that the Duchesse had another
meaning then she bewrayed: for nothing her countenaunce
so full of change, he gessed that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me sparks had fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
her affections, wherefore he began againe. I beséeche
you Madame accuse Loue, if I haue spoken to your disly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
yet hope I to sée the time, when I shall make knowne
howe great my affection is to doo you seruice: and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this talke he brought her to the Quéenes lodging, Loue
following them bothe so narrowlie at the héeles, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse
was no lesse affectionate then <hi>Lewes</hi> was passionate.
Which when he got some light of, in hope to purchase hys
his desire, he sollicited her in more secrete manner then hee
was wont, so that being one day in place where they might
familiarlie talke: <hi>Lewes</hi> perseuering in his enterprise, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
what torments he suffered for her loue, whereuppon
the Duchesse, not onely by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes reasons which were
perswasiue, but as well to mittigate her owne oppressions,
thus aunswered. Great is the force of your perswasions my
Lord, but greater is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> of looue, which hath made me yours:
so that what you request, I cannot denie, and though it

stand not with mine honour, yet such is my fortune. Let me
intreate you therefore to conceale this loue so discréetlie, as
none may knowe of it, especially my Lord the Duke, and
expect the day that shall yéelde you content and make mee
happy. This aunswere so highly pleased the Prince, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by the diuine force of loue that gouerns vs bothe, to bee for

me, then you shall like and well allowe of, for otherwise I
were not worthy this speciall fauour. The Duchesse than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

loue was depriued of libertie, threw many swéete glaunces
at the Mistresse of his affections, perswading himselfe, that
nature neuer made a more perfect creature, and not able to
make her like againe, burst her molde, whereupon hee said.
Lordes and Ladies, who with such aduauntage haue chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on beautie, vnderstand that such as you haue yet spoken
of, or seuerally in your owne thoughts shall thinke vppon:
may not be equall with one that I knowe, euen she that is
Ladie and commaunder of my hart, whose beautie is so far
beyond all other, as bright <hi>Cynthia</hi> from the goodliest star

(being carried awaie with priuate opinion) I vse these spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,

Nowe in regard that none shall pleade ignoraunce, I will

whom they honor most: and if Fortune frowne on them in
such sort as they be vanquished, they shall there leaue their
Ladies Image, to be placed vnder my Mistresse as her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.
Nowe if my vnhappy Starres so crosse me, as I loose
the credite I would bee lothe, the conquerer shall enter in

Knights willing thus to aduenture, shall be heere receiued.
His spéeches ended, the Gentlemen present could not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile

that the ending of matters is greater then the beginning.
The Duke humbly thanking the King, aunswered. Wee
doubt not my Lorde, but by the hope of God and fauour of
our Ladies, to ende our affaires with fortunate successe, but
if nowe we should giue ouer, and not goe forward with our
promise, we might woorthily be reprooued of shame &amp; cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardise,
the most villainous reproches that can be to any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hart. The King perceiuing the earnest affection of these
two yong Princes, and that to denie their request would be
more hurtfull then to graunt: commaunded him againe to
procéede with their intent, with such suretie against all
strange Knights, as what losse or victory happened to them,
they must be content with all that fell out. The Duke not
a little ioyfull, kissing his highnes hande departed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
acquainted Prince <hi>Lewes</hi> therewith: but nowe
the Queene vnderstanding her Sonnes enterprise, sent for
him, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sad countenance thus spake. I would (my Son)
that the intent of you and the Duke of <hi>Sauoye,</hi> were eyther
awhile deferred, or vtterly forgotten, because I greatlie
doubt, that the ende will bring a further consequence then
you expect. For thinke you, that by all your forces and Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualries,
the beauties of your Ladies shalbe any iote increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?
no beléeue me: but if they loue you as loyall Freendes
ought to doo, as greatlie wil they dislike your enterprise, as
feare the daunger whereinto you may fall, a matter cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

to them, then anie honor you may winne can please

dying dishonor I shall gaine thereby, which makes mee
desire a thousande deathes, then not to bee so good as my
worde: therefore perswade your selfe good Mother, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
her beautie for whom I enter the Combat, cannot bee
more perfect hereby, in that it is without imperfection, yet
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1616:83"/>
such is my resolution in a matter so certaine, as her sweete
lookes shall deliuer me strength enough to ende my taske,
without dreade of any inconuenience y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> may happen. The
Duchesse (enflamed with loue) hearing these wordes on
her behalfe, must needes speake, and thus began. I knowe
not (my Lorde) who is the Ladie you loue, nor what are
her vertues, but heereof I can assure you, that she is highlie
beholding to you, and (except great reason to the contrarie)
ought to loue you, considering what perill you thruste your
selfe into for her beautie. Madame (quoth the Prince) the
trauaile I shall take, and the bad fortunes may befall mee,
are little &amp; of no account in respect of her gracious deserts,
therefore for her honour, I will beare my inwarde paines
with secrete content, and attempt these outwarde actions
with the greatest courage I can possible, desiring no other
recompence then her fauourable conceit, whereof once assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
nothing can seeme difficult to me, no, were it to dye in
her diuine seruice. And as he would haue continued longer,
the King (not yet thorowlie content with his promise past
to the Duke of <hi>Sauoye)</hi> entered the Chamber, by whose
countenaunce, <hi>Lewes</hi> wel knewe he was <hi>mal content</hi> wyth
him, wherefore falling on his knée, hee saide. My Lorde, no
one is ignoraunt, how all my welfare and reputation consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
onelie in your Maiestie, as a Prince and Father, the
most vertuous that I know, which great good in some part
to recompence, I haue enterprised a matter vnwoorthie of
dislike, so please your highnes (of your accustomed bountie)
to excuse &amp; accept it in good part, in respect that such as are
borne to the highest places of dignitie, ought to bee more
prompt and readie to all magnanimious actions, then theyr
inferiors, chéefelie in prowesse, chiualry, and deedes of esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.

Uncles, and auncient progenitours, neuer made them noble
or ought renowmed: what then? onely vertue, the very
formatrix of all nobilitie. For this cause my good Lorde
and Father, hauing now oportunitie, as my Cozin y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Duke
of <hi>Sauoye</hi> hath informed you, may it please your grace to
permit my endeuours with fauour, to the ende I may deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
perfect testimonie, that I no whit degenerate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your

well you know howe to disguise and couer your follye wyth
vertues coullers, God sende it to fall out so well: arise, and
be it as your Cozin and you haue requested. See in meane
tune that you prouide all needfull occasions, that when the

his Father, arose, euery one present not a little reioycing,
because they feared all woulde be squandered. Then began
the Lordes and Ladies to conferre togeather, and the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse
departing to her lodging, béeing manned by the
Prince, did not [as I thinke] repent herselfe of her loue, as
a number of you (martching vnder the same Ensigne) wold
doo the like in such a case. In fine, the Duchesse fearefull of
the thwarts of Fortune, that she would work her disgrace
by some bad coniectures or wounding reports, said. I know
well (my Lorde) the good will you beare me, without anie
further shewes or confirmations by actions so daungerous,
which I had rather die then beholde, and therefore whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
you shall performe, will condemne mee as vnwoorthy

soone as I heard these newes from <hi>Fraunce)</hi> that it would
not passe without your presence, which displeaseth mee, not

you néede not <hi>Palmerin</hi> hide it from mée. My Lord (ꝙ

the Ladie is indebted to you, and you declare vnspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

delight to haue it by your presence, then thirste after such
applause with your absence. But séeing you will néedes to

whereuppon he knéeled before his Father, intreating him
not to denie him one request. Demaunde what thou wilt
my Sonne (quoth he) I graunt it thée. Then I beséech you
good Father, saide he, to suffer mee sée <hi>Fraunce</hi> with noble
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> that I may bee acquainted with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courtesie and
ciuilitie of that nation, not doubting but soone to deserue my

these high and woorthie déedes of Armes, happilie they may
entice me to follow their vertues: beside, if nowe I loose so
good an occasion offered, I knowe not when I shal compasse
the like commoditie, therefore (good Father) let me not be
denied. The Emperor offended for his rashe promise to his
Sonne, laboured to change his minde, but all woulde not
serue, for the Prince promised to goe so couertlie, as none
should knowe him. Wherefore he called <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who as

you shall not goe alone in your voyage, for my Sonne <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>
desires to be your companion: for which cause I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to you, and desire you to conceiue so well of him, as
at your returne we maie be all merrie togeather. Which
<hi>Palmerin</hi> promised, whereuppon the Emperour called for
the Maister of his Horse, commanding him that all things
might bee in readines against their departure: all which
was doone with such diligence, as the thirde daie following
all thinges prepared, they tooke their leaue of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

Alas my Lord, what mind is this in you, thus to voyage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<hi>Fraunce,</hi> and leaue mee alone sad and sollitarie? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
not content to hazard so long a iourney, but a daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

béeing péereles (as I haue hearde) among those of highest

(swéete Fréende) I intreate you with all my hart, and
by the vnfained loue you beare me, to leaue such dangerous
enterprises, where death is commonlie more frequent
then life. These wordes came with such amiable coniurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the Princesse, as <hi>Palmerin</hi> (though loth to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded)
answered. Let me preuaile with you so farre good
Madame, as not to mislike my enterprise for your gracious
loue, for the honour you haue doone me, in making mee your
Knight, I prize at no lesse valew then my déerest blood, and
shoulde I be helde from these <hi>French</hi> exploits, vnwoorthy
were I to bee your Seruaunt: in that (as you knowe) no
Knight but caries the honour of his Ladie in such account,
as he preferres that before his owne life. If then Madame
in religion of this office, I absent my selfe for a while, I shal
accomplish nothing but my duetie, wherto your selfe bound
me, and I hope to execute with such successe, as you shall

beare the prize for beautie, not onelie from the Ladies of
<hi>Fraunce</hi> and <hi>Allemaigne,</hi> but from all Christendome, yea,
the whole worlde may I liue to trauaile it. Doo not then
(swéete Mistresse) mislike, if I absent my selfe for a cause
so reasonable, and continue me still in your fauourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
as he that was borne to doo you seruice. And albeit I
can not depart without excéeding gréefe and anguish, yet
perswaded of your rare arguments, I arme my selfe with
patience and yéelde to reason, béeing present with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
in that I carrie your diuine Image in my soule, and
leaue hart, life and all with you till I come. These wordes
were sealed with manie deuoute kisses, and <hi>Ptolome,</hi> had
like paine in perswading <hi>Brionella,</hi> yet this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented them
in the ende, that the honor of their trauaile was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> renowne

departed. The next morning the Princesse sent <hi>Palmerin</hi>
an arming coate of gréene Ueluet, imbroidered all ouer

                        <p>How the Prince Lewes came to see the Duchesse of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie,
and what happened.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>O soone as the Heraldes &amp; Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>Fraunce</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Sauoie,</hi> had dispatched
their charge, their Lordes gaue
order to prepare al things in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines
so soone as might bee: but
yet the Princes affection to the
Duchesse so tormented him, as
he dailie compassed new meanes
to conferre with her, that shee
might knowe the passions hee endured for her sake. At
length it came to passe, that the King, the Duke of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi>
and diuers other Princes rode foorth on pleasure togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and returned not againe for two daies space, which
made him thus begin with the Duchesse. I néede not tell
you Madame, for you knowe it well enough, howe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie
I languish in remedilesse afflictions, till nowe this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
puts me in some hope of comfort, that you perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a sollemne promise, will deliuer me out of this extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.
Wherefore faire Mistresse, since time and occasion
hath pointed it, and Fortune (by nature forward and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant)
fauours it, let mee intreate you to take the benefit of
bothe, least héereafter we compasse not the like againe. My
Lorde (quoth the Duchesse) you must thinke I am more
yours then mine owne, and make that reckoning of you, as
no Ladie can the like: howe is it possible then for mee (lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
as I doo) to flie from that which loue commaunds me
to fulfill? Let it suffise you then, that the regarde of mine

honour defended, I am readie to doo ought may agrée with
your liking. What happened afterwarde, I leaue to your
oppinions, but by the halfe the whole may be discerned, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
vertuous Ladies haue power to resist such
motions, though time, occasion, and such amorous sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitings
did offer it them: but such may be accounted more
diuine then humaine, and to them may worthilie be erected
a Trophe, in disgrace of the temptresse <hi>Venus.</hi> But this
little discourse, not much dissenting from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> matter, is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

                     <p>But nowe is come the first of Maie, the daie to beginne
the enterprises of the Princes of <hi>Fraunce</hi> &amp; <hi>Sauoie: <hi>Lewes</hi>
                        </hi>
to entertaine the Duchesse loue begun with such aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
had greater desire nowe to execute his intent then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Wherefore this daie was his T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nt erected at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citty
Gates, béeing beautifull and verie sumptuous, and at the
enteraunce thereof was placed a goodlie monument of black
Marble, curiouslie sette foorth w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> collombes of white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
verie thicke imbossed with golde and pearle. At the
side of his pauillion, was placed another monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of gréene
Iasper, adorned with manie Bases, Pillers and antique
imagerie of Golde, whereon he intended y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> strange Knights
that came should place the figures of their Ladies. On the
other side was a séemelie place appointed for the Iudges of
the fielde, who were the Dukes of <hi>Orleaunce</hi> &amp; <hi>Burgundie,</hi>
Princes greatlie estéemed for their nobilitie, and in theyr
time had béene hardie and aduenturous Knights. Manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tents and Pauillions were that daie there set vppe,
as well for strange Knights that came, as Noble men and
Gentlemen of the Realme. And nowe comes the Prince
brauelie mounted to the fielde, accompanied with manie
yong Princes, Knights and Gentlemen, the Heralds and
King of Armes ryding before, the Drummes, Phifes, Tro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

and Clarions sounding so gallantlie, as made the ayre
deliuer a most swéete Eccho. Before him in a verye sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Coche, was carried the curious counterfeite of the
Duchesse, so superficiallie sette foorth with such perfection
of arte, as though it had béene the liuely Duchesse herselfe.
After followed Prince <hi>Lewes</hi> in gorgious gilt Armour, all
ouergrauen with most artificiall flowers, and mounted on a
Courser of <hi>Spaine,</hi> estéemed one of the best runners in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
which made waie with braue and loftie voltages, as
did not a little delight y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> beholders: one of the chéefe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Court bearing his Helmet, and another hys
Launce. What néede I make further reporte of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
tryumphe, he comming to the fielde in such equipage, as
well beséemed the house from whence he discended, and as
beséemed a louelie Knight in presence of his Ladie: who as
her fauour had sent him that morning, a costlie Girdle gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with Rubies, Diamondes, great Emeraldes &amp; other
vnualuable stones, with a Sworde so good as euer Knight
wore, and therewith rode he gyrded to the Fielde. Before
he went, the King his Father thus spake to him. My Son,
this daie and all the other following. Fortune speede thee
so well, as thou maist winne the honour my hart doth wysh
thee. My Lorde, aunswered the Prince, I hope before the
sennight be finished, to accomplish your desire effectuallie, so
fauour me she that may commaunde me. So leauing the
King he came to the place appointed for the Combatte, the
Iudges placing themselues where they shoulde, and the
Prince himselfe in his Tent, where hauing his Mistresse
picture set on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> appointed place, he commaunded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
to sound, and a Heralde to proclaime: that no Knight
bearing Armes shoulde bee so hardie as to ente<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Tent, except he first graunted his Ladie to bee the fayrest
creature in the worlde, and if any were so stubborne not to
confesse it, by knightly prowesse he would force him doo it.
The Heralde hauing doone his charge, and the Iudges cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the conditions to bee openlie reade, the people deuided
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1616:89"/>
themselues in conuenient places, and the Lords Ladies and
Gentlewomen betooke them to their Tents &amp; Scaffoldes.
The first that entered the field against the Prince, was the
Countie <hi>Durcell</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> his foure Squires conducting
before him in a great gorgious Litter, the stature of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
Daughter to the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the fairest Ladie
in all <hi>Spayne,</hi> and for whose beautie hee tooke in hande this
quarrell. After him came foure other Squires, the formost
leading his Courser, the seconde bearing his Helmette, the
thirde his Shéeld, and the fourth his Gauntl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ts &amp; Launce:
and comming to the monument appointed for strange La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
caused the portrait of his Ladie to bee placed thereon,
then comming to the Princes Tent, said. I know not Lord
<hi>Lewes,</hi> if ouercome with glorie, presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth,
or ouerwéening your selfe, you haue made this large enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
to Combat with the best approoued Knightes in the
whole worlde, in iudging no fairer Ladie to be this daie li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
then your owne: for mine own part, I am not so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in conceit as you are, to quarrell for such a fabulous
matter, yet dare I tell yee, that my Ladie is much more
beautifull then yours, which if you will denie, I am readie
by the strength of mine arme to make you confesse it. <hi>Lewes</hi>
féeling himselfe gréeued with these iniurious spéeches of the
Countie, answered. Proude Knight, I am ashamed to heare
thy iudgment so simple, as to thinke I am come hether for
a matter of so light moment, as though I would not iustifie
against thée and all other what I haue promised: but let
that passe, before we part, I will cause thée know thy folly,
by that time thy pate and thy bodie is thorowly bumbasted,
looke to thy selfe, for I intende to doo it. So mounting on
horseback, and prepared as it had béene to a warre mortal,
encountred eache other with such furie, as their Launces
flying in shiuers vppe in the ayre, they met together so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riblie
with their bodies, their Shéeldes, their Horsses and
their heads, as they were bothe dismounted to the grounde.
But earnest desire to vanquish, they béeing beside, stronge
<pb facs="tcp:1616:90"/>
and will disposed Knights, made them quicklie beginne the
second assault with their Swords, which was so dangerous,
and handled with such dexteritie, as it was harde to iudge
who should haue the honour of the Combat. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the representation of his Ladie, and considering her
so excellent and fauourable to him, tooke hart a fresh, and (as
it were inspired with newe vigor) so laide on the Countie

of his Sworde, when holding it against his threate, he said.

                        </gap>e. The Countie (for all this) woulde not aunswere
one worde, by reason of the debilitie he felt himselfe in, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
lost so much of his blood, as for the gréefe hee conceiued
to be thus vanquished: whereat Prince <hi>Lewes</hi> not content,
would haue taken his heade from his shoulders, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the fielde canie to him, saying. My Lorde, you ought
to forbeare, hauing brought your enemie beyonde his owne
defence, your victory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>éeing sufficient to content you, forbids
his death. The Prince perswaded, entred his Pauillion,
and ioyfull of his conquest, commaunded two Gardants of
the field, to take the figure of the Princesse of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and
place it at the féete of the Duchesse counterfeit, which was
doone immediatlie, and the Countie <hi>Durcell</hi> brought into
his owne Tent, where his Chirurgions tooke dilligent care
for the curing of his woundes. Soone after came a Knight
of <hi>Myllaine,</hi> who giuing such defiances as the other dyd,
was in the ende constrained with great shame, to confesse
vnder the conquering Sworde of <hi>Lewes,</hi> the imperfections
of his Ladie, and her stature placed by the Princesse of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon.</hi>
The same daie were fiue great Lords of <hi>Italie</hi>
brought in like subiection, and so the tryumphe ended till
the next daie, when the first that came into the fielde was a
braue Gallant of <hi>Spayne,</hi> a Knight of good estimation, and
specially reputed, who after a dain-glorious Oration made

he was vnhorssed, and in the following Combat likewise
receiued the foile. After him seauen other Knights of <hi>Castile</hi>

Prince <hi>Lewes,</hi> against so manie
woorthie Knights, so that they
altogeather accounted him most
fortunate. And nowe the thirde
daie when hee was entred his
Tent, an English Knight (no
lesse braue in termes then the
former) defied the Prince, and betwéene them began a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
conflict, in the midst whereof, the King with manie
Princes, Barons and Lordes, as also the Quéene and the
Duchesse of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> came to their standing, and vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
behelde the foyle of the English Knight, the Duchesse
hearing him confesse her beautie, and behelde his Ladyes
portrait placed vnder hers. But now the couragious Duke
<pb facs="tcp:1616:91"/>
of <hi>Gaule</hi> named <hi>Crenus,</hi> came brauelie mounted into the
fielde, dooing his duetie to the King, Quéene and Ladies,
who not knowing him, by his Armour iudged him some
great Lorde, in that no Knight before caused so good opinion
generallie, nor came with brauer countenaunce into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field:
he béeing indéede a Prince of wonderfull possessions, and a
Knight at Armes woorthilie approoued. The Duke (as all
the other had doone) caused his Ladies counterfeite to bee
placed where it ought by his Squires, to the no little admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of all the beholders, noting what rare and excellent
beautie it was adorned withall, the workman hauing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
such exquisite perfections, as it had béene the Ladie
herselfe naturallie liuing: while the Squires were thus
placing it on the monument, the Duke aduaunced himselfe
to <hi>Lewes</hi> in this manner. The ouermuch selfe conceite
(Lorde <hi>Lewes)</hi> of mindes but easily acquainted with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of difficultie, hath often béene, and yet is the cause, to
plucke great personages more lowe then they expecte: so
that men haue séene them deceiued of their intents, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
with ridiculous shame and confusion. This speake
I to you, hauing héere begun a busines, the ende whereof
will bee more harde to you, then as yet the beginning hath
béen: for <hi>Europe</hi> is sufficientlie stored with hardy Knights
to asswage your presumptuous opinion, and Ladies much
more faire and excellent, then she whom you contende for.
And this (by the fauour of Fortune, gracious regarde of my
Ladie and Mistresse, and helpe of my good Sworde) will I
enforce you to confesse: that incomparable <hi>Agriola,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the King of <hi>England,</hi> for vertue, for beautie and all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
perfections, excéedeth yours whatsoeuer she be. Before

Sonne of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> rather will I consent to bee péecemeale
torne in sunder: and before fayre <hi>Phaebus</hi> haue paced one
howres iourney, I doubt not to make thée repent thy pride

we two part, I meane to trie if I can doo it againe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
resolue thy selfe to thy best defence, for (by my life)
I will not fauour thee. Without any further spéeches they
encountred with such violence togeather, as Prince <hi>Lewes</hi>
was throwne betwéene his horsses féete, and he for <hi>England</hi>
lost his stirrops, but recouered himselfe well enough by the
mayne of his Horse: then he séeing his enemie not vppe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
cast himselfe out of his saddle to haue taken his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage,
but <hi>Lewes</hi> preuented him, and came marching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Duke with his Sworde drawne, who staied him
thus. Me thinks Prince of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> before any worse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall

that our Combatte beginnes for the excellencie of beautie.
By God man of <hi>England,</hi> aunswered <hi>Lewes,</hi> thou canst not
perswade me to a thing so farre from my thought, therfore
goe too, and he that hath the fairest Fréende, shall soone be

stroke on the head, as made him sette one knée to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground,
but recouering himselfe quicklie, and both thorowly angry,
they laid on eache other so cruellie, as the very hardiest of
the beholders feared the successe. Thus fought they for mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter

in their harts then their owne lines. So long these eager
charges continued on bothe sides, as Prince <hi>Lewes</hi> hauing
receiued more then twentie woundes on his bodie, feeling
himselfe fainte, fell downe before his enemie, saying.

no aunswere, eyther for his weakenes, or sorowful conceite
of his mis-fortune, wherefore the Iudges came, who gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

want of a iust quarrell. <hi>Trineus</hi> hearing <hi>Palmerin</hi> so affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate
in his spéeches, in a merry laughter, sayd. In good
sooth Sir <hi>Palmerin,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> was but ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled,
to enter the Combat for my Sisters beautie without
her licence, in that he once learned, howe you coulde defend
it much better then hee. <hi>Palmerin</hi> fearing hee had spoken
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1616:96"/>
more then he ought, because he discoursed his loue too open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
excused the matter thus. If it were not (my Lorde) that
I doubt to offer wrong to a Lady, on whome dependeth my
lyfe, and whom I loue more déere then my selfe: I woulde
cause the <hi>Frenchman</hi> well to vnderstand, how Madame <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linarda</hi>
your Sister, surpasseth in all perfections eyther of
grace or beauty, all the Ladies of this Country, yea, I dare
say of the whole world, therefore one may easily coniecture,
that the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> during y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Combat, had his mind
fixed on baser occasions. Then <hi>Trineus</hi> smyling to sée <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
so dilligent to shadowe his loue, sayd. It is no strange
matter Fréende <hi>Palmerin,</hi> to sée presuming mindes payde
with selfe same coyne, as the Duke is: and yet I can not
meruaile enough, that my Sister <hi>Polinarda</hi> wold not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
this matter to your charge, she hauing had so good know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of your valour and prowesse. These speeches pleased
not <hi>Palmerin</hi> a little, and did in such sort encourage him, as
for the iniury doone his Ladie by the Duke of <hi>Sauoye,</hi> in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her figure at the féete of <hi>Lucemania,</hi> as had not <hi>Trine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
perswaded him wyth fayre spéeches, all sicke and sore as
he was, he would haue gone to reuenge this dishonor. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
hee called <hi>Prolome</hi> secretly, saying. Thou
knowest (my déere Freende) what shame is offered her, to
whom I was destenied before my byrth, by the presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an ouer-bolde Knight, and what greefe it is to mee,
that I cannot at this present reuenge this wrong my selfe,
I pray thee therefore supply my insufficiencie, and enter
the Combat with that vaine-glorious Duke, of whom thou
maist gaine honor and yéelde me content, in giuing ease to
my afflictions, which els are insupportable. I promise you
my Lorde, aunswered <hi>Ptolome,</hi> before you made the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I intended it, and I will accomplish it with such good

for my Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>esse <hi>Brionella,</hi> will I enter the fielde, whose
beautie is sufficient to enriche me with the victory, for in
my conceit, shee farre passeth <hi>Lucemania.</hi> Therefore my
<pb facs="tcp:1616:97"/>
Lorde let me request one courtesie, which I am lothe you
should denie me: that if you shall be able to morrow, but to
accompanie me with your presence in the fielde. If the ayre
will suffer me, quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> I will, in meane while I
will pray, that thy fortune may fall out to my harts desire.
Thus <hi>Trineus, Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Ptolome,</hi> were passing the
time with other noble men, of the valoure of the Duke of
<hi>Sauoy</hi> against all strange Knights, and how he had not foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Duke of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> had not his Horse fallen on him
and maimed him, otherwise hee brought the Combatte to
so good a iudgment, as he had wunne the honour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fielde.
Wherat <hi>Palmerin</hi> was more offended then before, because
himselfe was not able to reuenge this mis-fortune, héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
he conceiued a kind of iealousie of the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,</hi>
because hée hadde chosen his Ladie <hi>Polinarda</hi> for his
Mistresse, and on her behalfe had entred the Combatte,
and howe he durst place her picture on the Piller wyth her
name, without he had receiued some commandement from
her, which conceit so gréeued him, as his woundes began to
be as daungerous as at the first, continually labouring in
his thoughts, nowe with the lightnes, then againe with the
constancie of Women, neuerthelesse, he could not iudge (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
earnestly the vertues of his Lady) that she would be
of such a double lyking, and in this doubtful estate, sayd. Ah
God, I sée that Women winne lightly, &amp; loose againe more
easilie. Then repenting his words, followes on thus. O hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
and what shall I say? it is impossible that shee (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Polinarda)</hi> should be so forgetfull, and neuer will I
beléeue, that a Princesse so wise and vertuous, wold reward
me with such treason, which may not, nay I dare sweare
cannot, once enter her thoughts. Yet would not all opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
serue to allay thys newe iealousie, but still it had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to confounde reason, and al the night continued he in this
variable conceit, till the next morning, when <hi>Ptolome</hi> (so
soone as the Sunne arose) acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyed with <hi>Trineus,</hi> went
to his Tent, where béeing armed, all sauing his Helmet,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1616:97"/>
hauing his Launce and Shéelde, he came to the Duke, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Thou knowest Knight the cause of my comming, stand
vpon thy guarde, for I sight for beautie. The Duke sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
at these words mounted on horseback, and ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his enemie with such strength, as <hi>Ptolome</hi> cast the
Duke forth of his saddle, and suddainly alighted wyth hys
Sworde drawne: but the Duke recouering himselfe, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
him in sharper sort then he expected. Nowe beganne
betwéene them a cruell and pittious Combat, as their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
sheeldes and swords, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lewe about in péeces, and the
blood trickling downe their bodies in manie places, so that
it was generally reputed, how the fight could not end with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the losse of both their liues. Yet in the ende, the Duke
béeing of stronger constitution then <hi>Ptolome,</hi> and gréedy of
victory ouer his enemie, ranne so violentlie vpon him as hée
got him on the grounde, and he béeing vppermost, offered to
take the aduauntage of his life: but the Iudges forbidding
it, caused <hi>Ptolome</hi> to be carried into his Tent, where the
Prince <hi>Trineus</hi> staied not a little sorry for this great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.
The Duke likewise sore wounded was carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Pauillion, but first hee sawe the portrait of <hi>Brionella</hi>
sette in the ranke of the conquered. The same daie dyd the
Duke fight with a Knight of <hi>Scotland</hi> at the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, who
not nimble enough in vsing that weapon, in the end had the
foyle, and thrée other Knights afterwarde at seuerall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
so that it was admirable to beholde the exploits of
Armes the Duke did, in that no Knight as yet medled with
him, but departed with shame, and their Ladies pictures
placed as vanquished. And nowe was <hi>Palmerins</hi> Combatte
against the Duke of <hi>Gaule</hi> not talked on, for the Duke of
<hi>Sauoy</hi> was accounted the onely Knight in the world, to the
no small ioy of the Princesse <hi>Lucemania,</hi> who perswaded
herselfe now, that her beautie was most excellent. But she
was not so pleasant as <hi>Palmerin</hi> was pensiue, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nraged
out of measure, notwithstanding his weakenes, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
intreaties of <hi>Trineus,</hi> he would néedes to the fielde, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb facs="tcp:1616:98"/>
Good my Lord perswade me not, for I reckon not my
life, so I may take vengeaunce of the dishonour doone to
my Ladie your Sister: the manifolde courtesies of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
your Father, haue so bounde me to her and you, as
excéede my life farre, and therfore I beséech you not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me. <hi>Trineus</hi> yet ouercame him by perswasions, assuring
him to haue time sufficient for his reuenge, whereat great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
displeased, he feigned himselfe to be whole sooner then he
was indéede, for the great desire hee had to deale with the
Duke. And Prince <hi>Lewes</hi> angrie, to sée the Duke hold the
fielde longer then hee did, not able to bee ouercome by anye
Knight, came to <hi>Palmerin</hi> saying. I knowe not my Lorde,
whether you vnderstand the Duke of <hi>Sauoyes</hi> victories a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
so manie hardie Knights, but belike his strength is
much better then mine was, or Fortune allowes him more
fauour then she did to me. In my conceit if you enter not
the Combat, you doo me wrong and your selfe too, and if hee
depart hence with victory, then shall I haue cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of you: in that his successe hath made him so braue
and presumptuous, as though no Knight is able to answere
him in the field, let me intreate you Sir <hi>Palmerin</hi> to abate
his pride, and (as well hee deserues) make him knowe his
folly. <hi>Palmerin</hi> hauing greater desire to execute this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then thus to be intreated, returned the Prince this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.
My Lorde, God giues honour and victory to whom
he pleaseth, without either regarde of the cause or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
If according to bountie or nobilitie of minde he distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
such gifts, then had you béene among the better sorte,
as furnished sufficientlie with valour and magnanimitie:
yet if your enterprise haue not sorted to your desire, account
this for certaine that it is for your good, and for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are to you known, for such matters are his secrets,
and he dooth ballance them by his diuine wisedome. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
as well to satis-fie your request, as ease mine
owne minde, to morrowe morning will I enter my Tent,
albeit my present estate would haue me stay awhile, there
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1616:98"/>
will I Combat with the Duke, not certaine how Fortune
meanes to deale with me. But happen what shall, I goe
with a minde to conquere, and doubt not but the issue wyll
be such, as shall yéelde you content, and me the victory, so
shall your sadnes &amp; mine be conuerted into pleasure. With
this aunswere the Prince satis-fied, departed, yet was hee
ignoraunt of <hi>Palmerins</hi> intent, which was farre otherwise
then he imagined: but pleased as he was he went into the
presence Chamber, where manie Knights were conferring
of déedes of Armes past, to whom hee opened the fantasie of
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> which caused a generall doubting of the Duke,
setting him downe for vanquished, except <hi>Palmerins</hi> weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
were his greater Fréende.</p>

of <hi>Fraunce, <hi>Trineus</hi>

Princes. The King with all his trayne taking theyr
standing to behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Combat, <hi>Palmerin</hi> came armed foorth
of his Tent, sauing his Helmet, which was carryed before
him by two Squires with his Sheeld and Mace, and next
to them came two Princes, who bare the portraiture of
his Ladie <hi>Polinarda,</hi> which béeing sette on the Piller, hee
<pb facs="tcp:1616:99"/>
clasped on his Helmet, and taking his Mace in his hande,
martched to the Dukes Tent, and thus summoned him.
Knight, thou hast long enough defended the field, and to my
great gréefe that it hath béene so long, my turne is nowe
come, and it is good reason I shoulde kéepe it the rest of the
time: for the Ladie whom I loue, is not onely much more
beautifull then thine, but beside, excelleth all other whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
and if thou wilt not confesse the same, I wil not leaue
thée with this Mace till I haue forced thée to doo it. I know
not saide the Duke, what thou canst doo, but I am of the
minde, that I shall soone quallifie thy ouer bolde brauing.
At these words the Duke taking his Mace, deliuered <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
so sounde a stroke on the heade, as made him to stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
but <hi>Palmerin</hi> requited him well againe for it, and long
had they fought togeather, and brused eache other very pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
till at length <hi>Palmerin</hi> gaue the Duke such a cruell
stroke betwéene the heade and the shoulders, as he fell to
the grounde cleane bereft of sence: when <hi>Palmerin</hi> taking
off his Helmet, would not offer him any further violence,
but setting his sworde against his brest, said. Now am I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
reuenged on him, that so ill intreated the figure of
the most fayrest among Ladies. The Iudges of the fielde,
thinking <hi>Palmerin</hi> would haue slaine the Duke, came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to him with these words. Content you Sir, he is van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished,
and hath no power to defende himselfe. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Palmerin</hi> put vppe his Sword againe, and leauing the

to pardon your Knight, in that he did no sooner repell

or want of courage, but debility of bodie, which once a little

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1616:99"/>
where with soueraigne drinks life was got into him again,
but when he knowe himselfe to be vanquished, and that in
one howre hee lost the greatest honour of all his life time,
very conceit of gréefe had well néere slaine him. No lesse
was the sorrowe of Madame <hi>Lucemania,</hi> but she and her
Knight were not so much discontented, as <hi>Palmerin, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi>

other Knights, &amp; in his conquests shewed himselfe not

honoring his Mistresse with the humilitie of theirs. The

                        </gap>hée, that

the counterfeite of her, whom thou perswadest thy selfe

answered the Knight of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> for I haue no other pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of her then is imprinted in my hart, where loue hath
<pb facs="tcp:1616:100"/>
so liuely figured her person, as she is daily presented to mee
by her incomparable beautie, which cannot be taken from
me but onely by death. And if loue follow the soule, [as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
holde opinion] whole worldes cannot seperate mee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
her. And therefore are all men vnworthy to receiue fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(by their regard) of a thing so precious, which makes me
imagine, none but my selfe woorthy to looke on her diuine
figure. Prepare thee therefore to thy Horse, and defende
thy selfe. <hi>Palmerin</hi> desirous to know the name of this fayre
Ladie, sayd. I sée Sir Knight, that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> art meruailous proude
and surlie, which make mee desire rather to Combat wyth
thee then any other, to abate this hote humour: albeit this
is contrarie to his conditions, who was the principall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this enterprise, which is, that thou shouldest set on
this Piller her portrait whom thou so estéemest, yet thys
exception shall be graunted thee, for the desire I haue to
knowe what thou canst doo, as also her name, if thou da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
reueale it. To tell thée her name (aunswered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight
of the <hi>Sunne)</hi> I will not sticke with thee, and because in
concealing it, I shall offer her wrong, nature hauing in her
set downe the onely worke of beautie: know therfore that
her name is <hi>Polinarda,</hi> Daughter to the mighty Emperor
of <hi>Allemaigne.</hi> These wordes were so yrkesome to <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
and troubled his thoughts in such sort, that hee knewe
not readily what to aunswere: notwithstanding in midst
of his choller, thus spake. By God Knight thou hast made
a good choyse, for against her beautie will not I contende,
hauing it in greater estimation and reuerence then y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> canst
haue: but I am ready to prooue, that thou deseruest not to
be named her Knight, no not so much as her meanest Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt.
That shall we try, said the Knight of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we part: and albeit her excellencie deserue farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
seruice then mine: yet so it is, that for the looue I beare
her, and the affection I haue to obey her by some agreeable
seruice, I may by good reason name my selfe hers. At these
spéeches <hi>Palmerin</hi> conceiued such iealousie, as without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1616:100"/>
any further matter, mounted in great anger on
horsebacke, and met the Knight of the <hi>Sunne</hi> so forcibly, as
bothe of them were sent to the ground: whereuppon they
drewe their Swordes, and charged eache other with such
furie, as their Armour and Shéeldes were hacked in péeces,
and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground coullered with their expence of blood. No per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of breathing was suffered betwéene them, but blood
and death earnestly desired on either part, so that the King,
the Lordes and the Iudges, reputed this for the strangest
Combat that euer they sawe, nor could they say who was
likest to winne the fielde, but if the one died, the other could
not escape, so that the King mooued with compassion, caused
them to be seuered, and commaunded them to enter theyr
Tents. Which motion liked well the Knight of the <hi>Sun,</hi>
for long he perswaded himselfe he could not hold out, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he mounted on horsebacke so well as he coulde, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe
himselfe, <hi>Palmerin</hi> béeing wonderfully displeased,
that he could not obtayne the victory of thys Knight. Soone
after, the King and the Prince <hi>Lewes</hi> came into his Tent,
and séeing him very sore wounded, woulde not let him staye
there, but sayd. Beléeue me (Sir <hi>Palmerin)</hi> you haue great
néede of rest, and your wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds I sée are very dangerous, you
shall therefore be conueyed to my Pallace, where all helps
that may be deuised shall be giuen, assuring you, that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
honour could neuer Knight purchase, then you haue
doone. And though this last Combat were not ended, you
néede not be displeased, the issue thereof importing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> death
of the one or the other, and perhaps of both, which I would
not haue séene for two of the best prouinces in my Realme.
And me thinks you should content your selfe, hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
before, such honour ouer so many Lords and Knights of
name, come you therfore with me, and Lord <hi>Trineus</hi> beare
vs company. Great thanks receiued the King of them for
this honourable courtesie, and <hi>Palmerin</hi> went with him to
the Pallace, where the Kinges Chirurgions tooke care of
his woundes, he béeing lodged in the most stately Chamber
<pb facs="tcp:1616:101"/>
in the Courte. Nowe the Prince <hi>Lewes</hi> beganne to loue
<hi>Palmerin</hi> so déerely, as he coulde not be an howre foorth of
his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie, desiring his health as his owne welfare: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all thinges that he imagined <hi>Palmerin</hi> tooke pleasure
in, would he performe with his vttermost endeuours, and
would suffer none to hold him talk, but only of matter that
might yéeld pleasure and delight. Notwithstanding, diuers
Knights conferring with him that euening, as concerning
the Knight of the <hi>Sunne: Palmerin</hi> aunswered them, that
his mind should neuer be thorowly quieted, vntil such time
as he fought with him againe. The Prince, who still ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
to kéepe him from sadnes, saide. I beléeue (my Lord)
that he will not easilie be induced to deale with you again,
for you brought him into such estate, as hee will kéepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
héereafter out of your handes: and well I am assured,
that had you continued but a little longer, the victorye had
béene yours, for the Knight was so weakened, that he did
nothing but defend your blowes. It pleaseth you (my Lord)
to say so quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> but had he felt such valour in me,
or such courage as beséemes a vertuous Combatant, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
coulde he escape as he hath doone: neuerthelesse, I hope
(with the fauour of Fortune) to méete him once more, and
then we will trie who is the strongest. Much other talke
they had, but <hi>Palmerin</hi> intreated the Prince, that all the
portraits of the conquered Ladies might bee brought him,
which were aboue an hundred, of diuers beauties &amp; most
strange fashions, and among them all could be founde none
seconde to <hi>Polinarda,</hi> but (as we haue said already) that of
<hi>Agriola</hi> the Princesse of <hi>England:</hi> who (by the report of a
Gentleman present that had séene her) was much more
beautifull then her figure presented. Such spéeches they
continued so long of the <hi>Englih</hi> Uirgin, as <hi>Trineus</hi> (albeit
he neuer sawe her) became amorous of her, and at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> instant
he so solemnly vowed himselfe hers, as thence forwarde he
swore neuer to loue any but her, so y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> for her sake he thrust
himselfe into manie perrillous fortunes, as in the folowing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1616:101"/>
discourse of the History you shall reade more at large. From
whom let vs returne to the Prince <hi>Lewes,</hi> who seeing so
many portraitures of Princesses and Ladies, would dailie
congratulate <hi>Palmerins</hi> good fortune, and embracing him,
said. So helpe me God, my noble companion, I woulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
desire greater riches in the world, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to resemble you,
especially in chiualry, which in you is so surpassing al other,
as you haue ended to your honor, what a number haue fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in. Oh howe happy may the Ladie account herselfe, that
hath such a Knight? and were not the condition too cruell
towards my selfe, I could wish I were a Woman in her
place, to haue so high rule and commande ouer you. At
which words all present began to smile, yet shewing good
countenaunce to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> for the affection they sawe the
Prince beare him, which is yet to this day a common vsage
and practise among Courtiers: but <hi>Palmerin</hi> somewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of such superstitious prayses, aunswered. Trust me
my Lorde, I account my happines the greater, that I haue
doone seruice to so high a personage and so good a Knight as
you are, desiring to méete you in such place héerafter, where
you may perceiue the good wil I beare you, not only for this
high entertainement, which is more then I can deserue, as
for the pleasure I haue to honour so good a Prince, which if
the occasion happen, you shall perceiue the experience. I
haue spoken nothing (quoth the Prince) but what is more
acquainted to others then my selfe, and if I would conceale
them, then will they be most openly knowne, because ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
doth so apparantlie shine in them. Manie other spéeches
passed betwéene, them, and longer had continued, but that
manie Lords which came to sée the Ioustes, were now vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
departing, and therefore woulde take their leaue of the
King, whereuppon they were constrained to breake off, the
Prince going to the Chamber of presence, where hee gaue
thanks to a number that honoured the Courte with theyr
presence: and so one after another all departed, the Duke
of <hi>Sauoye</hi> béeing one of the first, ashamed (God knowes) to
<pb facs="tcp:1616:102"/>
be so conquered by <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and not bidding his Lady <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemania</hi>
farewell. But <hi>Lewes</hi> did not serue the Duchesse
so, for her loue continued as resolute as before, and shee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him as wel conquered, as had he béene the conquerour,
whereof she assured him by many amorous méetinges, by
which meanes the Prince stayed the Duke at the Courte,

King his Brother to pardon him, for what hee had doone,
was not with any intent to displease his Maiestie, but an

made him no aunswere, because hee tooke <hi>Netrides</hi> reasons

by this occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of so slender moment, which increased thence
forward, as the matter prouoking a fierie Meteore: so that
he did repine at his Brother so much, as he would not speak

he to remembraunce the loue of his people towardes hys

The yong Prince obedient to his Brother, made answere,
that he wold accomplish his charge, and so withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
into his Chamber, not declaring to any one hys cause
of heauines. Then willing one of his Squires to saddle hys

as not resting but one night in any lodging, he left his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

sought to shroude him where none might discrye him,

shrubs, and bushes, hee estéemed this a conuenient place to
rest in, wherefore alighting from his Horse, and turning
him to féede, layd himselfe downe at the roote of a Trée, and
thus began to breathe foorth his complaints. Ah inconstant
Fortune, and to me most of all inconstant, didst thou erecte
me so high, and reiect mee nowe thus lowe? well then may
I saie, that more wrong thou doost a man in one houre, then
right all his life time: for it héeretofore thou diddest lende

(and that with vsury too rigorous) not leauing anie hope

me into this poore estate, wherein I must die, Oh happy if

So saying, he layde him downe among the Hearbes, and
was supprised with such extreame féeblenes, as he fell into
his lamentations againe, thus. Ah my Lord and Father, too

he there determined to finish his life. But better fortune
befell him then he expected, by the meanes of an auncient
Knight named <hi>Lombardo,</hi> who béeing néere, hearde all his
dolorous complaints. This Knight béeing rich and of noble

his mones, but afterward came and tooke him by the hand
saying. Arise my Freende and take courage, for you are in
the place, where you shall finde more good to benefit you,
then harme to offende you, therefore cherish your spirites,
and forget this heauines, which may endaunger you beyond
recouerie. <hi>Netrides</hi> séeing this honourable Gentlemanne,
with his bearde so white as snowe, hearing his courteous
offer, and for him nowe so necessary: with ioy, feare &amp; bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
all coupled togeather, accepted it, and humbly than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him, albeit (quoth he) a contented death is better to me,
them a miserable and dispised life. The Knyght comforting
him aunswered, that it was not in his power to chuse lyfe
or death, but the founder of the heauens reserued that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
in his owne handes. With these wordes hee tooke
him by the hand, and conducted him to his Castell, where he
was worthilie entertained by the Knight himselfe, his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb facs="tcp:1616:104"/>
and her Daughter, one of the fairest Uirgins in all that
Country. <hi>Lombardo</hi> hauing heard all his mis-fortunes and
hard aduentures, in the night discoursed the whole to hys
Ladie, wherefore (good Wife) quoth he, entertaine him so
well as may be, for I assure you he is discended of high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée,
and if his manners and vertues bee correspondent to
his byrth, wee will giue him our Daughter in mariage, if
so himselfe accept our offer. The good Ladie misliked not
her Husbands opinion, wherefore the next morning shee
went to entertaine her guest, saying. My Lorde, your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
hither hath well contented my Lorde and Husbande,
and so please it you to staie héere, he wil bee glad and fayne
of your companie: which gentle offer <hi>Netrides</hi> accepted,
thanking God and the Ladie for his good fortune. Thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained

neuer remembred him of his miseries in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
but intreated him so well as though hee had béene his
owne Sonne. <hi>Netrides</hi> séeing the Knights Daughter so
faire and well conditioned, and she regarding not onely the
vertues of his minde, but also his comely and well featured
bodie, they began amorously to affect eache other secretlie,
but loue inuented y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> meane to reueale it openlie: for <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardo</hi>
well noting the great discretion of this yong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,

resolued to cause him marry his Daughter, demaunding
the question of <hi>Netrides</hi> among other spéeches, if so he liked
to marry his Daughter? My Lorde, quoth he, it is the sum
of my desire, and greater honor cannot you bestowe on me,
so please her to conceiue the same opinion I doo. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

the Knight bestowed his Daughter so, in that they estéemed

that the auncient Knight and his Ladie deceased, leauing
theyr Daughter great with childe, to the no little content
of <hi>Netrydes,</hi> that after all his sorrowe he shoulde become a

Father. Thrée daies before this Ladie fell in trauaile, shee
dreamed that she was shut vppe in a very dark Chamber,
whereout she coulde by no meanes get, and therefore called
for helpe to one of her Gentlewomen. Then was she adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to take her childe in her armes, and to staye there still,
whereuppon she behelde her infant, and sawe that his face
resembled the beames of the Sunne, the brightnes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
chased away the darknes, so that shee might beholde the
place as cleere as any other, saying. My Lord, forgette thys
heauines, and you shall reioyce by this infant, for this is he
shall reestablish you in the place you haue lost, &amp; shall seate
you in that Chayre with honour, for which you were exiled
thence, giuing you his crowne, that traiterously chased you
from his kingdome. He comforted with these words, tooke
the childe in his armes, and sayd. Little soule, I pray God
thy mother speake trueth, and that thou maist be able to
execute it. So saying, hee espyed a furious man who snat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

This sorrowe for <hi>Netrydes</hi> made her giue a loude shryke,
when he calling his Wife, demaunded the cause of her sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
affright, whereupon she rehearsed to him the whole

my Lord that it will so happen to you as I haue dreamed,
and therefore comfort your selfe without feare of mis-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune:
notwithstanding, he remained in many doubtfull o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
till they vnderstoode by effects the certaintye of

                        <p>Howe Frisol persecuted with his disease, and the mockery

                           <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Risol</hi> hauing heard the originall
of his birthe, as also y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vision that
appeared to his Mother, was
thence forwarde more pensiue
then he had béene before, and per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiuing
his Brethren continued
their bad disposition, and day by
day mocked him more and more:
he determined to forsake his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house, to séeke aduentures,
and remedie for his sicknes, if any were to be found. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one daie in the Forrest, more mellanchollie then accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed,
hee espied a Knight vexed with Leprosie come by
the high waie, mounted on a poore Palfray, to whome he
said. My Fréend, I am infected with the same disease thou
art, wherefore wilt thou suffer me to beare thée companie,
<pb facs="tcp:1616:106"/>
and I will be readie to doo what thou shalt commaund me.
The Knight perceiuing hee might gaine some benefite by
<hi>Frisol,</hi> was well contented, and so bad him mount vppe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
him. So was he glad to doo what was contrarie to
his nature, and in this life continued two yéeres, trauailing
many Countries, bearing continually the wallet, and what
profit came he deliuered his Maister, reseruing nothing for
himselfe but what he gaue him, and bearing a minde so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and vertuous, as he desired rather death, then to enrich
himselfe by anie villainous or dishonest act. So many Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and prouinces had they trauailed, as at last they came
into the Realme of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> when <hi>Frisol</hi> remembred that
he was in his Uncles Land, who ledde a life so base and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious:
hee was ouercome with excéeding heauines,
which ill agréed with his daungerous disease, so that his
companion desired to know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of his sadnes, but <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sol</hi>
prayed him to content himselfe, saying that death was
more agréeable to him, then a life so dolorous and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
At which words the Knight growing in choller, thruste
him beside the Horse, and rode away leaning poore <hi>Frysol</hi>
there, hauing no other comfort then to fill the ayre with his
teares and complaints, till at length he receiued succour by
a yong Maide named <hi>Leonarda,</hi> the Daughter of a riche
Countriman that dwelt on a Mountaine néere at hande.
This Maiden leading her Fathers Beastes and Cattell to
pasture, tooke great delight in gathering hearbes and roots,
wherewith to make oyntments for all woundes and disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
and this daie (by the diuine permission) shee chaunced
that way where she hearde the mornefull lamentations of
<hi>Frysol,</hi> whom when she behelde, ouercome with pittie and
compassion, said. Alas my Freend, howe came you into this
desert and comfortlesse place, béeing oppressed with such a
bad and daungerous sicknesse? In good sooth Mistresse, (ꝙ
hee) by no other meanes then the mis-fortune and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of my life: Oh howe happy were my death at thys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue any longer in this monstrous languishing.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1616:106"/>
Fréend, aunswered the Mayden, you ought not thus to dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre
in sicknes, but consider, that the Lord and gouernour
of the heauens and earth, dooth by these meanes trye and
prooue his people, whom if he perceiue thankfull and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in their afflictions: of reprobate enemies, he makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his Freends and Children, onely by the raunsome that his
beloued Sonne paide. If then you will put your whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in him, I am perswaded you shall soone finde reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
So causing him to arise, shee conducted him to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house, where for certaine daies, she bathed him wyth
wholesome Hearbes, and annoynted him with such preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
oyntments, as in short time his disease forsooke him,
and he was as cleane as at the time hee dranke the water,
for which he humblie thanking the Maiden, said. God make
me able (faire Uyrgin) to requite this wonderfull kindnes
receiued at your handes, accounting my s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to you, then to my parents that gaue me first life, and this
perswade your selfe, that wheresoeuer my body bee sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from this place, my hart shall remaine readie to doo you
any seruice. That is my will &amp; intent, quoth <hi>Leonarda,</hi> but

                        </gap> to helpe you, and in
so dooing shall I account my labour well bestowed. <hi>Frysol</hi>
for this vnexpected good fortune, was thence forward verie
dutifull and louing towardes <hi>Leonardas</hi> Father and her
Brethren, as the readiest Seruant he had in his house: but
the good man estéemed so well of him, as by no meanes hee
wold suffer him to be so painfull, but with such fare as God
sent him, entertained and welcommed him, not suffering
him to departe thence in the space of a yéere &amp; more. <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sol</hi>
often accompanying <hi>Leonarda</hi> to the fielde, shee séeing
him so faire and comelie a personage, began secretlie to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
him, yet would she not acquaint him therewith, fearing
more to offend then to be refused. So soone as <hi>Frysol</hi> had
thus recouered his strength, he determined to stay no longer
there, wherefore finding <hi>Leonarda</hi> at leysure conuenient,
he said. I know very well (fayre Mayden) how much I am
<pb facs="tcp:1616:107"/>
beholding to you, for the speciall grace and good I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by you, which induceth mee to make you this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
that you shall not commaunde any thing, but I wyll
gladly accomplish it. And because I am desirous to trauaile
after strange aduentures, I would request that it might be
with your willing consent, promising you to stay no longer
hence then the tearme of thrée yéeres, in which time I will
not fayle to visite you againe: and if my fortune so fall out,
as I am perswaded, I doubt not to recompence what you
did for me. That which I alway feared (Sir <hi>Frysol)</hi> quoth
she, is nowe come to passe, notwithstanding, séeing it is
conuenient I should loue honour, more then mine own plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure,
I am content that you shall goe séeke your aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so well begunne: but I pray you not to cast your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in obliuion. I will not to the death (quoth he) doo anie
thing to dislike you, or against your wil, and since you haue
so féelie graunted me libertie, perswade your selfe my word
shall be my déede. So taking his leaue of her Father and
Brethren, he trauayled towards <hi>Allemaigne,</hi> where hee
hearde that chiualrie was more maintained then in anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, and so rode hee foure daies togeather without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
aduenture: till passing through a Forrest, he hearde a
great noyse of people fighting, wherefore making hast that
way, hee espyed an auncient Knight, assaulted by sixe vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines
that sought to murder him, whom he resisted so well
as he could, albeit he had nothing but his sworde to defende
him. The Knight espying <hi>Frysol,</hi> called to him for helpe,
when he (suddainly finding a strong yong Trée pluckt vppe
by the roote) came therewith to the villaines, saying. Why
traiterous varlets, who prouoked you to offer such shame
to a Knight? with which hee tooke one of them so soundlye
on the pate with his Trée, as he neuer rose to tell who hurt
him. The Knight and he togeather so behaued themselues,
as thrée of the villaines were layd dead before them, which
the other thrée perceiuing, tooke themselues to flight: wher
vpon the old Knight séeing himselfe so well deliuered, came

bethinke your selfe therefore howe I may grately

in safety before he departed, for which y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> olde Knight than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

certaine heritages, which vniustly they detained fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
poore Orphanes, and for that cause set spyes to watch him,
that they might set vppon him and kill him, which surelie
they had doone (quoth he) without your succour. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuaunce
of these spéeches, they arriued at his Castell,
where many of his Squires meruailed to sée him so sore
wounded, but especially his Lady and his two Sonnes, to
whome hee rehearsed the summe of his aduenture, and
the great fauour and helpe he founde by <hi>Frysol,</hi> for which
cause they entertained him with excéeding honour. And so
long aboade <hi>Frysol</hi> there with the Knight, till béeing desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to receiue the order of knighthoode, hee came to the
Knight in this manner. May it please you Sir to bestow on
me Horse and Armour, I wyll goe to the Emperors Court
of <hi>Allemaigne,</hi> he beeing the most renowned Prince in the
world. The good Knight seeing him so forward to chiualry,
gaue him Horse, Armour and money for his iourney, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
he sette forwarde, and the third daie after hee arriued
at the Emperors Court, from whence (a little before) <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>
and <hi>Palmerin</hi> were departed towards <hi>Fraunce:</hi> which
newes made <hi>Frisol</hi> earnestly desire his knighthood, because
he intended with all speede to trauaile thither likewise, in
respect of the honour was there to be wunne. <hi>Frysol</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Emperour was in the Chappell hearing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
seruice, went thither, where beholding the Princesse
<hi>Polinarda,</hi> he reputed her the onely fayre Lady of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world,
<pb facs="tcp:1616:108"/>
thinking hee could neuer glut his eyes with regarding her,
whereupon, seruice beeing ended, he fell on his knee before
the Emperour in this manner. Because I knowe (inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Lorde) that you are renowned beyonde all other poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates
whatsoeuer, and that you make no small accounte of
Knights aduenturous: I desire that by your hande I may
be numbred among them. The Emperour seeing him so
yong and yet valiantly giuen, aunswered. I would be lothe
my Freende to deny a request so reasonable, but I wil first
knowe if you be Gentle borne or no. My Lorde, quoth he, I
sweare by the fayth I owe to God and your Maiestie, that
I am noble borne, and of the bloode royall by my Fathers
side. God forbid then (sayd the Emperour) but you shoulde
be Knight, and Fortune sheelde you so well in chiualry, as
she hath indued you with comely shape and beautie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then
was the Spurre put vpon hys right heele, and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
bad him ryse a Knight, commaunding his Daughter
<hi>Polmarda</hi> to gyrde hys Sworde to him, which she did, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Worthily and with happines (Sir Knight) may you
imploy the order you haue receiued. Madame (quoth <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sol)</hi>
if heereafter any vertue or valoure abyde in me, it shal
be imployed onely for you, hauing thus honoured mee with
my Sword, wherewith I hope to accomplish such deeds of

but <hi>Polinarda</hi> made him no aunswere, because <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
was the onely Image of her thoughts. After <hi>Frysol</hi>
was thus Knighted, taking his leaue of the Emperour and
his Daughter, he departed, making no small hast till he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
at the Ioustes at <hi>Parris,</hi> where he determined for his

<hi>Polinarda.</hi> But he could not get thither so soone as hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
for hee was hindered by the way with an vnexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

another in such sort, as nowe hee had but two left to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist

so fast as they coulde ride, but <hi>Frysol</hi> would not folow, least
they had some other companie in ambush that might haue

Mothers Castell, where hee remained that night, and the
next daie set forwarde to <hi>Parris,</hi> where hee arriued at the

                     <p>After the Knight of the <hi>Sunne</hi> (who hencefoorth shall

dewe did great harme to his woundes, as if God had
not armed him with the better strength, he was in daunger
not to escape with life. The verie same daie was the Duke

him with troublesome warres: and the Duke beeing
benighted, was glad to pitch his Tents in a faire fielde,
through which it fortuned <hi>Frysol</hi> to passe, complayning of
the daunger he felt himselfe in. The Duke of <hi>Gaule</hi> beeing
abroade foorth of hys Tent to recreate himselfe, hearde this
sorrowfull noyse, which made him send his men to sée who
it was, and to bring him with them to the Tent, whither
when they had brought him, the Duke pitting his estate,
demaunded whence he came, and who had wounded him
in that sort. Then discoursed he the whole matter, how hee
had fought with the Knight that ouercame the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoye,</hi>
and so long their fight endured, that the darke night
<pb facs="tcp:1616:109"/>
and the King caused them to be parted, neyther of them as
yet conquered, and because he woulde not returne into the
Cittie, sought some Uillage where he might conuenientlie
lodge. The Duke of <hi>Gaule</hi> hearing the wordes of <hi>Frysol,</hi>
estéemed him for a hardy and valiant Knight, hauing so

ayde and succour I can giue you, you shall bee sure to finde
with hartie good will: assuring you, that there is no Knight
liuing to whom I wysh more euill, then him whom you

                        </hi>
In this time the other Ladies were conferring of <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins</hi>
knightlie valour, when the Countie of <hi>Armignac</hi> his
Sonne, intreating the Duke of <hi>Orleaunce</hi> Daughter to
daunce, was thus staied by her spéeches to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> other Ladies.
You sée faire Ladies (quoth shee) that <hi>Palmerin</hi> hath mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
our beauties, to reuenge our iniurie, let vs all fall
vppon him, and shut him in some place where hee may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
come foorth, for if he escape vs, the <hi>Allemaigne</hi> Ladies
shall beare the honor from the <hi>French,</hi> which will bee to vs
perpetuall discredite. These wordes she spake with such a
pleasant countenaunce, as mooued all the other Ladies to
smile, whereupon the Duchesse of <hi>Burgundie</hi> answered. In
sooth it is necessarie we should doo so, and let vs not suffer
him to gette out of our handes so easilie, as he did from the
Knights that came to the Combat. All the companie lyked
this motion well, but the King said. Ladies, I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
that <hi>Palmerin</hi> shall haue anie wronge, because I haue
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1616:110"/>
taken him into my guarde. And who shall make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
(quoth another Ladie) for the wrong hee hath
doone vs? You ought to suffer for satis-faction, saide y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> King,
and bee glad that you had the meane to sée the best Knight
in the world, for mine owne part I promise you, I rest so
contented. <hi>Palmerin</hi> hearing the King so commende him,
bashfullie thus aunswered. Alas my Lorde, there is no such
matter in me as pleaseth your Maiesty to report, but what
my abilitie is, it remaines to doo you seruice: accounting my
selfe more then happy by comming to your Courte, to haue
knowledge of a Prince so noble and vertuous, and no man
liuing (next my Lord the Emperour) that maie commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
me more then your highnes. Among other speeches, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> King
broke the matter of his Daughters marriage to <hi>Palmerin,</hi>
desiring him to labour in the cause to <hi>Trineus,</hi> which hee
promised: but al in vain, for after they had taken their leaue
to returne towards <hi>Allemaigne,</hi> though <hi>Palmerin</hi> was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in the matter, in respecte of the beautie and nobilitie of
the Princesse, as for the support he might haue by mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
with the Daughter of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> yet <hi>Trineus</hi> thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.
I thanke you my Lord for the good you wish mee,
as also the honour the King affoordes mee: but another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
her (whose renowne hath conquered me) is Lady and
Mistresse of my affections. And because you are hee fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whom I will not hide my most secrete thoughts, know that
it is <hi>Agriola,</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>England,</hi> to whom
though my Father be an enemie, yet by your aide &amp; mine
owne good endeuours, I doo not doubt to compasse my loue.
You knowe my Lord (quoth <hi>Palmerin)</hi> that I wish as wel
to you as mine owne hart, and when occasion serues, tryall
shall make manifest. And séeing you haue fixed your loue on
faire <hi>Agriola</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> imparting likewise the same so
confidently to me: I am perswaded you coulde neuer make
a better choise, therefore let nothing chaunge your opinion.
Thus rode they on with manie sundrie spéeches, not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
gladde they were returning to the Emperour, but <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:1616:111"/>
much more then was <hi>Trineus,</hi> for the desire hee had
to sée his Ladie <hi>Polinarda:</hi> wherefore with the consent of
the Prince, he sent a Squire before to aduertise the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of their comming, before whom he had no sooner doone
reuerence, but he was presentlie knowne, and demaunded
in what estate his Son <hi>Trineus</hi> and <hi>Palmerin</hi> were, where
he had left them, &amp; what accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts had happened in <hi>Fraunce?</hi>
Then the Squire rehearsed the Combats and victories of
his Maister against the Princes of <hi>Fraunce</hi> and the Dukes
of <hi>Gaule</hi> &amp; <hi>Sauoye,</hi> with their royall entertainment by the
King and his Sonne, howe manie portraits of Ladies <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
had conquered, with the whole discourse of euerie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Whereof the Emperour, the Empresse, and all the
Lords &amp; Ladies were maruailous glad, yet was not theyr
ioy comparable to the Princesse <hi>Polinardas,</hi> hearing the
Squire reueale the honourable déedes of her loue, so that
her conceit might be discerned by her cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, &amp; needes
she must thus demaunde of the Squire. I praie thée tell me
my Fréende, howe fares my Lord and Brother, with his
noble companion Sir <hi>Palmerin?</hi> The Squire wel abuised,
because he knewe the loue betwéene her and his Maister,
sette his knee to the grounde againe with this aunswere. I
left the Prince your Brother, accompanied with my Lord,
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> well and in good health: but chéefely my Lorde,
who since you sawe him, hath wunne the greatest honour
that euer Knight did. Afterward he reported the manner of
the Combats to her, and what gréefe his Maister sustained
in his sicknes, when he coulde not be reuenged on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Knight
that lost her counterfeit, which the Duke of <hi>Sauoye</hi> placed
at the féete of <hi>Lucemania,</hi> and last of all, the perillous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
betwéene his Maister &amp; the Knight of the <hi>Sun.</hi> Which
she tooke such delight to heare, as she made him repeate
one thing manie times, and could not satis-fie herselfe suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientlie
with these worthy reports. Which the Squire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing,
delighted as much to itterate euerie thing, and said.
Beléeue me Madame, the loue my Maister beares to her,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1616:111"/>
for whose beautie he entered the Combat, in my opinion is
incredible, for he is much more hers then his owne, and I
haue séene him in such sort thinking on her, as one coulde
hardlie iudge him aliue or deade, fearing least anie other
shold rob him of his loue, such is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iealousie of his vnspotted
affection, albeit my Maister reputes his Ladie immouable.
<hi>Polinarda</hi> changing countenance oftentimes at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Squires
wordes, aunswered. The Ladie shoulde be very ill councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
béeing honoured with the looue of so good a Knight as
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> to make refusall of his worthie seruice: and I
promise thée, by the faith of a Princesse, that if I knew her,
for the vnwillingnes I haue to heare him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine, I wold
endeuour to cause her like none but him, and therein to
thinke herselfe the most happie among Ladies. Wherfore
[if thou maist bee so bolde] tell thy Maister at his returne,
that I will be a meane to aide him towardes her he loues:
and therewithall present him my fauourable salutations,
in that I euermore desired the fortunate ende of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise,
not so much for the lyking of his Ladie, béeing beloued
of the best, as for the renowned chiualrie that harbours in
his hart. These spéeches ended, the Squire returned to méet
the Prince <hi>Trineus</hi> and his Maister, to whom he reported
his talke with <hi>Polynarda:</hi> which <hi>Palmerin</hi> reioycing at,
let fall all iealousie, estéeming her nowe the truest Lady li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
The men of <hi>Gaunt</hi> for ioy of his returne, that so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilie
deliuered them from the oppressions of the enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Knight, went foorth in seuerall companies, according as
honor, yéeres and office directed them, to méete him, and so
conueied him with signes of ioy to the Pallace, where the
Emperour so much abased himselfe, as he came downe into
the open Court to entertaine him, and glad likewise to see
the safe returne of his Sonne <hi>Tryneus,</hi> saying. My Sonne,
right happie is thy returne, &amp; you Sir <hi>Palmerin,</hi> perswade
your selfe so welcome as hart can deuise, assuring you, that
your successe hath not a little pleased me. And needes must
I account the Ladie especially bounden to you, for whose
<pb facs="tcp:1616:112"/>
loue you haue past so manie dangerous Combats, good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hath she to loue you, in respect of your trauailes for her,
renowning her so much by your knightlie chiualrie, so that
if she recompence you not according to your merits, woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilie
may she be condemned of ingratitude. Alas my Lords
(quoth he) her beautie commaundeth higher matters then
all my labours. <hi>Polynarda</hi> béeing in presence, remembred
well her Fathers words, and therfore she intended to shun
that condemnation, saying to herselfe. He that deserues ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
ought to were it, and he that commaundes the soule,
may easilie ouer-rule the passions of the minde: let my
Knight then be rewarded as he hath rightly deserued. All
this while, the eyes of these two louers so well discharged
their office, as <hi>Palmerin</hi> wished that <hi>Iuno</hi> had graunted
him so much, as she did somtime to <hi>Argus</hi> her shéepehearde,
that he might haue more ease in his afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for he thought
it not enough, onelie to behold the beautie of so rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
perfection. Againe, he was not a little tormented,
because <hi>Polynarda</hi> (to couer what she woulde gladlie none
should discerne) cast her lookes on the ground, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
shee likewise compelled him to doo: but her presence
whom he estéemed aboue all other things, would not allow
him that consideration. The Emperour at length comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that all the figures of the Ladies which he had wunne
in Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat, should be brought before him: but when hée sawe

Sir <hi>Palmerins</hi> victorie. Then were diuers iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
giuen of the beauty of the portraits, eache one of the
beholders after their seuerall opinions. <hi>Ptolome</hi> made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of whom they were, and who did enter Combatte
on their behalfe, omitting at no tune the honour of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin:</hi>
whereat they all admired, some commending
their complexions, others their swéete yong yéeres, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather
the prowesse of him that brought the conquest
with him, whereupon the Emperour said. In good faith Sir
<hi>Palmerio,</hi> I blesse the time that Fortune sent me so good a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1616:112"/>
Knight, and thinke not to carrie awaie all the glory of your
victorie your selfe, for I meane to haue part because you
gaue your selfe mine. And woulde the Ladie you loue were
in thys Courte or in my Realme, to the ende I might so
assist you in your sute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you might both be mine. My Lord
(quoth <hi>Palmerin)</hi> the victorie is wholie yours, béeing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by your Knight, and if the Ladie I loue were not vnder
your regiment, then shoulde I complaine of a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

as your humble subiect and Seruaunt. With which
aunswere the Emperour was highlie contented, and <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>
comming to his Sister <hi>Polynarda,</hi> saide. Trust mee
faire Sister, you are more indebted to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
other Knight in the worlde beside, and rather accept of
him then of the Duke of <hi>Lorrayne,</hi> who maintaining your
beautie, was ouercome by the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> and your pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
placed at the féete of <hi>Lucemania,</hi> where yet it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
but that <hi>Palmerin</hi> conquering the Duke, remooued
the figure of the <hi>French</hi> Princesse in obeysaunce to you. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynarda</hi>
not content with the vndiscréete enterprise of the
Duke of <hi>Lorrayne,</hi> aunswered. In sooth good Brother, the
Duke of <hi>Lorrayne</hi> is none of my Knight, and I repute <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
to haue more bountie and valour, then the Duke can
haue of wit or courage, therefore great meruaile that hee
was not slaine. The Emperour seeing <hi>Polynarda</hi> was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with the Duke of <hi>Lorrayne,</hi> aunswered. You cannot
(Daughter) forbid men to execute their owne pleasure, and
if the Duke liked to enter the Combat for your beautie, it
was for the honourable good will he bare you, and albeit hée
could not reache his desire, yet haue you no cause to thinke
the worsse of him. <hi>Polynarda</hi> béeing a Princesse of rare
wit and iudgment, as anie of her time, would multiply no
more words, but continued silent: neuerthelesse, <hi>Palmerin</hi>
remembring her aunswere to <hi>Tryneus,</hi> intreated her to
kéepe all the portraits of the Ladies, determining to sende
them to whom they belonged, according to their degrées in
<pb facs="tcp:1616:113"/>
birth and honor. Which she thankfully accepted, and spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
this whole daie in diuers delights, <hi>Palmerin</hi> béeing in
the euening in his Chamber accompanied with <hi>Ptolome,</hi>
sent his Dwarffe to the Princesse to appoint the time of
their méeting: and she séeing the Dwarffe, caught him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the necke, demaunding of him what newes hee
brought. None but good Madame, answered the Dwarffe,
my Maister hath sent you the <hi>Bon soir,</hi> and therewith his
humble duetie to your highnes, for, being your Knight, and
liuing onelie to doo you seruice: he hath good hope that your
vertuous nature wyll not forget, howe many daungers he
hath past for your sake, and nowe dooth loue appeale for his

for might I once receiue my content, then shoulde I

<hi>Ptolome</hi> béeing present, asked the Dwarffe if he saw <hi>Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onella.</hi>
No in sooth (quoth he) she was not in the Princesse
Chamber, nor (to my knowledge) was she acquainted with

with deuotion answerable to those silent howres, and theyr

and <hi>Brionella</hi> were in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same predicament, for he knowing
her to be of the noble and auncient ligne, beside, sole heyre
to the house of <hi>Saxon,</hi> might count himselfe highly honored
with such a Wife: and therefore the like coniunction was
made betwéene them, so that nowe these Knights and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
were espoused before God, there wanted nothing but
the ceremonie of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Church to confirme it. But nowe comes
<hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> and hee breakes of this pleasure, because y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> time
was so farre spent, as they must néeds depart: which with
much a doo they did, leauing their Ladies examining theyr
content, the Princesse soone after thus conferring with
<hi>Brionella.</hi> Alas faire Fréende, it is doubtfull what danger
maie arise, because you haue contracted your selfe to <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me</hi>
without the Emperors consent: howe will you answer
when you are charged with the fault? <hi>Brionella,</hi> who now
feared nothing but the preuenting of her loue, aunswered.
In sooth Madame, you speake with great reason, you nowe
giue counsell when the déede is doone, and cannot bee reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
till it be dispatched: woulde you haue all the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
your selfe, and suffer your Freende to enioy no part
with you? trust mee that is vnconscionable dealing, for he
that made you to loue, framed me of the selfe same mettall.
But I sée you make the occasion to me, to learne howe to
aunswere your owne déede: let vs referre all to him Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
that appointed your choise by destinie, and mine by
mine owne lyking. Manie other pleasaunt spéeches passed
betwéene them, and diuers times their Knights came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
them, till Fortune who will neuer suffer thinges long
in one estate, sent an occasion to hinder this delight of theyr
loue: for there was a Messenger come to the Courte from
the King of <hi>Norvvay,</hi> Nephew to the Emperour, who bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
admitted audience, thus deliuered his message. Woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
Lord, the King of <hi>Norvvay</hi> my Maister, requires your
assistaunce in his great distresse, against the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:1616:115"/>
who with a mightie and puissaunt Armie is entered
his dominions, where he hath made great wast &amp; slaughter
of his people, in diuers skirmishes and conflicts passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, so that he neuer had like<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>néede as at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.
Trust me (quoth the Emperour) I will assiste him
with right good will, and his mis-fortune dooth not a little
gréeue me, but I will take order for it immediatlie, and my
power shall be with him so soone as possiblie maie be, with
which aunswere the Messenger departed. Nowe as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the cause of these warres, betwéene the Kings of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>
and <hi>England,</hi> it was procured by displeasure of succor,
that the King of <hi>Norway</hi> gaue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who helde warre with <hi>England</hi> about the taking of
certaine Shippes: the Emperour likewise his heauie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
and for that cause he promised helpe so soone to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> King
his Nephew. Which when <hi>Trineus</hi> vnderstoode, that his
Father declared himselfe displeased with the Father of his
beloued <hi>Agriola,</hi> (whose loue no occasion coulde alter) hee
was greatlie discontented: yet dissembling his conceit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
rather to aide the King of <hi>Englande,</hi> then his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin,
and therefore intreated <hi>Palmerin</hi> to accompanie him to
his Chamber, where hee woulde acquaint him with some
part of the sorrow he conceiued, by the succour his Father
would sende to the King of <hi>Norvvay,</hi> against her Father
whose Seruant he had vowed himselfe, and therfore (quoth
he) let me desire you to conceale a request I shall make to
you. You knowe my Lorde, said <hi>Palmerin,</hi> that I will no
lesse obey you then the Emperour your Father, commaund
therefore what you please, and be it in my power, it shal be
executed. So it is, quoth <hi>Trineus,</hi> that I woulde haue you
not accompanie the power my Father sendes by Sea, but
doo so much for me, that you, <hi>Ptolome,</hi> &amp; my selfe (vnknown
to anie) may assist the King of <hi>England</hi> in his warres, by
which meanes I doubt not to compasse the thing I most of
all desire. And this I dare tell you, that my life is only dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to her seruice, and so well doo I hope to imploye my
<pb facs="tcp:1616:116"/>
paines, that she shall haue cause to loue me, and regard the
paine I suffer for her sake: and but I gaine the fortune to
to purchase my loue, right soone &amp; suddaine shall you heare
of my death. You that haue felt the like torments can cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of mine, which I dare not impart to the Emperor my
Father, because of the hatred hee beares the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
aduise mee therefore good Fréende what I shall doo.
These spéeches were nothing pleasing to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> seeing
he must nowe againe depart from his Ladie: but because
he earnestly affected <hi>Trineus,</hi> and knew how wel he might
helpe him in his loue, answered. Assure your selfe my Lord,
that I will labour dissigentlie for your good, and shall assist
you to my vttermost, in that you beare such loue to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.
And I am of the opinion, that hauing receiued the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of knighthood, which the Emperour your Father wyll
not denie, it woulde auaile you much, to tell your Father
how<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> you desire (vnknowne) to aide the King of <hi>Norway.</hi>
For my part, if he demaunde my aduise, I will like it so
well, as because the Annie cannot bee readie so soone, your
honor, <hi>Ptolome</hi> and my selfe will ryde before towards the
King, and so may we accomplish what you so earnestlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
This counsell pleased so well <hi>Trineus,</hi> as he intended
on the morrow to request his order of the Emperor: as also
how gladlie he wold assist y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> King of <hi>Norway,</hi> and howe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

that such as are borne to gouerne Kingdoms, if they giue

conceiuing well thereof, answered. Since your desire
is so earnest to be made Knight, I am well contented, but
I wold haue it doone honorablie, and before a greater assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie

howe much more then is it to our Kinsman, especially

<pb facs="tcp:1616:120"/>
conquere, weakening them so mightily as wee haue doone:
let vs not dismay then, but witnes that the worst manne
amongst vs, is more valiant and hardie in Armes, then the
greatest Lord that is in their companie, eache man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cherrish his hope, and bearde our enemies to the very
téeth. The daie following, the enemie came foorth at a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne
Gate, and held the Dukes power very good playe,
and the <hi>Norwayes</hi> very well appoynted with Bowes and
arrowes, gauled the Horsse so cruelly, as they were glad to
take their Campe, wherupon the Countie <hi>Tolano</hi> in hope
of the daie, followed vpon them with his <hi>Allemaigne</hi> court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,
which <hi>Frysol</hi> perceiuing, mette him in the face with
his <hi>English</hi> squadron, and giuing the spurres to his Horse,
ran with his Launce quite thorow his bodie: whereat the
<hi>Allemaignes</hi> much amazed, when they saw their Generall
fall dead from his Horse, determined valiantly to reuenge
his death, but <hi>Frysol</hi> and his men dealt with them so round
lie, as the stoutest was glad and faine to make them waie.
Yet had they hemde in <hi>Frysol</hi> with such a troupe, as if the
Duke had not spéedilie come with reskewe, they had taken
him, and then began the sharpest bickering, for the Duke of
<hi>Gaule</hi> and <hi>Frysol</hi> with their men so bestirred them, as the
<hi>Allemaignes</hi> cleane discouraged, beganne to disorder them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and with the <hi>Norwayes</hi> fled to the Cittie so fast as
they coulde, where <hi>Frysol</hi> &amp; his men had entered, but that
the King of <hi>Norway</hi> not daring to come into the fielde, was
there with men sufficient to resist his entrie. Thus remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the victory to the Duke of <hi>Gaule,</hi> by the braue pollicies
of <hi>Frysol</hi> and his men, he béeing generally commended of
the Armie: and thus retired the <hi>Allemaignes</hi> &amp; <hi>Norvvayes</hi>
to their shame and dishonor. After the retrait sounded by
the King of <hi>Norway,</hi> hee sent to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke to demaunde truce
for foure and twentie howres, that they might burye the

who by the counsell of his Lorde and Captaines,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1616:120"/>
was sent home into his Country. The King and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
secretlie in the night embarqued themselues, to ioyne
with the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> who expected his comming, &amp; then
did the Cittizens sende word to the Duke, that by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> breake

so well contented the Officers, as by their meanes

entertained, and two daies togeather were there fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted

answered. Why Sir Knight, where learned you so little
courtship, as when the fairest in the Westerne world pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
before you, you make no gentle gesture or salutation? I
doubt that what is counted honestie &amp; vertue among men

                        </gap>eemed harsh and vnciuill, which
makes me repute you more méete for the Kitchen, then to
beare the honorable office and rich Armes of a Knight, as
you doo. <hi>Trineus</hi> as it were awaked out of a traunce, saide.
Ah swéete Ladie pardon me, for by my faith I can neither
tell what you said, nor well where I am my selfe: for euen
as you ended, I felt such a passion strike me to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very hart,
as death will soone arrest me without remedie. The Ladie,
who knewe not his meaning, checked him againe, thus.
Were it not better then for you to be in the field, then héere
in this foolish and vndiscréete pensiuenes? It is true Lady,
(quoth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince) that at this time I haue shewed my selfe
vnmannerlie, and a slender Courtier, yet is not the blame
altogeather to be throwne on me, ignoraunt who the Lady
was which you speake of: for wee are strange Knightes,
and are come farre from this Countrey, with intent to aide

she sent them answere by her Gouernesse, that shee enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
them as her Knights, and as her Seruants desired
them to goe aide the King her Father, yet woulde shee not
consent to pardon them, till the renowne of their exploites
might shewe them to deserue it. <hi>Trineus</hi> tooke this answer
for better aduantage then the Princesse thought on, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himselfe happy by such a good beginning, and therefore
saide to the Ladie. I think my selfe (faire Ladie) one of the

our enemie hath not one man in his Armie, endued with

and therefore if we martch on valiantlie, continuing reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

your forwardnes will make them fearefull, and your verie

his men in this manner. The time is nowe come (loyal

so that if you set before your eyes the occasion calling vs to

duetie bound him, in respect he could not honestly refuse to
aide the King of <hi>Norway</hi> his Cosin, and hereof I can assure
you, in that I haue sometime béene in his Court, that hée is

My Maister (quoth the Dwarffe) hath not his second in all

whence he is? what are his companions? and why to they

gladly tell you some thing to your content, so you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
me on your princely worde, that what I reueale shall
neuer be disouered by you. Perswade thy selfe thereof, sayd
the Princesse, and looke what thou sayst, by my honor, shall
neuer turne to thy after harme. Then know fayre Madame,
(quoth he) that the gréene knight is of the most noble and
illustrious house in <hi>Europe,</hi> louing a Ladie as his proper
life, for whom he hath left his Countrey, parents &amp; friends,
to come and do her seruice. The blacke knight, as I haue

that neuer shall any creature know it by my meanes. You

in yéelding. Resolue your selfe therefore good Madame, that
the braue gréene Knight, so rich in Armes, but more in
minde, is the Prince <hi>Trineus,</hi> Sonne to the Emperour of
<hi>Allemaigne,</hi> so passionate in loue, and so depriued of liberty,
by deuout seruice to your excellent bountie: as against both
duetie and nature, he hath deceiued his Father, feigning to
come ayde his Kinsman the King of <hi>Norway,</hi> where contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise,
he hath shewed himselfe his mortall enemie. And to

then to make known his long &amp; labourous desires, to make

when loue to you excéedeth nature: may it not bee termed
loue surpassing all other, eyther registred in antiquities, or

it is beyonde my power to returne condigne recompence,
yet in respect of thy secrecie, I dare assure thée, mine owne

so kissing her hande hée departed, leauing her so

shée not disclose her minde, no not to <hi>Eufemia,</hi> her secret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
thinking herselfe too much bewrayed, because the

pastime they had all that morning. The Knightes hauing
saluted the Quéene and her Ladies, <hi>Trineus</hi> saluting the
Princesse <hi>Agriola,</hi> was so transported as hée scant knewe
where he was. The Princesse likewise fixed with a stedfast
eye on him, as wounded both him and her selfe togither,
her complexion so aptly deciphering her sickenesse, as the
Prince perceyuing it, sayd to himselfe. Ah loue, hast thou

cannot but content you. Demaunde what thou wilt, quoth

Then beganne the whole discourse hee had with the

in hardie manner, reueale to the Princesse, when you shall
find her at conuenient leysure, both howe you loue her, and
what fauourable grace you expect at her hands. I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
that Letters and messages are able to doo much: but
the person béeing present, and knowing how to request, and
how to be answered, is more auailable a thousand times:
and in bréefe, no Messenger can bée like himselfe. I speake
not this, as though my Dwarfe were not faithfull, but to

so that he stroue in such sort in his sleepe, as <hi>Trineus</hi> béeing

the whole effect of his dreame, and said. It will not bée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
my Lord that to morrow we ride armed in the Kings

vntrue, yet can presage no good to follow. I like your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell

who meruailed much to sée them so prepared, and
doubting they had receiued some occasion of offence, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
what mooued them so to be armed. You know my Lord

for all aduentures, and not knowing what inconuenience

because they were armed, and they with the Quéene were

the strokes of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who reached him such a sound

<hi>Trineus</hi> hearing the words of <hi>Agriola,</hi> was enflamed
with such a spirite of conquering desire, as breaking in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the thickest, his strokes gaue witnes he fought for a

his side were slaine, but this fresh assistance brought by the
king, was the meane that all the Giants knightes were
slaughtered, and they knéeling down thanking God for their

such a gracious acte to kill that monstrous villaine? Euen
hee Madame, said the king, that was cause of my victorie in

Realme of <hi>England.</hi> While these spéeches endured, <hi>Trineus</hi>
béeing sore wounded, was brought betwéen two squires and
set vpon his horse, but the king, the quéene, and chéefely faire
<hi>Agriola</hi> was glad, when she heard there was no such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

horsebacke, they rode to sée the Giants bodie, which made
<hi>Agriola</hi> repute <hi>Palmerin</hi> for no lesse then his Dwarfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended

Therefore you may assure him on my behalfe, that the loue

his iudgement, as the proofe hereof (in time) shall deliuer
true testimonie. Madame, quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> his onely desire
in this world you haue faithfully vnderstoode, in you then it
consisteth to preuent the contrarie, by mercifull regarde of

she, referre this talke to some other time, for the answere
of such a high and weightie matter, deserueth to be excogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
with leysure, for oftentimes we sée, that such actions
sodainely and slightly performed, causeth more repentaunce
afterward then is expected. Yet thus farre I venture, and
so faithfully perswade him, that he is the onely Prince in
the world I would accept for my husband, if they were so
agréed to whom God, nature, and dutie hath bounde mée:
and to let him vnderstand my wiliing desire towardes him,
I will speake to him my selfe, as soone as the Quéene is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
<pb facs="tcp:1616:139"/>
Not long after, the Quéene returned to the King,
leauing her Daughter with two of her Ladyes to comfort
the prince, whereupon <hi>Palmerin</hi> taking her by the hande,
brought her to the bedde side where <hi>Trineus</hi> lay, to whome
she made very curteous reuerence, &amp; trembling with modest
bashfulnesse, said. How fare ye gentle knight? trust mee
your hard fortune doth greatly displease mee, and if I could
beare part therein, beléeue me I would gladly endure the
paine: for it is good reason that the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

should haue a portion of the torment, gratifying you with a
Maidens thankes, for your good assistance without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert.
<hi>Trineus</hi> was so rauished with her presence, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her speake so friendly, in whom consisted the safetie of
his life, as hee could not vtter the ioy hee conceiued: which
the Princesse well noted and <hi>Palmerin</hi> likewise, who aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
her in this manner. It cannot be madame but my
Lord <hi>Trineus</hi> will soone amend, hauing the sodaine mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
so néere him, that is onely able to helpe him: and
with these wordes he left them both together, to acquaint
each other with their secret afflictions: when the Prince
giuing a gréeuous sigh, saide. Faire madame, to accomplish
what you commanded the first day I sawe you, I did my
beuoire to execute the effect of the charge, albeit not so suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
as I could wish: yet since that time I neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed
one minute of rest, till this instant, when mine eyes
delighted with your swéete presence, gaue hope to my heart
of further comfort. For this onely cause (faire mistresse)
haue I forsaken my Parents and countrey, regarding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then this present happinesse, whereby my

it, that scanning disdaine should be hid in such rare perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as oftentimes it commeth so to passe: therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séech
<pb facs="tcp:1616:140"/>
you Madame, may it stand with your liking to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
all doubts by your direct opinion, and héerein shall I
account my selfe more honoured, then were I monarch of
the whole worlde. Loue hauing then so wounded the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,

my Lord, I was (ere this) so certaine of your affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
me, in respect of the dangerous trauailes endured
for my sake, as you néede not séeke any other prooues, then
what mine owne hart was fully resolued on: and so I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
still, expecting the day to make vs both fortunate,
which I would haue you as yet dissemble, least crooked mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap
any way preuent vs. As she was procéeding in her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
the Quéene entred the tent againe, by which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<hi>Trineus</hi> could not say what he intended, wherefore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her secretly by the hand, wrong her fingers with such
a trembling passion, as all the night following he lay medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
on his gooddesse <hi>Agriola,</hi> and the comfortable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
shee gaue him. If the young prince were in such tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
his Lady beare him companie, thinking on the spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
past betwéene her and <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and this euening
the Dwarfe (not compassing before to speake with <hi>Agrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la)</hi>
presented her with the Emeralde from the Prince,
which she kindly receiuing, in recompence thereof sent him
a fayre Diamond, rewarding the Dwarfe liberally for his
paines, who among the rest of his talke, highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the vertues of the Prince, which increased her loue so
confidently, as she assured him of the Princesse loue, that
death could not change her setled affection. <hi>Trineus</hi> fully
resoluing héereon, gaue such chéerefull phisicke to his heart,
and the Chururgions such dilligence to his woundes, as
within seauen or eight daies he was able to beare armor:
whereupon the King departed thence towardes <hi>London,</hi>

and his friendes were greatly abashed. Passing on to the
Pallace, all the way they were still presented with rare
shewes and deuises, and the Knights lodgings were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
in very stately Chambers in the Court, causing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Court to be kept for eight dayes space, for the honour
of these knights, and entertainement of all friendly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
in all which time there wanted no sports &amp; delights,
as such times rnd occasions do necessarily require. Nowe
came all the Princes, Lords, and renowned Knights in
<hi>England</hi> to the Court, except the Duke of <hi>Gaule,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
himselfe by the warre in his owne prouince, which

hée reputed to himselfe for his foyle in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> when

<hi>Agriola.</hi> These knights thus worthily intreated,
they were at no time denied entrance into the King and

when himselfe pleased, conferre with the Princesse, till this

care &amp; deuotion, though not sufficient to equal your deserts,
yet because ingratitude shal not insult against me. So many
thanks (quoth the Princesse) I returne you my Lord, as
good opinions can bee imagined betwéene vs both, and
accounting you for my friende, which is a higher degrée,

(quoth shée) this is the man in your presence, name <hi>Mise<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res,</hi>
a vile Traytour, and publique adulterer. And if he dare
affirme that I haue spoken vntruth, I haue héere brought
a Knight with mée, who by Combatte shall make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
his falshood and treason, so please your Maiestie to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
my request. <hi>Miseres,</hi> (quoth the King) how answere
you this accusation and offence, wherewith this Lady char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
you? <hi>Miseres</hi> béeing suddainly driuen into this dumpe,
knewe not well what to saye: yet at length (with humble
reuerence) hée thus beganne. My soueraigne Lorde, if cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
may be giuen to the first countenaunce of accusations,
without hearing howe the partye accused can iustifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
I doubt not but your Maiestie will presentlye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
mee: but when the matter is well debated and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided,
they which séemed at first vnreprooueable, are found
malicious and slaunderous persons, and the accused, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and frée from blame, as heere your highnesse shall
most plainely beholde. The matter whereof this Ladye
detecteth mée, is forged, and most villainously inuented:
for to mée belonged the Castle shée quarrelles for, discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from my Predecessours, to whom I am the true, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and legitimate inheritour. True it is that this dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Womanne, by swéete spéeches, feminine guiles, and
secrete deceits, oftentimes practised to winne mée for her
Husbande: but knowing her behauiour such as beséemed
not a Woman of modestie and vertue, I would not héere
her, much lesse consent to match with her. And this is the
cause of her complaint, in hope that you, (béeing aboue all
other Princes most b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nigne and honourable) will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine
mée to wedde her, in respecte of your absolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
as the duetifull obedience wherein I am bounde.
When the Knight which came with the Lady, heard <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seres</hi>
blame her in this sorte, hee stepped before the King
with these words.</p>
                     <p>It is great follie (my Lord) in <hi>Miseres,</hi> to deny a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so apparantly knowne, although, if it were put to the
<pb facs="tcp:1616:143"/>
iudgement of honeste personnes, his common good reporte
might cause him be beléeued: but the poore Ladye desires
that her right may bée cleared by Combatte, wherein let
him confounde her if hée can, or else receiue rewarde for his
notorious offence. On her behalfe, therefore my Lorde, I
saye and will maintaine, that <hi>Myseres</hi> is a most disloyall
Traytour, and his mouth shall confesse it, or this day will
I take his heade from his bodie. <hi>Myseres</hi> feeling himselfe
somewhat touched, grewe into great anger, and albeit the
shame he did the Ladie deliuered him culpable, and made
him doubt the issue of the Combatte: yet in meruaylous
choller hée aun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wered the Knight, that hée falselye belyed
him, and was readie to make proofe thereof in Combatte,
if it pleased the King so to appoint it. And I doubt not (quoth
hée) to make thée paye for thy rashnesse, and force thée con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
thy lacke of discretion, in giuing credite to the troth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
complaints of this deceitfull Woman. Then was it
ordained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this difference should bée tryed by Armes:
wherupon the Ladies Knight spake thus to the King. Sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it hath pleased your Maiestie, to graunt the Fielde to
<hi>Myseres</hi> and mée, may it please you (as it is the custome) to
commaunde, that he deliuer hostages: to the ende, if hée
bee vanquished, the Castle maye bee deliuered into your
handes, to deliuer it in iustice where it appertaines. Good
reason, saide the King, and therefore <hi>Myseres,</hi> you must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you enter the Fielde, accomplishe what the Knight in
equitie hath demaunded.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Myseres</hi> called one of his Brethren, whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to stande as his hostage: and doubt not before the
Sunne be sette, but I will discharge my selfe &amp; my pledge,
with which wordes hee departed the Hall to arme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
but because the daye was too farre spent, the matter
was deferred till the next morning. The King &amp; his Lords,
séeing the Ladies Knight in such resolute assurance, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled
of whence and what he was, for none there knewe
him but <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who neither coulde gesse assuredly what
<pb facs="tcp:1616:143"/>
he was, but by the golden Sunne in the Azure sheeld, which
made him remember that at the Ioustes in <hi>Fraunce</hi> the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous
Combate without victorie on either side, was fought
betwéene him and this knight. <hi>Palmerin</hi> being glad to sée
the man he long looked for, and purposing now to bee fully
reuenged on him, secretly went forth of the hall, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
one of his Squires, to conuey his horse and armour the
next morning out of the Citie, because if he vanquished <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seres,</hi>
at his returne be intended to fight with him, or if <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seres</hi>
had the better, yet he should not depart thence againe
with life.</p>
                     <p>Nowe you must vnderstande, that this Knight which
came with the Ladie, was the Knight of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> named
<hi>Frysoll,</hi> who euer since the Combatte betwéene <hi>Palmerin</hi>
and him, remained with the Duke of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and was of
him highly honoured for his woorthie chiualrie. Of whom
when this distressed Ladie heard, shée made her complaint
to him of the wrong <hi>Myseres</hi> had done her, and <hi>Frysol</hi> pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her case, promised to ayde her in recouerie of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er right:
and so came with her to the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Court, to the
great gréefe of the Duke of <hi>Gaule,</hi> who made <hi>Frysol</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
him to returne againe after the Combatte: but <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sol</hi>
was more desirous thereof then the Duke, in respect of
his fayre Syster, because hée was specially beloued of her.
Thus <hi>Palmerin</hi> following his enterprise, feared to bée pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented,
because the Féeld was appoynted by the King, in
the same place where hée intended to méete with <hi>Frysol,</hi>
and beside, <hi>Palmerin</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Norgalles</hi> were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
Iudges of the field, which hée would not willingly
haue taken vpon him, doubting by that meane to bee hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of his other determination. The time being come that
the Knights should to the Combatte, the King and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
came to their Scaffolds, and the two Iudges were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in their Tent, accompanied with many Princes and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
persons.</p>
                     <p>After that the Heraulds bad commaunded the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
<pb facs="tcp:1616:144"/>
to doo theyr deuoyre, then they clasped their helmets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and fetching their carrire, mette with such puissaunce as
<hi>Miseres</hi> brake his Launce on <hi>Frysols</hi> Shéelde, not mouing
him in his Saddle: but <hi>Frysol</hi> driuing his Launce through
<hi>Miseres</hi> bodie, caused the Traytour to fall deade to the
earth. Then he allighting, and opening <hi>Miseres</hi> Helmette,
sawe no life in him, came to the Iudges, saying. You may
nowe perceyue my Lordes, whether hee that offered this
Ladie such villanie, hath receyued his due desert, or no, if
there yet remaine any thing else to do for recouering of her
right, I am here ready to maintaine her cause. <hi>Palmerin,</hi>
who was not verie well pleased with this victorie, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Knight, you haue done enough at this time, pray that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affayres may proue as prosperous to you héereafter, and
in anger went forth of the field, commaunding the bodie of
<hi>Miseres</hi> to be brought thence, which was afterward interred
with great honour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Frysol</hi> hauing thus vanquished <hi>Miseres,</hi> the Ladie for
whom he entred the Combatte, fell on her knées before the
King, desiring him to surrender the castell which <hi>Myseres</hi>
vniustly detained from her. In sooth Ladie, quoth the King,
it is reason you should haue iustice, and your owne deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

My Lord (quoth she) in concealing his name, I should
offer him great wrong, concealing the bountie and prowesse
of the man, which hath not béene sparingly shewed hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

                        </hi>
at his last voyage, and euer since hath so dearly loued him,
as he were his owne naturall brother. I promise you La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
sayde the King, you made no ill choyse of your Knight,
for I haue heeretofore heard of his actions, and am not a
little glad that I know him, wishing he were of my Court,
because a King accompanyed with such persons, must

néedes imagine his Countrie happie. And in respect he is
so braue a Champion, it is impossible but hée shoulde bée a
wyse and vertuous Knight, wherefore I pray you cause
him to come to mee: which shée presently did. And hauing
saluted his Maiestie with honourable reuerence, the King
embraced him with these wordes. Woorthie Sir, you are
most heartily welcome: I coulde wish you were one of my
Knights, in respect that my Court should bee the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
and I might requite your paines better then I can
on a sudden.</p>
                     <p>Mightie Prince, (quoth <hi>Frisol)</hi> in assisting this distressed
Ladie, I haue done but my dutie: but if I could any way
do your highnesse seruice, I knowe no Prince liuing, for
whom I wold more gladly employ my selfe. And at this

neuerthelesse, I intreate you my good Lord, (if it may
stande with your fauourable liking) to repute mee among

néedes be so, sayde the King, you shall doo what please you,
yet will I reckon you amongst those to whom I owe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall

<hi>Frysol</hi> humblie thanked his Maiestie, and departed
with the Ladie, which way they came: but <hi>Palmerin</hi> very
much offended at his departure, and earnestly desiring to be
reuenged on him, commaunded his Dwarffe to marke well
which way they went.</p>
                     <p>The Dwarffe diligently fulfilling his Maisters charge,
returned and told him which way they tooke: wherevpon, he
beeing desirous to follow, without giuing any knowledge
thereof to his companions, left <hi>Trineus</hi> to conferre with his

thus speaking to his man. Returne you to the Cittie, and
there expect my comming: as for thée <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> thou
shalt say to <hi>Tryneus,</hi> that hée must pardon mee, though I

pray him take no paine to enquire after mee, because
I doubt not to returne verie shortly, although not so soone

                     <p>So taking his Launce, hee galloped that way which

well recouered, departed thence with the Ladie, because

very solemne feastes prepared, and the Ladie recounted to
<hi>Hermes,</hi> Commissioner for the king, howe <hi>Frysol</hi> fought

was slaine, and a newe Armour, his owne béeing spoyled,
hée returned to the Duke of <hi>Gaule,</hi> who reioyced greatly to
haue his companie. But when the Duke vnderstood how
discourteously he had béene vsed by the blacke Knight, who
was so highly fauoured in the <hi>English</hi> Court, hée deuised
by all the meanes possible to bée reuenged on him: so that
béeing in a Castell on the Frontiers of his Duchie, yet
within the King of <hi>Englandes</hi> dominion, hée vnderstoode
the blacke Knight should passe that way, because he coulde
not else returne to the Court. Now perswading himselfe
for resolute vengeaunce, hée pitched his Tents in a fayre
Medow neare a Bridge, and there placed twelue knights,
<pb facs="tcp:1616:148"/>
the most hardie and valiant men in all his Dukedome, who
should maintaine this order: that no Knight shoulde passe
ouer the Bridge, vnlesse hée entred Combate with those

but if they were dismounted, the passenger shoulde
go on his iourney, and take theyr Horsses with him. Thys
aduenture thus established, many good Knights were ouer

twelue Knights, and yet escape: But the Duke tooke no

                     <p>Beléeue me Damosell, saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> you shewed but

vnhappye bodye are you? but more vnhappye the houre I
mette with you? but séeing it is reason I shoulde kéepe my
promise, leade the way, and I will not faile to follow you.
So rode they on, and for foure dayes space hée woulde not
speake one word to her, and fayne he would haue left her
company, but that he could not with honor forsake her. The
next daye, as they rode by a Riuers side, <hi>Palmerin</hi> espyed a
Knight standing with a Bowe and arrow in his hand, which
he let flye at his Horse &amp; killed him. <hi>Palmerin</hi> impacient by
remembraunce of <hi>Frysol,</hi> and angrye that the Knight had
thus killed his Horse, made towardes him so fast as hee
coulde, but the Knight was suddainlye gotte on the further
site of the Lake, and <hi>Palmerin</hi> vppe to the middle in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
before hée was ware of it, and nowe hee could neyther
sée the Knight that slewe his Horse, nor the Damosell that
came in his companie. <hi>Palmerin</hi> béeing in great perplexity,
when he sawe nothing but water rounde about him, and
féeling he was vpon a Bridge, behelde a meruailous déepe
streame running vnder it, and at the ende thereof a goodly
Castle. Walking along the Bridge toward the Castle, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
at this contrary aduenture, hée espyed a Knight on
the battlements of th<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Castle, who sayde. Staye a while
Syr Knight, one shall come presentlye and open the Gate.
<hi>Palmerin</hi> knewe not what to say, but determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
himselfe if any came to assaulte him, so the Castle
Gate béeing opened, hée entred with his sword drawne, yet
was there no man that displeased him, but euery one made
<pb facs="tcp:1616:149"/>
him humble reuerence, with very good wordes and gentle
countenaunce, declaring by their behauiour, that hée was
more then welcome thither. Thus walking on to the inner
Court, there came towardes him a Ladie, accompanied
with manie Damosels and Knights, all shewing chéerefull
gestures, and the Ladie taking <hi>Palmerin</hi> by the hande,
sayde.</p>
                     <p>Ah, gentle knight, right welcome are you to this place,

<hi>Palmerin</hi> beléeuing the Ladie, was brought into a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous
goodly Chamber, where certaine Squires holpe to

where the Table was couered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Ladie entertaining him
so nobly, as in the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Court hée coulde not
be better. The feast ended, and the Tables withdrawne,
the Ladie beganne to deuise with <hi>Palmerin,</hi> saying. Long
time (my Lord) haue we desired your comming, as the man
in whome our onely helpe consisteth: for by your valour
we are perswaded to be deliuered from the miserie, wherin
I and mine haue too long time béene detained. I beséech
you, Madame, quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> to tell mée your affayres,
as also what the Knight meant to kill my Horse, and why
you entertaine mée with so great kindnesse. If you wil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise

Gramercies gentle knight sayde the Ladie, the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stance

and condition then himselfe, by whom he had a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>augh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
at whose birth his Lady and Wife deceased. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
being yet in the flower of his youth, matched the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time with a Lady of very honourable and auncient
discent, by whom he had me the first Childe. My Sister
come to fourtéene yéeres of age, my father oftentimes
would haue richly married her, whereto she béeing vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
by my Fathers consent shée remained with her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Sister, whose skill was very great in all sciences, by
whose counsel my sister caused a goodly Pallace to be edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and a strong Lower in an Isle on the other side of this
Castle, where afterwarde they made their continuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding.
During this time, my father louing mee déerely,
matched me with a wealthie and noble knight, excelling in
all perfections, but chéefely in chiualrie, by whom I had a
Daughter a yéere after our espousall: but the more my
gréefe, my Husband and Father both died, within little
space after my Childs birth. My Daughter being come to
the yeeres of marriage, her beautie made her desired of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
noble Lords: but because I still reputed her too yong,
I denied all her sute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, which afterwarde turned me to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
great detriment. For my Sisters aunt had a sonne, the
most mishapped, deformed, and worst conditioned knight, as
all the Countrey could not shew such another, yet became
he so amorous of my Daughter, as hee requested his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to demaund her of me for his Wife: but when I heard
thereof, you may well perswade your selfe that neuer wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
disliked any thing more, and yet to this time doo as
much as I then did, so that I made her answere, howe I
would rather desire my Daughters death, then so to disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
her, because he was altogether vnworthie such speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
fortune. Notwithstanding this sharpe repulse, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
his amorous desires to my Daughter, so that he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
perswaded his mother to permitte him to take her
from me perforce, to which suite the vndiscréete mother
<pb facs="tcp:1616:150"/>
consented, either mooued with pittie, or ouercome by the
importunate solliciting of her, so that one day (vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of a friend méeting me to be merry) he robbed me of my
Daughter. This wicked traytor hadde long before that
time intended this trecherie, compacting the matter secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with villaines and théeues, by whose assistance he carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away my Daughter, shutting her vppe in a strong
Lower whereof I told you. And because he feared I would
gather some strength to reskew her, considering how well
I was beloued of my neighbours, hee preuented mée by a
strange enchauntment, enuironing the castle and the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
with such a maruailous water, as no knight shoulde
enter vppon them without their consent. Now that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
might come forth and returne againe at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
they deuised a little Boate, which is guarded by two
fierce Lions, and a puissant knight that hath charge of
them, so that none comes to them but whome they list.
Since this vnhappie time did I neuer sée my Daughter,
whom this damnable villaine (which most of all gréeues
mée) immediatly violated and rauished at his pleasure,
swearing now neuer to take her as his Wife, but to vse
her as his Concubine: and beside all this, the Traitour in
despight of mee, and to reuenge the words I gaue him,
doth monstrously abuse her, and (vnmanly) whippeth her
dayly with Roddes, which my Sister hath often intreated
to be spared, but he by no meanes will be perswaded. Thus
séeing my selfe out of all hope to recouer her againe, haue
euer since continued in earnest inuocation to Heauen, that
some notable vengeance might punish this villaine: and
such fauour haue I founde in my deuout imprecations, as
first his mother was chastized with a disease called Saint
<hi>Anthonyes</hi> fire in one of her legges, which so gréeuously
torments her, as no remedie can bée founde to asswage
the vexation. Her Sonne vnderstanding héereof, would
haue slaine my sister, accusing her to procure his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
infirmity by her learned knowledge: whereuppon
<pb facs="tcp:1616:150"/>
my Sister feari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for her purpose, escaped from the villaine hither to mée,
béeing sorrie that her Aunt should thus iniuriously deale

mée, I would néedes knowe howe I should come by my

                     <p>It is so good Sister, that I cannot nowe reuerse the
enchauntments I haue alreadie made for your Daughter,
though gladly I would if it lay in my power, wherefore
you must attende the comming of a Knight, who excéedeth
all other in vertue and prowesse: for he shall passe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

Niece your Daughter againe into your custody. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Knight: good Sister, that shall so hardly passe the

on him, because my selfe shall not liue to sée him,
which came to passe, for very shortly after my Sister di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Nowe know you Sir Knight what matter is preor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained

                     <p>Beléeue mee Madame, saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> your discourse
hath béene strange, and good reason mooues you to request
vengeance, because your wrong is the greatest that euer

offender cannot long escape, without shame aunswerable
to his villanie, for Heauen will not suffer it, by assistance
whereof I hope to reuenge your Daughters rape. And

And the Damosell whereof you speake hath brought hither

The Dwarfe béeing in a great feare, ranne so
fast as hée coulde into a great Caue betwéene two Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
which made <hi>Palmerin</hi> alight and followe him, and
very farre went hee into the Caue not séeing anye bodye,
till at length he came into a little roome, as it had béene
cut out of a quarrie, which had light into it by a little
chinke cutte through a Rocke: and there hée founde a
young Knigh layde vppon a bedde, at whose féete lay the
Dwarfe, quaking and trembling with his late feare,
whome <hi>Palmerin</hi> nowe sawe that hee was not <hi>Vrbanil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi>
wherefore he saluted the Knight, saying. I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
you Sir Knight to pardon mee, because I entred
so boldlye, neyther knocking first, or calling for any of
your Seruaunts: albeit I desired to speake with this
little man, but nothing coulde induce him to tarry my
comming, for hée fledde from mée as I hadde béene a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.
Whereuppon perswading my selfe, to finde some
other body héere more courteous, I followed him at the
harde héeles, with no other intent, but onelye to know
howe I might possible gette foorth of this dissolate For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
wherein by misaduenture I haue lost my way, for
I woulde not willinglye straye too farre, least I should
be forced to remaine héere as an holye Hermit, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my profession is cleane contrarye. To preuent such
chaunce, I thinke it was Gods will I shoulde followe
your Seruaunt, let mee therefore intreate you, to know
what you are, and wherefore you liue héere so solitarye,
shunning as it séemes the company of men: protesting to
you, that if I may in ought assist you, whereby to drawe
you from this obscure life, I wil with all my heart accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishe
it, though it were matter that should concerne my
life.</p>
                     <p>The Knight raysing vppe himselfe, and sighing so

aunswered. Alas noble Knight, séeke not to vnderstand

impossible: yet in that your demaund procéedeth
from such a gentle spirite, as pitieth the miseries of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised

                     <p>Knowe then gentle Knight, that I am the most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne
<hi>Varnan,</hi> whose vnfortunate life excéedeth all mens
whatsoeuer, for this worlde affoordeth me nothing but
mishappe, disgrace, contempt, and all tormenting griefes,
as for delight and pleasure, they are loathsome to mée, my
monethes, wéekes, dayes, howres, and minutes, béeing
continually accompanyed with all extreame passions.
My greatest ease consisteth in dolorous lamentations,
remembraunce of passed infortunes, sad regrets, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
melancholie. In bréefe, I am onelie hee,
whose companions are, a trauelled spirit, thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with frustrate hope, hauing vtterly lost the
light of those gladsome Sunnes, whereof the one shined
in my face, the other in my heart, that nowe nothing is
left for me but a life despised, yet welcome to me that am
so disdayned.</p>
                     <p>These wordes were vttered with so many sighes,
such flouds of teares, and haling his flesh with such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,

of him the cause of his disquiet: and so long he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
his importunate intreaties, that the Knight at
length thus answered. Gentle Syr, so well contenteth
me the sorrowes which I suffer, that in hope of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie,
I would not bewray them: but séeing Fortune
hath thus conducted you hither, in respect of your graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

mée vndiscréete and misgouerned, I will satisfie you in
the cause of my sadnesse.</p>
                     <p>True it is, Syr Knight, that I haue hitherto, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

that a Knight could for his Ladie, aduenturing mine
honour, and my life in all daungers for her sake, yea, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

and my passions to growe beyonde my abilitie, finding
occasion to acquaint her with the secretes of my heart, I
desired her to pittie my oppressions, which if shee refused
to doo, she should loose her louer, and his life withall. For
I was so solemnely vowed to her seruice, as she could not

where <hi>Valerica</hi> remained, because he would somewhat
sollicite the cause of sollitarie <hi>Verman.</hi> Ryding along in

or if Madame <hi>Valerica</hi> be as yet come thither. Go

<hi>Palmerin</hi> hearing the name of <hi>Valerica,</hi> knewe well it
was shée for whome the solitarie Knight liued in such
pensiuenes: wherefore mooued with pitty of his mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
hee sayde to himselfe. Sée héere the trecherie of a
trothlesse Woman, so vnhonorablie to forsake the man
that loues her so déerely, and preferre the villanie of

thou a man villaine, that wouldest forest all the loue of
the best Knights in <hi>England?</hi> by my Sword, thou shalt
déerely pay for thy disloyalty. With these words he gaue
him such a stroake on the head, as he cleft it therewith to
the very téeth.</p>
                     <p>The Squires séeing theyr maister slaine, beganne to
haste away: but <hi>Palmerin</hi> caught him that was sent to
the Garden, to whome he sayde. Come on Sirra, if thou
louest thy life, bring mée to the Lady if thou doost: not,
thou shalt neuer followe thy trade any longer. The
Squire durst doo no otherwise, so he brought him to the
little gate where <hi>Valerica</hi> was wont to receiue in her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and knocking with his finger as his Master was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed,
<hi>Valerica</hi> opened the doore, and thinking it was
her Fréend, cast her armes about <hi>Palmerins</hi> necke, who
brought her in his armes forth of the Garden, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

the Squire presently to followe him. <hi>Valerica</hi> aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

Tush Madame, sayde <hi>Palmerin,</hi> these are but wordes,
there is no remedy but you must go with mée. So ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with teares nor requests would hee be intreated,
but mounting on horsebacke, caused the Squire to helpe
the Lady vppe before him, because he would be sure shée
should not escape from him, and riding on towardes the
Forrest, because the night drew on, he left the rode way,
séeking some place where they might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniently repose
themselues for that night. At length hee founde out a
little thicket, where they alighted, and hee returning his
Horse to pasture, tooke off his Helmet and came to the
Lady, desiring her to bée content with such hard lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for that night: but when shée behelde that it was not

who hath thus appoynted to punish your loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and your excéeding disloyalty towardes him, who
loues you dearer then his owne soule, and for your loue
leades a most austere life, in the very desolate and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
place of the worlde. If hée haue thus long
endured such hardnesse for your sake, it is good reason that
you should participate a little with his misery. Feare
not therefore, for I speake nothing of him but what I

(this humor forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to cause you match with him, whose

incomparable, said the Lady, I sée now it is in vaine to
shun what the destenies haue appointed, how falles my
fortune from ill to worse? Must I now go to that coward

                     <p>I know not Lady what you thinke, said <hi>Palmerin,</hi> but
in my opinion, <hi>Varnan</hi> is much better then you estéeme

thence into <hi>England,</hi> at what time the Emperors power
was discomfited: and hearing great fame of <hi>Frisol</hi> his late
Maister, he spent some time in his seruice, not doubting
but by his meanes to find the man he looked for. <hi>Palmerin</hi>
was somewhat mooued, hearing <hi>Colmelio</hi> so commend
<hi>Frisol,</hi> wherefore he demaunded of him, if he knewe any
thing of that Knights linage. No my Lord, quoth he but I
can assure ye, that he is one of the most gentle Knights in
the world, and he concealeth his parentage very secretly,
which makes me iudge he is disce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of royal birth. After
<hi>Colmelio</hi> had ended his discourse, he repeated to him some
parte of his fortunes, in the end perswading him that hée
would remunerate his paines in séeking him and in time
manifest the loue he bare him. By this time they were

him in ioy, and mounted presently on horsebacke to

and kinde gratulations had passed betwéene them,
as is vsuall at the méeting of long absent louers: Ah my
Lord and fréend, quoth <hi>Trineus,</hi> how long hath Fortune
kept you from me? &amp; why did you depart not vouchsafing
a farewel? What earnest occasion might cause such an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

of the long continuaunce of our amitie, that death could
not procure such a seuere enterprise. My Lord, quoth <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
it séemeth you haue some cause to complain of mée:
but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you vnderstand how matters haue happened, you
will not condemne me altogither. For at the time of my
departure, I thought verely to return the next day follow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing:
but such importunate affaires continually fell out, as
I could not return till this very instant. <hi>Ptolome</hi> said as

much as <hi>Trineus</hi> did, notwithstanding, this fortunate mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forbad all further accusations, and they became as good
friendes as euer they were. So rode they to the Pallace,
where the king attending theyr comming, perceiued at

among all the rest, most maruailous is this of the Castle

requisite that you nowe go rest your selfe, therefore lette
some body helpe to disarme you, and betake your selfe (on

kings councell most expedient, and therefore did as hee
commaunded him, so hauing reposed himselfe a while, hee
came to sée howe the Quéene and her daughter fared, who
would not suffer him to departe, before hee hadde likewise

some estimation of me: whereupon shée laboured, to cause
my Mistresse in shorte time mislike what I hadde so long
trauailed to perswade her with, as thus. That it ill besée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a Princesse of her account, of so gracious discent, and
Daughter to such a mightie King, to conferre with straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
or vouchsafe a listening to any thing they sayde: for
they were none such as she reputed them, but after they
hadde brought a Ladyes honour in daunger, they then
were satisfied, as they vsed it for a custome among
theyr companions. And so well could shée féede the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
humour, with these suborning and spightfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions,
which séemed to her as swéete and freendlye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
that in stéede of the little loue I latelye conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
I finde nothing but frownes and disdaine, that she will
scant affoord mée a looke. Which discourtesie hath well nere
driuen me to dispayre, in regarde of her slender opinion of
mee, as being so hindered onely through your absence. Often
I determined with <hi>Ptolome,</hi> to leaue the Courte and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
you in trauaile: but the King by no meanes woulde
permit mée, sending many of his owne Knightes, because I
shoulde not go: yet was I resolued, that had you not come,
no displeasure whatsoeuer shoulde haue helde mée héere: but
to finde you I intended, or loose my life. This falles out ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
harde, quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> for by these meanes we shall stay
héere God knowes how long: beside, <hi>Hermes</hi> knowes my

name, which makes me doubt least we shalbe reuealed: the
Emperour likewise may be offended at our long tarriaunce.
In regarde of all this, good Prince, I thinke it best, that we
sende your squire and <hi>Vrbanillo</hi> my Dwarffe, to aduertise
his Maiestie of our affaires, and how by reason of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
we were cast quite out of course so far, as we could not
by any meanes assist his Armie, not doubting but to sée his
highnesse in very short time. In the meane while, we may
practise meanes to win the Princesse fauour againe, and
so in good time departe hence, with the honourable prize that
we came for. <hi>Trineus</hi> was newlye reuiued with these spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
wherefore he desired, that betimes in the morning hée
would dispatche theyr Seruauntes towardes <hi>Allemaigne.</hi>
Which <hi>Palmerin</hi> fayled not to doo, in respect of a dreame he
had the night before, for he imagined that he sawe his Lady

In this time of recreation, <hi>Hermes</hi> reported to the King,
that the knight so long absent was named <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and
the same knight that woonne so much honour in <hi>Fraunce,</hi>
which so well contented the king, as he more and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired

other sportes, for the honour of the noble <hi>Palmarin</hi> and his

companions as the like had not béen of long time before.
At night, when the Maskers, Mumeries and Moriscoes
were in presence, that <hi>Palmerin</hi> espied conuenient time
to talk with the princesse, he tooke her aside to a window,
and thus began. Madam, before I begin what I haue to

the hand of the soueraigne Lady &amp; Empresse of high <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,</hi>
that you will not shrinke hereafter fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
determination: but for your owne regard, you must
<pb facs="tcp:1616:171"/>
conceale this contract from your most trustie friends, and
dispose in such sort of your selfe, for I hope to compasse the
meane and opportunitie, that you shal leaue <hi>England,</hi> and
go to the noble regions of your worthy Lorde and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
What I haue promised, sayd <hi>Agriola,</hi> I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
and with what spéede you shall thinke conuenient:
albeit I repose such trust in you, that hauing béene so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
hitherto in your interprises, you wil be carefull in
accomplishing these daungerous intentions. Thus before
they departed, the mariage of <hi>Trineus</hi> and <hi>Agriola</hi> was
concluded, and because they would not as then bee suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they stept into the daunce next the yong prince, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very amiable &amp; pleasant gestures: which <hi>Trineus</hi> (in
his often turning) dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly noted, imagining that <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
had not so long conferred with his Lady, but some as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was determined, yet he dissembled his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ioies so cunningly as he could. Ech eie was fixed on
these two braue knights, the Ladies and Gentlewomen
perswading themselues, that they neuer beheld more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
personages, deseruing like estimation for their special
chiualrie, as also for their bountie and Courtly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iuilitie.
Thus passed the feast in all kinde of pleasures, and these
two Knights withdrawing themselues into their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>Palmerin</hi> discoursed to <hi>Trineus</hi> his talk with <hi>Agrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
and how he had with such cunning pursued the matter
that in the end be obtained what he demaunded, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the gentle conclusion hee made with the Princesse.
These ioyfull newes dro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e the prince into such a quanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
as he could not expresse his secret content, wherefore
<hi>Palmerin</hi> awaking him out of his musing, said. As I am
true knight, I neuer thought y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> a man of your estate could
be of so slender courage. What countenance woulde you
vse in a matter of sorrow, when such dainty tidings make
you so effeminate? Be of good chéere man, <hi>Agriola</hi> is your
owne, and none but <hi>Trineus</hi> must bee her Lorde and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
I must confesse my lord, said <hi>Trineus,</hi> that my beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior,
<pb facs="tcp:1616:171"/>
but little beséemes my calling: but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> cause therof is,

But now I desire you my Lord, séeing the occasion offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

<hi>Palmerin,</hi> be you as ready as I shall make prouision. The

heard of the Dwarfes arriual, which greatly pleasing her
she sayd to <hi>Brionella.</hi> I pray thée swéete fréend go spéedily
and séeke the Dwarfe, that we may knowe what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of our Lords and my brother <hi>Trineus. Brionella,</hi>
who longed to heare of hir loue Sir <hi>Ptolome,</hi> whom wel
she knew to be one of the companie, with all spéed accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
the Princesse commandement, and found the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

with what chéerefull countenance she came to bring
<hi>Vrbanillo</hi> to her Lady the princesse, bad him go with her,
hoping by his meanes his Daughters extreame sadnesse
would be comforted. <hi>Brionella</hi> béeing forth of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

tydings, when the Dwarfe not ignorant of the Ladyes
passions, deliuered <hi>Ptolomes</hi> letter to chéere her: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Princesse saw <hi>Vrbanillo</hi> comming, with the teares
in her eyes she ranne apace to méete him, and casting her
armes about his neck, embraced him verie often, saying.
Tell me <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> tell mee, how fares my brother &amp; thy
Maister <hi>Palmerin?</hi> Madame, quoth the Dwarfe, so well
as your owne heart can wish, and will ere long be héere
with you. Then deliuered he y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> letter fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Trineus,</hi> which
certified her of his short returne, &amp; that hee would bring

she expected other matters, and that her brothers me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
was not sufficient for her cure, he gaue her his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
letter, when she hastily breaking open y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> seale, found
the ring which her loyal friend had sent her, and after she
had welcomd it with many deuout kisses, she put it on hir
finger, with these words. I charge thée kéepe this token
safely, in witnesse of the knights gentlenesse that sent it,
whome my heart hath made speciall choyse of aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Then reading the letter, and discrée<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:1616:174"/>
supplications, entire excuses, &amp; extreame passions, that
her friend continually suffered for her loue, deliuering
many bitter sighs, she said. Ah my true and loyall friend,
I beléeue wel, and take in good part your cause of absence,
béeing assured, that if possibly you could returne sooner, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should stay you from the place, where y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> only reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

&amp; my hart néere tired with bootlesse wishings, may

bréefely reported to her the noble actions of his Lord
and maister, the loue of <hi>Ttineus</hi> to the Princesse <hi>Agriola,</hi>
discribing her beautie and rare perfections, whereupon
<hi>Polinarda</hi> thus answered. Beléeue mee <hi>Vrbani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Princesse be so faire as thou saist she is, her great vertues
and firme loyaltie likewise comparable, enuie &amp; false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
shal not impeach her, to be reckoned among the most
happie Ladies of the world, and her desires wil be as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably
effected, as with vertuous thoughts she first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
them. The like (I doubt not) will happen to thy mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
for fortune hath euermore so specially fauored him, as
now it were against reason shée should alter her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
So departed the Dwarfe from the Princesse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the Emperor, who by no meanes could get any
other tidings of his son then what you haue heard, which
made him doubt the dwarfe iuggled with him. The next
day the Emperour sent his chéefest Lords and Barons, to
conduct the French ambassadors to the court, which was
sumptuously hanged with Tapistrie, especially the great
hall, which was adorned with costly cloth of gold, and rich
purple, as it had béene the Pallace of <hi>Salomon.</hi> The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
entertained with maruailous royaltie, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
deliuered the summe of their embassage, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
answered that hée would conferre thereon with his
<pb facs="tcp:1616:175"/>
councel, in me any while they might returne to their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings.
After they were departed the hall, the Emperour
demanded of the princes electours and the rest of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
if these marriages of his sonne and daughter, with
the heire and princesse of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> might not be granted,
as well for the vtilitie and honor of the Empire, as for the
generall benefit of Christendome, commanding them to
speake their iudgements without feare. The Lords alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
answered, that the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tion was so good &amp; the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
so honorable, as it was no way to be misliked. I will
then (quoth he) talke with the empresse, that she may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
hir daughters opinion, &amp; then my lords of <hi>France</hi>
shalbe answered. So leauing them hee went to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
chamber, to whom he reported his agréement with
his councel, which pleased her likewise maruailous wel:
but when sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> had a little considered on the matter, she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that but little could be said before <hi>Trineus</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
home againe. You reason well, quoth the Emperour,
but in meane time I pray you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d your daughters iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we may returne our brother of <hi>Fraunce</hi> some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
answer. Which she promised to do, &amp; so departing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
her lord, she went to her daughters cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, where hauing
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded her ladies aside, she thus began. Faire daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it is the emperors pleasure and mine, that you mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
with the eldest sonne and heire of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> and your
brother <hi>Trineus</hi> with his sister, for hee is one of the most
renowned kings in <hi>Europe,</hi> &amp; his son recounted among
the best knights of the world: for which good fortune you
may thanke the heauens, that so great a prince offers his
Sonne to be your husband. Aduise your selfe of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
for by your opinion must the ambassadors be dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
hence, who came to the court for nothing else but to
conclude these honorable marriages. <hi>Polinarda</hi> hearing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
words of her mother, was surprized with such sodain hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines,
as she could not tel what to answer: but fearing the
Empresse should perceiue that her loue was already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
<pb facs="tcp:1616:175"/>
with sad countenance thus replied. Madame,
you know what promise I made my brother the day when
he departed from the Court, in the presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> of you and all
the nobility, that I would not marry before his returne:
and me thinks I were greatly to be blamed, and well
worthy gréeuous reprehension, if I shoulde so falsifie my
word, which I cannot do without impeach of myne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.
And héerein shall I follow the laudable bertue of the
Emperor my father, who euermore estéemed his promise
aboue al earthly possessions. Beside, I can assure you that
my brother wil neuer marry with the princesse <hi>Lucema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
for he loues one many degrées beyond her, and (may I
speake it without offence) one of the most beautifull La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
that euer nature framed. Thus Madame, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and you haue excuses sufficient &amp; auayleable, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to aunswere the king of <hi>France.</hi> It may be, quoth the
empresse, that your brother loues els where: but I can tell
ye, that neyther hée nor you shall do any thing contrary to
the Emperors commandement. <hi>Polinarda</hi> séeing her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
persist in her opinyon, bit in her sorrowes with many
secret sighs: yet knew she so wel how to dissemble her pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
as the Empresse could not discerne her priuat mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
So returned she to the Emperor, aduertising him of
hir daughters answere: wherat he was so offended, as in
great anger hee came himselfe to his Daughter, saying.
Why howe now Daughter? are you so bolde to disobey
my commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? or dare you repugne against my wil?
al is to no end that you haue babled with your mother, for
(will ye or no) it shall bée as I haue appoynted. I knowe
right well dread Lord and father, quoth she, that I ought
no way to deny your pleasure, but rather wil I die a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
deaths, then consent to match with the Sonne of
<hi>Fraunce,</hi> considering what promise I haue made my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and if I should so farre dishonour my selfe, as not to
regarde what I haue promised, I were not worthy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to be called your daughter. Thus stoode she resolute
<pb facs="tcp:1616:176"/>
in her answere, and therewith shedde such aboundance of
teares, as the Emperour was constrayned to tell the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours,
that the marriages could not be concluded till
the returne of <hi>Trineus,</hi> notwithstanding he granted all
the articles of their embassage. The princesse qualli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her gréefe as well as shee could, sent for the Dwarfe,
and taking him by the hand, sayde. Alas my freend, I am
now in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> greatest perplexity in the world, neuerthelesse,
one thing comforts me: that thou be holdest the true loue
and loyaltie I beare thy maister, which neuer shal be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
what euer become of me. And would to God he were
now heere, then would I speake it openly without feare
of any, that I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>is, and he myne. Madame, quoth the
Dwarfe, if you continue faithfull to my maister, perswade
your selfe of his assurance, for he building on your constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
takes such continual pleasure in remembring you, that
it is the onely meane that preserues his life: and you may
be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lde to credit me, that if your brothers loue did not
with-hold him, he would haue bin here long ere this, but
he wil come soone inough (I hope) to end this doubt. As for
me, I am of the opinion that heauen wil not suffer so good
a knight to die, but first wil permit him to sée his mistris.
Die? quoth the princesse, sooner let all the knights in the
world ende theyr dayes, and the eldest Sonne of <hi>Franc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi>
likewise, though hée loue mée so déerely, so might I be rid
of these importunate Ambassadours. The Emperour sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hée could get no other answer of his daughter, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the French ambassadors, that so soone as his son
was returned, he should be aduertized, and so for that time
they might depart: but the empresse and he first bestowed
on them many rich presents, and so in short time they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
againe in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> where great ioye was made in
hope of these marriages, albeit they little thought the
Prince <hi>Trineus</hi> would tarrie so long. Aboue all other, the
<hi>French</hi> prince was most ioyfull, hearing the Countie of

they departed one from another, the Galley wherein <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>
was discrying a goodly Ship of Christians, whereof
they béeing glad, sette sayle with the winde towardes the

<hi>Natolia,</hi> who ioyning with the Gallies, in the ende boor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her, and parted the spoyle among them: the winde sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
began to chaunge, so that they were constrained to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lye for succour to an Islande in the Kingdome of <hi>Persia,</hi>
which they reached in good time, glad to sheelde themselues
from daunger: These Pyrates thus come to the Hauen,
went all on shore to refresh themselues: but they hadde no
sooner sette foote on land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such enchauntments were there dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
<pb facs="tcp:1616:180"/>
through the whole Isle, as they presently knew not
one another. But to acquaint you with the manner of these
enchauntments, you must note, that the Isle where they
landed was called <hi>Malfada,</hi> which name was giuen it by
the Lady thereof, who was called likewise <hi>Malfada,</hi> the
most subtill Magitian of her time: so that wee may say of
her, as the Poets feigned of the auncient <hi>Circes.</hi> And albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
she was issued of Christian parentes, yet hauing such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie
with the diuell and his maligne spirites, she would
not acquaint her selfe with any goodnesse towardes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
but daily practise their harme and destruction. And
for this intent, shée had long time enchaunted this Island
with such charmes, that what Ships arriued there, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
depart thence againe, much lesse such as entred within
the Isle. They being thus staied, <hi>Malfada</hi> would come her
selfe, and chuse such as shée lyked, the rest shée transformed
into Hartes, Wolues, Dogges, Boares, and all manner of
beastes. Such likewise as shée tooke with her into her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse,
when she had abused them to content her owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
shée would cast them foorth, transforming them as shée
did the other: in bréefe, she was worse then a Diuell, and
the whole Isle a very disguised hell. This wicked woman
knowing, that more vnfortunate people were landed at the
Hauen, called her seruaunts, and came to see them: but she
made no great account of them, wherefore she commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her seruaunts to take all the riches foorth of the Shippe,
conuerting it by her inchauntment, that it séemed lyke a
bottomlesse gulfe. Afterward at her pleasure, shée transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them that came in it, among whome <hi>Trineus</hi> was
chaunged into the shape of a very fayre Dogge, not that hée
was so, for that is a thing against nature, and which God
no way will permit, that man shall take any brutish shape,
or a brute beast any humane forme. For the Magicall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
thus holde theyr Arte, that the enchaunted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéeme
themselues beastes, and of that sort was this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Mastiue: notwithstanding, these distressed captiues had
<pb facs="tcp:1616:180"/>
naturall reason and humane power, but the benefit of spéech
was taken from them. And thus was <hi>Trineus</hi> transformed,
which he séemed not to mistike, for not remembring himselfe,
he forgot all his heauie passions, maruelling only at his sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
mutation. And here will we leaue him in his straunge
deformitie, to report what befell to the Princesse <hi>Agriola,</hi>
after that dolorous separation betwéene her Lord and her.</p>
                     <p>THus Gentlemen haue wee left the Prince <hi>Trineus</hi>
transformed into the shape of a Dogge, in the Isle of
<hi>Malfada,</hi> by the Enchauntresse: the English Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
<hi>Agriola,</hi> in the custody of the Turkish Pirate <hi>Olima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el:
Ptolome</hi> and <hi>Colmelio</hi> carried into <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Palm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The next morning he called his foure Secretaries, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding

<pb facs="tcp:1616:189"/>
that they should not fayle to honour the day of his coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with their presence, and to bring with them theyr
Quéenes and Daughters, and this they should do on paine
of displeasure: all which was performed with present ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.
In the meane time, hee caused sundrie sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ornaments to bee prepared, with all manner of precious

but all these presents, promises, and munificent entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
could no way mooue her, not so much as to grant

Ladies in his Court, that they should kéepe the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
companie: but she would be conuersant with none but
<hi>Hippolita,</hi> of whom she had so prettily learned the Arabian
tongue, as many times she could indifferently answere the
Emperour. But when he behelde her continually so pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue,
and that by no meanes shee would bee comforted, hée
doubted least his presence did offende her, and therefore
hée forbare so often to visit her. For so déerely he loued her,

the <hi>Turke</hi> was in honors and perswasions, the more
loyall continued her loue to <hi>Trineus,</hi> whose perfect image
was engrauen in her heart. And not fearing torments or
death, she boldly answered the Emperor that he trauailed
in vain, for she might not loue him, in that she was married
to an husband, more noble euery way then he, and none but
him shée would loue while she liued: yet made he no great
account of her words, considering what frailtie commo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

intended to take to wife, one of the most beautifull Ladyes

refused to touch him, reputed him of royall parentage.
Whereupon he sent for his Daughter, praying her to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
him not as a Knight, but as a noble and vertuous
Prince, considering his behauiour so well deserued. The
Princesse entertayned him very graciously, and hearing
the successe of his happy fortune, spake thus in the hearing
of them all. Because euery one shall know, Sir knight, how
much I honour your good gifts, I will cause my Father so

who resembled his Mistresse so equall in beautie, and
could not holde his eye from her, so that hée conceiued such
<pb facs="tcp:1616:197"/>
pleasure in his regard, as he iudged it sustenance enough to
maintaine life. But she that was ignorant of the cause, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
that he loued her, wherfore thenceforwart, she began
so amorously to affect him, as shee enioyed no rest but in his
presence. Thus were these two Ladies <hi>Alchidiana</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demia</hi>
touched with one disease, and that so sharpely to the
quicke, that the least torment they endured (séeing hée could
neither speake nor vnderstand their language) was woorse
to them then death. And so it fell out, that each of them thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her selfe best beloued: concealed her thoughts from the
other, and would in no case be reputed amorous, least so her
desires should be discouered. <hi>Alchidiana</hi> for arguments of
her loue, gaue him horses, esquires, seruants, and pages, so
that the greatest Prince in the Court was no better equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
then he: and in this fortune such was his mind, that for
all the honor and fauour the Soldane and his daughter bare
him, he did not outreach himselfe in behauiour, but was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne
and full of courtesie, that each one loued and desired
to be familiar with him. And if any enterprise of Ioustes or
Tourneyes were in hand, <hi>Palmerin</hi> was the formost in the
field, and carried the prize away from all whatsoeuer, which
incited <hi>Maulicus</hi> to loue him in such sort, that he entertained
him into such speciall credite, as he would neuer resolue on
any matter of importance, without his shew of good liking.
And albeit the Princes of the Court shewed him good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
yet Enuy (that neuer can rest in ambitious hearts)
caused them in the ende to raise slaunder against him: which
<hi>Palmerin</hi> perceiued, but being vnable to remedie, awaited
conuenient time for his departure, notwithstanding the
earnest affection <hi>Alchidiana</hi> bare him. He knew likewise so
well to disguise his matters, that so often as the Princesse
would hold him in talke, he still feigned not to vnderstand
her: which made her iealous towards <hi>Ardemia</hi> her Cozin,
who by <hi>Alchidianaes</hi> iniuries and <hi>Palmerins</hi> refusall of her
loue, lost her life, as you shall read in the chapters folowing.</p>

home into his owne Countrey, forgot his loue to his newe
<pb facs="tcp:1616:198"/>
Fréend, and by his Fathers commaundement, marryed
with a yong Princesse, Daughter to the King <hi>Lycomedes.</hi>
The Quéene hearing these newes, was almost dead with
conceit of gréefe, and conceiued such hatred against my Lord
<hi>Maurice,</hi> as she determindd to be reuenged on him, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
came after. And the better to compasse her intent, shée
sent to search out one of her knights, a learned Magitian,
promising him, if he would help her to be reuenged on him
that so deceiued her, shée would make him one of the chée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest

desirous to please her, promised her to worke such a deuise,
that <hi>Maurice</hi> should endure such cruel torments, as her selfe
should be constrayned to pittie him. And to accomplish this
practise, hée onely desired the King her Fathers Crowne,
which was one of the richest in the whole world: which
Crowne he coniured in such sort, as the diuell himself could
not imagine the like, and comming therwith to the Quéen,
said.</p>
                     <p>Madame, you must sende this Crowne to the Prince
of <hi>Pasmeria,</hi> desiring him for your sake hée will weare it on
his head, in the chéefest affayres of his estate, which hée im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
will accomplish: but this I dare assure you, that
hereby hée shall suffer so many vexations, as hee would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
a thousand deaths if hee could possible, to be deliuered
from this torment, which he neuer shall be till the most loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
louer in the world take it from his head. The Quéene
so ioyfull hereof as could be, sent the Crowne to the prince,
who receiued it thankfully, and beholding it sumptuous,
sodainely put it on his head: but presently flew out of his
head such a flame of fire, as it had béene the blaze that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
from a discharged Cannon. Then called hee for ayde
and succour, making the greatest lamentations that euer
were heard, but all was to no ende, for no Knight or Lady
there could do him any good, and so all the whole day hée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in this cruell martirdome, burning aline, yet
not perishing, resembling the <hi>Salamander</hi> in the extreame
<pb facs="tcp:1616:199"/>
fire. When his people saw that they could procure him no
ease, they sent two of the greatest Lords of the Realme to
the Quéene, who humbly intreated her to pittie the Prince,
and to recompence the fault he had committed, hée should
take her to his Wife, and endow her with those honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
possessions belonging to him. The Quéene entertained
them very nobly, and after she had vnderstood their message,
answered.</p>

you shall excuse me. And let him know, that séeing hée was
so presumptuous contrarie to his faith and promise, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse

him, as my heart by no meanes can be induced to loue him.
And no other remedie is there for his torments, but that

returned to their Lord, to whom they reported the Quéenes
answere, and what remained to ease his affliction, which

(which is more) hee béeing a Knight as good as your selfe,
you may not refuse him, because you demaunded the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
against any Knight in my Court, and in your challenge
made no exception. Perswade your selfe (quoth the Prince)
that if hée be not the sonne of a King, hee shall not enter the
Fielde against mée: therefore if hee bée none such, hée hath
not to meddle with Armes in this cause, and so the fight

                     <p>During this contention, there entred the Hall a fayre

(for thy profit) to desist from the Combat whereto thou hast
challenged him, in defence of thy false accusation against
<hi>Alchidiana.</hi> And further shée doth admonish thée, that if
thou doost not as shee commandeth, the knight late dumbe,
surpassing all other in knightly chiualrie, shall ouercome
thée, and thou shalt not bee able to stande against him. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosell,

to giue credit to such sorcerers: besides, I will
not loose mine honour at the simple wordes of a Woman
I knowe not. And it doth not a little content mee, that this
knight is such an one as hee should be, wherefore, being so
sure of his bounty, I am the more desirous to Combatte
with him, to make experience of his renowne: yet this I
still maintaine, that what I haue spoken is true, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wee will presently enter the Feeld, so please the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane

spent, adiornde if till the day following, wherefore the
Prince withdrew himselfe to his lodging, reposing great
confidence in his owne strength, and after his departure,
the Soldane taking <hi>Palmerin</hi> by the hand, sayde. I knowe
not my Lorde how I may acknowledge the honour you do
my Daughter, whom I estéeme as mine owne selfe: but if
the Gods affoord me life, I will deuise some rich recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,

the Damosell sent from the Quéene of <hi>Tharsus,</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

and vertuous knight, the Quéene saluteth you with this
taken of her good will, in remembraunce of your speciall
loyaltie, whereby you deliuered the Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> for
which she so much remaineth yours, as you shall command
her any seruice hence forward, albeit she could haue wished
him longer torment, that proued so vnfaithfull to her. She
likewise desireth you to weare this Helmet in fight with
<hi>Amarano,</hi> for it will greatly auayle you, and more then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyother:
for such is her hope, that after you know this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

whereupon the Princesse Brethren were certified of

they said. Herauld, it is reason that your Lord should bée o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beied

to kéepe them from corrupting, and thus returned with

thou findest the chéefe cause of sorrowe and discontent. O

it before thy death, the lesse had béene my gréefe. But soone

<pb facs="tcp:1616:218"/>
promising in the presence of all his Knights, with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

how much I am indebted to you, my affections are
so resolutely perswaded, that I estéeme of you as you were
my Sonne, and much more then I am able to vtter: not so
much for seruices you haue done mée from time to time, as
for the incomparable déedes of armes and chiualrie, which
makes you honoured through the whole world. Hauing

onely hope I repose in you, and well it liketh mée that you
beare the office of my Lieutenant Generall, and principall

Therefore my noble and approoued good Friend, vsing your

that taking this honourable charge, the Souldiers

                     <p>And thinke you (quoth the Soldane) that my people

Yea doubtlesse my Lord, saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> that is my opinion.
Know then, quoth the Soldane, that for this counsell you
haue giuen mée, my loue is nothing diminished towardes

therefore as you haue appointed. This counsell gaue <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin,</hi>
not for any good he wished to <hi>Maulicus,</hi> or the King
of <hi>Balisarca,</hi> but (desiring nothing more, then the ruine
and generall destruction of these Heathen hounds, sworne
enemies to Christ and his Seruants) to ridde himselfe of
that charge, which would bring him so great and shamefull
report, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ight against his Lord and maker: therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditating
on all these inconueniences, he but expected the
meane to gette footing in Christendome againe. <hi>Maulicus</hi>
thus contented with his aunswere, the King of <hi>Balisarca</hi>
was appointed generall of his Armie, yet he gaue comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
that <hi>Palmerin</hi> should bee reuerenced among them,
as the second person to himselfe, and on paine of death
none to offende him. As all this strength was readie to
take shipping, newes came to the Court of <hi>Gramiell</hi> and
his brethren, what slaughter and spoyle they made through
all <hi>Assiria,</hi> whereat the Souldane béeing greatly offended,
séeing his prouision against Christendome thus chaunged,
came to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and sayde. My Sonne, what thinke you
of our enemies? What shall I doo to these followers of
their Brother in pride? I pray you counsell mée in this
necessitie. <hi>Palmerin</hi> perceiuing his desire preuented, was
ouercome with maruailous passions: yet to hide his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
from the Soldane, he thus answered. Séeing it hath
so fallen out my Lord, that without any summons our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb facs="tcp:1616:222"/>
haue presumed vppon vs, I thinke it most expedient
that your Armie prouided in so good readinesse, beginne first
with these arrogant inuaders: for I doubt not, their attempt
béeing so trecherous, and the courage of our men so resolute,
but they shall déerely buy their presumptuous aduenture. A

for this will bee a good whetting to our sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes,

This counsell was accepted, wherefore it was immediatly

I now beholde, that my arriuall is in a time so fortunate,
I celebrate theyr names with immortall thankes, assuring
your Maiestie so farre to stretch my endeouurs, as the sonne

after he had made him very gracious welcome, thanked
him for the succour he brought him, and henceforth he would

nothing tending to Religion as I gesse, but such
deuout seruice as loue teacheth his Schollers. In the

altred with his affection to the Princesse, that they which
haue felt like assaults, might easily iudge the cause of his

Lord <hi>Olorico</hi> hath brought your Father? beléeue mée, the
courtesse is so surpassing great, as your selfe ought especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

men as is in his troupe, in recompence whereof, I will not
denie the Prince any thing, that hée with honour will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest

dissimulations vsed in such causes, albeit Loue had
for a while depriued him of spéech: earnestly beholding the
rare beautie of the Princesse, he thus began. Madame, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I should doo to my Lord your Father all the serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that a Knight is able to yéelde his gracious patrone, yet
the very least of these fauours, which it hath pleased your
excellencie to bestowe on mée, may bee reckoned for much
more then deserued recompence. Wherefore béeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that my seruice is placed in your good conceit, I
shall not hencefoorth feare to put my life in hazard, so much
I desire to sée these present promises accomplished: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

requiring nothing but your good opinion, which
so many choyse Ladies haue heretofore desired. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
no better pay (quoth the Prince) then her gracious

time, till the Armie marched forward in array, which they
faire and softly followed, till tenne Pages belonging to the
Princesse, leading tenne goodly Coursers most richly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parassoned,
came before them. Another Page brought a

that the proude Brethren may see the shame of <hi>Amarano.</hi>
And such is my hope, that as you serued the eldest, so will
you deale with the other, while one of them remains aliue.
These Horses likewise for the warre I bestow vppon you,
they beeing accounted the very best in <hi>Turkie,</hi> and these
will serue you well when you are in fielde: our Gods bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

on the word of a Prince, whosoeuer it bee, to conceale it

so iust a Fréende to her, as her high calling well deserueth:
otherwise I had rather die the death, then once to speake a

as embracing him manie times, and returning him mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold

he gaue such a cruell stroke on the head, as had almost sette
him beside his Saddle. <hi>Olorico</hi> greatly discontented héereat
turned valiantlie towards his eneme, and betwéene them
continued a very daungerous fight: but in the ende, <hi>Grami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells</hi>

when <hi>Olorico</hi> following his intent, noblie at one

climbe the Mountaine, where in wholes &amp; Caues they were
glad to hide themselues: and there they continued fiue or
sixe daies in safetie, albeit they were readie to die for want
of sustenaunce. <hi>Palmerin</hi> foreséeing the incommoditie of the

but that you are the Sonne of the most loyall redoubted and

charge to giue the one the sléeping and daungerous drinke,
and to the other, the amorous &amp; delicate, yet in effect to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke

office, and the Princes tooke this mixed drinke so substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
as they coulde hardly forbeare sleeping at the Tables
<pb facs="tcp:1616:234"/>
wherefore euery one arysing, the Quéene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

where beeing in bed, they slept soundly, and the Quéene
comming to them, accompanied with those trustie Ladies
that wayted at Supper, tooke the Prince <hi>Olorico,</hi> conuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to another bed, for he was so charmed as hée coulde
not awake.</p>
                     <p>Afterward the Ladies departed, and the Quéene went
to bedde to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> whom she abused at her owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
A matter not to bée esteemed fabulous, in that other
haue béene brought into the like case, as well may witnesse
<hi>Brangiena,</hi> who endured these swéet skirmishes, because she
should not manifest the Historie of <hi>Ysuel</hi> her Mistresse, and
<hi>Tristram.</hi> The Quéene hauing satisfied her vnchast desire,
caused <hi>Olorico</hi> to be brought into his place againe, and then
returned to her owne Chamber. But now this enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
loosing his operation, a fantasie appeared to <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
resembling his Ladie <hi>Polynarda,</hi> who sayd: Ah <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
disloyall Traytour and adulterer, howe much are they
deceyued, that repute thée a loyall and faithfull Louer? Ah
wretch vnworthie of so good a name, hauing so iniuriouslie
forgotten mee. Doost thou not consider thy great offence,
committed against the God of heauen: medling with a
Woman more brute then brutishnesse it selfe, and thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall

forsake not her companie, I will neuer forget thy
fault, but chastise thée continually as a dissembling repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.
So she departed, <hi>Palmerin</hi> intreating her to pardon
this iuiurie, which she would not heare, but floong away in
great anger: and he awaking, brake foorth into these spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                     <p>Ah vnhappie wretch that I am, thus to loose the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

the Bedde in a swoune. <hi>Olorico</hi> fearing he was dead, cried
out for helpe, whereat the Quéene arose, and casting her
night Mantle about her, came to know the occasion of this
clamour: and finding <hi>Palmerin</hi> breathlesse, shée called for
so many present remedyes, as extinguished the passionate
fitte. <hi>Palmerin</hi> séeing the Quéene so néere him, clothed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

all his people to prouide themselues, for he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

his carriage béeing sent before, and his men attending him,
hée came to take his leaue of the Quéene, who verie sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for this straunge accident, said to him at his departure.
Noble <hi>Palmerin,</hi> my heart attainted with such extreame

obeysaunce of the Soldane, with theyr prisoners they
returned towardes his Maiestie, sending worde before of
<pb facs="tcp:1616:236"/>
their spéedie comming. The Soldane was not a little ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

héere may you behold the Prince of <hi>Arabia,</hi> one of

more seruice to your Father and you in this warre, then

who was chiefe leader of the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Armie. Beside,

such and so many haue béene his rare exploytes, as no one
that I knowe may be equalled with him. And all this hée
admitteh to your fauour, wherein hée earnestly desireth to

                     <p>So helpe me our Gods, I know well that the Prince
<hi>Olorico</hi> is so puyssant and renowmed, as any man of whom
I yet heard: notwithstanding, I hope the Soldane my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will not be ingratefull in the knowledge thereof, and
that sufficiently I dare awarrant yée. But I desire you

and especiall estimation. And were it not that my hope one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consisteth in you, comparing my small desert, and the
excellencie of my Ladie, long ere this had my soule forsooke
her infortunate habitation, which so indiscreetlie fell into
these oppressing passions. And this I earnestly intreate you
to let her vnderstand: in that I feare least shée impute my
happie alteration, to want of wisedome and ciuilitie. Trust
me, quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> I promise you my vttermost abilitie,
and so much will I do, as one Friend may for another, to
discharge my selfe of the promise which héeretofore I made
you.</p>
                     <p>And let me intreate you on mine owne behalfe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue
that opinion of speciall loue, which you report the
Princesse beares me, béeing not such as you doe imagine:
for (noble Prince, and my deare Fréende) you néede not
despayre of the benefit whereof I haue so solemnely assured
you. After many other speeches, they slept till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
when clothing themselues in their richest garments,
they went and gaue the good morrow to the Soldane, who
verie honourablie thanked them: and <hi>Palmerin</hi> espying
conuenient occasion, thus began.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, you haue sufficient experience, that by the
bountie and great fauour of the Gods, you haue obteyned
victory against your enemies, to the no little content of your
Subiects: all which béeing so happily finished, base were
the thought, to feare the perfection of higher enterprises.
<pb facs="tcp:1616:237"/>
Therefore my Lord, I thinke it expedient, so it may stand
with your good liking, considering your prouision for the sea
is in such readinesse, your people likewise acquainted with
your intent, before we meddle with the Brethren of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marano,</hi>
came daily in troupes to offer their seruice: that
now you send your Armie to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
once heard, right soone will we embarke our selues,
and set forward on our voyage. For the rest, I pray you
deliuer these prisoners to be vsed as your slaues: but as for
the Princes, I thinke (hauing séene the fortune of theyr
Brethren, and their owne badde successe in Armes) that
they will serue you with continuall loyaltie. My Sonne,
quoth the Soldane, let all bée doone as you haue appointed,
for such is my confidence in you, that your intent cannot
but sort to good ende: wherefore my Gallies and al things
readie furnished, depart when you please, hauing first sent
your Souldiers abroad.</p>
                     <p>The Prince <hi>Olorico</hi> beeing present, offered againe to
go in this voyage, with like number of men, as he brought
against the Brethren of <hi>Amarano:</hi> for which the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane
greatly thanked him, promising him such satisfaction
at his returne, as should agrée with his owne content. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chidiana</hi>
taking in ill part the words of <hi>Palmerin</hi> on the
Prince <hi>Oloricos</hi> behalfe, sent for him to come speake with
her, which hée did, and finding her very sad and melancholy,
hée demaunded if any one had doone her displeasure, and
what the cause might bee of her pensiuenesse. Ah my déere
friend, quoth shée, how can I but be agréeued, séeing no one
Lady in the world, hath so many contrarie fortunes as my
selfe? Alas, my heart hath chosen you for my onely Lords
and Friend, thinking to finde place woorthy my conceite,
and that your loue would answere me with the like: but in
ought I can perceiue, I am too much beguiled, for you, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as ingratefull or carelesse, vse affecting spéeches to me,
importing no other ende, but that in leauing you, I should
take the Prince <hi>Olorico</hi> for my Husband. Do you imagine
<pb facs="tcp:1616:238"/>
me so mutable and inconstant, that I will or can loue anie
other but you? or that my affection intirely setled so high,
can brooke such a downefall, as to like the man so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to mée? And (which most of all offendeth me) not
contented to mocke me, in disdaining my knowne loue, so
discourteously would perswade me to choose another? Let
all our Gods be iudge, if I haue not iust cause to complaine
of you, albeit I haue greater cause to hate and despise my
owne selfe: for in that I haue more then deserued your
loue, yet (as too much vnwise) I cannot consider, that in
the heart of an ingratefull person, loue hath no place of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
abyding. But seeing our gods haue in such sort sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
mee, as (against my will) I am constrained to loue
mine enemie: in vaine were it for me to resist against them,
that they beholding the vnspotted loue of the one, may in
the ende punish the ingratitude of the other. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her, as she was not able to proffer one word more,
whereby <hi>Palmerin</hi> enforced, thus answered. I beséech you
Madame, crosse me not with these néedelesse words, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Prince is so worthie to be loued, as any man
that euer I saw: yet were I very much vnprouided of
witte, and a méere stranger of good consideration, if I
would refuse that speciall felicitie, then which I can desire
no greater.</p>
                     <p>I knowe (swéete Lady) that you loue mee intirely,
perswade your selfe then, that my loyaltie is no lesse, nor
can death make mee gainesay the promises I haue made
you: and were it not to the great disaduantage of mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to leaue the honourable warre your Father hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
which might procure each one to misconceiue of
mee, assure your selfe, that I would forsake dignities,
Armes, and all, to do you the seruice you worthily deserue:
all which at my returne, feare not, shal be effected. So well
could <hi>Palmerin</hi> dissemble the matter, as the Princesse was

one of them that could well sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

answered. Wee are all of <hi>Allemaigne,</hi> to whome Fortune
hath excéeded in crueltie. These wordes were maruailous
welcome to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and for which inwardly he thanked
<pb facs="tcp:1616:239"/>
his God: but the better to dissemble his ioy, he thus spake.
This Countrey should séeme to be very farre from hence,
because I neuer heard thereof before. So finding this ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
fitte for his purpose, hée appointed it for himselfe and
the Prince <hi>Olorico,</hi> discharging all other that were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
two Knights onely excepted, to whose charge hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Christians: causing his Horses, Tents, and all
other necessaries, to be carried abroad, as well the Prince
<hi>Oloricos</hi> as his owne, accomplishing euerie thing in such
order, as within thrée dayes after the Souldiers were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

when the Soldane and other Taborlanes, accompanied the
King of <hi>Balisarca</hi> to the Hauen. But the faire <hi>Alchidiana</hi>
would not bee séene, by reason of her great greefe for her
Friendes departure: for when shee came to take her leaue
of <hi>Palmerin</hi> in his Chamber, shee fell (in a manner) dead at
his féete, soone after shee deliuered these lamentable spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                     <p>This is no common farewell my beloued Lord, which
you now take of me, but say it is my very last adiew: for
my heart perswades mee that I shall neuer sée you more,
because the extremities of my sorrowes are such, as well
I know I cannot long endure. Adiew my sweete Fréende,
who in stéede of my ioy and comfort, leauest me in despayre,
which neuer can haue ende but by immediate death. God
Madame say not so, quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> for I hope right soone
to sée you againe. So leauing her, <hi>Olorico</hi> and he went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Hauen: the Prince beeing so passionate to leaue
her sight, by whose swéete lookes his life was maintained:
as had not his friendly companion comforted him, vnable
was hee to departe the Pallace. But béeing nowe come to
the Port, and féeling the winde and sea seruiceable, loth to
trifle the time with any longer stay, they came to take
their leaue of the Souldane, who tooke great care for theyr
contentment, and many times embracing <hi>Palmerin,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
to him the disposition of all his affayres, sayd. My

noble Sonne and friend, I vowe to you in presence of our
Gods, that if you returne hither againe with victorie, with
such honours I will endowe you, as shall be sufficient for
the whole worlde to talke on. <hi>Palmerin</hi> humbly kissing
his hande, went aboord, the Marriners hoysing sayle,
launched foorth into the Sea, with such a braue noyse of
Drums, Trompets, Clarions, Cornets, Fifes, and other
instruments, as though Heauen and earth would haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
together. <hi>Palmerin</hi> thus floting on the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of <hi>Neptune,</hi> imagined how with safety he might
forsake his companie, wherefore he commanded to vnbinde
all the Christians. For (quoth hee to <hi>Olorico)</hi> séeing they
are Marriners, and well skilled in the art of Nauigation,
they may stand vs in good stéede, if time so require, or any
sodaine tempest should assaile vs: but the better to beguile
his owne people, he caused them to sweare their faithfull
seruice to him.</p>
                     <p>The neght being come, and he séeing that euerie one slept
soundly, called two of the Christians, and in the <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne</hi>
tongue thus beganne. My Friends, giue thanks to
God for your fortune, in that you Christians haue founde
one of your faith and religion, who hath good hope shortly
to deliuer you from these heathen helhoundes: therefore
set feare apart, and regarde well your Quadrant, if you can
compasse any meane to get the coast of <hi>Allemaigne.</hi> The
Christians more glad then can be expressed, answered, that
they would accomplish his commandement, and therefore
he should repose his trust in them. About midnight, as God
would, beganne a great tempest and blustring of winde, so
that in despight of the Pylots and Marriners, the Fléete
was seuered in many parts: but the Christians perceiuing
that this winde serued well for their auaile, kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

how to order their course, that in short time they got farre

for tenne or twelue dayes, for which <hi>Palmerin</hi> deuoutly

                        <pb facs="tcp:1616:240"/>So happily strained <hi>Palmerin</hi> with his <hi>Allemaignes,</hi>
that one of them at length tolde him they were neere
the straites of <hi>Gibraltare,</hi> for which <hi>Palmerin</hi> not a little
ioyfull, said, that they might passe <hi>Spaine</hi> without any feare,
and so the sooner reach <hi>Allemaigne.</hi> But when they began
to coast the straight the Turkish marriners were amazed,
saying that the Christians knew not their course, beeing
more then eight hundred thousand leagues foorth of theyr
compasse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> fearing to be discouered before hée came to his
intent, aunswered in choler, that the Christians knewe
their course much better then they did, and they to prate no
more on paine of their liues: which threatning presently
droue them all to silence. Afterwarde they sayled with so
good winde, as they tooke landing at a Port in <hi>Allemaigne,</hi>
which at this day is called <hi>Tolledo,</hi> when the Christians
said to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> how that was the place where they were
borne, where (if so he pleased) they desired their libertie.
<hi>Palmerin</hi> assuring them of their request, answered that hée
himselfe would land there, and therfore went first on shore,
feigning to séeke fresh water, and all ihings accomplished
to his owne desire, he caused his Horse to be brought forth,
and <hi>Oloricos</hi> likewise, who was importunate to beare him
companie. No sooner was <hi>Palmerin</hi> on shore, but he knéeled
downe, giuing thanks to God for his safe deliuerance. The
Marchants and Marrines of the Citie, séeing them whome
they thought lost in the Sea more then tenne yéeres before,
were greatly abashed, welcomming them home with excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ioy, but they answered, that they ought rather to
thanke the Knight in gréene Armour, for hee deliuered vs
from the Moores and Infidels, without request of any ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Olorico</hi> amazed at these signes of ioy, as also when hee
sawe <hi>Palmerin</hi> pray, knew not well what to thinke, which
<hi>Palmerin</hi> presently perceiuing, and to resolue him of all
doubts whatsoeuer, sayd. No longer neede I know my good
<pb facs="tcp:1616:240"/>
Lord and Friende, to hide the affaires and secrets of my
heart from you, know therefore that I am a Christian, and
a Gentleman of the Emperours Court of <hi>Allemaigne.</hi> But
that which most of all gréeueth me, is, that I am constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to forsake your companie, and returne againe to my
Lorde, for too much should I offend my God, to go with
you to the Soldanes seruice. Wherefore my louing friend,
let me intreate you to holde me excused, swearing to you by
the faith of a Knight, that whether else it shall like you to
go, I will accomplish your minde in any thing. I intreate
you likewise, to entertaine al my Squires and Gentlemen
into your seruice, and among them to share all my treasure
in the Shippe, because I will haue nothing with me but
my Horse and armour. And notwithstanding all this,
feare nor to present your selfe before the Soldane and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chidiana:</hi>
for to them will I write such matter of you, as
they shall accept you in my place, and with as great honour
as euer they did mee. If heauen so fauour mee as I may
come to the knowledge of my father, I will certifie you
with the truth of all. As for my counterfeiting to be dumbe,
was onely but to awaite opportunitie, when with safety I
might escape thence.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Olorico</hi> at the first was amazed, what may be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of him nowe? notwithstanding, hee loued <hi>Palmerin</hi> so
perfectly, as hee returned him this answere. Although Syr
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> wee are of contrary faith and opinion, yet hath
your noblenesse and humanitie gained such priuiledge ouer
me, that as you haue long time liued a Christian among
the Turks, so for your sake will I liue a Turke among the
Christians, dissembling in like sort as you did, and neuer
shall any occasion force mée to forsake you, till you haue
found your Father, and know if he be discended of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danes
bloud. No honour will it be for me nowe, to returne
again to the <hi>Assirian</hi> Princes, and as for my people, I force
not though they go backe againe with my treasure: for on
my Knighthood, I will bee no richer then you, nor will
<pb facs="tcp:1616:241"/>
reserue any thing with mée, then what belongs to a Knight
errant, which is Horse and Armour. For the rest, let For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
do the worst she can, I hope for all this, one day to be
King of <hi>Arabia.</hi> Then noble friend, be not offended, for
I will beare you companie, if death and strong imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doo not withhold mee. <hi>Palemrin</hi> embraicng him,
saide.</p>
                     <p>Ah worthie Prince, so noble is your minde, and repleate
with fidelitie, as perswade your selfe to find me your loyall
Brother, and fellow in Armee, neuer to forsake you while
I can lift my Sword, so please you to abide with mee. So
calling the chéefest of them in the ship, they sayde as much
to them as you haue heard, commaunding them not to stir
from <hi>Arabia</hi> before they heard some other tydings. As for
their strange conceit at these newes, I bequeath to your
iudgements, yet durst they not gainsay their Maisters, but
launching into the deepe, sayled backe again into their own
Countrey.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Olorico</hi> for this night lodged in the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to refresh themselues, and the next morning, after they
had taken leaue of the Merchants, they deliuered, they set
forward on their iourney. Continuing their trauaile thrée
daies together, at length they mette a Knight, who séeing
them armed after the Turkish manner, sayde. Gentlemen,
God saue ye, if I should not seeme troublesome to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I iudge you to be strangers, I would gladly knowe if
you could tell me any tidings of two Knights, which long
since left this Countrey. Howe were they named? (quoth
<hi>Palmerin)</hi> Syr saide the Knight, one of them is <hi>Trineus,</hi>
Some to our dread Lord the Emperour, and the other, the
most valiant <hi>Palmerin d' Oliua.</hi> Two yéeres and more since
they left the Court, without any newes what became of
them, sauing that wee heard they were a while with the
King of <hi>England,</hi> and thence they conuayed his Daughter,
the Emperous continuing so sorrowfull for theyr losse, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
houre his death is expected. May it be (quoth <hi>Palmerin)</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:1616:241"/>
that all this while <hi>Trineus</hi> is not returned? What daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
will noble <hi>Allemaigne</hi> receiue, by loosing their young
Prince? Ouercome with exceeding griefe and sorrow by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of these vnhappie tidings, to himselfe he beganne in this
maner.</p>
                     <p>What shall I doo? dare I be so presumptuous, as to
present my selfe before my Mistresse? what sufficient excuse
can I make for the loue of her brother? Doubtlesse, if it were
such a hell to me, to finde the meane for my departure, from
that long captiuitie in the Soldanes Court, much more will
it be to me now in the search of the Prince, for without him
I dare not approach the Emperours presence. While he thus
secretly discoursed with himselfe, he became so excéeding pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate,
as <hi>Olorico</hi> thought he had lost his sences: which
was the cause, that without any further enquirie, the <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne</hi>
Knight departed from them: when <hi>Olorico,</hi> ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at this suddain alteration, said. How now Sir <hi>Palmerin,</hi>
what hath moued you to this heauinesse? I beséech you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
not the cause from me: for if it be by any offence, that
the Knight offered which spake to you, soone shall I deliuer
him his penance. Therefore tell me I pray you, for vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
I will not suffer you to rest, vntill you haue acquainted
me with the truth. <hi>Palmerin</hi> knowing how déerly y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Prince
loued him, and that for his sake he had left Country, parents
and friends, reposing on his loyaltie, imparted his loue to
him, as also the lesse of <hi>Trineus</hi> and the Princesse <hi>Agriola,
Olorico</hi> then laboured to perswade him, aduising him to
compasse some secret spéech with his Ladie, of whome hée
might learne how to recouer her lost brother, and the faire
<hi>Agriola</hi> of <hi>England</hi> againe. <hi>Palmerin</hi> following this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,

                     <p>The Emperours trayne lodging each way about the
Castle, hindered our two Knights from any good hostage, so
that they were constrained to abide in a little simple house,
where they demaunded of a Courtier that lay there,
what time the Emperour would depart thence, who aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that his highnesse was minded that day to returne
to <hi>Gaunt,</hi> to conferre with the Princes electours of speciall
affaires concerning the Empire. <hi>Palmerin</hi> ioyfull heereof,
caused his Horse to bée brideled, and accompanied with
<pb facs="tcp:1616:242"/>
                        <hi>Olorico,</hi> went and ambushed themselues in a little thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
néere the high way where the Emperour must needes
passe, to the ende he might beholde his Ladie <hi>Polynarda,
Palmerin</hi> attending her comming who was the onely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of his life, his heart leapt with conceite of his ioy to
come, yet trembled likewise because hee durst not present
himselfe before the imperiall maiestie, without the noble

Court, the teares trickled downe his chéekes, chéefely for
want of his highnesse sonne, who was so especially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to his trust, then followed the Empresse, and with
her the faire Princesse <hi>Polynarda,</hi> clothed all in black, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing
by her outwarde habit, the secret sorrowes of her
heart. Her thoughts still hammering on her priuat gréefes,
yet assailed with a sodaine motion, shee gaue such a sigh
as <hi>Palmerin</hi> easily heard it, which troubled him in such
sort, as without the assurance of <hi>Olorico,</hi> hee had fallen
downe from his Horse. <hi>Polynarda</hi> beholding his sodaine
alteration, without any regarde of her Mother, called <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banillo</hi>
the Dwarfe to her, who since his comming from
<hi>England</hi> neuer boudged from her, and to him she sayd. Hast
thou héeretofore <hi>(Vrbanillo)</hi> séene these two Knights,
which shaddow themselues in the wood side while wee passe
by? No trust mee Madame (quoth the Dwarfe) I neuer

me, of whence they are, and if they can tell any tydings of
thy maister, and my Brother <hi>Trineus.</hi> The Dwarfe, who
was more then a Doctor in such affaires, dissembling that
his Horse would stale, suffered the traine to passe by, and
then rode towards the knights, who were deuising on the
Princesse beautie. <hi>Palmerin</hi> well knowing <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> and
séeing him come in such hast, was not a little glad, thinking
<pb facs="tcp:1616:243"/>
now he should heare some newes of his Mistresse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he saide is <hi>Olorico.</hi> I pray you let vs goe méete this
Horseman, for I thinke his returne is onely to vs. Nowe
was the Dwarffe come to them, and hauing humbly salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, said. I beséech you faire Knights to tell me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you belong to the Emperour, or are straungers, for the
Ladie whome I serue, is verie desirous to knowe, and that
for matters néerely concerning her, whereof if you can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

your owne contentment? What <hi>Vrbanillo?</hi> quoth <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
lifting vp his Beuer, didst thou not knowe thy Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster?
Oh Heauen, (quoth the Dwarffe,) praised by thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
for euer for this aduenture. And moued with extreame
ioy, he fell at this Maisters féete, saying. Ah my Lord, what
comfort will this be to the Princesse <hi>Polynarda,</hi> when shée

cause: for by this meane is shée deliuered from the greatest
torments in the worlde. And that nothing may want to
furnish this long expected ioy, tell me if the Knight in your
companie, be the Prince <hi>Trineus</hi> or no? It is not hée, quoth
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> for it is more then a year since, that of him, and
faire English <hi>Agriola</hi> (after that I vnfortunate lost them)
heard anie certaine report. For this cause <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> it
behooues thée to be faithfull and secrete, not discouering my
béeing héere to any but my Ladie, of whome thou must
learne, by what meanes I may best come to sée her. The
Dwarffe taking his leaue of his Maister, turned his Horse
to be gone: but comming backe suddainlie againe, saide. Is
this Sir <hi>Ptolome</hi> that is with you? Madame <hi>Brionella</hi> will
not be a litle glad to hear of him likewise. Nor is it he, (quoth
<hi>Palmerin)</hi> I lost him in company with the rest. God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store

spurres to his horse, he galloped till he came to the Princesse,
who séeing him returned in such haste, knew not well what

so soone as shée came to her Chamber, shée called for the
Dwarffe, who being come, shée said, I pray thée <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi>
by the reuerend dutie thou owest mée, whence are the two
Knights, and what answere did they make thée? They are
such swéet Madam, quoth the Dwarffe, as when all the men
in the world could tell no tydings of, my selfe by happie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
haue found: for by them I bring you the Key of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
if your self wil but find the meane to enter. Tush, I pray
thée quoth the Princesse, iest not with me in this sort, for now
is no time of sport or meriment: tell mée who they are I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
thée? Know then fair Madam, quoth he, that one of them
is my Maister <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who thus concealeth him, because
he hath not brought the Prince your brother with him, and
he (humbly kissing your hand) commends him to your graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fauour, desiring you to send him answer, how he may se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
speak with you, because he wold not be knowne to the
Emperor, or any other of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Court. How welcome these long
expected newes were to the Princesse, I leaue to the opinion
of long absent friends. O heauens, quoth she, doth <hi>Palmerin</hi>
liue, and is so near at hand? now hath my hart his only desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
comfort: and such is my hope, that séeing he is come, my
brother (by his meanes) shall not be long hence, to such good
fortune are all his actions destenied. Presently she ran to tell
<hi>Brionella</hi> these newes, who likewise was excéeding ioyfull,
because she imagined <hi>Palmerins</hi> companion to be her <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome.</hi>
Whereupon they concluded togither, that <hi>Palmerin</hi>
should the night following come to the Gardein, where first
his swéet Amours were sollicited, and by a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he should ascend their Chamber. This resolution set downe,
the Dwarffe departed to execute his charge, when <hi>Polinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>

before I begin this iourney, let me intreate that fauourable
regard: which is the comfort in loue, and vniteth life &amp; soule
togither, which heretofore you haue graunted, and I hope
will not now deny me. What may I iudge (quoth she) of
your constancie since your absence? for not long since I was
sollicited with a vision, which tolde me that you commited
breach of loyaltie with a Quéene, to my no litle griefe: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
full often I reprooued you therefore, to cause you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
that sinns, when me séemed the Quéene thus answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Be thou assured <hi>Polynarda,</hi> that although <hi>Palmerin</hi>
estéeme thée aboue all other, yet shall he leaue some part of his

wherewith you séemed to be moued, and so forsaking her,
followed me: and herewith I awaked, finding (indéed) my

insupportable griefe. <hi>Palmerin</hi> abashed hereat, remembred
what entertainment the Quéene of <hi>Tharsus</hi> made him at

<pb facs="tcp:1616:245"/>
his arriuall, her piercing, amorous, and alluring spéeches,
wherewith incessantly shee did sollicite him: and such was
conceit, as he verely perswaded himselfe, that by enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

me by an enchaunted drinke, which vnwittingly I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
as I sate at supper, causing me to loose both sence and

night likewise.</p>
                     <p>Doubtlesse my Lord, quoth she, considering the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
of her affection, she practised some meanes to compasse
her desire: but séeing it fell out in that sort, and beléeuing you
would not willingly offend me, I am contented to pardon
that fault. In these and such like spéeches, they spent that

to set fire among the Turkishe Fléete, at what time they
receiued the signe from the Cittie. The Infidelles séeing the
Christians to sallie abroad, left their Shippes and came to

into squadrons, and running furiously on the <hi>Moores,

suddainly was the signall of fire made, on the highest stéeple
in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to the Emperours power wasting on
the Sea: which immediately launching among the Turkish
Fléete, suncke the greater part of them, and burned the rest
with their wilde fire. When the Turkes beheld this strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geme,
and that they were now destitute of any helpe, they
beganne to faint: so that at the comming of the Emperour,
who came himself vpon them, with a fresh sallie of fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

As he thought to haue procéeded further in spéeches, and
the Quéene hauing not answered one worde, vnhappily the

<hi>Florendos</hi> séeing his affaires to growe from badde to

choler, he drew his Dagger from vnder his Frocke, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the King by the bosome, said: <hi>Tarisius,</hi> I will not hyde
from thée who I am: it is more then twentie yéeres since I
promised thy death, and nowe I am come in person to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme

the Quéene saw, she on the other side fell in swoune again.
<hi>Frenato</hi> greatly amazed hereat, sayde to <hi>Florendos.</hi> For

ranne downe the stayres, crying aloude. Arme ye Knights,

Pilgrime is slaine in the Quéenes Chamber. <hi>Cardino</hi>
one of the Quéenes Squires, her brother that caried yong
<hi>Palmerin</hi> to the mountaine, had no leysure to take anie
other armes then a Sword and Shéelde, wherefore he was
the first that came to the Quéenes Chamber, where hee
found <hi>Florendos</hi> guarding the entraunce, who presentlie
<pb facs="tcp:1616:250"/>
knew him, saying. Depart my good Friend <hi>Cardyno,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse

what art thou (sayde <hi>Cardyno)</hi> that knowest mee so well?
I am thy Fréend (quoth the Prince) the most vnfortunate
<hi>Florendos.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Straunge it is my Lord, quoth <hi>Cardyno,</hi> that you durst

Sheelde, and defend your selfe, for I thinke you will stande
in great néede thereof. In the means while, I wil go aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
the Duke of <hi>Pera</hi> of this mishap, he is your good fréend,
and by his meanes you may haue some succour: for often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
haue I heard him say at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that he wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
you as well as my Lord the Emperour. Dispatch then
said <hi>Florendos,</hi> that thou be not found héere with me, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
thée, if I may escape this daunger, I will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
this seruice to thine owne content. <hi>Florendos</hi> armed
himselfe with the Sword and Shéeld, whereof hée was so
glad, as if hée had béene backed with manie trustie fréends:
vowing before he died, to make such a spoyle among his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
as should remaine for an after memorie. <hi>Cardyno</hi>
went with all diligence to the Duke, and secretly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him with all this misfortune: whereat the Duke
greatly amazed, answered, I will do my vttermost for his
safetie, because full well he hath deserued it. And so accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with many <hi>Grecian</hi> Knights, he went to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Quéenes
Chamber: and thrusting through the throng in despight of
them that guarded the stayres, bée got to the Chamber. At
the entrance whereof he found <hi>Florendos</hi> defending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with such manly courage, as nine or ten lay slaine at
his féete.</p>
                     <p>The Duke and his men caused the <hi>Hungarians</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themselues, saying: that himselfe would not suffer the
matter so to escape, for the offence ought to bee punished by
iustice, after the truth were knowne and thorowlie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode.
Hereupon the kings two Nephewes came in great
rage, saying to the Duke of <hi>Pera,</hi> that the Quéene and the
<pb facs="tcp:1616:251"/>
Pilgrime ought presently to die. What? quoth the Duke,
depart you likewise, your willes shall not héere stande for
Lawe, nor is the Quéene to bée intreated with such ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>
                     <p>So drawing his swoorde, and his Knights likewise,
resisted the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> so that manie of them were slaine,
vntill certaine Gentlemen came, who louing and estéeming
the Quéene, appeased this tumult. Then was it agréed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the Duke should take him into his charge, who had
murthered the King, on whom such punishment should bee
inflicted as the cause required: and héereupon the Duke
tooke his oath before all the companie. In this sort the
Kinges Nephewes were quieted, who presentlie departed
the Chamber, causing the dead and wounded to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed
thence, that the people might receiue no further occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

said.</p>
                     <p>Yéeld your selfe to me my Lord, and I will promise you

If you will not, assure your selfe, that your bodies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
suffice the villainous surie of these people, for they haue

Quéene, for (on mine honour) she is guiltlesse. And if any
offence hath béene committed, it was by me: yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
iust cause, and in defence of mine own life. My comming
hither-was, because I am newly returned from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
and remembring the manifold honours, which sometime I
receyued of my Ladie in the Emperour her Fathers Court:
in my passing by, I was destrous to do my dutie to her. At
the instant time I was saluting her, the King came into
the Chamber, who moued with an auncient hatred, which
<pb facs="tcp:1616:251"/>
you verie well know, would haue slaine me, but I preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his intent with the ayde of my weapon, bestowed that

haue sayd, quoth the Duke, yet must you néedes abide triall

                     <p>
                        <hi>Frenato</hi> perceyuing his Cozin in such daunger, sought
about the Chamber for some weapon to defende him: and
finding the Kings Sworde by the Quéenes bed side, shewed
it to the Duke, that he might giue the better credite to the
Princes wordes. Yet notwithstanding all their excuses,
these two Pilgrims were taken into sure custodie, and shut
vp both togither in a strong Towre, which was verie long
before they could accomplish, because in leading them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
many sought meanes to kill them, and they had done
it, but that the Duke verie strongly defended them.</p>

                     <p>O God, doost thou permit a happie life, to enioy so bad
an end? Thou that onely knowest the inward secrets of the
heart, séeing I stand suspected in this treason, let my spéedie
death deliuer mine innocencie. Ah inconstant Fortune, that
in my yonger yéeres was so aduerse to mee, how might I
credite thy continuall mallice but by this strange and vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
accident? Ah gentle Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> it was not
for loue that thou camest to sée mée, but for a secret hatred
more then deadly, séeing that by thée (and that with great
shame) I shall remaine for euer defamed. Where was that
loyaltie, and the great feare to offend mée, which sometime
thou séemedst to haue? Knowest thou not that in a royall
and noble minde, one onely note of infamie is an extreame
torment? Doubtlesse, if thou wouldest well consider the
wrong thou hast done me, thou shalt finde it to excéede all
other worldly iniuries. But I may perswade my selfe,
that my destinie was such, for being long since by thée disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
it must fall out for a finall conclusion, that by thée
also I shall receiue death.</p>
                     <p>In this maner the Quéene complained, with such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
of teares and bitter sighes, as the Duke pitying her
case, sayd. I beséech you Madame, to endure this mishap pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
séeing now it cannot be recalled, and consider that
these teares and lamentations can yéelde yée no amendes,
but rather threaten daunger, and will in the ende not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

dead, he must be buried: <hi>Florendos</hi> hath offended, hée shall

Hereupon the Duke caused preparation for the funerall

many teares and lamentations of his Subiects. When
the obsequies were finished, <hi>Promptaleon</hi> and <hi>Oudin</hi> came

may say, that without hearing hee was cut off, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by his open enemies. Againe thinke you that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour

So well coulde the Duke sette foorth his discourse, with
confirmation of Hystories both auncient and moderne, that
in despight of the Kings Nephewes it was concluded, how
the prisoners should be sent to <hi>Constantiople.</hi> If they were

<pb facs="tcp:1616:253"/>
trusting so much in their strength and prowesse, that if the
Emperour (for proofe of the cause) shoulde committe it is
the Combat, they easily thought to compasse their intent.
So were the two Pilgryms committed to the Dukes Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
with an hundred Knights of <hi>Greece</hi> for their guard,
and foure hundred <hi>Hungarians,</hi> who would néedes followe

                     <p>To comfort her, her Daughter <hi>Armida</hi> was placed in

twelue or thirtéene yeares of age, coulde so well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

must thinke <hi>Florendos</hi> griefes nothing inferiour, séeing
his Ladie led in such sort, and accused of a crime wherein
none but himselfe was culpable: yet made hee no account,

mine owne honour as the Princes, I humbly desire your

for such is my hope in a rightfull cause, as I shall find some
Knight to fight for me. The Lords of the Empire were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
of the same opinion, and instantly desired the
Emperour, to graunt his Daughter her lawfull request:
whereto hee answered that he would take counsell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and iustice should be doone her as it ought. Héereupon
the Emperour went into his Chamber, and the Quéene
was brought to the Empresse her Mother, where the poore
Lady was assaulted afresh, for shée was no sooner entred
the Chamber, but her Mother thus beganne. I knowe not
Daughter how badly thou hast béene counselled, that since

                     <p>Madame, quoth the Quéene, you speake your pleasure,
but (in regarde of my reuerence to you) I aunswere, that I
neuer though it. Wherefore I intreate you to forbeare
such spéeches, and if you consider all things well, your selfe
will be founde in greater fault then I. For con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

solemne promise which I had made to the Prince of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
you compelled mee to marrie with him: and if <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos</hi>
had the opportunitie, and in defence of his owne
<pb facs="tcp:1616:256"/>
person hath slaine him, ought you then to impute the crime
to me? With these words the Empresse held her peace, and
sate conferring with the yong Princesse <hi>Armida:</hi> in meane
while came the Duke of <hi>Pera,</hi> who had the Quéene in
charge, and conducted her to her Chamber, and afterward
(by the Emperours commandement) he shut <hi>Florendos</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a strong prison.</p>
                     <p>The next day, <hi>Promptaleon</hi> and <hi>Oudin</hi> came to the
Pallace, where with great and audacious impudencie they
came before the Emperour, saying. Why haue you not my
Lord, prouided the fire to burne your Daughter, and her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer
<hi>Florendos?</hi> Soft and fayre, aunswered the good
<hi>Remicius,</hi> bee not so hastie, I finde them not so faultie as
your accusation deliuereth: for no other harme was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
then talking together, and because <hi>Florendos</hi> was
disguised, is that a consequence my daughter must die? Nor
will I encurre with infamous report, in putting such a
Prince to death, without hearing how he can answere for
himselfe: you therefore my Lord of <hi>Pera,</hi> go fetch <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi>
that hee may answere to their propositions. The Duke
obeyed his commandement, and brought the Prince so
spent with extreame gréefe, because hee had caused the
Quéene into such danger, as hardly he could sustaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but after he had with great humilitie, prostrated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
before the Emperour, he began in this manner. Most
mightie Loed and Emperour of <hi>Greece,</hi> maruaile, not that
with such heauinesse I come before your maiestie, when in
stéede of dooing you seruice according as my dutie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

I repose my self on your benignitie and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
iustice, wherein I must intreate you, to haue regard on
the Quéene your Daughters innocence, for the fault that
is committed, if it deserue to be called a fault, was doone
without the Quéenes knowledge, or so much as a thought
of the matter on her part, before it happened. Moreouer,
there is none of so harsh iudgement or reason, but will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb facs="tcp:1616:256"/>
what familiaritie and friendship, both passe betwéene
Princes and Ladies in occasions of honour. Which may
serue to answere the cause of my comming to sée the Quéen,
being thereto bound by dutie and honest loue, wherewith
in my yonger yéeres I faithfully serued her. And this I
did without any iniurie to her honor, much lesse occasion of
offence to the King, which hee would néedes interprete in
that sort, when with so good indiscretion hée came and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailed
me.</p>
                     <p>These are fables, quoth <hi>Promptaleon,</hi> for the conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and treason betwéene thée and the Quéene is so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
as euerie one knowes it. And if the Emperour doo not
this day consumate your liues both together in one fire:
he offereth the greatest iniurie that euer Prince did, and
before the whole world wee will héereafter accuse him.
Darest thou maintaine by Combate in fielde, saide <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi>
what thou with such brauerie affirmest in this Hall?
that will I by mine honour, quoth <hi>Promptaleon,</hi> and let

burned as ye haue deserued, and the Princesse <hi>Armida</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
not legitimate, and so disinherited of the Kingdome.
Now hast thou reuealed thy villany, saide <hi>Florendos,</hi> and
for the last condition doost thou follow the cause so earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
rather then by any matter of truth and equitie: but
thou art deceiued in thine intent, and thy death (villaine)
shall deliuer assurance of her succession. So please my Lord
the Emperour of his grace, to prolong the day of Combate
till I haue recouered some health: my selfe alone, against
thée and thy Brother, will prooue ye false Traytours, and
that maliciously yée haue accused the Quéene. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
seeing the Prince so weake and sickly, and yet with

resolued himselfe that shee was innocent. Remembring
then his noble seruices in defende of his Empire, and hows
iniuriously he denied him his Daughter: he was mooued in

accepted these conditions, béeing so farre ouercome

was carried backe againe to prison in such pensiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

The Quéene likewise was kept in sure guarde, despayring

wisheth? The torment of the will like wise, when one dare
not come in presence, nor behold her fauoured, to languish,
and yet may séeke no meane of helpe: all these insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
miscries we poore Ladies must endure, béeing giuen
by nature, or forced for a custome. Wherefore my Lorde,
present not me with your passions, considering each thing
as it ought, they may not be compared to the least of mine:
for loue who hath ouermaistred me, reigueth with such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
authoritie, as I must sooner die, then offer you anie

you, and bestowed those fauours on you which are most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
to wit, willing obedience, and that (then which) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more precious. Hauing then made you soueraigne
of my selfe, the Prince of <hi>Fraunce</hi> cannot enioy an other

enforce mée, although it be gréeuous to mée, I will tell him
what hath happened, and no menaces whatsoeuer shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> séeing his Ladie so firme and loyall, was not
a little ioyfull, thus answering. Doubtlesse my deare and
most gracious Mistresse, hitherto I durst presume on my
selfe, that by my manifolde loyall seruices, I shoulde one
day deliuer recompence, for some part of the honours you
haue done mée: but nowe I perceiue, that abounding in
your graces, you depriue me of all meanes to acknowledge
your bountie, which commonly men desire to shew by their
obedience, nor shall I be able to deserue the inestimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
contained in the simplest worde of your last most hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
promise.</p>
                     <p>Nowe the Princesse discerning by the Window, that
<hi>Aurora Phoebus</hi> his faire Porter, began to let foorth the
morning light, and prouide way for his Maisters iourney,
withdrew her selfe to her Chamber, and quicklie layde her
downe by <hi>Brionella,</hi> who the better to hide her Ladies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres,
dissembled that she had a feuer <hi>Quotidian,</hi> by which
meaue shée compassed to kéepe her Chamber, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<hi>Palmerin</hi> as her selfe desired. All this while <hi>Vrbanil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi>
brought newes from the Prince <hi>Olorico,</hi> who was so
desirous to sée the Princesse againe: as hée vowed not to
depart the Cittie, before hée accomplished what hée inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
<hi>Palmerin</hi> who loued him as his Brother, was in great
doubt howe hée shoulde safelye bring it to passe: till
<hi>Bryonella,</hi> whose deuises were euer readyest, sayde. My
Lord, the man béeing no way able to hurt you, of the lesse
importance néede you make the matter: will yée sée howe
<pb facs="tcp:1616:259"/>
we will a little iuggle with the Emperour? Let it be sayd,
that the Prince is Cozin to <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> and the cause of his
comming into his Countrey, was to séeke you: then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he vnderstandes how my Ladie loues the Dwarffe,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Maiestie (without anie doubt) will suffer the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins
to take their leaue of her: will not this deuise then
shadow his séeing the Princesse? Without question, quoth
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> I shoulde neuer haue inuented such a subtiltie,
be it then as you haue determined, but with great politie,
that the Emperour misdoubt nothing, for if he discouer vs,
we are shamed for euer. Referre it to me, sayd <hi>Brionella,</hi> if
I discribe not their kindred cunningly, neuer beléeue that
a Woman can inuent a lie without studie. <hi>Brinella</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
with the Dwarffe, layde downe the platforme in
such order, as the next day the Prince came before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour:
when <hi>Vrbanillo</hi> on his knée desired leaue, that hée
might depart with his Cozin there present, to séeke his
Maister, in whose search he woulde trauaile, till he heard
certainly of his life or death.</p>
                     <p>Ah, <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> quoth the Emperour, in such a luckie
howre maist thou goe, as to finde both him and my Sonne
<hi>Trineus,</hi> good leaue hast thou to goe when thou wilt. But
when I beholde you both aduisedly, verie hardly doo you
séeme to bée Cozins: for if there be anie alliaunce betwéene
you, it neuer came by the Fathers side: and if it be by the
Mother, the one was then married in <hi>Barbarie,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Scotland.</hi> Why my Lord (quoth the Dwarffe) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had I die, then tell an vntruth before your highnesse:
and with such protestations did the Dwarffe sooth his tale,
as they of greatest doubt gaue credite to him. Hereupon the
Emperour commaunded them to goe take their leaue of
his Daughter, willing her to write to her Brother. Hauing
obtained what they desired, they stayed not long in retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thankes: but went presently to the Princesse Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where shée (aduertized of their comming) staid for them.
Honourable salutations on each side deliuered, a Chayre
<pb facs="tcp:1616:259"/>
was brought for the Prince, and he sitting downe by <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narda,</hi>
she thus began. Albeit my Lord I am verie loath to
forgoe my Seruaunt: yet hauing found him so honest, and
for the good will I wish to all his kindred, especially you,
who haue enterprised to séeke his Maister and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I am the better contented to part with him. If the
Prince commended her beautie, when being ambushed hée
sawe her passe by: what may wee imagine of his opinion
nowe? For beholding her, the comfort of her long absent
Fréende, had called all her beauties togither, enriched
with so many swéete and ami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ble graces, as hee coulde
not repute her of humaine linage, but rather some Angell
discended from heauen, to make the glorie of <hi>Palmerin</hi> more
ample: whereupon, to deceiue the Ladies béeing present, hée
returned this answere. Undoubtedly Madame, if I and all
mine had spent our soules in your seruice, we should holde
our selues sufficiently recompenced, with the princely fauor
you affoord our Cozin, which he is no way able to deserue.
And perswade your selfe faire, Princesse, that if he be your
obedient Seruaunt, my selfe am no lesse, in all things that
your excellencie shall please to commaunde mee: so that if
there were not vrgent occasions to excuse my departure, it
would be my onely content to remaine at your disposition.
Yet such is my hope, that this gréefe shall bee changed into
ioy by a spéedie returne, when wee shall bring the Prince
<hi>Trineus</hi> and our noble Maister <hi>Palmerin.</hi> The sooner, the
better welcome will they be, quoth the Princesse, for therin
consisteth my chéefest comfort. And after many other spée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
betwéene them, she gaue him manie rich gifts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he helde himselfe so honoured, as if he had gained the
Monarchie of <hi>Asia:</hi> so kissing her hande, the Prince with
his newe Cozin, returned to his lodging. Now was it
concluded betwéene <hi>Palmerin</hi> and the Princesse, because
the Empresse on the morrow would come to sée her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that he should depart the same way he came, wherefore
the hower béeing come that hée shoulde passe the Wall,
<pb facs="tcp:1616:260"/>
                        <hi>Polinarda</hi> thus spake. Nowe is the time (my Lorde) that
you must leaue me, and I be forced to consent, because there
is no remedie: but perswade your selfe, that with this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
begins my sorrowes. Yet if I knowe where you tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed,

with better hope: but béeing vncertaine of your way,
and knowing what misfortunes and daungerous perilles,
may incounter you in vnknowne Countries, I knowe not
howe I shall dissemble my torments. Notwithstanding,
swéete Fréende, if your stay be long, send <hi>Vrbanillo</hi> againe,
to comfort poore <hi>Bryonella,</hi> and myselfe: for loosing the

For Gods sake Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

So after many swéete kisses, and gracious courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
passed betwéene them, they tooke their leaue each of
other, with such effusion of teares, as the verie inwarde
soule bemoned their departing. So with his Ladder of

and so I leaue thée to thy happie successe. Then suddainlie
vanished the Woman away, and coulde not afterwarde bée
seene againe, leauing <hi>Palmerin</hi> verie pensiue for what hée
had heard, which he estéemed to bée true, because hitherto
hée had found no lesse, all that the Sisters sayd to him on the

                     <p>Returning to his companie, <hi>Olorico</hi> demaunded what
Goddesse had talked with him, and what made him on a

be, the matter is such, as for all the Golde in the worlde, I
would not but haue knowne, which <hi>Vrbanillo</hi> can better
declare vnto you, then I am able: but because wée woulde
méete no more strange aduentures in this Mountaine, let
vs spéedily set forwarde on our iourney. All that day
they rode without any occasion to stay them, and the next
day likewise till towarde the Euening, when they espyed
tenne Knights comming before them, the formost of them
leading a Ladie, who made verie gréeuous and pitifull la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations:
whereupon <hi>Palmerin</hi> clasped his Helmette,
desiring <hi>Olorico</hi> to do the like, because (quoth hée) for anie
thing I sée, we shall haue pastime with some daunger. The
Prince did as his Fréende requested him, and when the
Ladie was come somewhat neerer them, shée framed her
spéeches to them in this maner. Gentle Knights, for Gods

hither: and to compasse their villainous intent, they haue
murthered my Husband and two of my brethren. <hi>Palmerin</hi>
without answering one word, approched to him that ledde
her, and gaue him such a rap on the pate, with a Mace that
hee carryed at his Saddle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:1616:261"/>
dead to the earth, making him sure not to escape, during
the time that hee dealt with the other. <hi>Olorico</hi> had taken
his carryre against another of them, whom he encountred
so puissantly, as the Knight breaking his Launce, <hi>Olorico</hi>
thrust his quite through his bodie, whereof <hi>Palmerin</hi> being
glad, said.</p>
                     <p>To the rest noble Prince, for wee are sure two of them
can doo vs no harme. With such courage did these Gallants
bestirre themselues, as in lesse space then halfe an howre,
sixe more of them were slaine: for <hi>Palmerin</hi> neuer gaue
stroke, but either he brake an arme, head, or necke. The two
which were left, séeing the hard fortune of their fellowes,
would bide no further daunger, but tooke themselues to
flight with all the spéede they could. When the Lady sawe
her selfe deliuered of her enemies, she came and humbled
her selfe at <hi>Palmerins</hi> féete, earnestly desiring him not to
leaue her, but that it would please him to conuay her to her
Castle néere at hand: whereuppon <hi>Vrbanillo</hi> alighting,
holpe her to mount on one of the vanquished Knights Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>

gaue her to a yong Gentleman his neighbour, who was a

displeasing to him that was refused, so that he brought nine

to take their leaue of the Ladies, to the no little gréefe
both of the one and the other. All this day they trauailed

                     <p>When they sawe that <hi>Palmerin</hi> slept, one of them
(fearing least the noyse of the Horses should awake him)
alighted, and drawing his Sword, came there with to haue
slaine him: but by good fortune there arriued a Knight, who
had béene hunting there about all that day, and hée cried to
him with his Sword drawne. Ah villaine, kill not the man
that sleepes. The Traitour séeing this new come Knight
so braue a person, beganne to be afraide, and therefore slept
backe again a little, at what time <hi>Palmerin,</hi> by the knights

the mortall stroke, was greatly amazed, sodainely draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his sword to defende himselfe, not hauing the leysure
to put on his Helmet, by which occasion he receiued a small
wound vpon his head. The Knight séeing the cowardly

himselfe so worthily among them, as hée that gaue the

and had brought their enemies into such danger, as they

would tende, gaue the spurs to theyr Horses, and galloped

                        </gap>rie. I
accept your offer gentle Sir, quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> with right
good will, as well to haue your friendly companie, as to
shéelde you from any other such like villanies, who happily
may séeke your harme for this noble fauour. So they rode
on altogether, <hi>Palmerin</hi> remembring the wordes of the
Fairie Ladie, and could not imagine who the knight should
be that had so honourably preserued his life: this made him
more to maruaile, that hée should be his enemie, whom (to
his remembrance) hee had neuer séene in any place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>To put him from these cogitations, <hi>Olorico</hi> ashamed
of his absence in such a néedfull time, came to <hi>Palmerin</hi>
with these words. Certes my noble Friende, I am hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
vnworthie to beare armes, séeing that in such daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
I left your companie: vnhappie that I am, might not
former experience teach me what sodaine aduentures doo
often happen to Knights errant? what punishment may
be sufficient for my hainous offence? Leaue such spéeches
to Women, quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> for if we kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>we before what
would happen afterward, neuer should we fall into any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences,
but it is sufficient that we haue so well esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and let God haue the glorie for so happie deliuerance.
By this time they were come to the Castle, and entring
the base Court, the Seruants came to take their Horses
to the stable: meane while the Knight himselfe went to
aduertise the lady of the other knights arriual, saying. Faire
<hi>Leonarda,</hi> I pray you vouchsafe the best honour and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
you can deuise, to two Gentlemen I haue héere
<pb facs="tcp:1616:263"/>
brought with me, for I imagine by their rich armes and
courtly behauiour, that either they are Princes, or discen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of very honorable parentage. Trust me my Lord, quoth
she, for your sake I will endeuor my selfe to welcome them
as they ought.</p>
                     <p>And comming into the hall to salute them, after many
courtesies deliuered on either side, the Lady séeing <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins</hi>
armour besmeared with bloud, by reason of the wound
he receiued on his hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, saide. I feare my Lord you are very
sore hurt, therefore the sooner it be séene to, the better ease
you shall finde. Héereupon her selfe holpe to vnarme him,
and afterward brought him into a goodly Chamber, where
when shee had staunched his bléeding, and bound vp the
wound, he was laide in a maruailous rich bedde prouided
for him, she promising within ten dayes and lesse to restore
him so well, as he would at pleasure trauaile without any
danger.</p>
                     <p>For this kindnesse <hi>Palmerin</hi> returned her many thanks,
and because hee might the better rest without distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
shée caused euerie one to depart the Chamber, her
selfe likewise courteously bidding him good night. <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
béeing alone, looked rounde about the Chamer, to sée if
by any armes of deuise, hée might knowe the Knight that
so happily deliuered him: at length, hard by his bed side he
espied the Shéeld of <hi>Frysol,</hi> with the Sunne painted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
which hee well remembred to be his deuise, whom for
<hi>Polynardaes</hi> loue he hated, according as you haue heard in
the former part of this Historie, which when he beheld, the
teares trickling down his chéekes, he thus began to himself.
I perceiue that the lady which saluted me on the mountaine
is of excellent knowledge, for though the Knight bee my
chéefest enemie, yet for the honorable kindnesse he hath this
day shewed me, I wil forget all former iniuries, and loue
him henceforth as hée were my brother, and what I could
neuer compasse by rigour and force of Armes, I will nowe
séeke to conquer by loue and courtesie. While he continued
<pb facs="tcp:1616:264"/>
these priuat spéeches, <hi>Frysoll</hi> opened the Chamber doore,
and entred to bid Sir <hi>Palmerin</hi> good night, who not a little
glad of his comming, said.</p>
                     <p>I pray you Sir knight, by the honourable loue you beare
to Chiualrie, to tell me your name, and if héeretofore you
were neuer in the Realme of <hi>England?</hi> My name, quoth the
Knight, which hitherto I neuer hid from any man, is <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soll,</hi>
and two yéeres I remained in the Realme you speake
of, with the Duke of <hi>Gaule</hi> in his Court. You rememb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

then a Knight, saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> with whom in lesse space
then twelue dayes together, you had two seuerall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats?
Uery true, quoth <hi>Frysoll,</hi> and some good reason I
haue to remember it, for the fight on my behalfe was so
dangerous, as but by the fauour of a Lady and a Squire,
I neuer had escaped with life. Nowe hast thou in thy cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie,
saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> the man that did thée such wrong, no
more an enemie, but for euer thy vowed, true, and trustie
Friend: and by the order I haue receiued, there is no man
this day liuing, that shall withdraw me from thy friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe,
because thou better deseruest it then any Knight in
the world.</p>
                     <p>And hath by my meanes, quoth <hi>Frysoll,</hi> the onely flower
of Chiualrie béene deliuered from death, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
hatred betwéene vs, vnited nowe with loue more
then brotherlike? in happie howre went I on hunting this
day, and fortune could neuer honour mée with more desired
successe. For confirmation of this new alliance, hee ranne
and called <hi>Leonarda, Olorico,</hi> and the rest, and before them
all kissed <hi>Palmerin</hi> in the Bedde, to seale the perpetuall
league of amitie betwéene them. Then was recounted
their aduentures and hatred past, whereat euery one great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maruailed, séeing this sodaine change to such surpassing
loue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Frysoll</hi> also rehearsed, how after the rape of <hi>Agriola,</hi>
the Duke <hi>Crenus</hi> his Lord, went to the Court, where hée
aduised the King to pursue his Daughter, or to sende him
<pb facs="tcp:1616:264"/>
in search of her, whereto he could not any way perswade
the King. Moreouer, howe his Maiestie would haue kept
him still in his seruice, whereto he might not graunt, for
the promise he made the Ladie that came thither, whome
after hée had brought to her Castle, hee trauailed by the
Emperour of <hi>Allemaignes</hi> Court, where hée certainely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
that <hi>Trineus</hi> and <hi>Agriola</hi> were not as yet there
arriued, nor could any newes bee heard what became of
them.</p>
                     <p>Yet during all these spéeches, he concealed all his owne
noble déeds of chiualrie in <hi>England, Allemaigne,</hi> and other
places: so vertuous and vebonarie was this gentle knight,
coueting in nothing to extoll himselfe. He forgot not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to report how that Lady cured him of a long and grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
disease, for which hée had so giuen himselfe to her ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
as for euer he vowed himself her knight. <hi>Palmerin</hi> not
a little contented with this discourse, said. I thinke the King
of <hi>England</hi> would not sennde his Shippes after his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
remembring her happinesse to come, béeing nowe the
espoused wife to Lord <hi>Trineus,</hi> and the honour thereof ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

béene alreadie séene, but that the tempest of the Sea was too
much their enemie. Then declared hée their troublesom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
time on the Sea, in what manner he lost them, and how he
now trauailed to finde them againe. Since fortune hath
so appointed (quoth <hi>Frysoll)</hi> that this loue and friendship
should bee begunne betwéene vs, to continue the same I
will beare you companie, and will not forsake you till yée
haue found them, may it like you to accept me for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</p>
                     <p>If it like mée? quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> you néede not doubt
thereof, and rather you then any man that I knowe, for
which noble kindnesse I thinke my selfe most fortunate. In
this manner beganne the concorde betwéene <hi>Palmerin</hi>
and <hi>Frysoll,</hi> which continued with vertuous and perfect
constancie, as in the Chapters following you shal perceiue.
Thus soiourned these Knights, there louingly togither, till

thou beene? what fortune hath kept thee so long from mee?
My déere Fréende, howe manie yrkesome thoughts haue I
endured, expecting thy comming? so that when I saw thou

<pb facs="tcp:1616:267"/>
depriued of my loue and honour of my life, I am fallen into
these miseries farre excéeding death: which Fortune I sée
hath permitted, because I am perswaded that thou must
deliuer me from all mishappes, and by thée shall I attaine
my chéefest desires. Ah happie and fortunate hower, well

                        </gap>raied thée
thus long, for very desirous am I to knowe them. <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
was so gréeued to sée him in such weake &amp; sicklie estate,
as hée could hardlie make any aunswere, yet striuing with
himselfe, said.</p>
                     <p>My noble Lord, the time requireth now other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
héereafter shall I tell you the whole discourse. Graunt
mée I beséeche you, without further intreating, that I may
enter the Combat in your name, against one of those Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
who haue accused you: for such is my hope in God,
that I shall spéede luckilie, and bring him to the end such a
villaine deserues. With all my heart, quoth the Prince I
am contented, assuring my successe so well in your vertues,
as if fiue hundred of my Knights did enter the fielde for mée.
And to the ende that without feare or doubt you maye take
my cause in hand, I sweare to you by the liuing God, that
since <hi>Tarsius</hi> espoused <hi>Griana,</hi> I neuer sawe her, till when
the King came and found me with her: which was so short
a time, as she had not the leysure to make mée any answer.
True it is that I kild the King: but howe? I did it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
hée was mine enemie, and abused my Lady and lawful
wife. What though they were espoused togither? the
mariage was not to be allowed, in that it was doone against
her will: she béeing (as I haue said) my Wife, by solemne
spéeches before God married to me. It suffiseth, said <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
I haue enough. You shall likewise vnderstande my
Lord, that I haue brought with me another Knight, who
will gladlie aduenture the Combate on the Quéenes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
<pb facs="tcp:1616:267"/>
and such a one he is, as the other accuser will scant
dare to stande against him: wherefore let mée intreate you
to comfort your selfe, expecting our happy and fortunate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Florendos</hi> falling on his knée, gaue thanks to Heauen
for this luckie euent, and hauing an indifferent while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
togither: after <hi>Palmerin</hi> had aduertised <hi>Frenato,</hi>
of his Sonne <hi>Ptolomes</hi> health, and that in short time hee
had good hope to finde him, he returned to the Emperour,
to whome making great reuerence, he saide. Now my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Lorde, I come to vnderstand your answer. I pray you
sir Knight quoth the Emperour, holde me excused, if I haue
not welcommed you, as your nobilitie, bountie and highe
Chiualrie deserueth: but after the Combat is ended, which
for my part I graunt ye, what hath wanted now shall bée
supplyed, so that your selfe shall rest contented. I thanke
your Maiestie for this extraordinarie fauour, said <hi>Palmerin,</hi>
and séeing the Prince hath committed his cause to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
I beséech you send for the Kings Nephewes, that
the appointed daye may not bee preuented by any further
delayes. And if the Quéene your Daughter be not prouided
of a Champion, this Knight (poynting to <hi>Frysoll,</hi> my vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Fréende and companion, shall vndertake her cause, in
that he came hither for no other businesse: and such good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
haue I made of his valour and hardinesse, as if by
knightlie Chiualrie her right may be defended, assure your
selfe my Lord, this is the man. I thinke, said the Emperor,
she is not as yet determined of anie one, albeit full manie
haue made offer of themselues: and for wee will expect no
further, this Knight shall be preferred before all that come.
I humbly thanke your Maiestie for this fauour, aunswered
<hi>Frysoll:</hi> yet would I bee loth to presume too farre, before
I vnderstand the Quéenes pleasure. The Emperour cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him to be conducted to the Quéenes Chamber, and his
two companions with him, who desired to sée the Ladies:
where béeing entred, <hi>Frysoll</hi> humbly vpon his knée, began
<pb facs="tcp:1616:268"/>
in this manner. Right noble and excellent Quéene, so far
through Christendome, is spread the report of your rare
vertuous and integritie of life, especially your innocencie in
the crime wherewith you are accused: as from farre Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes
I am come to be your Knight, if you will vouchsafe
me such honour as to accept me. Assuring you, that vnder
your commaundement, and in the companie of my noble
Fréend, who vndertakes the Combat for my Lord <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi>
right willing am I to aduenture life and credit. Alas
Gentle Knight, quoth the Quéene, this offer procéedeth from
your courtesie and bountie, not by any vertue on my parte
deseruing: for too contrarie hath Fortune euermore sette
her selfe against me. But verie ingratefull might I bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted,
and neuer be reckoned among Ladies of regard, if
hauing taken such paines for me, I shoulde not accept you
for my Knight, especiallie in so vrgent occasion. Therefore
I entertaine you into this seruice, and I desire of God, that
you may be as easilie deliuered from the charge you take in
hand for me, as my conscience is cléere from the faulte wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I am accused.</p>
                     <p>I hope Madame quoth <hi>Frysoll,</hi> that my Lord your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall ere long perceiue, your loyall, perfect, and pure
nobilite, which neuer can kéepe companie with seruile an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
detestable treason. All this while <hi>Palmerin</hi> beholding the
Quéene, séeing her swéete face so stained and blubbered with
teares: mooued with naturall remorse, was constrained to
turne his head aside, to hide the teares that trickled down his
chéekes.</p>
                     <p>The Quéene likewise regarded him so earnestlye, as
when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he behelde him wéepe, she imagined that one gaue
a violent pull at her heart: which shee dissembled so well as
she could, determining not to demand the cause thereof, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
such time as the Combatte were finished. So taking
their leaue of the Quéene and the Princesse <hi>Armida,</hi> they
returned to their lodging till the next morning, when the
Emperour sending for them to the Pallace, where <hi>Promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taleon</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:1616:268"/>
and <hi>Oudin</hi> staied their comming, the Emperour
himselfe thus began. Now <hi>Promptaleon,</hi> héere maist thou
behold two yong Knights, who speake the contrarie of that
thou hast reported: wilt thou yet maintaine that my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath committed treason, and hath béene disloyall to her
Husband, thy deceased Unckle? I will my Lorde, quoth
he, and sweare by my Baptisme, for that cause she shal die
the death: and if anie dare vndertake the contrarye, I am
readie to prooue it by force of Armes. I thinke it conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
said <hi>Palmerin,</hi> my Good Lord, that no Combat should
be graunted, without the presence of the accused. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atelie
<hi>Florendos</hi> and <hi>Griana</hi> were sent for, and being come
before the Emperour, <hi>Palmerin</hi> said to the Prince? How
saye you, my Lorde, doo you permit in maintenance of your
right, that I giue these false accusers such discipline, as
their wicked and treacherous dealings deserue? I doo, (quoth
the Prince) and Heauen prosper thée in thine enterprise.
What saye you Madame, quoth <hi>Frysoll</hi> to the Quéene, doo
you affoorde the like to me? Shee aunswered as <hi>Florendos</hi>
before had doone, whereuppon <hi>Palmerin</hi> thus spake to the
accusers.</p>
                     <p>We two Knights will maintaine, that you both are
Traitours, and that by couetous and gréedie desire of rule,
and to enioy the Kingdome, you woulde (against all right)
disinherit the yong Princesse <hi>Armida:</hi> for which cause you
haue shamefullie accused the Quéene her Mother, to haue
committed murder, and more then that, charge her with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall
lubricitie. For if the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> talked with
her, when the King founde him in her Chamber: it was in
no other sort then honor allowed, and according to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of honest loue, wherein all Princes are bounde to their
Ladies. Beside, if your King was slaine by the Prince, if
was in defence of his owne life, and in repelling the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
spéeches he gaue him: to approoue what I say, wée
present our gadges to the Emperour, so please him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
them. The like did the too Brethren, desiring his
<pb facs="tcp:1616:269"/>
highnesse to appoint the Combat presentlie, in the wide and
necessarie place before the Pallace. For (quoth they) wée
will teache these vaine-glorious Strangers, the price of such
iniurious spéeches, spoken to those that know how to correct
them.</p>
                     <p>I thinke (quoth <hi>Palmerin)</hi> thou shalt néede to teache
thy selfe: but if thou hast learned anie newe dexteritie,
practise it well thou art best, for I can tell thée the time
will require it. The good Emperour <hi>Remicius</hi> commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
silence, and taking the gadges of these foure Knights,
bad them goe arme themselues, saying hée woulde sée the
ende thereof before he tooke any sustenaunce. The Duke
of <hi>Mensa,</hi> and the Counte of <hi>Redona,</hi> auncient Princes of
<hi>Greece,</hi> were appointed to bee Iudges of the Fielde: who
commaunded two hundred knights to Arme themselues, for
assurance of their owne persons.</p>

The Duke of <hi>Mecaena,</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
<pb facs="tcp:1616:269"/>
prince, discended of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> most ancient race in al <hi>Greece,</hi>
with many other great Lords went after them: and when
they were Armed, the Duke would néedes beare <hi>Palmerins</hi>
Launce, and the graund Squire attending on the Emperor,
caried <hi>Frysols.</hi> In this maner came they to the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the Combat, where the two Brethren were alreadie
staying for them, the eldest thus beginning in mockage. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue
mée Knights, for men that shewed themselues so hardie
in a Hall, mée thinks you haue béene very long Arming your
selues.</p>
                     <p>I thinke you came on your footcloth Mules to the Fields
entraunce, for feare of felling to hurt your selues: but soone
shall ye be taught better horsemanshippe I warrant ye. If
there were in thée so much wisdome and exercise of Armes,
aunswered <hi>Frysoll,</hi> as are high words and brauing behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
it would bée a little better discerned then it is: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
ere wee haue doone, I thinke they that came first
into the Fielde will tarrie last héere, vnlesse some bodie
for pittie carrie them out before. Héerewith the Trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
sounded, and the Heraldes commaunded the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
to doo their deuoire, which was the cause, that
these hotte words were chaunged into déedes: and running
fiercelie against eache other, they encountred with such pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issaunce,
as <hi>Palmerin</hi> cast <hi>Oudin</hi> foorth of his saddle, with
a verie great wound on his left side, and <hi>Promptaleon</hi> was
receiued by <hi>Frysoll</hi> so roughlie, as he fell backwarde on the
crupper of his Horse, because hée was lothe his Brother
should fall without companie. The two Brethren, enraged
to bée thus foyled at the first, came with their swords drawn
to kill their aduersaries Horsses: so that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
quicklie to alight, when they assayled each other
with meruailous furie, for either side expected victorie, the
one in hope of a kingdome, the other to saue their Freends
liues.</p>
                     <p>Strange was it so beholde this violent fight, yet the
two Brethren seemed vnable long to holde out, for theyr
<pb facs="tcp:1616:270"/>
Armor was so cut and mangled, and themselues so driuen
foorth of breath, as hardly they coulde sustaine themselues:
so that <hi>Promptaleon</hi> desired <hi>Frysoll</hi> to rest a while, who
mooued with anger, thus aunswered. Nay Traytor, now
shall I teach thée how to defende thy selfe, and not one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
will I graunt thee to trauerse with mée: but will send
thy soule to the Father of thy villaine, vnlesse with spéede
thou denie thy slaunder. With these words he laid so many
sounde strokes on him, as at length hee fell downe deade at
his féete, which when <hi>Oudin</hi> perceiued: hee threwe his
Sworde at <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and caught him fast about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
thinking that way to get him downe, but <hi>Palmerin</hi>
striking away his féet, caused him fal on his backe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
attending for his reuolt, noblye stroke his head from his
shoulders.</p>
                     <p>So comming to <hi>Frysol,</hi> he asked if he were wounded.
No my Lord (quoth he) I thanke God, the greatest wound
I haue cannot with-holde me to doo you further seruice, if
so be you haue anie néede. Then putting vp their Swords,
they demaunded of the Iudges, if any thing else remained
to be doone, for deliueraunce of the prisoners. Nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Lords, answered the Iudges, and them will the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
nowe deliuer, with all possible spéede. The good
<hi>Remicius</hi> heartilie thanking God for his victorie, sente a
Knight to the Champions, with request to come and lodge
in his Pallace, as also that they should presently come speake
with his Maiestie: yet could not the Messenger make such
haste, but they were come foorth of the Fielde, the Duke of
<hi>Mecaena</hi> and the Prince <hi>Olorico</hi> bearing them compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</p>
                     <p>When the Knight had ouertaken them, hée saide. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
woorthie Knightes to my Lord the Emperour, for hee
would conferre with you, and haue your wounds attended

they entred the Hall, where the Emperour méeting them,
said. Right welcome are ye my noble Fréendes, who hau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so happilie defended my Daughters honor: for whose sake
I shall make ye such recompence, as shalbe hencefoorth an
encouragement to all Knights, to aduenture the Combat
on the behalfe of anie distressed Ladye Imediatlye in theyr
presence, by sounde of Trompet hée caused to bee declared,
that the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> and the Quéene <hi>Griana,</hi> were
innocent of the trayterous accusation, and therefore in open
Fielde bad they should bee deliuered: commaunding like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
his most expert Chirurgions to giue diligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce
on the wounded Knights, causing them to be lodged
in the most statelie Chambers of his Pallace. Afterwarde,
hée suffered the bodies of the vanquished to bee buried, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
expresse charge on paine of death, that none of the
knights of <hi>Hungaria</hi> should depart from <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
without his leaue: because hée woulde while they stayed
there, prouide for the gouernment of the kingdom, as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to his yong Daughter the Princesse <hi>Armida.</hi> The
Empresse was so ioyfull for the deliueraunce of <hi>Griana,</hi>
as shee had soone forgotte her Nephewes misfortune: the
Quéenes Ladies likewise were not a little glad, but aboue
all, the yong Princesse <hi>Armida,</hi> her comfort could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
that her Mother was so graciouslie defended: and
now the Duke of <hi>Pera,</hi> who hadde the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> in
custodie, fetching him foorth of prison, said. My Lord thanke
God and the Knights that fought the Combat for you: for
by theyr meanes the Emperour declareth you absolued and
set at libertie.</p>
                     <p>The Prince lifting his eyes to Heauen, thus began.
Ah my God, how happie is the man that trusteth in thy
mercie? doubtlesse, he that beléeueth in thy promises, shall
neuer perish. Noble Duke, in all mine afflictions I haue
euermore founde your speciall fauour: but if God prolong
my life, I will not be vnmindfull of your gentlenesse. In sooth
my Lord, quoth the Duke, for so good a Prince, any honest
minde would gladlie endeuour himselfe: and if I haue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
you in anie thing, I did no more then my dutye,
<pb facs="tcp:1616:271"/>
which christian amitie requireth of each other. So taking
him by the hand, hée brought him before the Emperour,
when falling on his knées, the Prince thus spake. If héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
dread Lord, both I and my people gaue our selues to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rauaile, and aduentured desperate hazard in your defence:
at this time I count my selfe sufficientlie recompenced, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your displeasure qualified, and the hard opinion you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
against me, chaunged into princely and honorable iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
                     <p>Syr <hi>Florendos,</hi> aunswered the Emperour, when I
remember the wrong you did my Daughter, leauing such a
scandalous report of her, at the first time you came to this
Cittie, I thinke you woorthie of the sharpest death. But
placing mercie before rigorous iustice, I am desirous to let
you knowe, that it liketh me better to be loued then feared:
forgetting quite the offence against our person, the murder
of our Sonne, without any regard to the murmur of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whose ignoraunce cannot consider of Princes mercie.
Nor will I stayne mine aged yéeres with mine owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
bloud, or the death of a Prince so noble, whereby I
shoulde leaue to my following posteritie, as a Trophe of my
life, an endlesse memorie of tirannous crueltie: but rather
shall my chéefest aduersaries stop their mouthes, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of my clemencie and princelie bountie, as your
owne conscience shall well witnesse with me. You therefore
my Lorde, the Duke of <hi>Pera,</hi> see that the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi>
be lodged in the best place in our Cittie, and kéepe him
companie vntill his traine shall come from <hi>Macedon.</hi> With
great humilitie the Prince kissed the Emperours hande,
acknowledging his manifolde and princelie courtesies: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
the Duke likewise before his departure, that hee
might speake with the two Knightes, <hi>Frysoll</hi> and <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Béeing brought to their Chambers, the embracings
and gracious courtesies hée vsed to them, I am not able to
vtter, and verie loth was hee to parte from them, but that
<pb facs="tcp:1616:271"/>
hée woulde no way preiudise theyr health: wherefore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
them the good night, he was conducted to his lodging,
leauing <hi>Palmerin</hi> verie sadde and pensiue, remembring
what the Quéene of <hi>Tharsus</hi> had saide to him, howe hée
should deliuer his Father from death, before he could know
him, which was likewise confirmed by the apparition of
the Ladie to him, vnder the name of his best and déerest
Fréendes.</p>
                     <p>O that the Heauens did so fauour me, quoth he, that I
were the Sonne of the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> and Quéene <hi>Griana,</hi> then woulde I imagine my selfe the happiest man in
the world. Yet can I not forget, that the Fayries tolde mée
on the Mountaine <hi>Artifaeria,</hi> that one daie I shoulde bée
Lord of all <hi>Greece:</hi> but God is my witnesse, that I couet
not such honor and preferment, were it not for the loue of my
Ladie, to the ende her Father might not dislike of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.
And hence will I not depart before I vnderstand the
truth héereof, and to what ende this aduenture will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
<hi>Frysoll</hi> on the other side, he deuised how to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

                     <p>Alas Daughter, aunswered the Quéene, hast thou the

breaking foorth in teares, replied. Beléeue me Madame,
if you remember your selfe well, you are in as little faulte
as Iam, and so hath an honorable victorie declared: but
had you béene anye way culpable therein, yet nowe you
ought to comfort your selfe, hauing had such a famous proofe
of innocencie. In signe whereof, and to declare your thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
to those gentle Knights: it will bée counted a speciall

greatlie thanking him for the paines hée had taken, putting

The Quéene then sitting downe in a Chaire by him, and
viewing him verie earnestly, his lockes of haire kept down
by a gorgious wrought Cap, embroidered with Saphires

                     <p>Madame, I sweare to you by my faith, that I knowe
no Ladie this day liuing, to whom I woulde willinglie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale
more then to your selfe: but so contrarie was For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to mée in mine infancie, that as yet I could not get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
knowledge either of my Father or Mother, nor of the
Countrey where I was borne. Yet thus I haue beene certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that I was nourished on a Mountaine not farre from
this Citie, which is called the Mount of Oliues, where (as
I haue béene many times tolde) my Foster-father founde
mée in rich swadling cloathes: and more then this, so please
you to credite mée, cannot I bewray of whence or what I
am.</p>
                     <p>O heauens (quoth the Quéene) how greatly am I bound
to prayse your infinite bountie and pittie, for so safe protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
mine infant, whom I forsooke so cruelly? Ah gentle
Knight, sée héere thy Mother, euen shee that commaunded
thou shouldest bée caried to the Mountaine: and the Prince
<hi>Florendos,</hi> whom so lately thou diddest deliuer from death,
hée (noble <hi>Palmerin)</hi> is thy Father. Norwithstanding my
Sonne, I desire thee by the reuerent loue thou bearest mée,
to conceale secretlie what I haue sayde, vntill I gaine the
meane to discouer my shame to the Emperour: yet such a
shame, as neuer came greater good to thy Mother: nor can
I nowe account the déede sinfull, in that my fortune hath
brought mée such an honourable Sonne. So rauished with
ioy was both the Mother and the Sonne, as neither coulde
expresse their inward contentation, for such was their alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
as they reputed for an illusion or dreame, what was
most certaine indéed: such wonderfull comfort brought this

of honour or riches may not bee compared. Béeing in this

sayd.</p>
                     <p>My God I render thy name immortall thanks, in that

before he had first solemnly vowed marriage to mée, which
against all right was broken by the Emperours commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
                     <p>Madame, quoth <hi>Palmerin, Florendos</hi> is of such valour,
and his honorable actions so well receiued among men, that
albeit he had made you no such promise, yet reason may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
you in this matter. But if by promised faith, and to
saue the life of so gentle a Knight (who happilie by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall
might haue miscaried) you honoured the Temple of
Loue with so swéete an offering: among people of good
minde, it ought rather to bée tearmed a vertue, then anie

priuate agréement, because I doubt the Prince of <hi>Fraunce,</hi>
whose Ambassadours haue béene there to conferre on the

In like manner, if <hi>Netrides</hi> shall be founde to bee made
King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and the Princesse <hi>Armida</hi> to be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     <p>So God helpe me my Sonne, quoth the Emperour, no

Notwithstanding, before you begin your iourney, you shall

iudge may bee equalled with the burthen of mine offence.
Neuerthelesse, if you estéeme not your selfe satisfied, let
your noble regarde excuse what nature hath perfected,
which is, to endure much more then as yet wee haue done.
Madame, answered <hi>Florendos,</hi> in time of ioy remember
not our passed misfortunes, but thinke what now is doone,
our gracious starres haue graciously furthered and limitted
to this end, that my loyaltie, with the bountie and prowesse
of our sonne, should be laid open to euerie iudgement. Héere
had the Prince occasion to rehearse his afflictions in loue,

take him home with thée to thy house? Ah mistresse, quoth
the good old man, you haue killed my heart in remembring
me of him, whom I loued déerer then any of mine owne.
The infant of whom you speake, I founde not farre hence
vnder a Palme Trée, for which cause at his Baptisme I
named him <hi>Palmerin.</hi> From that time forwarde, I nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
him as hée had béene mine owne Sonne, till hée rame
to tall stature, and as he grew in yéeres, so did hee in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and noble qualities, which made him not a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
in these parts, for when hee attended my Cattell,
he tooke pleasure to course the Wolfe, Hart, Beare, Bore,

which none of mine owne Children durst at any time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture.</p>
                     <p>Ah swéete Mistresse, when I remember his many ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices,

in courtesie and nobilitie of heart, louingly welcommed
<hi>Marcella,</hi> and her daughter <hi>Dyofena,</hi> walking along with

him, commaunding them to bee brought to his daughters
Chamber, who entertained them verie graciously: but
when they came to vnfold <hi>Palmerins</hi> little pack of cloathes,
hardly can you imagine the inwarde ioyes of the Mother.
For <hi>Tolomestra</hi> well knew the Scarlet mantle, which her
selfe had all embroydered with curious knots of Gold, and
all the other prettie trinkets, saying. Doubtlesse Madame,
it cannot bée but that <hi>Palmerin</hi> is your Sonne: for well I

she made her one of the Ladies of her Chamber, and gaue
<hi>Dyofena</hi> a worthie dowrie to her marriage. As for <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rad</hi>
himselfe, the Emperor made him one of his chéefest Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
and dubbed his Sonnes Knights, who proued after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of hardie courage, as héereafter in the Historie you
may perceiue. This done, the Emperour brought <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi>
and <hi>Palmerin</hi> into his Treasurie, saying. My friends,
take, beare away, all is yours, dispose thereof as you please:
furnish your selues with all néedefull thinges, against the
day of my Daughters marriage. Giue bountifully to the
poore Knights, that they may likewise prepare themselues
in readinesse, all which will redound to your perpetuall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>In sooth my Lord, answered <hi>Florendos,</hi> it is against
all equitie and reason, that during your life I should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
so farre: well worthie were I of the sharpest repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
to vsurpe that, which by right appertaines to him
who gaue me life and honour. When the Emperour sawe
hée coulde not perswade them, hée sent a sumpter Horsse
loaden with Golde, to the Prince <hi>Olorico</hi> and <hi>Erysoll:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
diuers other Iewels of inestimable value, that they
might the better furnish their estate, against the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Prince. On which day, these two
Knights determined a Tryumyhe at Armes, for the loue
of their friende and companion <hi>Palmerin:</hi> who the same

Upon this occasion, and by his highnesse commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Heraldes were sent abroad to publish the Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
which should endure tenne dayes togither: with the

deuising with his Daughter: and setting his knée to the

by the consent of all the Princes of the Empire, and
Sir <hi>Palmerin</hi> your Sonne shall be Emperour, after the

                        <pb facs="tcp:1616:283"/>
olde and decrepite, was so surprised with these newes,
as he imagined he heard some fantastical illuding voice, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then matter of trueth and certaintie: with which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
oppressing conceite, his weake estate not able to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it selfe, béeing ouercome with ioy, doubt and suspition,
as hardly could <hi>Arismena</hi> his Daughter kéepe life in him,
so often hee swouned with hearing this reporte, yet at
length taking the Knight by the hande, he sayde. My good
Fréend, God I trust will blesse thée with honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie,
for bringing mee the tidings I haue long desired.
Nowe may I well say, that neuer anie Princes age was
more beautified with happinesse, then mine is, hauing my
Sonne allyed in such an house, and another Sonne excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
all the Knights in the worlde. But if the Heauens
vouchsafe me so much grace and fauour, that I may once
sée him before I ende this life, it will be such sufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to mée, as then I force not though I liue no longer.
Then calling for one of his Secretaries, to reade the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
his sonne had sent him, and hauing heard the contents

hée entreated to come and sée him, gaue them to the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger,
and withall such an honourable gift for his paynes,
as well might content a greater personage. He returning
to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> effectually discharged his aunswere: and

take theyr leaue of the King, who began to them in this
manner. Ah, my good Fréends, God is my witnesse, with
what good will I would beare you companie, if my aged
<pb facs="tcp:1616:284"/>
yéeres did not forbid me: neuerthelesse, let mée desire yée to
behaue your selues in such sort, as if I were in person with
ye, and honour Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> no lesse then my selfe. So
creating the Duke of <hi>Pontus</hi> his Lieutenant in this Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassade,

bequeathed them to happie Fortune in their iourney, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
a Knight to poste before them, that <hi>Palmerin</hi>
might be first aduertised of their comming. On the same
day as they should arriue at the Cittie, <hi>Palmerin</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied,
with the yong King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> the most subtill and

other yong Princes and Knights, rode to méete the Lords
of <hi>Macedon,</hi> at the Gates of the Citie. There alighted all
the Lords to kisse his hand, which hée woulde not permit
them to doo: but casting himselfe likewise from his Horse,
embraced them all one after another. And mounting on
horsebacke againe, entered the Cittie, which was so plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
stored with Knights and gentlemen against the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph:
as the Prince <hi>Olorico</hi> and <hi>Frysoll</hi> were appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Emperour, to sée the Lords lodged according to
their estate, and to erect Tents and Pauillions without the
Cittie, where the rest of their traine might be decently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained.</p>
                     <p>This choyse made the Emperour of these twaine in
this matter, because in all his Court were not two more
courteous Princes: beside, they were the onely men in the
worlde, for affable and gracious entertaining straungers.
All this businesse ended, and <hi>Palmerin</hi> deuising with the
Quéene his Mother, <hi>Frysoll</hi> béeing in his companie, sawe

as yet in all my life I neuer requested any thing of a

Ladie, and now would I gladly moue one sute to you, (as to
her that is the onely Mistresse of my heart) if I should not
séeme ouer-bold in this petition: assuring you, that hauing
obtained this fauour of you, you shall not commaunde anie
thing, how difficult so euer it bée, but I will gladlie enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
it for your sake. Beléeue me, Sir <hi>Frysoll,</hi> aunswered
the Princesse, you speake but reason, demaunde then what
you please, and you shall obtaine it: because I holde this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion

good Madame, said <hi>Frysoll,</hi> this houre I hope hath boaded
mée good fortune, and this is my request, that you would so
much honor me, as to permit me enter the Tourney vnder

                     <p>In sooth my Lord, neuer was I mooued with any such sute
héeretofore: but my Brother may so farre commaund mee,
as what liketh him I would be loth to gain-say. As for your
demaund, to enter the field vnder the name of my Knight,
with right good will I graunt it: assuring you thereof with
this Iewell, which henceforth so please you to weare, shall
remaine as a token of my loue to you. So taking a goodly
Emeralde from her finger, kissing it, with great courtesie
gaue it him. Nowe am I sure Madame, quoth <hi>Frysoll,</hi> to
haue part of the prize, séeing I shall aduenture in your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice:
nor is this ring of so little value, but when in the

Combat I shall behold it, my forces will be redoubled, and
newe life enter my fainting spirit. Moreouer I dare say,
that neuer did the Ring of <hi>Giges</hi> bring him more honour,
then this will to mée: for his could not profite or aduantage
him, but onely by béeing inuisible. On the contrary, I haue
no pleasure but in your presence, nor shall I thinke my selfe
at better ease, then when among Launces and Swordes I
may labour for your loue. Then entred the Empresse, with
other Ladies newlie come to the Court to sée the Iousts:

of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> and the sodaine death of her Husband the

renowne liues as wel in Heathenesse as in Christendome,
<pb facs="tcp:1616:286"/>
béeing now found Sonne to my Lord the Emperour, and
therefore created sole heyre to the Empire. And the noble

maiestie, béeing the Lord to whom he is most affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in seruice, so that to finde out your Sonne <hi>Trineus</hi> and
the faire <hi>Agriola</hi> Daughter of <hi>England,</hi> whom two yéeres
since and more hee lost in the East Seas: he abandoneth all
honorable preferments, vntill his trauaile shall be finished:
and he hath brought him hither before your highnesse. And
hauing alreadie searched in many Kingdomes, at length
hée vnderstood that they were liuing and in health, also that
himselfe should in the ende recouer them, hée thought it
necessarie to acquaint you herewith, because he doubted of
your extreame sorrow and heauinesse. The Emperor asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
to heare the good fortune of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> as also the losse
of his Sonne <hi>Trineus,</hi> could not subdue his passions, which
mooued the teares to trickle downe his chéekes, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of ioy and gréefe together: yet shadowing his altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so well as he could, thus replyed. In truth my Lorde
Ambassadour, I alwaies imagined by <hi>Palmerins</hi> woorthie
actions, that he was discended of noble or royall linage, and
greatly it contenteth me, that he so happily hath founde the
house of his discent, expelling altogether (considering his
promise and prowesse) what hath béene long imprinted in
my heart, considering the losse of my Sonne <hi>Trineus.</hi> For
so fauourable are the heauens to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> in all his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises
and admirable aduentures, as one may imagine, that
déeds of honor and account are reserued onely for him, chéefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the recouerie of my Sonne, which I hope hee will effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
bring to passe. And trust me, not without great and
sufficient reason, doth the Emperour your Maister repute
himselfe happie: this onely good fortune béeing of force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to discharge his mind of all sorrowes and cares, that
former occasions mooued him with all. Now know I howe
to recompence his princely kindnesse, honoring me with so
good and happy tidings, but that it may please him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb facs="tcp:1616:286"/>
of mee héereafter, as his louing Brother and faithfull
Friend. No other thing my Lord (quoth the Duke) dooth
his Maiestie desire, and to beginne this amitie and alliance
betwéene you, hee requesteth that if his Sonne <hi>Palmerin</hi>
hath héeretofore founde such fauour in your eyes, you would
now confirme it, by giuing him to wife the Princesse <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynarda</hi>
your Daughter, whom he will not marrie vntill he
haue brought home your Sonne <hi>Trineus.</hi> As for the other
conuentions of the marriage, this Letters shall certifie you:
so kissing them, hée deliuered them with very great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                     <p>And her shall he haue with right good will, sayde the
Emperour, for a fitter husband can shée not haue: I thinke
likewise her selfe will consent thereto, for the good opinion
she had of him while he remained in our Court. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I will not displease the King of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> who in like
manner requesteth her for his Sonne and heyre, I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
with the estates of the Empire, and then deliuer you
certaine answere. So the Ambassadours withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to their lodgings, and the Emperor caused the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to bee read before all his Princes and Lordes, who
could no way mislike of this marriage, and therefore great
ioy was made through the Empire, in hope the Prince
<hi>Trineus</hi> should soone be recouered. These ioyfull newes
soone spreading through the Court, at length were brought
to the Princesse <hi>Polinarda</hi> in her Chamber, who not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to conceale her sodaine ioy, ranne to <hi>Bryonella,</hi> saying.
Swéete friende, nowe maist thou reioyce with me, in that

our long desired fortune. God graunt it may be so,
quoth <hi>Bryonella,</hi> yet my minde perswades mee that wée
shall not sée them so soone as you wéene. The Emperour
hauing conferred with the Lorde of <hi>Allemaigne,</hi> who very
well allowed the marriage of his daughter with <hi>Palmerin:</hi>
determined to send to the Emperor of <hi>Constantinople</hi> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours,
for perfect confirmation of the marriage. And by
generall consent, the Duke of <hi>Lorrayne</hi> and the Marquesse
of <hi>Licena,</hi> were chosen for this present Embassage. Which
being doone, the Emperour went to the Empresse Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and sent for his Daughter <hi>Polynarda,</hi> who was so ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of these happie newes, as she could scant imagine how
to dissemble her content, when shee should come in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
presence, yet shadowing it from any open suspect, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shee had saluted her Father with great reuerence, the
Emperour, thus spake.</p>
                     <p>Daughter, you haue hitherto refused so many noble
offers, as hardly can I permitte to mooue you with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
yet once more will I trie you againe, in hope you will
stand vpon no more refusals, but ioyne with me in opinion,
as beyonde all other best beséemes you. The man of whom
I speake, is noble <hi>Palmerin,</hi> of whose honourable behauiour
you haue some knowledge, and for no other cause hath the
Emperour sent his Ambassadours, aduise your selfe then
what you answere, for all our nobilitie allow the match, and
thereto haue generally subscribed their consent. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
couering her inwarde ioy with modest bashfulnesse,
thus answered.</p>
                     <p>If héeretofore my good Lorde, I excused my obeysance
to your commandement, especially for taking a husband,
it was onely for the promise I made to my Brother <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus:</hi>
but nowe seeing it is your pleasure, and the good ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of al the estates, as also that the marriage shall not be
<pb facs="tcp:1616:287"/>
solemnized till my Brothers presence: I will not disobey
your commaund, assuring your Maiestie, that more content
am I to match with him, then any other you named here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.
And this one speciall cause, that he laboureth to bring
home my noble Brother, which Heauen graunt hee may:
otherwise can I not marry, without verie great impeach to
mine honour.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour well perceiued by the grace of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
and her countenance nowe nothing sadoe or melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chollie,
that shee was nothing offended with this motion,
wherfore he said. Happie may I count my selfe faire daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that among all the Christian Princes you haue chosen
such a Husband: therefore apparrell your selfe to morrow
in the best sort you may, for then shall my Lordes the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours
see you. So departed the Princesse to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and no more spéeches were vsed till the next day, when
the Emperour sent for the Ambassadours of <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
and in the presence of the principall estate of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
ratefied the mariage betwéen <hi>Palmerin</hi> and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And for further confirmation thereof, promised to send
his owne Ambassadours with them, to satisfie (on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe)
the Emperour, <hi>Florendos</hi> and <hi>Palmerin.</hi> For which
excéeding gentlenesse, the Duke of <hi>Mec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ena</hi> (in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
name) thanked his Maiestie, earnestly entreating
him to dispatch them thence so soone as might bee, because
their charge was to returne with all possible spéede. This
resolution absolutely sette downe, the Emperour (for the
greater honour) caused them to dine with him at his owne
Table, and grace being said by the Lord Almoner, the Duke
of <hi>Mecana</hi> desired his Maiestie, that hée might sée the
Princesse <hi>Polynarda:</hi> whereof hée made promise so soone
as Dinner was done, when taking the Duke of <hi>Mecaena</hi>
by the one hande, and the Countie of <hi>Reifort</hi> by the other,
brought them to the Empresse Chamber, where they founde
the Princesse in such sumptuous ornaments, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with such rare grace and exquisite beautie, as they
<pb facs="tcp:1616:288"/>
iudged her rather an Angell then anie earthly creature.
And greatly was the Duke abashed at such a singular spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle,
not knowing how to frame his opinions: but hauing
humbly saluted the Empresse, came to the Princesse, and

Let it not displease ye faire Madame, that I vse this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

                     <p>By this meane hée secretly conueyed <hi>Palmerins</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into her hande, for which the Princesse gaue him many
deuout thankes, which were coupled with such magesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
gestures, as neither to <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Galba</hi> were done the
like, no not by <hi>Constantine</hi> himself to the Pope. And though
the Dukes words had raised a swéete blush in her chéekes,
yet could she with such choyse answeres excuse the same, as
gaue greater countenaunce to all her behauiour. Then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Duke to the Emperour, and smiling, saide. Trust
me my Lord, nowe doo I verely beléeue what hath hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bene told me of the Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> that hée is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall
Iudge of the beautie of Ladies, for in mine opinion,
hée hath chosen one without a second: and of her may truly
be affirmed, what the Poets described of <hi>Helena,</hi> tearming
her the Goddesse of beautie. With this rare Princesse to
be matched an Husband so famous, well may be saide, the
couple to be without compare: for the faire formed <hi>Paris</hi>
may not be equalled with <hi>Palmerin.</hi> So the Ambassadours
departing, the Princesse withdrewe her selfe to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where reading her friends Letter, her ioyes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
redoubled, because shée might now boldly credite her
fortune.</p>
                     <p>And before she would forget the inuention her spirite of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hée presently wrote an answere: earnestly entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him to hasten his returne, to abreuiate her languishing
desires, which nowe made her life but a shadow of death.
Hauing close sealed her Letter, shée sent it to the Duke by
<pb facs="tcp:1616:288"/>
one of her most trustie Ladies, with diuers other rich gifts
and presentes. The Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> and his companie

and weather seruing so well, they arriued at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
the day before <hi>Florendo's</hi> his nuptialls. Newes being
brought héereof to the Courte, <hi>Palmerin</hi> accompanied with
many Princes and Knightes, went to the Hauen, and at
the landing of the Ambassadours, <hi>Palmerin</hi> embraced the
Duke of <hi>Lorr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the Pallace, beguiled the time with diuers discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
where among, the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> thus spake. Syr
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> I alwayes did imagine, that those straunge ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>chiued by you, during the obscuritie of your yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
yeares, would in the end reueale your honourable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage,
and make your name for euer immortall: and were
the Prince <hi>Tryneus</hi> with you nowe, for the verie best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in the world would I not leaue your companie. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Duke, answered <hi>Palmerin,</hi> if I did not perswade my
selfe, how greatly I should comfort your minde, by recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
your Prince <hi>Tryneus:</hi> I should account my life so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie,

quoth the Duke, that you may finde him againe, for that
will bee the greatest good that euer came to our Empire:
considering the vertues, magnanimitie and speciall chiual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
which is as currant in our yong Prince as in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And thus they spent the time till they came to the
Pallace, where the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> after hee had saluted
the Emperour and the Princes, deliuered the message
committed to his charge. Wherewith <hi>Palmerin</hi> was not
a little pleased, considering what he had read in his Ladies
Letter, which discouered the sorrowes shee endured for his
absence: but being assured of her firme loyaltie, as also that
shée was now promised him in marriage, his cares were the
lesse, commaunding the Duke to be lodged neare his owne
Chamber, that he might the better conferre with him of his
Mistresse, whom he loued as deare as his owne life.</p>

other Lords, Ladies and Gentlewomen, also the solemnitie
and ceremonies, both at the Church and at the Pallace,
would waste a great deale of time in vaine, and without any
pleasure or profit to the Readers, and therefore I will let it
passe vnder your conceit, and speake of such things as are
most néedfull.</p>
                     <p>After that the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> and <hi>Griana</hi> were
espoused by the Patriache of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the whole
traine returned to the Pallace, where before the Gate was
erected a goodly Theater, hanged rounde about with cloth
of Golde, and therein were set manie Chaires and Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of estate. There was the Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> placed in
<pb facs="tcp:1616:289"/>
the cheefest seate, the Emperour and <hi>Florendos</hi> on the one
side, and the Empresse and <hi>Griana</hi> on the other: then was
<hi>Palmerin</hi> sworne Prince of <hi>Greece,</hi> with all the obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in such causes accustomed, by all the Lords of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
from the Emperor himselfe to the verie meanest Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.
In like sorts did the states of <hi>Macedon,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Florendos</hi> first beginning, the Duke of <hi>Pontus</hi> next,
and in the selfe same order as the Imperialistes had doone.
This doone, the Tables were couered, and all the Princes
placed according to their dignities: the Emperour and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
at the chéefest, the newe married couple at the second,
and the Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> at the third: so consequently the
Kings, Princes, Dukes, Marqusses, Counties, and all the
rest in order. As for the magnificence of the seruice, the royal
order obserued, the Tryumphes, Momeries, Masques, and
dauncing: would but fill paper with néedlesse reports, in
that your iudgements can conceiue thereof sufficientlie. But
the Tabels béeing withdrawne, the noble Gallants went
and Armed themselues, and entred the field which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

ruleth, reason hath no place. And if by the exteriour action
<pb facs="tcp:1616:290"/>
I haue béene disloyall to you: yet my heart, which first of all

For which <hi>Tarisius</hi> verie often reprooued me, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in the ende, and by the sufferaunce of God I think,
he receiued the rewarde, that the vsurper of another mans
right deserueth. But why should we (my Lorde) call now
to memorie things past, or remember matters which bréed
nothing but heauinesse? it is for you to excuse mée, and for
my selfe to loue and honor you. All the points of theyr for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

pleasures sorted in the end, as that night shée conceiued with
a Daughter, which prooued to bée beyond all other in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
On the morrow the Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> entred the Lists

the chéefest Princes of <hi>Greece</hi> on foote, and sixe Trompets

Emperour vnderstanding that <hi>Palmerin</hi> woulde enter the

entring his Chamber, found there a white Armour,
such as the yong Knights was accustomed to weare, which
his Dwarfe had there prouided for him: Armed himselfe
presentlie therewith, and mounted on a Horse of the same
colour, entred the Fielde on the assailants side, because he
had heard, that this daie the King of <hi>Sparta</hi> would encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Duke of <hi>Pontus, Frysoll, Olorico,</hi> and other of the
most gentle Knightes in the companie. The Emperour
knewe <hi>Palmerin,</hi> among all the rest, and said to <hi>Florendos:</hi>
what thinke you (Sonne) of the white Knight? Doo you
know him? No my Lorde, quoth the Prince, I know not
what hée is but me thought hee entred with a iollie counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,
it now remaines to sée what hee can doo. At the
encounter, <hi>Palmerin</hi> vnhorssed the Prince <hi>Olorico,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Duke of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and fiue other Knights in his
companie: then hauing broken his Launce, the Emperor
sent him another by a Squire, willing him (for his sake) to
imploy it as he had doone the other, but hee would make no
answer because he feared to be knowne. Now was <hi>Frysoll</hi>
much offended at the Prince <hi>Oloricos</hi> misfortune, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hée would reuenge his Fréendes cause: but the king of

his styrrops, and had hee not caught holde about his horse

In sooth my Lord, quoth the Prince, his fortune is

good if it be hee, and well may he be estéemed the worthiest

said.</p>
                     <p>Meruaile not my Lorde that Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> hath

But on the morrowe, when <hi>Palmerin</hi> sent for all the
Knights of name with whome he had Iousted, and euerie

the sorrowe of the Princesse <hi>Armida</hi> was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into pleasure, reputing it an honor to her Knight to bée
vnhorssed by her Brother.</p>
                     <p>When the Emperour vnderstoode that <hi>Palmerin</hi>
was iesting with the Knights, hée came into the Hall, and
taking him by the hande, merrilie saide. Sée héere my
Fréendes the white Knight, whome you all were so desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to knowe, but if you finde your selues agréeued with
him, you must laye the blame on mée: for I was the onely
cause of this enterprise, to the ende that hauing made open

                     <p>Nowe were all the Knightes well contented againe,
especially the Prince <hi>Olorico</hi> and <hi>Frysol:</hi> who though hée

our Father we shoulde not haue knowne yée. It may bee
(said <hi>Palmerin)</hi> that yee made no reckoning of the Knight,
who handled ye in this rough manner: or that you thought
him not woorthie to beare a Launce, because you refused to

spared you? If I had knowne so much before, I should
haue cryed quittance with you before wee parted. These

I pray you excuse mée, if in dooing my deuoire I haue

                        </gap>etings, they went to the Court, where began
a fresh occasion of ioy, betwéene the Empresse and her Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewe
<hi>Netrydes:</hi> shée then embracing him in her Armes,
thus spake.</p>
                     <p>Ah my noble Nephew, how haue the Heauens blessed
me with speciall fauour, in suffering me before my death to
sée my chéefest Fréendes, whom I was out of all hope to
behold againe: especiallie you, whose long absence from
your Countrey, hath rather deliuered imagination of your
death then life. Neuerthelesse, it is the prouidence of the
highest, that after all the troubles you suffered in your youth,
you might receiue the recompence in your age, by the
knightlie honour and bountie of your linage. In sooth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
sayd <hi>Netrydes,</hi> not so pleasant to mée is high prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as that I liue to sée my sonne againe, for hauing
contented my selfe in my little Castle, with a life frée from
offence and sollitarie, I did account it to excéede all other:
but nowe séeing in my declining yéeres, the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
hath thought good that I might profit his people, the
thought were base and abiect in me to make refusall. So
long were they deuising on these and other matters, as the
<pb facs="tcp:1616:293"/>
good night beeing giuen on all sides, the Emperour caused
these newe come Fréendes to bée conducted to theyr lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings.</p>
                     <p>But on the morrowe when <hi>Palmerin</hi> came to bid the
Emperour good morrow, he thus began. You knowe my
Lord, that a Common wealth without a heade and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
(as for example) is the Realme of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> cannot
long endure without sedicious tumults or rebellion: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
vnder your Maiesties reuerende regarde, I thinke it
expedient that my Sister <hi>Armida</hi> shoulde bee giuen in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to Sir <hi>Frysoll,</hi> because in nobilitie of minde and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of iudgement, hardly may so good a Knight be found,
nor shée enioy a fitter Husbande, and so may the Realme li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neallie
discende, from <hi>Netrides</hi> nowe aged, to his noble
sonne.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour liked well of this aduise, wherefore the
same day were <hi>Frysoll</hi> and the Princesse <hi>Armida</hi> espoused
togither: to the good lyking of all, but especially of the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
themselues, whose secrete desires were now effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
requited. After the feast was ended, <hi>Netrides</hi> instituted
Gouernour of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> departed with his wife and Sons
to his Kingdome: where hee was receiued very honorablie
by his subiects, who had not forgot their former loue to him:
and the vnnatural dealing of their king his deceased brother.</p>

his affection to the Princesse: so that for a flat resolution,
he aunswered, that nothing but death shoulde seperat their

not preuaile in his noble minde: reioysed greatlye thereat,
determining to recompence his princelie kindnesse, if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

                     <p>All which <hi>Palmerin</hi> promised to doo, and so comming
downe into the Court, founde there the Emperour and his
Father mounted on horsebacke, who bare him companie
two miles from the Citie: where after many courtesies
betwéene them, the Emperour and <hi>Florendos</hi> returned to

their comming, when taking his leaue likewise, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boorde,
and sayled with so good a winde, as in short time he

of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and howe he was sworne Prince of <hi>Greece</hi>

shée be satisfied, with the discourse, making many demaunds
to the Duke, as well of the Tryumphes, Tourney and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
as also of the marriage celebrated at <hi>Constantinople:</hi>
whereto the Duke returned such fitte aunswers, as nothing
wanted to extoll her Fréendes honor, yet without anye oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of iealouzie to the Princesse, wherto amorous Ladies
are commonlie subiect.</p>
                     <p>But nowe returning where wee left before, you must
<pb facs="tcp:1616:295"/>
note, that <hi>Palmerin</hi> béeing departed the confines of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
entred his Fathers Realme, where in euery Cittie he
was entertained with great tryumphing: especiallye in the
Cittie of <hi>Hermida,</hi> where the Merchaunt dwelt that was
<hi>Palmerins</hi> Maister, for whom he sent, but hée was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by his Wife, that her Husband was gone to the Sea,
and his two Sonnes with him, wherefore he gaue her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
rich gifts, and Letters for his Maisters frée enfranchise
and libertie. At his departure from thence, he came to the
place where <hi>Vrbanillo</hi> his Dwarfe was borne, whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was there liuing a poore auncient Knight, and his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of as tall stature as <hi>Vrbanillo,</hi> whom <hi>Palmerin</hi> (at her
Brothers request) sent to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to his Mother.
And for the honor of the order his Dwarfes Father had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
hée gaue him the Uillage wherein he dwelt, and in
the presence of the <hi>Macedonians</hi> put him in possession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
who not a little commended the discréete and liberal mind
of the Prince.</p>
                     <p>From thence he iourneyed to the chéefe Cittie of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
where remained the aged King his Grandfather: but
how the Cittizens entertained him, and what honorable
Tryumphes were made at the Court, I list not héere sette
downe, because it would be more tedious then benificiall.
As for his Aunt the Princesse <hi>Arismenia,</hi> shée at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

as <hi>Palmerin</hi> fell on his knée before her to kisse her hande,
she stayed him in her armes, saying. God forbid Sir <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>

                     <p>Fayre Aunt, answered <hi>Palmerin,</hi> if before I knewe

<pb facs="tcp:1616:296"/>
hand, as being the Ladie to whome I rest continually boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
I beséech you my Lord, quoth the Princesse, to pardon
me, for neuer shall <hi>Macedonian</hi> Maiden be so rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

but that she well knowes her dutie to her betters. At these
spéeches came the King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Pontus</hi> and
<hi>Mecaena,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Eustace,</hi> whom the Princesse wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed
with excéeding honor. After all courtesies ended,
<hi>Palmerin</hi> said.</p>
                     <p>I vnderstand Madame, that the king your Father is
crazed and sicklie: if it be so I am verie sorrie, I praye you
therefore let vs goe sée howe his Maiestie fareth. When
you please my Lord, quoth the Princesse, for I thinke if
héeretofore hee receiued health by you, Fortune may at this
time affoord the like: and yet (as I haue read) there is no
remedie for troublesome age, but onelie death it selfe, which
is the Gate to immortalitie, and endeth all diseases what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.
So entred they the Kings Chamber, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
going to the bed side to her Father, saide. My Lorde, sée
héere the good Knight <hi>Palmerin</hi> your Nephew, may it
please you to speake to him, and bid him welcome? Well
know I that he is right welcome to your Maiestie, were
there no other cause then the happye recouerie of your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
health, which his aduenturous trauaile héeretofore
brought ye.</p>
                     <p>The good olde King, whome the palsie caused to shake
and tremble: raysed himselfe vppe a little, and beholding
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> with weake and féeble voice, thus spake. Come
néere my noble Sonne, that these armes halfe deade may
embrace thée, and my lips now drie and withered, may once
kisse thée before I die. So holding him betwéene his armes,
and lifting his eyes to Heauen, said. O my God, for euer be
thy name honored and praysed, in vouchsafing me to sée my
Sonne before my death. Ah swéete death, the ende of all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
and beginning of felicitie, now art thou welcome, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
not thy stroke, in that I haue now séene the honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
defence of my Subiests héereafter, yea such a worthie
<pb facs="tcp:1616:296"/>
Fréende for them, as neuer had they the like. Ah my Son,
howe déerelie ought I to loue thée? how gracious hath thy
remembraunce béene of mee? yet féele I my selfe so weake
and feeble, as nature cannot prolong my life thrée daies. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
I knowe not which of vs twaine hath greatest cause to
reioyce: eyther the Father seeing his Sonne, euen when
he is readie to leaue him, or the Sonne finding his Father
attending his comming before he giue vp the ghost. I hope
my good Lord, said <hi>Palmerin,</hi> that you shall not leaue vs so
soone, therefore take a good heart, and that no doubt will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
your life. Alas my Sonne, quoth the King, vnweldie
age hath so weakened my body, and euen dried vp my vitall
blood, as longer I may not liue: and had not hope to sée thée
lengthened my languishing daies, thou hadst found my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
breathlesse, which yet sustaineth féeble life, onely by thy
presence.</p>
                     <p>Now that I may leaue this worlde with content, and
trauaile with better quiet to mine ende: tell mée (good
Sonne) the whole matter concerning thy Father <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi>

<hi>Palmerin</hi> rehearsed euery circumstaunce, both of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

Fréends (to their great sorrow) declared howe well they

the chiefest Citizens therein taken prisoners, the Turkes
following their fortune, marched further, and came to the
Cittie of <hi>Durace,</hi> where the faire Princesse <hi>Laurana</hi> abode,
of whom <hi>Palmerin</hi> sometime was amorous: when he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
by her excellent beautie, that it was shée who so often

euery one imploy your selfe, to preserue her and her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and demaund them of the Admirall for our part of the

                     <p>While <hi>Palmerin</hi> thus conferred with his Fréendes,
<hi>Olimaell</hi> vnderstoode by certaine prisoners, that the Cittie
was verie slenderly defended, therefore no great maistrie
to winne it quickly. Yet at their first assault they were so
valiantlie repulsed, as <hi>Olimaell</hi> and his men began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire
of victorie: wherefore hee made open protestation,
that hée who first could enter the Cittie, should haue anie

skirmish, as they all fledde out at the further Gate. The
Turkes then burned the Gates on the Sea side, and ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Citie, put olde and yong to the Swoord. But <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:1616:300"/>

the custodie of the King of <hi>Sparta, Frysoll, Olorico,</hi> and
<hi>Eustace,</hi> desiring them to comfort the Princesse, in that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shée or her Ladies should fall into the Tyrants power,
and so comming to <hi>Olimaell,</hi> on his knée he began in this
manner. You knowe my Lord the promise you made to day,
by vertue whereof beca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se I first got ouer the wall into the
Cittie, for my share I request the Dukes Daughter, and
for my Fréendes that followed mée, her Ladyes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen:

                     <p>
                        <hi>Olimaell</hi> graunted his demaunde, charging his people
on paine of their liues, not any way to offende the Ladies.
In this manner was the Princesse saued, whereupon the
Duke of <hi>Pontus</hi> presently went to her, and taking her by
the hand, acquainted her with this ioyfull newes, whereto
shée thus replied. Can it bée possible that <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who
héeretofore ventured his life in my fathers defence, against
the Count <hi>Passaco</hi> of <hi>Mecaena,</hi> should now become so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
among Turkes and Moores? Hath hée so forgot his
honour to God, that himselfe is not onely a vassaile to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of his faith, but dooth likewise séeke their destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the Duke, for if his name be knowne, we all perish:
what hath béene doone, is for the safetie of your life, and our
owne likewise, which hée hath obtained of the Generall of
the Armie.</p>
                     <p>With these words she was somewhat pacified, and the
old cinders of loue, which nowe began to spreade abroade,
caused her to returne this answere. In sooth, my Lord, séeing
I am become <hi>Palmerins</hi> prisoner, I thinke my honour in
better assuraunce, and my Fathers death is the lesse grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

then I can conceiue. By this time was <hi>Palmerin</hi> come to
her, who intreated her to kéepe all things secretly, for hée
woulde endure a thousand deathes, before shee should be any
way dishonoured. In time (quoth he) wée may be deliuered
from these Hell-houndes: as for you and your Ladyes, the
Admirall hath openly commaunded, that you be reuerently
vsed.</p>
                     <p>A thousand thanks my Lord, quoth the Princesse, and
séeing matters are so come to passe, yet do I reioyce that I
fell into your power. The Citie of <hi>Durace</hi> left in the same
state as <hi>Albania</hi> was, the Turkes went all aboorde, taking
no prisoners thence, but <hi>Laurana</hi> and her Ladies, whome
<hi>Olimaell</hi> intended to giue to the great Turke. So passing
along the Coast of <hi>Thessalie,</hi> they spoyled many Citties on
the Sea side, tooke the King and many noble men: so that

of <hi>Tubant,</hi> where as then the great Turke kept his
Court.</p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>Thessalie,</hi> thrée dayes before his taking,
sent his Queene (who was great with Childe) to one of his

heard her Husbandes misfortune, the gréefe shée conceyued
caused her presently to fall in trauell, when shée was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
of a goodly Daughter, named <hi>Francelina.</hi> At this

on the Mountaine <hi>Artifaeria,</hi> and one of them afterwarde in
his going to <hi>Buda,</hi> made theyr aboode in an Isle thereby
named <hi>Carderia.</hi> When they (by their hidden Philosophie)
heard how the King was taken, and should be kept in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
prison, without the helpe of his Daughter which
was newly borne: they concluded to frame such an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment,
as ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:1616:301"/>
that would not deigne to kisse his shooe, should be deliuered
from imprisonment. Héereupon the yongest of these thrée
Sisters, went to the Castell where the wofull Quéene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
where shée was verie honourablie entertained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Quéene desired to know, if the King her Husband
was dead or aliue, and if any hope might be expected of his
deliuerance.</p>
                     <p>The Damosell Enchauntresse aduertised the Quéene,
that in departing with her Daughter <hi>Francelina,</hi> the King
her Husband should enioy his libertie, and in time to come,
she should be maried to one of the best Knights of the world.
Wée néede not doubt that the Quéene was héereat ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
yet the loue of the Mother to her infant, cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the loue of the Wife to her Husbande, which among
all loues is the most honest and loyall: so that in hope to
frée him againe, on whom depended her health and welfare,
shée gaue her Childe to the Damosell, intreating that shée
might be vsed as beséemed the Daughter of a King, and as
the swéete beautie of the infant deserued. Shée returning to
<hi>Carderia</hi> with the Childe, made her Sisters verie ioyful by
her comming, who there nourished the infant till shée was
three yéeres olde, when the beautie of the yong Princesse
beganne to shewe it selfe, as fayre <hi>Cynthia</hi> dooth among the
Starres.</p>
                     <p>Nowe did the Sisters inclose her in a strong Tower,
made of purpose for young <hi>Francelina,</hi> wherein was the
most goodly Garden in the worlde, there was shee attended
by her Nursses, and sixe waiting Gentlewomen: and such
enchauntments were imposed on the Tower, as no man
should euer sée her, vnlesse he were the best Knight of his
time. The entraunce into the Tower was verie strayte
and narrowe, barred vppe with a great Gate of yron, and
guarded with two furious Lyons. Ouer the gate stoode a
huge Image of Copper, holding a mightie Mace of Stéele,
wrought by such cunning, as if anie Knight but he that was
destenied to end the aduenture, should assay to enter, hardly
<pb facs="tcp:1616:301"/>
might he escape to returne againe. Moreouer, the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
should not demaund the first demaund of the princesse,
which was the deliuerance of her Father, and for this
cause the Sisters enchaunted the faire <hi>Francelina,</hi> whose
Historie wée must yet forbeare, procéeding where wee le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Olimaell</hi> béeing thus on the Sea, laden with Christian
spoyles and prisoners, at length entred the port of the great
Cittie of <hi>Tubant,</hi> where hée made such a chéerefull noyse
of Droms, Trumpets, Clarions, and Cornets, as though
the greatest Monarch in the worlde had come to take lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
The great Turke maruailing at this sodaine me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodie,
sent one of his Knights to vnderstand the cause, who
béeing certified by <hi>Olimaell,</hi> what great victories hee had
obtained against the Christians, and the number of pryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
he brought with him, returned to the Pallace, where
he told his Lord that the Admirall <hi>Olimaell</hi> was come, and
had brought with him great spoyles from the Christians:
where among (quoth hee) is a Christian King in person,
many worthy Knights and Gentlemen, and a young Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of incomparable beautie. Not a little ioyfull was the
Turke at these newes, wherefore comming into his great

and aduauncing his sword drawne in signe of victorie. Bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to the Pallace, <hi>Olimaell</hi> saluted his Lorde with
great reuerence, standing by him to make report of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
and make present of his prisoners after their estate
and calling.</p>
                     <p>First he caused all the riches to be brought, and all the
meanest captiues one after another to kisse the great Turks
foote, then commaunding them to be carried thence, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in this manner. It is not to be doubted, most high and
<pb facs="tcp:1616:302"/>
mightie Monarch, that this victorie gotten on the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
enemies to our Gods, hath beene obtained onely by
your fauour, therefore it is good reason that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall

should be doone. The witnesse héereof are the treasures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and these prisoners abyding your mercie, who from

reuerence, and the King of <hi>Thessaly</hi> shoulde next follow,
who though his handes were pinniond behinde him, yet
had a Crowne of Gold on his head to shewe what hée was:
although he sawe himselfe in the Traitours power, and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limaell</hi>
had commaunded him to kisse his Maisters foote,
boldly made this answere. Nor will I so much displease my

from thy shoulders. With these words he gaue the King
such a blow on the face, as made him fall on his knées to the
ground.</p>
                     <p>Ah Traytour, quoth the King, well hast thou shewen
the nature of a villaine, that without commaunde strykest a
King captiue, and vnprouided of Armes: but might it so
please thy Lorde, in open Fielde will I prooue thée a disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and vnchristened Curre, that thus abusest the bloud roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
The great Turke séeing the King so moued and angrie,
the bloud likewise trickling from his nose and mouth: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
him to be carried thence, to one of the strongest
<pb facs="tcp:1616:302"/>
Castles in <hi>Nacolia,</hi> where he should be enclosed without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
companie, that his captiuitie might be the more grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

                     <p>When the King of <hi>Thessaly</hi> was departed, <hi>Palmerin</hi>
approched, leading the Princesse <hi>Laurana</hi> by the hande, hée
and his fiue companions beeing Armed, except theyr Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
Gantlets, and swords, whereat the great Turke
maruailing, demaunded of <hi>Olimaell</hi> why hée suffered them
to be armed? My Lord, quoth hee, these sixe Knights were
the first prize I tooke, who (after they had giuen me theyr
oathes) haue done such seruice to your Maiestie, especially
this, poynting to <hi>Palm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

answered the great Turk, for thy sake I likewise confirm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
it, and if héereafter they will abide with mée, I will make
them greater then euer they were. While the Turke was
making these promises, <hi>Agriola</hi> hauing well noted <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
knew him, and with the sodaine conceit thereof was
readie to swoune: but staying her selfe on her Chayre, said.
O sole bountie, who is this? are not mine eyes deluded and
my thoughts be guiled? At these wordes <hi>Palmerin</hi> knewe
her, which before hee did not, by reason of her strange dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guysed
apparrell: yet thought hee best to conceale his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ioy, least crooked fortune should now againe preuent
him.</p>
                     <p>The great Turke séeing <hi>Agriola</hi> looke so pale and wan,
started from his Chayre, and taking her in his Armes,
said. Alas Madame, hath any sodaine ill befallen yée? hath
any one in this companie offended yée? By our Gods, if I
knew him, presently shoulde he die the death. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
trembling with feare, séeing <hi>Hippolyta</hi> was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
spake thus in English. What will my Lorde and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<hi>Trineus</hi> say, if hee be in this companie, séeing I haue
so dissloyally forsaken him, and thus (though God knowes
<pb facs="tcp:1616:303"/>
perforce) in stéed of him, haue taken the enemie to him and
our faith? Yet one comfort haue I, that this Infidell hath
not carnally knowne me, for which perfection I thanke the
heauenly maiestie. At these spéeches <hi>Palmerin</hi> was so glad,
as the feare of death could not withholde him, but in the
same language he thus answered.</p>
                     <p>Feare not good Madame, <hi>Trineus</hi> is not in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
but so please you to say I am your Brother, you
may happily saue my life and practise your deliuerance.
The Turke misdoubting by <hi>Palmerins</hi> perswading, that
hée had caused this sodaine alteration, imagining him to
be her husband of whom he had heard her talke so often, in
a great rage said: Knight, how durst thou presume my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
presence, knowing the sight of thée would any way dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
her? By the Prophet Mahomet thou shalt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
die, that all such audacious villaines may take an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
by thée.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Agriola</hi> knowing the Turks censures were very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie,
and commonly no sooner saide then excuted, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
him, thus replied. Ah my Lorde, do not the thing in
haste, for which afterwarde you will be sorrie, for I assure
you on my honor, the Knight that spake to mée is my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and hath left his Countrey onely to finde me, and him
I do loue so effectually, as if you put him to death, impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
is it for me to liue afterward. When the Turke heard
her speake with such affection, qualifying his anger, saide. I
promise ye Madame, for your sake hée shall haue no harme,
but bee entertained with loue and honour, conditionally
that you forgette this melancholy, and hencefoorth shewe
your selfe more pleasant: for in séeing you sad, I am more
gréeued, then if I had lost the moitie of dominions. In sooth
my Lorde, answered <hi>Agriola,</hi> now shall I be merrie, séeing
you intende to loue my Brother, for greater good cannot
happen to me then this gentle entertainment, and hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth
shall I tread vnder foote, the sad remembraunce of
my Countrey and Parents, hauing him with me, by whom
<pb facs="tcp:1616:303"/>
I hope to gaine my greatest comfort. So the Turke arising
from his Chayre, caused <hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Laurana</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
<hi>Agriola,</hi> and the other fiue Knights hauing kissed his
hande, hee went to his Chamber, commaunding <hi>Olima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi>
(for his greater honor) to vsher <hi>Agrola,</hi> who as she went,
thus spake.</p>
                     <p>Beléeue me Admirall, if I was offended when thou
broughtest me prisoners hither, thou hast now made mée
sufficient amendes, in that by thée I enioy my Brother,
whom I was out of all hope to sée againe. Alas Madame,
quoth he, little did I thinke him to be such a one, for had I:
his vsage should haue béene much better, which fault I hope
heereafter to recompence. I commend him to thy countesie,
sayde <hi>Agriola,</hi> let him and his friendes haue all things they
want, according as my Lorde hath appointed. So taking her
leaue of them, she entred her chamber, where she and <hi>Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita</hi>
conferred with <hi>Laurana,</hi> of all her fortunes passed,
and the aduentures of her Brother. Nowe was <hi>Palmerin</hi>

Horse with costly furniture, thinking by these meanes to

command me nothing, but I will doo it with all my heart:
as for your request, it is not in my power, but in the hande
of God, who defendeth me as best him pleaseth. Nor can I

my Brother with me, I enioy farre greater content then I

                     <p>It sufficeth me, saide the Turke, to sée you so well pleased,
and as for your Brother, that you may perceiue howe well
I loue him, before one moneth be expired, I will make

Lady you sawe héere yesterday, for shee vnderstandeth

death, therefore when you sée her with me, conferre rather

No lesse (Madame) haue I alwaies found her, quoth <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin:</hi>

how he with his people were transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
into diuors shapes of Beasts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom <hi>Trineus</hi> bare the likenesse of a goodly Dogge.
Béeing thus disguised, a yong Princesse named <hi>Zephira,</hi>
Daughter to the King of the same Countrey, came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
counsell of the aged Enchauntresse <hi>Malfada,</hi> for the
cure of a certain disease, which by strange aduenture happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to her in this manner.</p>
                     <p>This yong Princesse one day béeing pleasant in her
Fathers Court, among many of her waiting Ladyes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
a goodly Garden, which abounded with great diuersitie
of swéet flowers, and after shee had walked a prettie while
in an Arbour of Muske-roses, shee espied a Gille-flower,
which séemed so faire and beautifull in her eye, as shee was
prouoked to goe crop it from the stalke. Hauing this delli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
flower in her hand, wherein (by misfortune) a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
worme was crept, she tooke such delight in smelling
<pb facs="tcp:1616:305"/>
it: as her breath drewe vp the worme into one of her nose?
thrilles, not béeing able to get it out againe. So the venome
and poysome of this little worme, engendred a putrifaction
and other like worms, which gaue a smell so filthy and loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
as hardly could any abide to stand by her. Her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not a little agréeued at this mischaunce, sent for the
most skilfull Phisitions, to sée what remedie might bede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised:
but all their paine and trauaile was in vaine, for
the disease continued still without any amendment. In the
end, the King fearing it would change to a Canker incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and hauing heard what straunge actions the Enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse
<hi>Malfada</hi> performed, sent the Princesse <hi>Zephira</hi> to
her, where shée béeing arriued without anie daunger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she would not hurt anie inhabiting in the Isle, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Sorceresse the whole manner of her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                     <p>The Enchauntresse answered, that shée could giue her
no remedie, and hardly should she finde any at all: except it
were by an ancient Knight, who remained in the Court
of the King of <hi>Romata</hi> and <hi>Grisca,</hi> Realmes subiect to the
Soldane of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the knight was named <hi>Muzabelino.</hi>
The Princesse was so displeased at this answere, séeing her
intent frustrated, as shée would receyue no sustenaunce:
wherefore walking in the Féeldes to represse her anger,
and so to the Sea-side, where the Ships lay confused, shée
behelde the Dogge which was the Prince <hi>Trineus,</hi> and so
farre in liking was shée with him, as she des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Citie called <hi>Elain,</hi> one of the greatest and surest strength in
<pb facs="tcp:1616:306"/>
the Realme, with all the signories belonging thereto. To
<hi>Maulerino</hi> his yongest Sonne, he gaue an other like porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was a dayes iourney distaunt from <hi>Elain.</hi> After
the Kings funerall rytes were solemnized, the Princesse
with her brother <hi>Mulerino,</hi> went to their owne possessions,
doubting the furie of the Prince <hi>Tyreno,</hi> their eldest Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who alwayes had showen himselfe proude and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious.</p>
                     <p>Shée béeing thus in quiet by her selfe, tooke no other
pleasure then in playing with her Dog, because hée seemed
verie subtile and politique: so that shée prepared a Couch
for him at her beds féete. <hi>Tyreno</hi> béeing crowned King af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Fathers deceasse, began greatly to despise that his
Sister should enioy the fayrest Cittie in the Realme: for
which cause hée practised all the meanes he coulde to put her
to death. And that he might the better compasse his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
hee secretly sent a Messenger to the maister of the
Princesse horses, that if hée woulde kill or poyson his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Sister, hée would giue him thirtie thousande Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphes,
and make him gouernour of <hi>Elain.</hi> The wicked
noble man, gréedie and couetous, séeing the large promise of
the Tyrant, consented thereto: so that one night the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
béeing asléepe, he entred her Chamber with his Sword
drawne, there to haue murthered her, and afterward the
Prince her Brother. <hi>Trineus,</hi> who had lost nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to a man but bodily shape and voyce, seeing the
Traytour enter his Ladies Chamber with his weapon
drawne, started vp presently, and setting his two foreféete
on the villaines breast, bit him so cruelly by the face and
thraote, as he being vnable to helpe himselfe, was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to crie out aloude. With this noyse the Princesse awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,

comming in haste to sée the cause of this outcrie, and
knowing the Traytour, beate him so fore with the Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell
of his Sword about the stomacke, as in the end enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

smote his heade from his shoulders. In the morning he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
such guarde in the Cittie, as no straunger might
enter without great examination. The Princesse know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
howe her Dog had saued her life, loued him afterwarde
so tenderly, as shée would féede him at her owne Table, and
none but her selfe might giue him anie foode. Héere will we

in the worlde, not contented with infinite number of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines,
hath many times made loue to me, so that to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
mine intent, I haue made him promise within thrée

the Princesse <hi>Agriola</hi> to shewe him the most disdamefull

<pb facs="tcp:1616:307"/>
and for this cause hath sent mee to you, to conuay

(Madame) I lately promised the Turke, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

                     <p>In sooth my Lord, so please you to commit the charge
héereof to me: so well hope I to execute the same, for her

should enter into some talke of hunting: wherat the Turke
presently arose, and taking <hi>Laurana</hi> by the hand, led her to

the very fairest creature that euer mine eyes behelde, will
ye graunt the request I made to you yesterday? Sée you
not what great honour I haue done to Madame <hi>Agriola?</hi>
Notwithstanding, if you will loue me, I will make you my
Wife, that I may haue issue by you to succéede in my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and your honours shall be nothing inferiour to hers.
And though she still denie me the fauour, which with long

my gréefe, and if in short time you vouchsafe me no pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,
the extreame afflictions I endure for your loue, are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

<pb facs="tcp:1616:308"/>
cause that made me deferre so long from this answere, was
the feare I haue of Madame <hi>Agriola,</hi> and her Brother, to
whome I was giuen by your Admirall after my Fathers
decease.</p>
                     <p>But to the ende, my Lorde, that none of them may su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

attending on <hi>Agriola,</hi> and her shall you commaunde to
giue me the Key of my Ladies Chamber, which hitherto
shée hath vsed to carrie. By this meane may I the more
safely, and without suspition of any one, come in the night
to fulfill your desire. The Turke imagining he had gayned
the Princesse loue indéede, was not a little ioyfull, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he said.</p>
                     <p>Swéete Ladie, you shall haue the Key as you request,
nor shall she longer lodge in my Chamber, whom you feare
so much. Moreouer, this night will I perswade <hi>Agriola,</hi>
that I féele my selfe not halfe currant: and therefore to

say that I sent for you: and if they dare bee so bolde as to
hinder your comming, in the morning shall my Ianizaries
put them to death, whatsoeuer they be. So taking a King
from his finger, wherein was a stone of inestimable value,
hée gaue it to the Princesse, saying. Holde Madame, take
this as a pledge of my promise: for which <hi>Laurana</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie

went to the Princesse Chamber, where the Duke was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
Armed, except his Helmet, which he left on the

putting on the attyre the Princes wore vppon her heade,

to the Hauen, where they were ioyfully welcommed
by <hi>Frysoll,</hi> and the rest, without méeting anie by the way to
hinder them. When the Duke saw himselfe left alone, and
now he was to dispose himselfe to his intent, falling on his

                     <p>O my God, that suffered the mightie <hi>Holofernes</hi> to bée

humbly saluting him, saide. Welcome Sir Knight, heere
may you repose your selfe if you please. Alas Ladys, quoth
be, it is nowe no time for me to rest, because the Ladie of

their Ladies cunning had brought them thither, that shee
might abuse him, and afterwarde transforme him as was
her custome) béeing amazed at this aunswere, thus spake.
Accursed villaine, of an euill death maist thou die, whom
our Mistresse by her knowledge cannot transforme, now
knowe we that thou hast murdered her: but assure thy selfe
to finde vs thy two most mortall enemies, and though we
can change thy Fréendes to their former shapes, yet in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight

<hi>Palmerin</hi> séeing such strange euents succéede one an

this answer. You must hold me excused Sir, for in truth I

so vnfortunate, as the rehearsall woulde bee most dolorous.
Then <hi>Dyardo</hi> declared, howe the King had sent him with
some small assistaunce, to pursue fiue Foystes of Moorish
Pirats, who had doone manie iniuries to his subiects. And,
quothe hee, after I had long time chased them, fiue other

sparing me in regard of amorous desire, hath kept mee in
this Castle a yéere and more, abusing mee at her owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and neuer could I compasse any meane to escape hence
againe, for if I had but made offer néere the Gate, by forcible

who smote me.</p>
                     <p>Your hap, quoth <hi>Palmerin,</hi> hath béene verie harde, but

our Princesse not long since went, for remedie of a strange

(quoth the Hoste) in a Cittie called <hi>Elain.</hi> Perhappes, quoth
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> by her I may be better resolued. So bidding his
Hoste good night, withdrewe himselfe into his Chamber,

<hi>Zephira.</hi>
                     </p>

some man more expert in that diuellish Science: who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
her health, happily may giue mée some counsell to
amende my misfortune. In this opinion the next morning
he rode to the Cittie of <hi>Elain,</hi> heauie and sadde, yet in hope of

with two or thrée hundreth light Horsse men, whome the

to taste all auaunt, currers and Knights passing by

take the Princes paie, and sweare faithfull seruice, shoulde
sustaine no harme: but such as refused so to doo, were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the Cittie, their Horsse and Armour taken from

were amazed to sée <hi>Palmerin</hi> so richly armed, and much

to him.</p>
                     <p>Yéeld your selfe Sir knight, and sweare to maintaine

The condition is very harde, said <hi>Palmerin,</hi> but for I haue
heard the wrong offered by the king to your Princesse, I
will sustaine her cause, not as a prisonrr enforced héereto,

ran and leaped on him, whining and fawning on him so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly,
as euery one greatlie meruailed thereat. In bréefe,
they might discerne by cries, colling about his legs, and
pittifull mourning, that faine he would haue spoken, and
shewed his loyall Fréende his inward complainings. The
Princesse meruailing at this strange occasion, said. I thinke
(Sir Knight) my dog knowes you, for since <hi>Malfada</hi> gaue
him me, I neuer could sée him so faune on anie body. In
sooth Madame, answered <hi>Palmerin,</hi> to my remembraunce,
I neuer sawe your dog before this present. Héereupon shée
called him to her, and made many meanes that hee shoulde
come to her, yet would he not leaue <hi>Palmerin,</hi> but shaking
his head, still whined to his Fréende, as crauing aide and
succour at his hand, wherewith the Princesse mooued, thus
spake.</p>
                     <p>I praye thée Knight conceale not any thing from mee,
for I perswade my selfe, that thou hast beene héeretofore
some Fréende to the Enchauntresse <hi>Malfada,</hi> seeing my

truth I praye thée, and if thou likewise wilt assist mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

and thy ordinarie paye redoubled. Madame, answered <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin,</hi>
héere may you beholde the most distressed Knight
liuing, and a Christian, whose harde fortune hath béene such,
as arriuing in the Enchauntresse Isle whereof you spake,
I haue lost fiue Fréends, my true and honourable compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and with them two Ladies, who in all vertues may
not be equalled. Yet haue I reuenged their losse on the olde
<pb facs="tcp:1616:315"/>
hagge and her seruaunts, whose breathlesse bodies remaine
for foode to the foules of the ayre. And because I hearde
(fayre Princesse) your selfe was not long since with her,
for councell in some vnhappie fortune befallen you, faine
woulde I knowe, maye it please you to graunt mee so much
fauour, if shee assigned you to anie other more skilfull then
her selfe, by whom you not alone shall finde remedie, but my
tormenting gréefes maye likewise bée comforted. Good
Knight, aunswered the Princesse, the Gods themselues will
trauaile to helpe thée, and it may be I haue learned of her,
by whose death thou hast reuenged the wrong of manie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
persons: some hope of further good, to ease those passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which thy spéeches bewray. True it is, that I stayed
with <hi>Malfada</hi> the space of eight daies, yet not learning any
thing of her woorthie the rehearsall, this onelie excepted:
she tolde me that in the kings Court of <hi>Grisca</hi> and <hi>Romata,</hi>
remained an auncient Knight named <hi>Muzabelino,</hi> by
whome (if my maladie were curable) I should finde helpe,
and by no other man whatsoeuer, so did she extoll him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all other. And had not the king my Father died soone
after my returne, and my iniurious brother euer since mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested
mée, long ere this had I gone to that skilfull man,
whome I meane to finde, so soone as I can bring my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to anie good ende. By all our Gods, quoth the Prince
<hi>Maulerino,</hi> séeing <hi>Malfada</hi> is deade, <hi>Muzabelino</hi> maye
finish all the enchauntments: but during her life, neither
he nor all the Magitians in the world were able to compasse

                     <p>As for the kingdome of <hi>Romata,</hi> it is very farre from
this Couutrey, the greater will your paine and daunger be
in trauailing thither. Right pleasant will the paine bee to

againe: and for you swéete Madame will I aduenture my

brought him from the Isle of <hi>Malfada,</hi> for doubtlesse, quoth

more courtesie, if woulde agrée much better with his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
but because he shall not think, that we refuse the Iouste
through feare or cowardise, say hee shall haue his desire,
both he and all his shall try their fortune ere wee passe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>This answer returned to the Prince, <hi>Drumino</hi> first
shewed himselfe in the Fielde, and by importunate intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
certaine of the Princesses Knights would first try their
valour: but such was their ill fortune, as <hi>Drumino</hi> vnhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them one after another. <hi>Zephira</hi> somewhat offended
heereat, intreated <hi>Palmerin</hi> eyther to win them passage,
or else with his successe she was content to staye Prisoner. I
goe Madame (quoth <hi>Palmerin)</hi> and Fortune spéede mee,
as I regard the safetie of your honor. <hi>Muzabelino,</hi> hauing
acquainted the King with this pastime, they came in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
disguised to beholde it, at what time the Prince <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino</hi>
encountred <hi>Palmerin.</hi> But not to hold you with te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
discourse considering which way the victorie is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the twe Princes and all their knights were manfullye
foyled by <hi>Palmerin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Ioust béeing ended, and the king returned again
to the Cittie, <hi>Muzabelino</hi> came to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and hauing
saluted him with great reuerence, thus spake. Woorthie
Lord, who onelie deseruest the name of chiualrie, let mee
intreate you to excuse the kings Son, who to make proofe
of your valour, by my meanes attempted this noble aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
from which you haue escaped with great honour, and
to their shame that made the challenge. What are you Syr,
said <hi>Palmeiin,</hi> that know me so well, and the cause why I
came into this Countrey? Your Fréend <hi>Muzabelino,</hi> (quoth
he) whome you haue taken such paines to finde, and who
knowing you to be a Christian, will kéepe you from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
among these Mahumetistes. <hi>Palmerin</hi> suddainlie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
from his Horsse, came and embraced him, saying
<pb facs="tcp:1616:321"/>
Noble Fréend, suffer mée to kisse your hand, as a witnesse of
my reuerence to your honourable age. Not so my Lord, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<hi>Muzabelino,</hi> rather suffer me to doo my dutie, to that
incomparable person, by whose meanes ere sixe Monethes
be past, the greatest nobilitie in the world shall receyue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
honour.</p>
                     <p>While these courteous ceremonies endured, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
Princesse with her Ladies came from the Pauilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and saluting <hi>Palmerin</hi> with great courtesie, sayde. Sée
héere, Sir Knight, the Lady, who trusting in your honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
benignitie, commeth to submit her selfe at your disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
béeing woonne with more choyse chiualrie, then euer
any other Ladie was. Notwithstanding, I hope that you
will not refuse to graunt me one demaund, according to the
conditions agréed in the Ioust. <hi>Palmerin</hi> séeing her so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créet
and modest, so sumptuous in apparell, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with so manie Ladies, iudged that she was the Kings
Daughter, and Wife to the Prince <hi>Drumino,</hi> wherefore
entertaining her verie graciously, hée thus replyed. Unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it is, faire Ladie, that a Princesse of so high and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

Knight: and though the agréement of the Ioust bee such,
yet do I humblie thanke you for this honour, bequeathing
you to your former libertie, and restoring you to him that
hath best right to you.</p>
                     <p>A thousand thankes worthie Lorde, said the Princesse,

                     <p>Your disease happened by smelling to a flower, and by

which if <hi>Palmerin</hi> by his bountie and prowesse doo not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish,

For the rest, feare not my discouerie of thy secrete loue and

hardly could it bée equalled through the world. <hi>Palmerin</hi>
approched to behold the counterfeit, which helde in the one
hande a Booke fast shutte, and in the other a Key of Golde,
poynting with the Key towarde the Gate of the Pallace:
whereupon he imagined, that this was the Tombe of the
Ladie Enchauntresse, whereof <hi>Muzabelino</hi> had told him
before, and putting his hand betwéene the golden Barres,
the Image presently offered him the Key. Héereat béeing
some what abashed, he iudged that this happened not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

the Pallace Gate, and entering the great Hall, hée

a Table furnished with all kinde of meates, and a hand hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
two great Golden Candlesticks, wherein burned two

                     <p>Wondering at these euents, and doubtfull to take thence
those rare presents, immediately a Damosell came before

and after she had shewed them the Arbour, departed. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
looking round about him, maruailed at the ingenious

Princesse <hi>Alchidiana</hi> the Soldanes Daughter, onely for

hath raysed you againe? The soldane was credible enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that you and <hi>Olorico</hi> were drowned in the sea: for

What may bee the cause of your Ambassage? I will not

                     <p>I thanke you good Sir, aunswered <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and I
doubt not in time to requite your gentlenesse. While they
thus talked together, the Soldane came to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Will not you make one my Lord in this daunce? the
Ladies say they cannot haue your companie. In sooth my
gracious Lorde, answered <hi>Palmerin,</hi> little doo I delight in
any such exercises, very earnest affaires haue I with the
Ambassadour <hi>Maucetto,</hi> which craue suddaine and spéedie
dispatch. Beside, faine would I know some tydings of him
from my Ladie <hi>Alchidiana,</hi> from whose seruice I haue now
discontinued a yéere and more. The Soldane abashed at
these wordes, saide. I pray you tell mee the truth, are not
you hee that slewe the Prince <hi>Amarano</hi> of <hi>Nigrea</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
and afterwarde two other of his Brethren, of which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
remaine such fame through all Turkie? In sooth
my Lord aunswered <hi>Palmerin,</hi> béeing vowed to my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
seruice, I neuer could suffer her honour to be any way
distained, and in that dutie I will continue, for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde
curtesies I haue receiued by her. By the liuing God,
sayd the Soldane, now think I my selfe the happiest prince
in the world, hauing the man in my Court, whose verie
name maketh the stoutest to tremble. But séeing wee are
thus farre entred, tell mée, is the Princesse <hi>Alchidiana</hi> so
beatifull as Fame reports her, That is she my Lord, quoth
shee, and much more then fame is able to vtter, beside, shée
is one of the most gracious and affable Princesses that euer
I beheld in any Kings Court.</p>
                     <p>Nowe is night come, and after the Courtly pastimes
were ended, the Bridegroome went to receiue the honur
of his Bride, commaunding <hi>Palmerin</hi> to bee intreated as
his owne person, which not a little contented the Princesse
<hi>Lyzanda,</hi> thinking héereby (alas too lauishly) to obtaine
<pb facs="tcp:1616:336"/>
him for her husband, but héerein she was deceiued, so that
her rash loue procured her miserable death. <hi>Aerecinda</hi>
likewise continually courted <hi>Trineus,</hi> as though shée had
alwaies béene trained vp in his company, wherefore one
day, after hee had béene warned foure or fiue times by <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin,</hi>
he thus spake to her. Madame, if your honestly and

of your continencie and chastity, I maruaile nowe
what many will thinke, in that you should not shewe any
such signes of loue to me, for it séemes yée yéelde the Cittie
before any assault be giuen. Al these spéeches could not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
her humour, for loue had so emboldened her with such
vnshamefastnesse, as shee made no conscience of following
the cause, giuing credit to one of her Ladies perswasions,

sad and pensiue for the death of her Brother. These newes

                        <pb facs="tcp:1616:338"/>
by the hand, but when they sawe the Armed Knight thus
contend with <hi>Trineus,</hi> they meruailed greatly what might
be the occasion thereof. When <hi>Orzadine</hi> sawe the Soldane
was sette, he entred into these spéeches. Soldane, I am hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
come to accuse thée, of a villainous act which thou hast
committed, harbouring in thy Court, the man that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>What art thou, said the Soldane, that darest speake
thus presumptuously in our presence? <hi>Orzodine</hi> King of
<hi>Galappa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> quoth he, of whom thou hast heard heretofore, and
now haue I presented my gage against this Knight, which
I will maintaine in despight of the proudest. The Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane
abashed at this euent, sought to disswade them from
the Combatte, because hée had heard great spéeches of the
Kings prowesse, but all was in vaine, for <hi>Orzodine</hi> was
so obstinate, and <hi>Tryneus</hi> so earnest to reuenge the Turks
proud blasphemie against his Ladie, as they would not be
pacified till the Fielde was graunted them. Let vs haue
Iudges presently, quoth <hi>Orzodine,</hi> and the Fielde assured
for our Combat, that I may discipline this glorious straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>Make not such haste, sayd <hi>Tryneus,</hi> for I feare thou
wilt thinke thy comming too soone. Immediately were the
the two Combattants Armed, the Iudges placed in their
Tent, when the Soldane and <hi>Palmerin</hi> with manie Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
went to beholde this exployt. But such a mightie man
was the King of <hi>Galappa,</hi> as <hi>Palmerin</hi> feared his fréends

the fight with danger on either side, but the king of <hi>Galappa</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:1616:339"/>
strooke such peasant strokes, béeing a man of equall stature
with a Giant, as hée wounded <hi>Trineus</hi> in manie places:
and such was his ill fortune, after long trauersing about,
hee sette his foote vnwarilye on the Trunchion of a Launce,
whereby he fell downe backward to the ground. <hi>Orzodine</hi>
taking aduauntage of this fall, sette his foote on the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
breast, striuing to pull his Helmet from his head: but
God knowes in what agonie <hi>Palmerin</hi> was newe, when
he breathed foorth these spéeches to himselfe. Ah Heauens
quoth he, haue I taken such paine and trauaile to finde my
Fréend, and must he now die among his enemies, <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>einda</hi>

is it not enough that my Fréend must die, but his noble c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
will beare him companie? While this doubtfull
feare was among the Courtiers, <hi>Tryneus</hi> had so well scuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with <hi>Orzodine,</hi> as he laye along by him likewise, when
drawing a pocket dagger, he stabbed it through his Helmet,
into one of his eyes, so that he nailed his head to the ground.
<hi>Orzodine</hi> féeling himselfe wounded to the death, gaue a
very loude cry: when <hi>Tryneus</hi> hauing gotten his Helmet
off, presentlie smote his heade from his shoulders. If the
Knights of <hi>Galappa</hi> were now dismaide, and the soldane,
<hi>Palmerin, Zephira, Tomano,</hi> and all the rest ioyfull, I
leaue to your iudgements: especially <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
that <hi>Trineus</hi> had thus conquered his enemie, entred
the Lystes and embraced him, and bringing him foorth of
the Fielde, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The bodie of the dead King was giuen to them that
came with him, with meruailous reprehension of theyr
Maisters audacious challenge, and so with great heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
they returned home againe. Nor would the Soldane
longer stay in his Court the <hi>Assirian</hi> Ambassadour. But
excused himselfe to the <hi>Babylonian Mysos,</hi> that he could not
giue him anie assistaunce, couering this aunswer vnder his

vnfortunate battaile against the King <hi>Abimar. Maucetto</hi>
séeing that to staye longer would not auaile him, tooke his
leaue of the Soldane, saying. Albeit my Lorde, you cannot
giue my Maister anie assistance, yet let <hi>Palmerin</hi> returne
to him at his departure from your Court. What I can doo
héerein, aunswered the Soldane, your Lord shall be assured
to finde, although I thinke his minde bee otherwise adic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:

I heard him saye he would write to Madame <hi>Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana.</hi>

                        <hi>Maucetto</hi> departing to <hi>Palmerins</hi> lodging, the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane
went to see his Sisters, of whome hée demaunded, if
they had as yet practised anie thing with the Knights. My
Lord, aunswered <hi>Aurecinda,</hi> who in all things was more
prompt then her eldest Sister, I haue fixed my loue on the
knight <hi>Trineus,</hi> with full resolution neuer to loue anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
yet dooth not he intend to staye héere in your Courte,
much lesse (I feare) to make me his wife. As for my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
shée cannot compasse the meane, howe to impart her
loue to Sir <hi>Palmerin.</hi> Right strange is it, quoth the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danen,
that the promises you haue made them, and so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
signes of ardent affection, cannot disswade them to
make choyse of you: Doubtlesse they bée some great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who to sée the fashions of the worlde haue thus disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
themselues. Continue your loue as you haue begunne,
and if by other meanes you cannot stay them, aduenture
your honors as a meane to entrappe them. And now dooth
occasion well serue you Sister <hi>Aurecinda,</hi> for by courteous
intreating <hi>Tryneus</hi> now he is wounded, you maye more
profit in one houre, then you haue doone during this tedious
pursuit.</p>
                     <p>Néedlesse was it for the Soldane thus to perswade
her, in that she laboured for no other matter, kéeping <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi>

thereat, secretlye thus rebuked the Prince. What meane
you my Lord? If you mend not this order I must be angry

with you. You sée this Princesse excéedes in her desire, and
you giue her occasion to continue it: I know not what will
happen héereon, but my mind perswades mee that you
will hardlie depart hence with honour. Be aduised I desire
you and take this of me: that if the wisest man will lende
his eares to loose persons, and followe theyr affections: hée
shall become more vnreasonable then a bruite Beaste, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding

                     <p>I praye thée good Page, goe to the Prince <hi>Trineus</hi>
his Chamber, and there attende till he come foorth: then
feigning that some one hath doone thée iniurie, thou shalt
intreat him to helpe thée against him that abused thée. If

where I will stay his comming with thy Sister, and so
soone as he is entred, make fast the doore on him, and gette

his Chamber, he fell on his knées before him saying. My
Lord, if euer you pittie a Gentleman abused, let mee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
you to reuenge my cause, on a villaine that hath too
much wronged me.</p>
                     <p>

pittie to denie thy request, considering thou doost demaunde
it so courteously: shall I néede to bee better prouided then
I am? No my Lord, quoth he, your sword is sufficient. So
was he conducted by the Page along the Gallery, and bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

speaking to the Prince. My Lord, the partie you must deale

wherefore you may enter secure from daunger. Hee

Now was <hi>Tryneus</hi> not a little amazed, when he saw
no bodie but the Princesse with her Ladie, shée being come

Betwéene her daintie Breastes hung a precious Carbunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
which supplied the office of <hi>Venus</hi> her firebrand: when

to be desired of such a ladie, whome mightie kings and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

euious of her Sisters benefit, and despightfull at <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins</hi>

much better had it béene, that wee had neuer knowne these
cruell Christian Knightes? whose ingratitude will bee the
cause of my death: for the yonger of them is meruailouslie
beloued of my Sister, who forgetting her faith, honor, and
her obedience to your Maiestie, hath dishonored both her
selfe and you, onelie to make proofe of the other knights Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie

                     <p>I did not will my Sister to abuse her selfe, without

therefore you must bee angrie with no bodie but your selfe.
Let me not liue an houre sayde the Soldane, if I be not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

quoth he, for if his companion know thereof, it may

neuer was imprisonment so dearely bought as this will

life, and the liues of an hundreth thousand Knightes beside,
in reuenge of his wrong. Béeing thus enflamed with ire,
hée could not so giue ouer, but thus beganne againe. By
God Soldane, thy treason is so manifest as thou canst not
hide it, full well doo I vnderstand thy flatteries, whereby
thou hopest to kéepe vs in thy seruice, but farre art thou from

More I demaund not, said <hi>Palmerin,</hi> for I am assured that

why did you not reueale it to me? quoth he, worthilye haue
you deserued death, in concealing the shame of your Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters

Héereupon he Armed himselfe, and sending for the Prince
<hi>Tomano,</hi> said to him.</p>
                     <p>I thinke it best my Lord, that you kéepe your ordinarie

came hither with vs, that none may enter into the Cittie
without our licence. In meane while, you may sende a
Courtier to the King your Father, that he presentlye sende
vs what helpe he may. Sir <hi>Palmerin</hi> answered <hi>Tomano,</hi>
not onelie my Knightes shall enter the Fielde for you, but
my selfe likewise, so please you to commaund mee, and what
you thinke best for the deliueraunce of your Fréende <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi>
I will bee willing to accomplishe to my vttermost.
Presentlye will I send a Horseman to <hi>Grisca,</hi> and conferre

resolute constancie, not once listning to the mones of the
Princesse.</p>
                     <p>When they were come within sight of <hi>Palmerins</hi> power,

<hi>Tryneus</hi> and <hi>Aurecinda</hi> to fiftie Knights, who should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey

which was a good quarter of a league from the Cittie.
<hi>Trineus</hi> nowe séeing death before his eyes, and no succour

<hi>Palmerin</hi> knowing which way his Fréend should be led to
death, with a sufficient traine lay secretlie ambushed, and
espying oportunitie, gaue summons to his men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon

thinking the end of the world was come vppon them,
fledde towards the Cittie: but notwithstanding all theyr

                     <p>My Lord, aunswered the Duke, fearing to offend you,
I still deferred to mooue you in this cause, but seeing wee
are nowe so happily fallen into these tearmes, I will not
conceale the truth from you. In sooth my Lorde, when first
I sawe her, I loued her, and haue euer since continued in
this hope, that time at length would fauour my intent. It
sufficeth, saide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and presently hée acquainted the

said. I sée it is the will of God my Sonne, that héere after
<pb facs="tcp:1616:361"/>
I shall haue as great ioy by thée, as in thy long absence I

so that they twaine, with the aide of the King of <hi>England,</hi>
haue leueyed such an Armie on the Sea, as neuer was the

menaces: yet are they the thrée principall Kings of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                     <p>My Lord answered <hi>Palmerin,</hi> be not you dismaide at
their enterprise, for ere manie dayes bee expired, I hope to
sée all matters quietly pacified, and that without anie ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of blood. The lesse is my doubt, quoth the Emperour,
in that with such good fortune you haue finished your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for nothing you begin but comes to luckie ende. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
héerof appeareth in the search of my Sonne <hi>Tryne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
whom the best Knights in Christendome haue laboured
to finde: but all their trauaile I sée hath béene spent in vaine.
By this time they were come to the Pallace, where they
were graciously receiued by the Ladies. Alas my Fréendes,
said the Empresse, which of you shall I first embrace? Ah
my Sonne <hi>Tryneus,</hi> howe sorrowfull hast thou made mée
since thy departure from <hi>England?</hi> iust cause hast thou to
thanke the Heauens, who protected thée still in so manie
daungers, and forget not thy Brother <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who hath

your knight sir <hi>Ptolome,</hi> and him I commend to your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

I would not haue forsaken my Parents and friendes so

shée was sometime promised to mine eldest Sonne,
reseruing the conditions of our amitie, that our first Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes

to continue the honour of their predecessours. As for the

assistaunce, on there behalfe I can make you no certaine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,

Gracious Lord, quoth <hi>Ptolome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> I dare assure you in the

this coniunction of your amitie, will cause that neither the
Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> or <hi>England</hi> will séeke to molest him: but

I graunt his request, and will presently call home my

As for the wrong doone to my Daughter, I am content to
excuse it, beléeuing that shée was not conueyed hence but
with her will: thanking the Prince for the honour he hath
done her, séeing she would leaue her Parents and friendes
so lightly. I thinke my gracious Lord, answered the Duke,
that when you consider what your Daughter hath done,
<pb facs="tcp:1616:364"/>
you will not touch her with want of witte or iudgement: for
in respect of the long enmitie betwéene the Emperour and
you, shée desired that her marriage might sort this happie
ende. Nor would she haue departed hence with the Prince
<hi>Tryneus,</hi> without a faithfull and resolued promise of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
which is performed, with as great honour as euer was
done to the daughter of a King. Thinke you, quoth the King,
that had not the great friendship of <hi>Tryneus,</hi> (when against
his Fathers will, he came with <hi>Palmerin</hi> to assist me) qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
the weight of mine anger against him, but I woulde
haue pursued the iniurie he did to me? yet did I referre his
seruice, to the iudgements of my Lords of <hi>England,</hi> who
perswaded me to reuenge, which you well perceiue as yet I
haue not done.</p>
                     <p>Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> quoth the Duke, is so vertuous, as
rather woulde hée haue runne on a thousande deathes, then
your daughters honour shoulde anie way haue béene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached:
but béeing assured of this fortunate issue, both hée
and <hi>Tryneus</hi> aduentured as they did. And sorrie am not I,
said the King, that all things are come so well to passe, but
séeing we are entred thus farre in spéeche, tell mée (I pray
you) how <hi>Palmerin</hi> came to the knowledge of his Parents,
and howe hée finished the aduentures at the Castle of the
tenne Rockes, and the daungerous Isle of <hi>Malfada,</hi> which
neuer any Knight could compasse before? Then the Duke
rehearsed euerie accident, how amourous the great Turke
was on the Princesse <hi>Agriola,</hi> and each seuerall occasion as
they fell out: at which report, the Quéene with her Ladies
were present, who hearing the discourse of so straunge and
variable fortunes, said.</p>
                     <p>I thought my Daughter had learned more modestie,
then leauing her Fathers Court, to followe a Knight vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
to her in straunge Countries: but séeing the ende
hath fallen out so well, hencefoorth I shall remaine in better
contentment, séeing a Prince of so great renowne hath now
espoused her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:1616:364"/>While this conference endured, the Duke earnestly
beheld the Princesse <hi>Sabinda,</hi> Daughter to the Prince of
<hi>Sansuega,</hi> and Néece to the Quéene: and of such excellent
grace and beautie he estéemed her, as forgetting the death
of his Father, who deceased since his departure from <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,</hi>
hée became so amourous of her, that he demaunded
of the Quéene if shée were her Daughter. Shée is not my
Daughter, quoth the Quéene, but the Daughter of my
Brother, the Princes of <hi>Sansuega.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Right glad was the Duke thereof, and resolued to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
her of the King in marriage, who knowing the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

a Rocke was spilt in the middest. Nowe are they left to
the mercie of the waters, and <hi>Alchidiana</hi> wasting on a

hée gained landing at a Porte distant from <hi>Constantinople</hi>
about thirtie miles. The Inhabitants where they came on

leauing <hi>Lycado</hi> and his Father at the Port, where hée
threwe abroade such enchauntments, that all such as came
foorth of their houses, presently fell downe a sleepe in the

knew hée was the Emperour, wherefore drawing his

this shamefull outrage, wrong the Sword out of <hi>Nardides</hi>
hande, and gaue him such a sounde stroke therewith on the
head, as made him tomble his héeles vpwarde, and by the

who had béene newly baptised, loued the Emperour as hée

Duke <hi>Ptolome</hi> strongly helde in his armes, gaue him so
many stabs on his throate, that he likewise fell downe at
his féete. The Empresse séeing her Lord so wounded, rent
her garments, tore her comely locks of hayre, and smote
her faire face with maruailous violence. Ah my Lord, quoth
shée, thou art not wounded alone, for if thou die, as God
forbid, right soone will my ghost follow thée. Cease Madam
your complaints, saide the Emperour, and comfort your

leaue you: I haue lost such aboundance of my bloud, as lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

himselfe by his Magique, was presently transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Serpent. Now thou shalt perceiue, saide <hi>Muzabelino,</hi>
that I am greater in power then thou art. So taking two
great Golden Chaines, he tied the Serpent about the neck
therewith, and his Sonne together, setting such a coniura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on them, as he should neuer be chaunged to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Then came hée to the Pallace, where taking off his
Helmet, hée entred the Hall, saying to the Knights. Ah my
déere friendes, the Traytour that thus hath molested you,
is taken, reioyce therefore, and be of good chéere, your Lord
is not dead, he liueth, he must liue, and in despight of enuie
shal florish more then euer he did. The princes and knights
hearing him speake so friendly, and yet knew not what hée
was, notwithstanding his promises they were greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed,
but when they sawe <hi>Bellechino</hi> and <hi>Colmelio</hi> so
reuerently embrace him, they began to conceiue better o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of him. Alas my Lord and Father, said <hi>Bellechino,</hi>
in a happie houre came you hether, and your presence puts
vs out of al further feare, vouchsafe to succour the Empresse
<hi>Polynarda,</hi> for pittie it is to sée her thus chaunged. Héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Muzabelino</hi> embraced the Empresse, whose face was

Conuey her hence, saide he to the Ladies, I am ashamed to
sée your follie, suffering her to lye in this sort and no one
helpe her. Then was shée conducted to her Chamber, and
<hi>Muzabelino</hi> with the ayde of his Sonne and Duke <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stace,</hi>
carried the Emperour to his bed, where staunching
his woundes with a precious Oyntment, <hi>Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out at his mouth, and howling with strange and pittifull
cries. Then went <hi>Muzabelino</hi> to the Empresse, who still
