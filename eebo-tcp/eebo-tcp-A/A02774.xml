            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>r. Wolfe, <hi>Good Newes</hi> was euer a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guest vnto me: and you do well in the current of your businesse, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Italian Prouerbe; <hi>Good Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> would be dispatched to ride post, as <hi>Ill Tidings</hi> may haue good leaue to be a footeman. The nimblest <hi>Bee</hi> is a slowworme in expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of importance, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gratulation: &amp; the dullest <hi>Snaile</hi> the meetest Ambassadour to be employed in messages of damage, or condolement. You haue lately, (as appeareth by your Indices of the sicknesse, and so many other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels) very tidely playde the Bees part: and so continue, as you loue me, or your selfe: vnto whom I wish a rich hiue, and many hony-moones. Since I receaued <hi>Parthenophil, Shores wife,</hi> and the <hi>Articles</hi> of accorde, or truce in France, (for which I render you as many thankes, as there be Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles): I haue now also this instant of September, perused your queint, and cunning Discourse of <hi>Remonstrances</hi> to the <hi>Duke de Maine:</hi> with that other new-new Pamflet of the late Turkish assiege of <hi>Sysseck in Croatia,</hi> the old <hi>Libur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> famous for seruiceable Shippes. And take no lesse pleasure in the sounde Declaration of the plaine Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, a credible Historicgrapher, then delight in the sly Information of the fine French, a glicking Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. It is not the externall, but the <hi>internall forme,</hi> (call it the Pith, or the marrow, or the life-bloud, or what you list)
<pb facs="tcp:6476:3"/>
that edifieth: and vndoubtedly the Christian world hath pregnant cause to prostrate the feruentest Zeale of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions to his almighty maiesty, that hath brought <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Croatia</hi> to those termes of Truce, and Triumph. A happy <hi>Truce,</hi> if a happy truce: and an honorable <hi>Triumph,</hi> if durable. I say, <hi>If,</hi> and <hi>If,</hi> bicause I haue knowne many a <hi>Truce,</hi> like Scammony, that weakeneth the liuer; or Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, that enfeebleth the raines; or Agarick, that ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the stomacke; the stomacke, that must worke the feate. And who hath not either by Experience, or by heare-say, or by reading, knowne many a <hi>Triumph,</hi> like Sena, that breedeth winde; or Rubarbe; that dryeth ouer-much; or Euforbium, that inflameth the whole body; the body, that must strike the stroake? Take-away that ouerthrowing, or weakening property from <hi>Truce:</hi> and <hi>Truce</hi> may be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Scammony, Cassia, or Agaricke, to purge noysome, and rebellious humours. Oh that it might be such a Purge in Fraunce. Correct that ventositie, or inflammation, that accompanieth Triumph: and Lo the gallantest Phisique, that nature hath affourded, witt deuised, or magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty practised, to abate the pride of the enemy, and to redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the courage of the frende. No Tobacco, or Panacea so mightily vertuous, as that Physique. Oh that it might be such a Physique in Croatia, in Hungary, in Almany, in the whole Christian world. <hi>Immensum calcar Gloria:</hi> the golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spurre of the braue Grecian, &amp; the worthy Romane. <hi>Pollicy</hi> is Politique: &amp; will not easely be coosened with the muske of the Perfumer, though muske be a sweet Curtesan; or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured with the sugar, &amp; hony of the Cooke, though sugar, &amp; hony be dainty hypocrites; or enueigled with the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaues of the Goldsmith, though gold-leaues be eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; bewitching Oratours; or deluded, that is, betrayed with
<pb facs="tcp:6476:3"/>
any coolerable counterfesance, howsoeuer smoothly enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or gloriously pretending. Priuate medicines are often adulterate: but publique medicines will admit no sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and Pollicy must be well-aduised, before it swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-downe the gilded pilles of flattering pretext. Fraunce hath bene taught to be cautelous in <hi>Truce;</hi> which hath eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soones sucked the sweetnesse of a <hi>Iudas kisse:</hi> and Croatia may learne to be prouident in <hi>Triumph;</hi> which hath often fealt the ioyfulnesse of a <hi>Sampsons post.</hi> Neither Fraunce can be too ielous; nor Croatia too prest; nor Hungary too fierce; nor Almany too hardy; nor any nation too circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, that is beleaguered with such puissant, and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate foes. The house of <hi>Guise</hi> hath lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g hawked and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for a great Crowne: the Duke de <hi>Maine</hi> hath chopped vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a main-cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: Opportunity is a maruelous warriour: The king of <hi>Spaine</hi> a mighty enemy: the <hi>Pope,</hi> an vnrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable aduersary to a Protestant Prince: the <hi>Turke</hi> a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foe to Christian states; and not to be daunted, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed with two, or three petty foiles. <hi>Petty foiles</hi> incense choler, &amp; enrage fury; not allay courage, or disarme power. Were not man a man in himselfe, and God aboue all; alas, what security in a fallible <hi>Truce:</hi> or what repose in a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany <hi>Triumph?</hi> Yet euery <hi>Truce</hi> is respectiuely wellcome: and euery <hi>Triumph</hi> a Pageant of manfull valour, &amp; a Iubile of diuine fauour. For my poore part, (a single Interest in so great affaires) I am as affectionatly glad to find Victory on the better side, as I haue often bene compassionatly sory, (or shall I say? stomachously angry), to read how pitteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Christian hoast hath bene beaten by the Turkish Army, a braue Army, but Turkish. Whose puissance hath long bene, and still is the dishonour of Christendome; and whose Empire cannot waxe, according to their aspiring

deseigne, but Christes kingdome must wane, according to some lamentable Examples. Surely the Onely-wise (for whosoeuer is comparatiuely wise, He is absolutely wise) ordaineth all for the best: and they perish for, or thorough their <hi>owne Folly,</hi> that perish. Homer in humanity hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it: and the Bible in diuinity hath confirmed it. Howbeit true <hi>Wisedome</hi> is valiant in aduersity: and right <hi>Valiancy</hi> wise in prosperity: both euer like themselues, and vnlike the puffes, or bubbles of the world; that know how to disguise, or afflict, but not how to redresse, or solace themselues. <hi>Hope</hi> neuer dispaireth: and no such resolution, as the resolution of <hi>Faith:</hi> a vertue of more wonderfull emproouement by thousandes, then the most miraculous graine of mustard-seede; or whatsoeuer <hi>Nature</hi> ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, <hi>Art</hi> frameth, or <hi>Exercise</hi> atcheiueth most powera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Zeale</hi> hath bene, &amp; may be a maruellous Conquerour, euen beyond the brauest <hi>Confidence,</hi> or fiercest <hi>Fury:</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> was euer the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of wonders, where it was. Christ fauoureth a stout, and inuincible <hi>Constancy</hi> in any good cause: and in his owne cause, (maugre the mainest forces, or suttlelest Pollicies of Mahomet, or the Diuell,) he will finally make them victorious, with <hi>Triumphes</hi> of ioy, and <hi>Trophyes</hi> of honour, that fight his battailes with the hart of <hi>Zeale,</hi> and the hand of <hi>Courage.</hi> Who honoureth not the glorious memory, and the very name of the renowned <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto:</hi> the monument of Don Iohn of Austria, the security of the Venetia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> state, the Halleluia of Christendome, &amp; the Welaway of Turky? Christ blesse his sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dard-bearers, with many <hi>Lepantos,</hi> and <hi>Syssecks:</hi> and make his <hi>militant</hi> Church, an hoast <hi>triumphant.</hi> It hath often bene the meditation of One, that with a politique, and diuine Analysis, hath loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into the successiue proceedings, and fatall ouerthrowes
<pb facs="tcp:6476:4"/>
of Tyrannyes: if <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and his <hi>Alcoran</hi> cannot stand, but <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; his <hi>Euangely</hi> must fall: when the <hi>Great Turke,</hi> continually encroaching, (according to his graund inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, and ambitious deseigne,) is busiest in his hoatest haruest of engrosing and coheaping kingdomes, and with a most greedy appetite runneth-headlong to deuoure the Christian world at a bit; Lord haue mercy vpon thee, <hi>ô little-little Turke. Pride</hi> may exalt his hawty presumptions, and <hi>Prowesse</hi> aduaunce his terrible brauery: but there is a God in heauen: and they cannot laugh long, that make the Diuell laugh, and Christ weepe. Meane-while it were pitty, <hi>Sysseck</hi> should want the glory of such an immortall Memoriall, as some noble, and royall witts haue bestowed vpon the euer-renowned <hi>Lepanto.</hi> Excellent <hi>Vertue,</hi> for a due reward, deserueth excellent <hi>Honour:</hi> and braue <hi>Valour,</hi> for worthy imitation, would be brauely extolled: as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus glorified lason; Homer, Achilles; Virgill, Aeneas; Ariosto, Charlemaine; Tasso, Godfry of Bollen; and so forth. Especially at such an encountring, and surprising Time, as must either floorish, like the Palme of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; or fade, like the Lilly of the valley.</p>
            <p>You know, I am not very prodigall of my discourse with euery one: but I know, vnto whom I write: &amp; he that hath read, and heard so many gallant Florentine Discourses, as you haue done, may the better discerne, what is what: and he that publisheth so many books to the world, as you do, may frame vnto himselfe a priuate, &amp; publique vse of such conference. Few they are, that are qualified to surpasse, or equall those singular Presidents: but they few would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined with a golden fee, or interteined with siluer Curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. Some I know in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> some in <hi>Oxford;</hi> some in <hi>London;</hi> some <hi>elsewhere,</hi> died in the purest graine of <hi>Art,</hi> &amp;

               <hi>Exercise:</hi> but a few in either, and not many in all: that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly can do excellently well, exceedingly well. And were they thorowghly employed according to the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their <hi>Learning,</hi> &amp; <hi>Industry,</hi> who can tell, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison this tongue might wage with the most-floorishing La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guages of Europe: or what an inestimable crop of most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble and soueraine fruite, the hand of <hi>Art,</hi> and the spirite of <hi>Emulation</hi> might reape in a rich, and honorable field? Is not the Prose of <hi>Sir Philip Sidney</hi> in his sweet Arcadia, the embrodery of finest <hi>Art,</hi> and daintiest <hi>VVitt?</hi> Or is not the Verse of M. <hi>Spencer</hi> in his braue Faery Queene, the Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of the diuinest Muses, and gentlest Graces? Both deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Writers: alwayes gallant, often braue, continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable, somtimes admirable. What sweeter tast of Suada, then the Prose of the One: or what pleasanter relish of the Muses, then the Verse of the Other? <hi>Sir Iohn Cheekes</hi> stile was the hony-bee of Plato: and M. <hi>Aschams</hi> Period the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of Isocrates.

What notes I finde aboue Ela in the One: &amp; what counterpoints of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite workemanship I admire in the other: it shall else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where appeare, in a Dialogue, intituled <hi>Pandora,</hi> or the <hi>Mirrour of singularitie.</hi> Might I see the <hi>finest Art,</hi> and the <hi>sweetest nature</hi> in person, I would report me to the Censure of their owne souerain mouthes; the best Iudges in their owne peerlesse faculty. There falleth not a <hi>sentence</hi> from her quill, without sappe, and pith: and euery <hi>Periode</hi> of her stile carrieth marmalad and sucket in the mouth: and euery <hi>argument</hi> of her inuention, sauoreth of most sauory reason. No chaine so linked, as her <hi>Conclusions:</hi> nor any Cristall so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spicuous, as her <hi>Method.</hi> Her whole <hi>discourse,</hi> is the creame of the milke; the combe of the hony; the iuice of the grape: &amp; the marrow of the bone. The <hi>bestowing of her perfections</hi> at occasion, a dainty choice, &amp; fine, marshal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of euery excellency, curiously sorted in their proper places: like the gorgeous <hi>wardrobe of Helena,</hi> or the precious <hi>Iewellhouse of Cleopatra,</hi> or the cunning <hi>stillhouse of Maedea,</hi> or the comely distributing of the <hi>neatest and gallantest furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in the ritchest Oeconomy. What needeth more? <hi>Her beginning,</hi> like the purest Oile in the crowne of the middest

of the rondelet: <hi>her proceeding,</hi> like the souerainest wine in the butt: <hi>her ending,</hi> like the sweetest hoony in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the hoony-pot. Her <hi>intention</hi> was defensiue, not offensiue: and had any thing bene tolerable in that scurrilous and villanous declamation, assuredly she would a thousand times rather haue excused the matter, then accused the maker. <hi>Humanity,</hi> is euer willinger to loue, then to hate, &amp; so is she: <hi>Curtesie,</hi> much forwarder to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, then to disprayse; and so is she: <hi>Clemencie,</hi> infinitly proner to absolue, then to condemne, and so is she. For she is a personall Humanity, a meere Curtesie, and a Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie incorporate. But when she sawe the fowle mouth so shamefully runne-ouer, without all respect of <hi>manners,</hi> or regard of <hi>honestie,</hi> or pretence of <hi>Truth,</hi> or colour of <hi>Reason: Gentlemen,</hi> quoth She, <hi>though I lacke that you haue, the Art of Confuting; yet I haue some suddes of my mother witt, to sowse such a Dish clowte in:</hi> and if sowsing will not serue the turne, I may hap finde a payre of Pinsons, as sharply co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceited, as S.

And as for his terrible crackes of <hi>Gunpowder termes,</hi> neuer lend credit to the word of A Gentlewoman, if I make not old <hi>mother-Gunpowder</hi> of the newest of those <hi>ratling babyes.</hi> And if steeping in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> will infuse courage into his <hi>goose-quill;</hi> why man, I will dowse thee ouer head, and eares in such a dowty <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrium,</hi> as will inspire the Picture of <hi>Snuffe, and Fury,</hi> into the Image of <hi>S. Patience.</hi> I haue not bene squattering at my papers for nothing: and albeit I cannot paint with my pen, like fine <hi>Sappho,</hi> yet I can dawbe with my incke, like none of the <hi>Muses:</hi> and am prettily prouided to interteine <hi>S.

her dainty slaumpaump of <hi>little wit.</hi> A poore kitchin may be as good an Artist for the stomacke, as a poore dairy: (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, that euer S.

            <p>The rest of her speaches, and writings; are to be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or suppressed, as it pleaseth the Horne of these pelting sturres: who may haply finde the Trompet of <hi>Peace,</hi> as suer a Souldiour in case of necessary defence, as the Drumme of <hi>Warre,</hi> or the Swash of <hi>Feude.</hi> Some that haue perused eloquent bookes and researched most curious writinges, haue not seene goodliest variety of vernished phrases, and burnished sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, then in her stile: which was not so gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously decked, and so fairely limned for nought. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit as in some publique causes, better a mischief, then an inconuenience: so in many priuate cases <hi>better an inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, then a mischief.</hi> Though an Orient Gemme be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and worthy to be gazed-vpon with the eye of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, yet better an Orient Gemme sleepe, then a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perish: and better a delicate peece of Art should be layd-aside, or vnwouen like Penelopes web, then an immortal peece of Nature be cast-away. She loueth not to confute, that confuteth itselfe: &amp; I hate to confound, that confoundeth himselfe. She in the Court of Ciuility hath
<pb facs="tcp:6476:12"/>
learned, to embrace <hi>ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement</hi> with the armes of <hi>Curtesie:</hi> and I in the schoole of Diuinity am taught, to kisse <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce</hi> with the lippes of <hi>Charitie.</hi> I affect not any colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable insinuation, in glosing or smoothing termes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall accord: but misery accompany my actions, and the mercy of heauen be my vnmercifull enemy, if I desire not with a longing hart, to wreake my teene vpon wilde vndis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by requiting <hi>good for bad,</hi> &amp; conuerting the worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood of iust offence into the angelica of pure attonement. The onely reason of my demurrer, is my <hi>assurance:</hi> which consisteth rather in <hi>diffidence,</hi> then in <hi>credulitie,</hi> and cannot warrantise itselfe what will be done, vntill it is done. He were very simple, that hauing so heauy causes of diffide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and so light causes of credulity, would runne hastily into the trapp, or suffer himselfe to be presently intangled in the snare. <hi>Parly</hi> is a suttle Sophister: <hi>Flattery</hi> a tickling sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: and <hi>Persuasion</hi> an inchaunting witch. I cannot but listen vnto them with an itching eare, and conceiue as it were a tang of pleasure in mine owne displeasure: but without <hi>Legempone,</hi> wordes are winde, and without actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all performance, all nothing. Had I not more Premisses of distrust, then promises of trust; or were he not euer to be <hi>presumed</hi> a bad fellow, that hath once played the bad fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with a witnesse, (nothing but <hi>contrary proofe</hi> can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse that iudgement): yet Lawyers loue <hi>reall cautions:</hi> and they that would be loth to be enticed by white, and defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by blacke, are curious of their security. <hi>Truce</hi> was euer a redoubtable freind: &amp; <hi>Suspicion</hi> hath cause to looke vpon <hi>Reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation</hi> with a ielous eye. <hi>Reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> is a sweet word: but entire Reconciliation a rare thing, &amp; a strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: whose sweetnesse lyeth not in the tip of the tongue, or in the neb of the pen, but in the bottome of the <hi>hart,</hi> &amp; in
<pb facs="tcp:6476:12"/>
the bowells of the <hi>minde;</hi> the minde that daily emproueth itselfe, the onely deepe Polititian, &amp; inscrutable hypocrite. Whose inwardest secrets notwithstanding, are not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, or close, especially in the shallow brest of inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate youth, but they may in sort be sounded, &amp; discouered by a cunning obseruation of Circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. Some essentiall points I reserue to miselfe: bur M. Wolfe knoweth, &amp; who knoweth not? great <hi>Penmen,</hi> and Pamflet-marchants play much vpon the aduantage of the <hi>time,</hi> and care not who be their enemy, so the <hi>Terme</hi> be their frend. Which of vs can tell, but <hi>there</hi> may lye the drift, &amp; great Pollicy of the new motion? I haue earnestly, and instantly craued personall conference: but that should seeme to make little for his purpose; or might haue bene graunted with lesse suite. All must be done by the mediation of a third, and a fourth; and such an intercourse, as I may probably haue in some ielousie, though I conceiue well of the interposed persons. There hath already bene a large expence of <hi>time:</hi> &amp; <hi>charges</hi> continually runne: &amp; matters of <hi>more importance</hi> lye dead in the neast: &amp; the <hi>burned finger</hi> hath reason to startle from the fire: and he that hath bene <hi>once abused,</hi> would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be abused twice: and <hi>Security</hi> cannot be too precise, or scrupulous: and I would there were no Cunny catchers in London. Till <hi>a publique iniurie</hi> be publiquely confessed, and <hi>Print</hi> confuted in Print, I am one of S. Thomas disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: not ouer-prest to beleeue, but as cause causeth: and very ready to forgiue, as effect effecteth. They that know the daunger of <hi>Truces,</hi> and the couen of <hi>Treatyes,</hi> vt supra, must begge leaue to ground their repose vpon more <hi>cautels,</hi> then one; and to proceede in termes of <hi>suspence,</hi> or <hi>Pause,</hi> till they may be resolued with infallible <hi>assurance.</hi> For mine owne determination, I see no credible hope of
<pb facs="tcp:6476:13"/>
               <hi>Peace,</hi> but in <hi>Warre:</hi> and could I not commaunde, that I desire; I am persuaded, I should hardly obteine, that I wish. I loue <hi>Osculum Pacis;</hi> but hate <hi>Osculum Iudae:</hi> and reuerence the <hi>Teares of Christ;</hi> but feare the <hi>Teares of the Crocodile.</hi> Shall I be alittle plaine? Methinkes the raunging Eyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g haire, (which some would call ruffianly haire) should scarsely yet be bathed in the heauenly Teares of Christ, or washed in the diuine Teares of Penitence. <hi>Irish haire,</hi> and <hi>weeping Irish</hi> are no white Crowes in these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes: and although there be no Wolfes in England, yet there be <hi>Foxes in the hole.</hi> I would be loth to aggrauate the least, or greatest particular against a Penitentiall soule: but still to haunt infamous, or suspected houses, tauernes, lewd company, and riotous fashions, as before, (for to this day his behauiour is no turnecoate, though his stile be a chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geling) is a greater liberty in my small diuinity, then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with that deuoute, and most holy-holy profession. Lord, how curious was the wiser sort euen of the heathen Philosophers, in the neat, &amp; exquisite choice of their pure diet, vndefiled society, Virgin manners, Vnstained dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, and vnspotted actions? What so clarified, as their witt: so purified, as their minde: so sweetened, as their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: so vertuous, as their instruction: so powrefull, as their experiments: so exemplary, as their life: so vnblemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, as their fame? I know not, who weeped the Funerall Teares of Mary Magdalene: I would he that sheddeth the Patheticall Teares of Christ, &amp; trickleth the liquid Teares of Repentance, were no worse affected in pure deuotion, then those Philosophers in morall Conuersation. Were I not content, in some little hope of his finall recouery ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in deede, or in shewe; to do him a meritotious sauour by concealing his vtter discredit: I could easily, and would
<pb facs="tcp:6476:13"/>
notoriously, make him ashamed of some his late Sayings, and Doinges: ô Lord, how Vnbeseeming the Teares of Christ: &amp; Alas, how likely to forerunne a miserable desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? Let him reforme his publique, &amp; redresse his priuate enormities, &amp; with a sincere vowe I sweare him frendship: or let him rest quiet, &amp; I am quiet. Otherwise I may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be induced, to pay him home with an immortall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, that hath plagued his own to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue with desperate <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies in iest:</hi> ô Christ, of how horrible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Teares in earnest?</hi> There is a great distance betwixt Hell, and Heauen: the Diuell, and God: Rakehells, and Sainctes: the <hi>Supplication to the Diuell,</hi> and the <hi>Teares of Christ:</hi> the <hi>Straunge Newes</hi> of Villany, and the miraculous Newes of Repentance: the Herald of Warre, and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour of Peace: the publique Notary of Lyes, and the Register of Truth: the <hi>Diuels Oratour,</hi> and <hi>Christes Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour.</hi> Though <hi>Greene</hi> were a Iulian, and <hi>Marlow</hi> a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian: yet I would be loth, <hi>He</hi> should be an Aretin: that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrased the inestimable bookes of Moses, and discoursed the Capricious Dialogues of rankest Bawdry: that pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one Apology of the diuinity of Christ, and another of Pederastice, a kinde of harlatry, not to be recited: that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished the Life of the blessed Virgin, and the Legende of the Errant Putana: that recorded the history of S.

It was his glory, to be a <hi>hellhounde incarnate,</hi> and to spoile Origen of his egregious praise: <hi>Vbi benè, nemo meliùs: vbi malè, nemo peiùs.</hi> Some surmounting spirites loue to arreare a huge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their excessiue validity <hi>pro,</hi> or <hi>contra.

<pb facs="tcp:6476:14"/>
and like a ridiculous Vice in a Tragedy, or a poisonous Serpent in Paradise. <hi>Non est bonum, ludere cum Sanctis: cum Christo ludere, execrabile.

I would euery Autour, that hath done no better, had done no worse: and it were to be wished, that some desperate wittes were not so forward, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowell the intrails of their owne impious mindes. <hi>Plinyes,</hi> and <hi>Lucians</hi> religion may ruffle, and scoffe awhile: but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme <hi>Vanitie</hi> is the best beginning of that brauery, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme <hi>Miserie</hi> the best end of that felicity. <hi>Greene,</hi> and <hi>Marlow</hi> might admonish other to aduise themselues: and I pray God, the promised Teares of Repentance, proue not the Teares of the Onion vpon the Theater. If I knew no more, then I vtter; I would hope no lesse, then I wish: but hearing what I heare, &amp; conceiuing what I conceiue, I would be vnfainedly glad, he should exceede my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation: and when he hath resolued my incredulity with a little actuall performance, I will not faile to render him right, with extensiue fauour.
