            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas in the Reigne of Our late deare Father, and since Our</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
to the Crowne, vpon mature deliberation three haue been sundry
Proclamations published for restraining the landing of Tobacco to
certaine Ports and Harbours within this Kingdome, and against
planting of the same within this Realme; And for that they haue not
been put in due execution, diuers fraudes and abuses haue beene
of late inuented and put in execution, by mixing of Tobacco, not
onely with other Tobacco of worse condition, but also with other
Materials, falsifying and corrupting the same, to the great hurt and damage of Our people,
both in their estates and persons, which growing euill may in some measure bee preuented, if
the Tobacco brought into this Our Realme shall be layd or landed onely in one Port and place.</p>
            <p>For remedie therefore in that behalfe, and to the end Wee may bee the more truely answered
of the Custome, Impost, and other dueties due vnto Us for Tobacco brought into this Realme
by way of Merchandize, whereof Wee haue been sundry times defrauded by landing the same at
the pleasures of the Owners: Wee doe hereby publish and declare Our Royall will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
That no Tobacco bee hereafter landed, or imported to bee landed at any other Porte, then
in Our Port of <hi>London,</hi> and at no other place of the sayd Port then at the Key and Wharfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the Custome-house Key, scituate in Our Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and other Port or place for
landing of Tobacco Wee doe not admit or allow, but them inhibite.</p>
            <p>And Wee doe hereby straitly charge and command all and singular Customers, Comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
Searchers, Waiters and other Officers, attending in all Our Ports, Creekes, or places of
lading or vnlading, (except Our said Port of <hi>London</hi>) not to take entries of any Tobacco, nor
suffer the same to be taken, landed, or layd on shoare in any other Harbour, Port, Creeke or place
within this Kingdome, vpon paine that euery of the said Officers that shall bee found negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
corrupt or remisse herein, shall vndergoe such paines and penalties, as by the Lawes or
Censure of our Court of Starre-chamber may bee inflicted vpon them for the same.</p>
            <p>And it is Our further will and pleasure, that if any Ship or Barque wherein Tobacco shall
be loaden shall arriue at any other Port or place then at Our sayd Port of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:28634:2"/>
Wee doe hereby giue full power and Authoritie to all and euery the Customers, Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers,
Surueyours, Searchers and Waiters, and euery of them there attending, and doe
command them to take and arrest the same Tobacco, and forthwith to make Certificate to the
Customers of the Port of <hi>London,</hi> of the Owners name of such Ship or other Uessell, and
his place of dwelling, the number and names of the Officers, and Mariners in the same,
the place from whence the same Tobacco came, with the quantitie of Tobacco that shall bee
contained therein.</p>
            <p>And also, that Our said Officers, or some of them, shall with all conuenient speed cause and
procure the Tobacco so by them arrested, to bee carefully transmitted to the said Port of <hi>London,</hi>
to the Customer there, that the same may bee there viewed, and the dueties thereof belonging
vnto Us, may be duely payed and satisfied, and such further order taken with the same, and
with the Owners thereof, as shall be fit.</p>
            <p>And whereas notwithstanding former Proclamations published to the contrary, yet Wee
are informed, that Tobacco is still planted and sowen in diuers parts of Our Realmes of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in contempt of Us and Our Royall Commands declared to the contrary;
We do therefore hereby againe absolutely prohibit the Planting therof in Our said Kingdomes,
as also the bringing into the same of any Seed for the increase thereof, from the parts beyond the
Seas; The Tobacco growing in the Northerne and moist Climats being not onely vnwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
for mans body, but the same maketh fertill grounds become for a long space lesse fruitfull,
that might otherwise produce Corne, Herbes and Rootes for the sustenance of Our Subiects.</p>
            <p>And for the more certaine depressing of the same, We doe hereby straitly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand Our Iustices
of Assize within their seuerall Circuits, Our Iustices of Peace within Our seuerall Counties
of this Kingdome, Maiors, Sheriffes, Bayliffes, and other Our Officers within each Cittie
and Towne Corporate, that they at their seuerall Sittings, Quarter Sessions, and meetings,
giue the same in charge as an Offence, whereof Wee expect due reformation, requiring a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
thereof amongst other the grieuances of the Countrey in their Presentments, And the
names and dwelling places of any Offenders herein, and the qualities of their Offences, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the Lords of Our Priuie Councel, the then next Tearme after euery such Sitting or mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
to the end the Offenders may bee proceeded against by sentence in Our Court of Starre-chamber,
or otherwise, as in iustice shall be thought fit.</p>
            <p>And lastly, We doe by these Presents will and require all and singuler Maiors, Sheriffes,
Iustices of Peace, Bayliffes, Constables, Headboroughes, Customers, Comptrollers, Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
Waiters, and all other Our Officers and Ministers whatsoeuer, that they and euery of
them in their seuerall places and Offices, be diligent and attendant in the execution of this Our
Proclamation, as they will answere the contrary at their vttermost perils.</p>
