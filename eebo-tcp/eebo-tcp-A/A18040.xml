            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I will accordynge to my ſimple know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, reuele vnto you. You ſee, dayly with your eyes, that euery man, if that he be of any reputation, he will ſtande in the ſame, yea, and rather then he wil loſe any parte of his reputation, he will boaſt of the ſame, to make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, that is ignorant of his ſtate, that he is ſome Frankelin, or ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilman borne, then he to vpholde his ſtate, will ſeeme to be a royſtyng gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,

Nowe I wyll not ſeeme to teache a man what exerciſe hee ſhall vſe, for that will I referre to his owne diſcrete minde: but I do ſhewe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormitie whiche enſueth to thoſe, which friuolouſly do ſpend their time in vaine pleaſures of the worlde: as in delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge in Pryde, whiche is the mother of all miſchiefe, and in drunkennes: for when a man or woman is drunke, they are then edicted vnto all miſchiefe, and other vices beſide, whiche I perceyue that the worlde is geuen to, therfore I woulde wiſhe that this may be a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for thoſe the which haue hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to led their liues in ſuche wickedneſſe,

woulde rather exerciſe hym ſelfe in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kyndes of games, as diſinge, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, and other moe, whiche oughte not to be vſed, but rather to be reiected and ſo hee continued the ſpace of ſeuen yeres, in whiche time he had conſumed his fathers ſubſtaunce, ſo muche, that his father dyd ſeeme to withdrawe his greate loue and good wyll from hym, and dyd kepe him in ſo ſhorte, that hee coulde not haue the value of one penye, but his father woulde knowe how that it was beſtowed. Nowe this youthful ſonne, contrary vnto his fathers wyll, woulde priuielye reſorte vnto his olde companions, whoſe companies before hee frequented, and they gaue him ſuch councell, that hee woulde not ſeeme no more to be kepte in at his fathers plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but dyd ſhewe him ſelfe ſo obſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that all his friendes hated him: it came to paſſe that his father dyed, and he poſſeſſed his landes and goodes, &amp; he through his companions entiſement, was ſeduced from all vertuouſe trade and led his life in a moſt ryotous rate, and conſumed it cleane: when all was

Then <hi>Morton</hi> departed with a heauy harte, and came to the houſe wherein hee had ſpente his
<pb facs="tcp:11587:20"/>
ſubſtance, and finding one of his mates there that had wonne his money, and hadde ben a procurer of him to ſpende, when he ſaw him, his hart was fraight with care: remembringe the ſtate hee was in, and the ſtate of the time preſent dyd with his ſworde run hym throwe, and ſo ſlewe him, and then he ſat down and wept bitterly, and for ſorrow ſlewe him ſelfe. Lo ſee his miſerable ende, this hiſtorie I found written in an olde booke in Weſtminſter abbey, whiche booke was written by a Monke of the ſame abbey: I think that this ſtory ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to be trewe, for what care wyl ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perce a mannes harte, then when once hee hathe obteyned the wealthe of the worlde, and afterwarde fall to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, as the Sacred ſcriptures dothe<note place="margin">Luke. 15.</note> teache vs there of the prodigall chylde, whiche ſpente his porcion in riotouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and was neuer careful for to kepe and ſaue the ſame, to the entent that he might, obteine the pleaſure of it an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daye, but riotouſly waſted it, what was his end? the Scriptures do oſtend, he was faine to eate amonge ſwine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11587:20"/>O miſerable ſtate: yet in the ende he repented, and came home to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe, who receyued him very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingely, and did more reioyce in hym, then hee dyd in his ſonne, whiche dydde not in ſuche cauſe offende. Thus you maye ſee always that prodigalitie doth conſume wealth, good name, and fame, it abateth honour, it diſgraceth a mans credite, it cauſeth hate of friendes, and reape the loſſe of fauour, yea, and more<note place="margin">Goddes diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pleaſure is worſt of al</note> then this, it draweth the diſpleaſure of God towardes vs, and maketh manye thinges deere whiche would be plenty, it cauſeth men to ſwarue from God, it reapeth to them perpetuall dampnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the proude harted man mindeth nothynge, but his pryde: the couetouſe man mindeth nothinge but his wealth. I compare Pride and Couetouſneſſe together, becauſe of al vices that is, and are vſed, none doo more reſemble one an other, then theſe two. For hee that is proude, is alwaies couetous and gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>die for to obteyne wealth, to maintayn it, the couetous man is proude in his harte, though he doo not ſhewe it,

exteriorly, or outwardely, but becauſe that I haue treated of Pryde and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie hytherto, I wyll leaue of to ſpeake of other vices, but towche them a little as occaſion ſerueth me, but if I had a thouſand tongues to ſpeake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and a voyce as lowde as braſſe, I coulde not vtter the vices which oughte to be ſpoken of, to the reproche of ſuche as vſe theim at this daye: but forthe I wyll procede as I haue begonne, tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge the fall of Prodigalitie.</p>

            <p>In deede I muſt and wyll commend clenlines and comlines of aparell, vſed with a mediocritie, for it is to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to haue too ſumptuous apparell, to flaunte it in brauerye, and not hable to mainteine it, neyther oughte it to bee too ſimple and poore: but in a means modeſtie, whiche is beſt conuenient for profite and honeſtie.
