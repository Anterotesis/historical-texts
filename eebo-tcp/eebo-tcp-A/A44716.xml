            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Voyage. Sir <hi>Walter</hi> landed at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> whence he thought to make an escape; and some say he hath tampered with his body by Phisick, to make him look sickly, that he may be the more pitied, and permitted to lie in his own house. Count <hi>Gondamar</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador speaks high language, and sending lately to desire Audience of his Majestie, he said he had but one word to tell him, his Majestie wondring what might be delivered in one word; when he came before him, he said onely, <hi>Pyrats, Pyrats, Pyrats,</hi> and so departed.</p>
                        <p>Tis true that he protested against this Voyage before, and that it could not be but for some praedatory designe: And that if it be as I hear, I fear it will go very ill with Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> and that <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damar</hi> will never give him over, till he hath his head off his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; which may quickly be done, without any new Arraignment, by vertue of the old Sentence that lies still dormant against him, which he could never get off by Pardon, notwithstanding that he mainly laboured in it before he went; but his Majestie could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be brought to it, for he said he would keep this as a Curb to hold him within the bounds of his Commission, and the good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Gondamar</hi> cryes out, that he hath broke the sacred Peace twixt the two Kingdoms, That he hath fired and plundered <hi>santo Thoma</hi> a Colony the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had planted with so much blood, neer under the <hi>Line,</hi> which made it prove such a hot service unto him, and where, besides others, he lost his eldest son in the Action; and could they have preserved the Magazin of <hi>Tobacco</hi> onely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other things in that Town, something mought have bin had to countervail the charge of the Voyage. <hi>Gondamar</hi> alleadgeth further, that the enterprise of the myne failing, he propounded to the rest of his Fleet to go and intercept some of the Plate-Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons, with other Designes which would have drawn after them apparent acts of Hostility, and so demands Justice: besides other disasters which fell out upon the dashing of the first designe, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Remish,</hi> who was the main Instrument for discovery of the myne, pistol'd himself in a desperate mood of discontent in his Cabin, in the <hi>Convertine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This return of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> from <hi>Guiana,</hi> puts me in minde of a facetious tale I read lately in <hi>Italian</hi> (for I have a little of that Language already) how <hi>Alphonso</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> sent a <hi>Moor</hi> who had been his Captive a long time, to <hi>Barbary,</hi> with a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sum of money to buy horses, and to return by such a time.

That day the <hi>Moor</hi> was dispatched for <hi>Barbary,</hi> the said Jester waiting upon the King at supper, the King call'd for his Journall, and askt what he had observed that day: thereupon he produced his Table-book, and amongst other things, he read how <hi>Alphons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> had sent <hi>Beltran</hi> the <hi>Moor,</hi> who had been a long time his Prisoner, to <hi>Morocco</hi> (his own Countrey) with so many thousand Crowns, to buy horses. The King asked him why he inserted that: Because, said he, I think he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come back to be a Prisoner again, and so you have lost both man and money. But if he do come, then your Jest is marr'd, quoth the King: No Sir; <hi>for if he return I will blot out your name, and put him in for a</hi> Fool.</p>
                        <p>The Application is easie and obvious: But the world wonders extremely, that so great a wise man as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> would return to cast himself upon so inevitable a Rock, as I fear he will; and much more, that such choice men, and so great a Power of Ships, should all come home, and do nothing.</p>
                        <p>The Letter you sent to my Father, I conveyed safely the last week to <hi>Wales.</hi> I am this week, by Gods help, for the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> and then I think for <hi>France.</hi> If in this my forren employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I may be any way serviceable unto you, you know what pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er you have to dispose of me; for I honor you in a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and will live and die,</p>

                        <p>I Am newly landed at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and it is the first forren earth I ever set foot upon. I was pitifully sick all the Voyage, for the Weather was rough, and the wind untoward; and at the

mouth of the <hi>Texell</hi> we were surprised by a furious Tempest, so that the Ship was like to split upon some of those old stumps of trees wherewith that River is full; for in Ages passed, as the Skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per told me, there grew a fair Forest in that Chanell where the <hi>Texell</hi> makes now her bed. Having bin so rocked and shaken at Sea; when I came ashore I began to incline to <hi>Copernicus</hi> his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which hath got such a sway lately in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Earth as well as the rest of her fellow Elements, is in perpetual motion, for she seem'd so to me a good while after I had landed He that observes the site and position of this Countrey, will never hereafter doubt the truth of that Philosophicall Problem which keeps so great a noise in the Schools, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Sea is higher then the Earth, because as I sail'd along these Coasts, I visibly found it true; for the Ground here which is all twixt Marsh and Moorish, lies not only levell, but to the apparant sight of the ey far lower then the Sea, which made the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> say, That the Inhabitants of this Countrey were the neerest Neighbours to Hell (the great Abysse) of any people upon Earth, because they dwell lowest: Most of that Ground they tread, is plucked as it were out of the very Jaws of <hi>Neptun,</hi> who is afterwards pennt out by high Dikes, which are preserved with incredible charge, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, That the chief <hi>Dike-grave</hi> here, is one of the greatest Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of trust in all the Province, it being in his power, to turn the whole Countrey into a Salt lough when he list, and so to put <hi>Hans</hi> to swim for his life, which makes it to be one of the chiefest part of his Letany, <hi>From the Sea, the Spaniard, and the Devil,</hi> the Lord deliver me.

                        <p>I Am lately arrived in <hi>Holland</hi> in a good plight of health, and continue yet in this Town of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> a Town I beleeve, that there are few her fellows, being from a mean Fishing Dorp, come in a short revolution of time, by a monstrous encrease of Comerce and Navigation, to be one of the greatest Marts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop:</hi> Tis admirable to see what various sorts of Buildings, and new Fabrics, are now here erecting every where; not in houses onely, but in whole Streets and Suburbs; so that tis thought she will in a short time double her proportion in bigness.</p>
                        <p>I am lodg'd in a <hi>French-mans</hi> house, who is one of the Deacons of our <hi>English Brownists</hi> Church here; 'tis not far from the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog</hi>

of <hi>Iews,</hi> who have free and open exercise of their Religion here: I beleeve in this Street where I lodg, ther be well near as many Religions as there be houses; for one Neighbour knows not, nor cares not much, what Religion the other is of, so that the number of Conventicles exceeds the number of Churches here. And let this Countrey call it self as long as it will, the <hi>united</hi> Provinces one way, I am perswaded in this point, there's no place so <hi>Disunited.</hi>

                        <p>The Dog and Rag Market is hard by, where every Sunday morning there is a kind of public Mart for those commodities, notwithstanding their precise observance of the Sabbath.</p>
                        <p>Upon Saturday last I hapned to be in a Gentlemans company, who shew'd me as I walk'd along in the Streets, along Bearded old <hi>Iew</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Aaron;</hi> when the other <hi>Iews</hi> met him, they fell down and kiss'd his Foot: This was that Rabbi, with whom our Countrey-man <hi>Broughton</hi> had such a dispute.</p>
                        <p>This City, notwithstanding her huge Trade, is far inferiour to <hi>London</hi> for populousnes; and this I infer out of their weekly Bills of Mortalitie, which come not at most but to fifty or thereabout; whereas in <hi>London,</hi> the ordinary number is twixt two and three hundred, one week with another: Nor are there such Wealthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in this Town as in <hi>London;</hi> for by reason of the generality of Commerce, the Banks, Adventures, the Common shares and stocks which most have in the <hi>Indian</hi> and other Companies, the Wealth doth'diffuse it self here in a strange kind of equality, not one of the Bourgers being exceeding rich or exceeding poor; Insomuch, that I beleeve our four and twenty Aldermen, may buy a hundred of the richest men in <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> It is a rare thing to meet with a Begger here, as rare, as to see a Horse, they say, upon the Streets of <hi>Venice,</hi> &amp; this is held to be one of their best peeces of Government; for besides the strictnes of their Laws against Mendicants, they have Hospitals of all sorts for young and'old, both for the relief of the one and the employment of the other; so that there is no object here to exercise any act of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon. They are here very neat, though not so magnificent in their Buildings, specially in their Frontispices, and first Rooms; and for cleanlines, they may serve for a pattern to all People. They will presently dresse half a dozen Dishes of Meat, without any noise or shew at all; for if one goes to the Kitchin, ther will he scarce apparance of any thing, but a few covered Pots upon a Turf-fire, which is their prime fuell; after dinner they fall a

                        <p>Twere cheap living here, were it not for the monstrous Accises which are impos'd upon all sorts of Commodities, both for Belly and Back; for the Retailer payes the <hi>States</hi> almost the one Moity as much as he payed for the Commodity at first, nor doth any murmur at it, because it goes not to any Favourit, or private Purse, but to preserve them from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> their common Enemy as they term him; so that the saying is truely verified here, <hi>Desend me, and spend me:</hi> With this Accise principally, they maintain all their Armies by Sea and Land, with their Garrisons at home and abroad, both here, and in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and defray all other public charges besides.</p>
                        <p>I shall hence shortly for <hi>France,</hi> and in my way take most of the prime Towns of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> specially <hi>Leyden</hi> (the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity) where I shall sojourn some days.

blossoming as it were in every Line; I mean those sweet expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Love and Wit, which in every period were intermingled with so much Art, that they seem'd to contend for mastery which was the strongest: I must confesse, that you put me to hard shifto to correspond with you in such exquisit strains and raptures of <hi>Love,</hi> which were so lively, that I must needs judg them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the motions, from the <hi>Diastole</hi> and <hi>Systole</hi> of a Heart truly affected; certainly your heart did dictat every syllable you writ, and guided your hand all along: Sir, give me leave to tell you, that not a dram, nor a doze, not a scruple of this pretious <hi>love</hi> of yours is lost, but it is safely tresur'd up in my Brest, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd in like proportion to the full, mine to you is as cordiall, it is passionat and perfect, as <hi>love</hi> can be.</p>

I was yesterday to wait upon Sir <hi>Herbert Croft</hi> at Saint <hi>Germains,</hi> where I met with a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, who amongst other curiosities, which he pleased to shew me up and down <hi>Paris,</hi> brought me to that place where the late King was slain, and to that wher the Marquis of <hi>Ancre</hi> was shot, and so made me a punctuall relation of all the circumstances of those two acts; which in regard they were rare, and I beleeve two of the notablest Accidents that ever happen'd in <hi>France,</hi> I thought it worth the labour to make you partaker of som part of his discours.</p>

                           <hi>France</hi> as all Christendom besides (for ther was then a truce twixt <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Hollander</hi>) was in a profound Peace, and had continued so twenty yeers together, when <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth fell upon some great Martiall design, the bottome whereof is not known to this day; and being rich (for he had heap'd up in the <hi>Bastile</hi> a mount of Gold that was as high as a Lance) he levied a huge Army of 40000 men, whence came the Song, <hi>The King of France with fourty thousand men,</hi> and upon a sudden he put this Army in perfect equippage, and some say he invited our Prince <hi>Henry</hi> to come unto him to be a sharer in his exploits: But going one afternoon to the <hi>Bastile,</hi> to see his Tresure and Ammunition, his Coach stopp'd suddenly, by reason of some Colliers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Carts that were in that narrow street; whereupon one <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villac</hi> a lay Jesuit (who had a whole twelve month watch'd an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to do the act) put his foot boldly upon one of the wheels of the Coach, and with a long Knife stretch'd himself over their shoulders who were in the Boot of the Coach, and reach'd the King at the end, and stab'd him right in the left side to the heart, and pulling out the fatall Steel, he doubled his thrust; the

King with a ruthfull voice cryed out, <hi>Ie suis blesse</hi> (I am hurr) and suddenly the bloud issued at his mouth: The Regicide villain was apprehended, and command given, that no violence should be offered him, that he might be reserv'd for the law, and som exquisit torture. The Queen grew half distracted hereupon, who had been crown'd Queen of <hi>France</hi> the day before in great tryumph; but a few days after she had something to countervail, if not to overmatch her <hi>sorrow;</hi> for according to Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> law, she was made Queen Regent of <hi>France</hi> during the Kings Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who was then but about years of Age: Many consultations were held how to punish <hi>Revillas,</hi> and ther were some <hi>Italia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>This Kingdom since the young King hath taken the Scepter into his own hands doth flourish very much with quietnes and Commerce; nor is there any motion or the least tintamar of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in any part of the Countrey, which is rare in <hi>France.</hi> Tis true, the Queen Mother is discontented since She left her Regency, being confin'd, and I know not what it may com unto in time, for she hath a strong party, and the murthering of her Marquis of <hi>Ancre</hi> will yet bleed as som fear.</p>
                        <p>I was lately in societie of a Gentleman, who was a Spectator of that Tragedie, and he pleas'd to relate unto me the particulars of it, which was thus: When <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth was slain, the Queen Dowager took the Reins of the Government into her hands during the young Kings Minority; and amongst others whom she advanc'd Signor <hi>Conchino,</hi> a <hi>Florentin,</hi> and her Foster-Brother was one; Her countenance came to shine so strongly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, that he became her onely confident and favourit, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that she made him Marquis of <hi>Ancre,</hi> one of the twelve

The Captain of your Guard; why? Because he would have drawn his Sword at Your Majesties Royall Commission, then the King replied, <hi>Vitry hath done well, and I will maintain the act:</hi> Presently the Queen Mother had all her Guard taken from her, except six men and sixteen Women, and so she was banish'd <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and commanded to retire to <hi>Blois: Ancre's</hi> Body was buried that night in a Church hard by the Court, but the next morning, when the Laquays and Pages (who are more unhappy here then the <hi>Apprentises</hi> in <hi>London</hi>) broke up his Grave, tore his Coffin to peeces, rip'd the Winding-Sheet, and tied his Body to an Asses Tail, and so dragg'd him up and down the Gutters of <hi>Paris,</hi> which are none of the sweetest; they then slic'd off his Ears, and nail'd them upon the Gates of the City, they cut off his Genito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (and they say he was hung like an Asse) and sent them for a present to the Duke of <hi>Main,</hi> the rest of his Body, they carried to the New-Bridg, and hung him his Heels upwards, and Head downwards upon a new Gibbet, that had bin set up a little before to punish them who should speak ill of the present Government, and it was his chance to have the Maiden-head of it himself: His

                        <p>MY dear <hi>Tom,</hi> I had no sooner set foot upon this Soyl, and breath'd <hi>Spanish</hi> ayr, but my thoughts presently reflected upon you: Of all my frends in <hi>England,</hi> you were the first I met here, you were the prime object of my speculation; me thought the very Winds in gentle whispers did breath out your name, and blow it on me; you seem'd to reverberat upon me with the Beams of the Sun, which you know hath such a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full influence, and indeed too great a stroke in this Countrey: And all this you must ascribe to the operations of Love, which hath such a strong virtuall force, that when it fastneth upon a pleasing subject, it sets the imagination in a strange fit of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it imployes all the faculties of the Soul, so that not one Cell in the Brain is idle, it busieth the whole inward man, it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the heart, amuseth the understanding, it quickneth the fancy,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97056:31"/>
and leads the will as it were by a silken thred to cooperat with them all: I have felt these motions often in me, specially at this time, that my memory fixed upon you: But the reason that I fell first upon you in <hi>Spain,</hi> was, that I remembred I had heard you often discoursing how you had received part of your educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, which brought you to speak the Language so exactly well: I think often of the Relations I have heard you make of this Countrey, and the good instructions you pleas'd to give me.</p>
                        <p>I am now in <hi>Barcelona,</hi> but the next week I intend to go on through <hi>your</hi> Town of <hi>Valencia</hi> to <hi>Alicant,</hi> and thence you shall be sure to hear from me further, for I make account to Winter there. The Duke of <hi>Ossuna</hi> pass'd by here lately, and having got leave of Grace to release some slaves, he went aboard the <hi>Cape-Gallie,</hi> and passing through the Churm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>Ther is a Tradition, that ther were divers Mynes of Gold in Ages pass'd amongst those Mountains: And the Shepherds that kept Goats then, having made a small fire of Rosemary stubs, with other combustible stuff to warm themselves, this fire graz'd along, and grew so outragious, that it consum'd the very Entrails
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97056:32"/>
of the Earth, and melted those Mynes, which growing fluid by liquefaction, ran down into the small Rivelets that were in the Valleys, and so carried all into the Sea, that monstrous Gulph which swalloweth all, but seldom disgorgeth any thing; and in these Brooks to this day som small Grains of Gold are found.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Viceroy</hi> of this Countrey hath taken much pains to clear these Hills of Robbers, and ther hath bin a notable havock made of them this yeer; for in divers Woods as I pass'd, I might spie som Trees laden with dead Carcases, a better Fruit far then <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> Tree bore, wheron a Woman had hang'd her self, which the <hi>Cynic</hi> cryed out to be the best bearing Tree that ever he saw.</p>
                        <p>In this place ther lives neither <hi>English</hi> Marchant or Factor, which I wonder at, considering that it is a Maritim Town, and one of the greatest in <hi>Spain;</hi> her chiefest Arsenal for Gallies, and the Scale by which she conveys her Moneys to <hi>Italy;</hi> but I believe the reason is, that ther is no commodious Port here for Ships of any burden, but a large Bay. I will inlarge my self no further at this time, but leave you to the guard and guidance of God, whose sweet hand of protection hath brought me through so many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth places and difficulties to this Citie: So hoping to meet your Letters in <hi>Alicant,</hi> wher I shall Anchor a good while, I rest</p>

                           </hi> stands like a Gold Ring in a Bears Muzzle: We pass'd also by <hi>Aetna,</hi> by the <hi>Infames Scopules, Acroceraunia,</hi> and through <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis,</hi> about which the ancient Poets, both Greek, and Latin, keep such a coyl, but they are nothing so horrid or dangerous, as they make them to be; they are two white keen-pointed Rocks, that lie under water diametrically opposed, and like two Dragons defying one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and ther are Pylots, that in small Shallops, are ready to steer all ships that pasle: This amongst divers other, may serve for an instance, That the old Poets used to heighten and hoise up things by their ayrie fancies above the reality of truth: <hi>Aetna</hi> was very furious when we pass'd by, as she useth to be somtimes more then other, specialy when the wind is Southward, for then she is more subject to belching out flakes of fire (as Stutterers use to flammer more when the wind is in that hole) som of the sparkles fell aboard of us; but they would make us beleeve in <hi>Syracusa</hi> now <hi>Messina,</hi> that <hi>Aetna</hi> in times pass'd, hath eructated such huge gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets of fire, that the sparks of them have burnt houses in <hi>Malta,</hi> above fifty miles off, transported thither by a direct strong wind: We pass'd hard by <hi>Corinth,</hi> now <hi>Ragusa,</hi> but I was not so <hi>happy</hi> as to touch there, for you know</p>

                        <p>I Found a Letter of yours that had lain dormant here a good while in Mr. <hi>Symns</hi> hands, to welcom me to <hi>Venice,</hi> and I thank you for the variety of news wherwith she went sreighted; for she was to me, as a Ship richly laden from <hi>London</hi> useth to be to our Marchants here, and I esteem her Cargazon at no lesse a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, for she inrich'd me with the knowledg of my Fathers health, and your own, with the rest of my Brothers, and Sisters, in the Countrey, with divers other passages of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; besides, she went also ballasted with your good instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which as Marchants use to do of their commodities, I will turn to the best advantage, and <hi>Italy</hi> is no ill Market to improve any thing; the onely <hi>procede</hi> (that I may use the mercantil term) you can expect, is thanks, and this way I shall not be wanting to make you rich returns.</p>
                        <p>Since I came to this Town I dispatch'd sundry businesses of good value for Sir <hi>Robert Mansell,</hi> which I hope will give content: The art of Glasse-making here is very highly valued, for whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be of that profession, are Gentlemen <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and it is not without reason, it being a rare kind of knowledg and chymistry, to transmute Dust and Sand (for they are the onely main Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients) to such a diaphanous pellucid dainty body as you see a Crystal-Glasse is, which hath this property above Gold or Silver or any other minerall, to admit no poyson; as also, that it never, wastes or loseth a whit of its first weight, though you use it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so long: When I saw so many sorts of curious Glasses made here, I thought upon the complement which a Gentleman put upon a Lady in <hi>England,</hi> who having five or six comly Daughters, said, <hi>He never saw in his life, such a dainty Cupboard of Crystall-Glasses;</hi> the complement proceeds it seems from a saying they have here, <hi>That the first handsom Woman that ever was made, was made of Venice-Glasse,</hi> which implies <hi>Beuty, but brittlenes withall</hi> (and <hi>Venice</hi> is not unfurnish'd with som of that mould, for no place abounds more with Lasses and Glasses) but considering the brittlenes of the Stuff, it was an odd kind of melancholly in him,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97056:37"/>
that could not be perswaded, but he was an <hi>Urinal,</hi> surely he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd to be piss'd in the mouth: But when I pried into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and observ'd the Furnaces and the Calcinations, the Transubstantintions, the Liquefactions that are incident to this Art, my thoughts were rais'd to a higher speculation; that if this small Furnace-fire hath vertue to convert such a small lump of dark Dust and Sand into such a specious clear Body as Crystall, surely, that gran Universall-site, which shall happen at the day of judgment, may by its violent-ardor <hi>vitrifie</hi> and turn to one lump of Crystall, the whole Body of the Earth; nor am I the first that fell upon this conceit.</p>
                        <p>I will in large my self no further to you at this time, but conclude with this Tetrastic which my Brain ran upon in my Bed this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

                        <p>I Am now in the Gentle City of <hi>Naples,</hi> a Citie swelling with all delight, Gallantry and Wealth; and truely, in my opinion, the King of <hi>Spains</hi> greatnes appears here more emminently, then in <hi>Spain</hi> it self: This is a delicat luxurious Citie, fuller of true-bred Cavaliers, then any place I saw yet. The Clime is hot, and the constitutions of the Inhabitants more hot.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Napolitan</hi> is accounted the best Courtier of Ladies, and the greatest embracer of pleasure of any other peeple: They say ther is no lesse here then twenty thousand Courtizans registred in the office of <hi>Savelli.</hi> This Kingdom with <hi>Calabria,</hi> may be said to be the one Moytie of <hi>Italy,</hi> it extends it self 450. miles, and spreds in bredth 112; it contains 2700 Towns, it hath 20 Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops 127 Bishops, 13 Princes, 24 Dukes, 25 Marquisses, and 800 Barons. Ther are three Presidiall Castles in this Citie; and though the Kingdom abound in rich Staple commodities, as Silks, Cottons, and Wine, and that ther is a mighty Revenue comes to the Crown; yet the King of <hi>Spain</hi> when he casts up his account at the yeers end, makes but little benefit therof, for it is eaten up twixt Governours, Garrisons, and Officers. He is forc'd to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 4000 <hi>Spanish</hi> Foot, call'd the <hi>Tercia</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> in the Castles he hath 1600 in perpetuall Garrison; he hath 1000 men of Arms, 450 Light-Horse; besides ther are five Footmen enroll'd for evry hundred Fire; And he had need to do all this, to keep this voluptuous people in aw; for the Story musters up seven and twenty famous Rebellions of the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> in lesse then 300 yeers: But now they pay soundly for it, for one shall hear them groan up and down under the <hi>Spanish</hi> yoak; And commonly the King of <hi>Spain</hi> sends som of his <hi>Grandes</hi> hither, to repair their decayed fortunes, whence the saying sprung, <hi>That the Viceroy of</hi> Sicily <hi>gnaws, the Governour of</hi> Milan <hi>Eats, but the Viceroy of</hi> Naples <hi>devoures.</hi> Our <hi>English</hi> Merchants here, beat a considerable Trade, and their Factors live in better Equippage, and in a more splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did manner, as in all <hi>Italy</hi> besides, then their Masters and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalls in <hi>London,</hi> they ruffle in Silks and Sattins, and wear good <hi>Spanish</hi> Leather-Shooes, while their Masters-Shooes upon our

At <hi>Puzzoli</hi> not far off amongst the <hi>Grotts,</hi> ther are so many strange stupendous things, that nature her self seem'd to have studied of purpose how to make her self there admir'd: I reserve the discoursing of them with the nature of the <hi>Tarantola,</hi> and <hi>Manna</hi> which is gatherd'd here and no wher else, with other things, till I shall see you, for they are fitter for discours then a Letter. I will conclude with a Proverb they have in <hi>Italy</hi> of this people.</p>

                        <p>THis Letter comes to kisse your hands from fair <hi>Florence,</hi> a Citie so beutifull, that the great Emperour (<hi>Charls</hi> the fifth) said, <hi>That she was fitting to be shewn, and seen onely upon Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidayes:</hi> She marvailously flourisheth with Buildings, with Wealth and Artisans; for it is thought that in Serges, which is but one commodity, ther are made two millions evry yeer: All de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of people live here not onely well, but splendidly well, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the manifold exactions of the Duke, upon all things: For none can buy here Lands or Houses, but he must pay eight in the hundred to the Duke; none can hire or build a House, but he must pay the tenth penny; none can marry, or commerce suite in Law, but ther's a Fee to the Duke; none can bring as much as an Egg or Sallet to the Market, but the Duke hath share therinna: Moreover, <hi>Ligorn</hi> which is the Key of <hi>Toscany,</hi> being a Maritim, and a great Mercantil Town, hath mightily inrich'd this Countrey by being a Frank Port to all comers, and a safe rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz to Pyrats, as well as to Marchants. Add hereunto, that the Duke himself in som respect is a Marchant, for he somtimes ingrosseth all the Corn of the Countrey, and retails it at what rate he pleaseth. This inables the Duke to have perpetually 20000 men inroll'd, train'd up, and payed, and none but they can carry Arms; he hath 400 Light-Horse in constant pay, and 100 men at Arms besides; and all these quartered in so narrow a compasse, that he can command them all to <hi>Florence</hi> in twenty four hours. He hath twelve Gallies, two Galeons, and six Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leasses besides, and his Gallies, are call'd, <hi>The black Fleet,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they annoy the <hi>Turk</hi> more in the bottom of the <hi>Straits,</hi> then any other.</p>
                        <p>This State is bound to keep good quarter with the Pope, more then others; for all <hi>Toscany</hi> is fenc'd by Nature her self, I

mean with Mountains, except towards the Territories of the Apostolic <hi>See,</hi> and the <hi>Sea</hi> it self, therfore it is call'd a <hi>Countrey of Iron.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Dukes Palace is so spacious, that it occupieth the Room of fifty Houses at least; yet though his Court surpasseth the bounds of a Duke's, it reacheth not to the Magnificence of a King's: The Pope was sollicited to make the gran Duke a King, and he answer'd, That he was content he should be King <hi>in Tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,</hi> not of <hi>Toscany;</hi> wherupon one of his Counsellors replied, That it was a more glorious thing to be a <hi>gran</hi> Duke, then a <hi>petty</hi> King.</p>

                        <p>From the time they began to finger the <hi>Indian</hi> Geld, and that this Town hath bin the <hi>Scale</hi> by which he hath conveyed his Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to <hi>Flanders,</hi> since the VVars in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his Armies, and that she hath got som priviledges for the exportation of VVools, and other commodities (prohibited to others) out of <hi>Spain,</hi> she hath improv'd extremely in riches, and made Saint <hi>George</hi>'s Mount swell higher then Saint <hi>Marks</hi> in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>She hath bin often ill favouredly shaken by the <hi>Venetian,</hi> and hath had other enemies, which have put her to hard shifts for her own defence, specially in the time of <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh of <hi>France;</hi> at which time, when she would have given her self up to him for Protection, King <hi>Lewis</hi> being told that <hi>Genoa</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be his, he answerd, <hi>She should not be his long, for he would give her up to the devill, and rid his hands of her.</hi>

                        <p>Amongst other customs they have in that Town, one is, That none must carry a pointed Knif about him, which makes the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> who is us'd to <hi>Snik and Snee,</hi> to leave his Horn-sheath and Knif a Shipboard when he comes a shore: I met not with an <hi>Englishman</hi> in all the Town; nor could I learn of any Factour of ours that ever resided there.</p>
                        <p>Ther is a notable little active Republic towards the midst of <hi>Toscany,</hi> call'd <hi>Luca,</hi> which in regard she is under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours protection, he dares not meddle withall, though she lie as a Partridg under a Faulcons Wings, in relation to the gran Duke; besides ther is another reason of the State, why he meddles not with her, because she is more beneficiall unto him now that she is free, and more industrious to support this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, then if she were becom his vassall; for then it is probable, she would grow more carelesse and idle, and so could not vent his commodities so soon, which she buyes for ready money, wherin most of her wealth consists: Ther is no State that winds the peny more nimbly, and makes quicker returns.</p>
                        <p>She hath a Counsell call'd the <hi>Discoli,</hi> which pryes into the profession and life of evry one, and once a yeer they rid the State of all Vagabonds: So that this petty, pretty Republic, may not be improperly parellell'd to a Hive of Bees, which have bin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the emblems of industry and order.</p>
                        <p>In this splendid City of <hi>Florence,</hi> ther be many rarities, which if I should insert in this Letter, it would make her swell too big, and indeed they are fitter for Parol Communication. Here is the prime dialect of the <hi>Italian</hi> spoken, though the pronunciation be a little more guttural, then that of <hi>Siena,</hi> and that of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which occasions the Proverb,</p>

                        <p>I Am now upon point of shaking hands with <hi>Italy;</hi> for I am com to <hi>Turin,</hi> having already seen <hi>Uenice</hi> the rich, <hi>Padoua</hi> the learned, <hi>Bologna</hi> the fat, <hi>Rome</hi> the holy, <hi>Naples</hi> the gentle, <hi>Genoa</hi> the proud, <hi>Florence</hi> the fair, and <hi>Milan</hi> the great; from this last, I came hither, and in that City also appears the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of <hi>Spains</hi> Monarchy very much: The Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> is alwayes Captain Generall of the Cavalry to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> thorowout <hi>Italy:</hi> The Dnke of <hi>Feria</hi> is now Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and being brought to kisse his hands, he us'd me with extraordinary respect, as he doth all of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being by the maternall side a <hi>Dormer.</hi> The <hi>Spaniard</hi> entertains there also 3000 Foot, 1000 Light-Horse, and 600 men at Arms in perpetuall pay; so that I beleeve the benefit of that Dutchy also, though seated in the richest Soyl of <hi>Italy,</hi> hardly countervails the charge. Three things are admir'd in <hi>Milan,</hi> the <hi>Dome</hi> or great Church (built all of white Marble, within and without) the Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall, and the Castle, by which the Cittadell of <hi>Antwerp</hi> was trac'd, and is the best condition'd Fortresse of Christendom: Though <hi>Nova Palma</hi> a late Fortresse of the <hi>Venetian</hi> would go beyond it, which is built ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exact Rules of the most modern Engin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, being of a round form with nine Bastions, and a street levell to evry Bastion.</p>

                        <p>This is a stately rich Town, and a renowned Mart for the Silks of <hi>Italy,</hi> and other Levantin commodities, and a great bank for mony, and indeed the greatest of <hi>France.</hi> Before this Bank was founded, which was by <hi>Henry</hi> the first, <hi>France</hi> had but little Gold and Silver, insomuch, that we read how King <hi>Iohn</hi> their Captive King, could not in four yeers, raise sixty thousand Crowns to pay his Ransome to our King <hi>Edward;</hi> And Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> was in the same case when he was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner in Egypt, wher he had left the Sacrament for a gage; But after this Bank was erected, it fill'd <hi>France</hi> full of money; They of <hi>Luca, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> with the <hi>Venetian,</hi> got quickly over the Hils, and brought their moneys hither to get twelve in the hundred profit, which was the interest at first, though it be now much lower.</p>

                        <p>BEing so neer the Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> curiosity would carry anyone to see it: The Inhabitants of that Town, me thinks, are made of another past differing from the affable nature of those peeple I had convers'd withall formerly; they have one policy, lest that their pretty Republic should be pester'd with fugitives, their Law is, <hi>That what stranger soever flies thither for sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he is punishable there, in the same degree, as in the Country wher he committed the offence.</hi>

                           <hi>Geneva</hi> is govern'd by four Syndncs, and four hundred Senators: She lies like a Bonetwixt three Mastiffs, the Emperour, the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> they all three look upon the Bone, but neither of them dare touch it sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for fear the other two would flie upon him: But they say the Savoyard hath the justest Title, for ther are Imperiall Records extant, <hi>That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the</hi> Bishops <hi>of</hi> Geneva <hi>were</hi> Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and Temporall, <hi>yet they should acknowledge the</hi> Duke of Savoy <hi>for their</hi> Superiour: This man's Ancestors went frequently to the Town, and the Keys were presently tender'd to him.

                        <p>Before I part with this famous City of <hi>Lions,</hi> I will relate unto you a wonderfull strange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that happen'd here not many yeers ago: Ther is an Officer call'd <hi>Le Chevalier du Guet</hi> (which is a kind of Night-guard) here as well as in <hi>Paris,</hi> and his Lieutenant call'd <hi>Iaquette,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving supp'd one night in a rich Marchants house, as he was passing the round afterwards, he said, <hi>I wonder what I have eaten and drunk at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants house, for I find my self so hot, that if I met with the</hi> Divels Dam <hi>to night, I should not forbear using of her;</hi> hereupon, a little after he overtook a young Gentlewoman mask'd, whom he would needs usher to her lodging, but discharg'd all his Watch, except two: she brought him, to his thinking, to a little low lodging hard by the City Wall, wher ther were only two Rooms: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had enjoyed her, he desir'd, that according to the custom of <hi>French</hi> Gentlemen, his two Camerads might partake also of the same plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; so she admitted them one after the other:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97056:53"/>
And when all this was don, as they sat together, she told them, if they knew well, who she was, none of them would have ventur'd upon her; thereupon she whissel'd three times, and all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd: The next morning, the two souldiers that had gon with Lieutenant Jaquette were found dead under the City Wall, amongst the ordure and excrements, and <hi>Iaquette</hi> himself a little way off half dead, who was taken up, and coming to himself, confess'd all this, but died presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>The next week I am to go down the <hi>Loire</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Paris,</hi> and thence as soon as I can for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> wher amongst the rest of my frends, whom I so much long to see after this Trienniall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, you are like to be one of my first objects; In the mean time, I wish the same happinesse may attend you at <hi>home,</hi> as I desire to attend me <hi>hom-ward;</hi> for I am</p>

                        <p>But to return to my first discours whence this digression hath snatchd me, The <hi>Netherlands</hi> who had bin formerly knit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred under one Soverain Prince, were thus dismembred; And as they subsist now, They are a <hi>State</hi> and a <hi>Province:</hi> The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> having ten of the 17. at least, is far greater, more populous, better soyld, and more stor'd with Gentry. The <hi>State</hi> is the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and stronger, the one proceeding from their vast Navigation and Commerce, the other from the qualitie of their Countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defensible by Rivers and Sluces, by meanes wherof they can suddenly overwhelm all the whole Countrey, witnes that stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious siege of <hi>Leyden</hi> and <hi>Haerlam,</hi> for most of their Towns the marks being taken away are inaccessible by reason of shelfs of sands. Touching the transaction of these <hi>Provinces</hi> which the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> made as a dowry to the Archduke <hi>Albertus,</hi> upon marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with the <hi>Infanta</hi> (who therupon left his red Hat, and <hi>Toledo</hi> Miter the chiefest spirituall Dignity in Christendom for revenue after the Papacy) it was fringd with such cautelous restraints, that he was sure to keep the better end of the staff still to himself: for he was to have the tutele and ward of his children, that they were to marry with one of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Family recommended by <hi>Spain,</hi> and in default of issue, and in case <hi>Albertus</hi> should survive the <hi>Infanta,</hi> he should be but Governor only: Add hereunto that King <hi>Philip</hi> reserv'd still to himself all the Cittadells and Castles, with the order of the golden Fleece, wherof he is Master, as he is Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi>

Ther are two supreme Counsells, the Privy Counsell, and that of the State; this treats of confederations and intelligence with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Princes, of Peace and War, of entertaining or of dismissing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonells and Captains, of Fortifications, and they have the surinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the highest affairs that concern the Prince and the policy of the <hi>Provinces.</hi> The privat hath the granting of all Patents and Requests, the publishing of all Edicts and Proclamations, the prising of Coin, the looking to the confines and extent of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> and the enacting of all new Ordinances. Of these two Counsells ther is never a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but in the actuall Counsell of War their voices are predominant: Ther is also a Court of Finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or Exchequer, whence all they that have the fingring of the Kings money, must draw a discharge. Touching matters of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, their Law is mixt between Civill and common with some clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Canonicall: The high Court of Parliament is at <hi>Maline,</hi> whither all Civill Causes may be brought by appeal from other Towns, except som that have municipall Privileges, and are soverain in their owne jurisdictions, as <hi>Mons in Henalt,</hi> and a few more.</p>
                        <p>The prime <hi>Province</hi> for dignity is <hi>Brabant,</hi> which amongst many other privileges it enjoyeth, hath this for one, not to appear upon any summons out of its owne precinct, which is one of the reasons why the Prince makes his residence there: but the prime for extent and fame is <hi>Flanders</hi> the chiefest Earldom in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, which is three dayes journey in length; <hi>Ghent,</hi> its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, is reputed the greatest town of Europe, whence arose the Proverb, <hi>Les flamen tient un gan, qui tiendrá Paris dedans.</hi> But the beautifullest, richest, strongest, and most privileg'd City is <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> being the <hi>Marquisat</hi> of the holy Empire, and drawing nere to the nature of a <hi>Hans</hi> Town, for she payes the Prince no other Tax but the Impost. Before the dissociation of the seventeen <hi>Provinces,</hi> this Town was one of the greatest Marts of Europe, and greatest bank this side the <hi>Alpes,</hi> most Princes having their Factors here, to take up, or let out moneys, and here our <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham</hi> got all his wealth, and built our Royall Exchange by modell of that here. The Merchandise was brought hither from <hi>Germany, France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> by Land, and from <hi>England, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Hans</hi>

Therfore there is no town under the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke where the States have more conceal'd friends than in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> who would willingly make them her Masters in hope to recover her former commerce which after the last twelve years truce began to revive a little, the States permitting to passe by <hi>Lillo's</hi> sconce which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands the river of <hi>Skeld</hi> and lyeth in the teeth of the Town som small cross-saild ships to passe hither: There is no place hath been more passive than this, and more often pillag'd; amongst other times she was once plunder'd most miserably by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of a Priest, immediatly upon <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria's</hi> death, she had then her <hi>Stat-house</hi> burn'd, which had cost a few years before above twenty thousand Crowns the building, and the spoils that were carried away thence amounted to forty Tuns of gold: Thus she was reduc'd not only to poverty, but a kind of captivity, being commanded by a Citadell, which she preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Garrison; this made the Merchant retire and seek a more free Randevous, som in <hi>Zeland,</hi> som in <hi>Holland,</hi> specially in <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> which rose upon the fall of this Town, as <hi>Lisbon</hi> did from <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> upon the discovery of the Cape of good Hope, though <hi>Venice</hi> be not nere so much crestfall'n.</p>
                        <p>I will now steer my discours to the united <hi>Provinces</hi> as they term themselves, which are six in number, <hi>viz. Holland, Zeland, Frisland, Overyssell, Gronninghen</hi> and <hi>Utrecht,</hi> three parts of <hi>Gilderland,</hi> and some Frontire Towns and places of contribution in <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders:</hi> In all these ther is no innovation at all introduc'd, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this great change in point of Government, except that the College of States represents the Duke or Earl in times pass'd, which College consists of the chiefest Gentry of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, surintendants of Towns, and the principall Magistrates: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Province</hi> and great Town choose yearly certain Deputies, to whom they give plenary power to deliberat with the other States of all affairs touching the public welfare of the whole <hi>Province,</hi> and what they vote stands for Law.

                        <p>THose many undeserved favors for which I stand oblig'd to your self and my noble Lady, since the time I had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines to com first under your roof, and the command you pleas'd to lay upon me at my departure thence, call upon me at this time to give you account how matters passe in <hi>France.</hi>

The King declares that he proceeds not against them for their Religion which he is still contented to tolerat, but for holding an Assembly against his Declarations. They answer that their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly is grounded upon his Majesties royal Warrant, given at the dissolution of the last Assembly at <hi>Lodun,</hi> wher he solemnly gave his word to permit them to re-assemble when they would six months as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The King is so incens'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, that their Deputies can have neither accesse to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor audience of his Counsell, as they stile themselves the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Assembly at <hi>Rochell;</hi> but if they say they com from the whole body of Them of the pretended reform'd Religion, he will hear them. The breach between them is grown so wide, that the King resolves upon a fiege. This resolution of the Kings is much

somented by the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, specially by the <hi>Celestines,</hi> who have 200000 Crowns of gold in the <hi>Arsenal</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> which they would sacrifice all to this service, besides the Pope sent him a Bull to levy what sums he would of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of this design: This resolution also is much push'd on by the Gentry, who besides the particular emploiments and pay they shall receive hereby, are glad to have their young King train'd up in Arms to make him a Martiall man; But for the Merchant and poor Peasan, they tremble at the name of this War, fearing their teeth should be set on edge with those soure grapes their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tasted in the time of the <hi>League,</hi> for if the King begin with <hi>Rochell,</hi> 'tis fear'd all the four corners of the Kingdom will be set on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>Of all the Towns of surety which They of the Religion hold, <hi>Rochell</hi> is the chiefest; a place strong by nature, but stronger by Art; It is a Maritim town, and landward they can by sluces drown a leagues distance: 'tis fortified with mighty thick walls, bastions, and counters<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This amongst other cautionary Towns, was granted by <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, to them of the Religion for a certain term of years, which being expir'd, the King saith they are devolv'd again to the Crown, and so demands them. They of the Religion pretend to have divers grievances; first they have not been paid these two years the 160000 Crowns which the last King gave them annually to maintain their Ministers and Garrisons: They complain of the Kings carriage lately at <hi>Bearn (Henry</hi> the greats Countrey) which was merely Protestant, where he hath introduc'd two years since the public exercise of the Masse, which had not bin sung there fifty years before; he alter'd also there the Government of the Countrey, and in lieu of a <hi>Viceroy,</hi> left a Governor only: and wheras <hi>Navarrin</hi> was formerly a Court of Parlement for the whol Kingdom of <hi>Navar,</hi> (that's under <hi>France</hi>) he hath put it down and published an Edict, that the <hi>Navarrois</hi> should com to <hi>Tolo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

an ample relation in my last, matters are becom now more calm and rather inclining to an accommodation, for 'tis thought a sum of money will make up the breach; and to this end som think all these bravado's were made. The Duke of <hi>Luynes</hi> is at last made Lord high Constable of <hi>France</hi> the prime Officer of the Crown, he hath a peculiar Court to himself, a guard of a 100. men in rich liveries, and a hundred thousand livers every year Pension: The old Duke of <hi>Lesdiguieres,</hi> one of the ancientst soldiers of <hi>France,</hi> and a Protestant, is made his Lieutenant.</p>
                        <p>But in regard all Christendom rings of this Favorit, being the greatest that ever was in <hi>France</hi> since the <hi>Maires of the Palace,</hi> who came to be <hi>Kings</hi> afterwards, I will send you herein his Legend. He was boru in <hi>Province,</hi> and is a Gentleman by descent, though of a pettie extraction, in the last Kings time he was preferr'd to be one of his pages, who finding him industrious, and a good wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, allow'd him 300.

The King observing that, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Pension, and taking notice that he was a serviceable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument and apt to please, he thought him fit to be about his son, in whose service he hath continued above fifteen years, and he hath <hi>flown</hi> so high into his favor by a singular dexteri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He is a man of a passable good understanding and forecast, of a mild comportment, humble and debonnair to all, and of a winning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, he hath about him choice and solid heads who prescribe unto him rules of policie, by whose Compas he steers his course, which is likely will make him subsist long: He is now com to that transcendent altitude, that he seems to have mounted above the reach of envy, and made all hopes of supplanting him frustrate, both by the politic guidance of his own actions, and the powerfull alliances he hath got for himself and his two brothers: he is maried to the Duke of <hi>Montbazons</hi> daughter, one of the prime Peers of <hi>France.</hi> His second brother <hi>Cadanet</hi> (who is reputed the wisest of the three) maried the heiress of <hi>Picardy,</hi> with whom he had 9000 l. lands a year. His third brother <hi>Brand</hi> to the great heiress of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> of which house ther have bin five Emperor; so that these three brothers and their allies would be able to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter balance any one faction in <hi>France,</hi> the eldest and youngest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made Dukes, and Peers of <hi>France,</hi> the other Marshall. Ther are lately two Ambassadors extraordinary com hither from <hi>Venice</hi>
                           <pb n="36" facs="tcp:97056:71"/>

I presume you have by this time tasted of the sweetnes of Travell, and that you have wean'd your affections from <hi>England</hi> for a good while, you must now think upon home (as one said) good men think upon heaven, aiming still to go thither, but not till they finish their cours; and yours I understand will be three years, in the mean time you must not suffer any melting tendernes of thoughts, or longing desires, to distract or interrupt you in that fair road you are in to vertue, and to beautifie within that comly Edifice which nature hath built without you.

that matters begin to grow boysterous. The King retir'd not long since to <hi>New market</hi> not very well pleasd, and this week there went thither twelve from the House of Commons, to whom Sir <hi>Richard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Weston</hi> was the mouth; the King not liking the Message they brought, calld them his <hi>Ambassadors,</hi> and in the large answer which he hath sent to the Speaker, he saith that he must apply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them a speech of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> to an Ambassador of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Legatum expectavimus, Heralaum accepimus?</hi> We expected an Ambassador, we have receivd a Herald; he takes it not well that they should meddle with the match twixt his Son and the <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> alleging an example of one of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> which would not marry his Son without the advice of his Parliament, but afterwards that King grew so despicable abroad, that no Forren State would treat with him about any thing without his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sundry other high passages ther were as a caveat he gave them not to touch the honor of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> with whom he was so far ingag'd in a matrimoniall treaty that he could not go back: he gave them also a check for taking Cognisance of those things which had their motion in the ordinary Courts of Iustice, and that Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> (though these words were not inserted in the answer) whom he thought to be <hi>the fittest instrument for a Tyrant that ever was England</hi>) should be so bold as to call the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> of the Crown a <hi>great monster.</hi> The Parliament after this was not long liv'd but broak up in discontent, and upon the point of dissolution, they made a Protest against divers particulars in the aforesaid answer of his Majesties. My Lord <hi>Digby</hi> is preparing for <hi>Spain</hi> in qualitie of Ambassador Extraordinary, to perfect the match twixt our Prince and the Lady <hi>Infanta,</hi> in which business <hi>Gondamar</hi> hath waded already very deep, and bin very active, and ingratiated himself with divers persons of qualitie, Ladies espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, yet he could do no good upon the Lady <hi>Hatton,</hi> whom he desird lately that in regard he was her next neighbor (at <hi>Ely</hi> House) he might have the benefit of her back gate to go abroad into the fields, but she put him off with a Complement, wherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a privat audience lately with the King amongst other passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of merriment, he told him that my Lady <hi>Hatton</hi> was <hi>a strange Lady, for she would not suffer her Husband Sir</hi> Edward Coke <hi>to com in at her foredore, nor him to go out at her back dore;</hi> and so related the whole business: He was also dispatching a l'ost lately for <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Post having receivd his packet, and kisd his hands, he calld him back and told him he had forgot one thing, which was, that when he came to <hi>Spain he should commend him to the Sun,</hi>

When I have done with the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> here, I shall hasten my dispatches for <hi>Sardinia:</hi> since my last I went to liquidat the account more particularly, and I find that of the 250000 Crowns, ther are above forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand due unto you; which might serve for a good Aldermans estate.</p>
                        <p>Your son in <hi>Alicant</hi> writes to me of another mischance that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faln the ship <hi>Amitie</hi> about <hi>Mallorca,</hi> wherof you were one of the proprietaries; I am very sorry to hear of it, and touching any dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches that are to be had hence, I shall endeavor to procure you them according to instructions.</p>

You shall understand there came lately an express from <hi>Rome</hi> also to this Court, touching the business of the match which gave very good content; but the dispatch and new instructions, which Mr. <hi>Endymion Porter</hi> brought my Lord of <hi>Bristoll</hi> lately from <hi>England</hi> touching the Prince <hi>Palatinat,</hi> fills us with apprehensions of fear: Our Ambassadors here have had audience of this King already about those Propositions, and we hope that Master <hi>Porter</hi> will carry back such things as will satisfie. Touching the two points

in the Treaty wherin the two Kings differ'd most, <hi>viz.</hi> about the education of the children, and the exemption of the <hi>Infanta's</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastic servants from secular jurisdiction: both these points are clear'd, for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is com from fourteen years to ten, and for so long time the <hi>Infant</hi> Princes shall remain under the mothers go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And for the other point, the Ecclesiasticall Superior shall first take notice of the offence that shall be committed by any spirituall person belonging to the <hi>Infanta's</hi> family, and according to the merit therof either deliver him by degradation to the secular justice, or banish him the Kingdom according to the quality of the delict, and it is the same that is practis'd in this Kingdom, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts that adhere to <hi>Rome.</hi>

About ten a clock that night, the King himself came in a close coach with intent to visit

the Prince, who hearing of it, met him halfway, and after salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and divers embraces which past in the first interview they parred late: I forgot to tell you, that Count <hi>Gondamar</hi> being sworn Counseller of State that morning, having bin before but one of the Counsell of War, he came in great hast to visit the Prince saying, he had strange news to tell him, which was that an <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was sworn privy Counseller of <hi>Spain,</hi> meaning himself, who he said was an <hi>Englishman</hi> in his heart. On Sunday following, the King in the afternoon came abroad to take the air with the Queen, his two brothers and the <hi>Infanta,</hi> who were all in one coach, but the <hi>Infanta</hi> sat in the boot with a blew riband about her arm, of purpose that the Prince might distinguish her: ther were above twenty coaches besides of Grandes, Noble men and Ladies that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them. And now i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>I Know the eyes of all <hi>England</hi> are earnestly fixd now upon <hi>Spain,</hi> her best jewell being here; but his journey was like to be spoild in <hi>France,</hi> for if he had stayd but a little longer at <hi>Bayon</hi> the last Town of that Kingdom hitherwards, he had bin discoverd, for Monsieur <hi>Gramond</hi> the Governor had notice of him not long after he had taken Post. The people here do mightily magnifie the gallantry of the journey, and cry out that he deserv'd to have the <hi>Infanta</hi> thrown into his arms the first night he came: He hath bin entertaind with all the magnificence that possibly could be devis'd. On Sunday last in the morning betimes he went to Saint <hi>Hieroms</hi> Monastery, whence the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> use to be fetchd the day they are crownd; and thither the King came in person with his two Brothers, his eight Counsells, and the flower of the Nobility: He rid upon the Kings right hand through the heart of the Town under a great Canopy, and was brought so into his lodgings to the Kings Palace, and the King himself accompanied him to his very bedchamber. It was a very glorious sight to behold, for the custom of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is, though he go plain in his ordinary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, yet upon som Festivall or cause of triumph, ther's none goes beyond him in gaudiness.</p>
                        <p>We daily hope for the Popes Breve or Dispensation to perfect the busines, though ther be dark whispers abroad that it is com al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, but that upon this inexpected coming of the Prince, it was sent back to <hi>Rome,</hi> and som new clauses thrust in for their further advantage. Till this dispatch comes, matters are at a kind of stand; yet his Highnes makes account to be back in <hi>England</hi> about the latter end of <hi>May.</hi> God Almighty turn all to the best, and to what shall be most conducible to his glory.

give up their opinion: But from <hi>Turky</hi> ther came a Letter this week wherin ther is the strangest and most tragicall news, that in my small reading no Sory can parallell, or shew with more pregnancie the instability and tottering estate of human greatnes, and the sandy foundation wheron the vast <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is reard upon: For <hi>Sultan Osman</hi> the grand <hi>Turk.</hi> a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the humor of that Nation, warlike and fleshd in bloud, and a violent hater of Christians, was in the flower of his yeers, in the heat and height of his courage, knockt in the head by one of his own slaves, and one of the meanest of them, with a battle axe, and the murtherer never after proceeded against or questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
                        <p>The ground of this Tragedy was the late ill success he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Pole,</hi> wherin he lost about 100000. horse for want of forrage, and 80000. men for want of fighting, which he imputed to the cowardize of his <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> who rather than bear the brunt of the battell, were more willing to return home to their wives and merchandizing, which they are now permitted to do contrary to their first institution, which makes them more worldly, and less venturous.

                        <p>Som few days before his death, he had a strange dream, for hee dreamt that he was mounted upon a great <hi>Camell,</hi> who would not go neither by fair nor foul means, and lighting off him, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to strike him with his <hi>Cimitier,</hi> the body of the beast vanisht, leaving the Head and the bridle only in his hands; when the <hi>Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi> and the <hi>Hoggies</hi> could not interpret this dream, <hi>Mustapha</hi> his Uncle did it, for he said, the <hi>Camell</hi> signified his Empire, his moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him his excesse in Government, his lighting down his depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. Another kind of Prophetic speech dropt from the <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier</hi> to Sir <hi>Thomas Roe</hi> our Ambassador there, who having gone a little before this Tragedy to visit the said <hi>Visier,</hi> told him what
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:97056:89"/>
whisperings and mutterings there were in every corner for this <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siatic</hi> voyage, and what ill consquences might ensue from it; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it might well stand with his great wisdom to stay it; but if it held, he desir'd him to leave a charge with the <hi>Chimacham</hi> his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, that the <hi>English</hi> Nation in the <hi>Port,</hi> should be free from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages: wherunto the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> answer'd, Trouble not your self about that, for I will not remove so far from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but I wil leave one of my legs behind to serve you, which prov'd too true, for he was murther'd afterwards, and one of his legs was hung up in the <hi>Hippodrome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This fresh Tragedy makes me to give over wondring at any thing that ever I heard or read, to shew the lubricity of <hi>mundan</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as also the fury of the vulgar, which like an impetuous Torrent gathereth strength by degrees as it meets with divers Dams, and being come to the hight, cannot stop it self: for when this rage of the soldiers began first, there was no design at all to violat or hurt the Emperor, but to take from him his ill Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, but being once a foot, it grew by insensible degrees to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of outrages.</p>
                        <p>The bringing out of <hi>Mustapha</hi> from the Dungeon, where he was prisoner, to be Emperor of the <hi>Musulmans,</hi> puts me in mind of what I read in Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> of our late Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> how she was brought from the Scaffold, to the <hi>English</hi> Throne.</p>
                        <p>They who profess to be Criticks in policy here, hope that this murthering of <hi>Osman</hi> may in time breed good bloud, and prove advantageous to Christendom; for though this be the first Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the <hi>Turks</hi> that was dispatcht so, he is not like to be the last, now that the soldiers have this precedent: others think that if that design in <hi>Asia</hi> had taken, it had been very probable the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinopolitans</hi> had hoisd up another King, and so the Empire had been dismembred, and by this division had lost strength, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire did, when it was broken into East and West.</p>
                        <p>Excuse me that this my Letter is become such a Monster, I mean that it hath past the sise and ordinary proportion of a Letter, for the matter it treats of is monstrous, besides it is a rule that Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Letters have more liberty to be long than others: In my next you shall hear how matters pass here, in the mean time, and always I rest</p>

                        <p>THe procedure of things in relation to the <hi>grand</hi> busines the match, was at kind of a stand when the long winded <hi>Iunta</hi> deliver'd their opinions, and fell at last upon this result, that his Catholic Majesty for the satisfaction of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> might oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the behalf of <hi>England,</hi> for the performance of those capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which reflected upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics in that Kingdom; and in case of non-performance, then to right himself by war; since that, the matrimoniall Articles were solemnly sworne unto by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Highness, the two Favorits, our two Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, the Duke of <hi>Infantado</hi> and other Counsellors of State being present; hereupon the eighth of the next <hi>September,</hi> is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be the day of Desposorios, the day of affiance, or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothing day; ther was much gladnes exprest here, and lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of joy were in every great street throughout the City: but there is an unlucky accident hath interven'd, for the King gave the Prince a solemn visit since, and told him Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> was dead, who was so great a friend to the match, but in regard the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines was not yet com to perfection, he could not proceed further in it till the former Dispensation were ratified by the new Pope <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> which to procure he would make it his own task, and that all possible expedition should be us'd in't, and therfore desir'd his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the interim. The Prince answer'd, and prest the necessity of his speedy return with divers reasons, he said ther was a generall kind of murmuring in <hi>England</hi> for his so long abseuce, that the King his Father was old and sickly, that the Fleet of shipe were already, he thought, at Sea to fetch him, the winter drew on, and withall that the Articles of the match were sign'd in <hi>England,</hi> with this <hi>proviso,</hi> that if he be not com back by such a month they should be of no validity. The King replyed, that since his Highness was resolv'd upon so suddain a departure, he would please to leave a <hi>Proxy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97056:90"/>
he might send for his <hi>wife</hi> when he pleas'd. The Prince rejoyn'd, that amongst those multitudes of royall favors which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from his Majesty, this transcended all the rest, therfore hee would most willingly leave a <hi>Proxy</hi> for his Majesty and another for <hi>Don Carlos</hi> to this effect; so they parted for that time without the least ombrage of discontent, nor do I hear of any engendred since. The last month 'tis true the <hi>Iunta</hi> of Divines dwelt so long upon the busines, that ther were whisperings that the Prince intended to go away disguis'd as he came, and the question being ask'd by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of quality, ther was a brave answer made, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But wee shall know shortly now what to trust to, we shall walk no more in mists, though som give out yet that our prince shall embrace a cloud for <hi>Iuno</hi> at last. I pray pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent my service to Sir <hi>Iohn Franklin,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Smith,</hi> with all at the Hill and Dale, and when you send to <hi>Wales,</hi> I pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the inclos'd to my Father.

                        <p>I Receiv'd lately one of yours, but it was of a very old date: we have our eyes here now all fixd upon <hi>Rome,</hi> greedily expecting the Ratification, and lately a strong rumor ran it was com, in so much Mr <hi>Clerk</hi> who was sent hither from the Prince being a ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, (and now lies sick at my Lord of <hi>Bristolls</hi> house of a Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) hearing of it, he desired to speak with him, for he had som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97056:92"/>
to deliver him from the Prince, my Lord Ambassador being com to him, Mr <hi>Clerk</hi> delivered a letter from the Prince; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents wherof were, that wheras he had left certain <hi>Proxies</hi> in his hand to be deliverd to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> after the Ratification was com, he desir'd and requir'd him not to do it till he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive further order from <hi>England;</hi> my Lord of <hi>Bristoll</hi> hereupon went to Sir <hi>Walter Aston,</hi> who was in joynt Commission with him for concluding the match, and shewing him the Letter, what my Lord <hi>Aston</hi> said I know not, but my Lord of <hi>Bristoll</hi> told him that they had a Commission Royall under the broad Seal of <hi>England</hi> to conclude the match; he knew as well as he how earnest the King their Master hath bin any time these ten years to have it don; how ther could not be a better pawn for the surrendry of the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> than the <hi>Infanta</hi> in the Prince his arms, who would never rest till she did the work to merit love of our Nation: He told him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so how their owne particular fortunes depended upon't, besides if he should delay one moment to deliver the <hi>Proxy</hi> after the Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was com according to agreement, the <hi>Infanta</hi> would hold her self so blemish'd in her honor, that it might overthrow all things. Lastly, he told him that they incurr'd the hazard of their heads if they should suspend the executing his Majesties Commission upon any order but from that power which gave it, who was the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; hereupon both the Ambassadors proceeded still in preparing matters for the solemnizing of the mariage: the Earl of <hi>Bristoll</hi> had caus'd above thirty rich Liveries to be made of watchet Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, with silver lace up to the very capes of the Cloaks, the best sorts wherof were valued at 80 l. a Livery: My Lord <hi>Aston</hi> had also provided new Liveries, and a fortnight after the said politic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was blown up, the Ratification came indeed complete and full; so the mariage day was appointed, a <hi>Terrass</hi> cover'd all over with Tapestry was rais'd from the Kings Palace to the next Church, which might be about the same extent, as from <hi>White-Hall</hi> to <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster Abbey,</hi> and the King intended to make his sister a <hi>Wife,</hi> and his daughter (wherof the Queen was deliver'd a little before) a <hi>Christian</hi> upon the same day; the <hi>Grandes</hi> and great Ladies had been invited to the mariage, and order was sent to all the Port Towns to discharge their great Ordnance, and sundry other things were prepar'd to honor the solemnity: but when wee were thus at the hight of our hopes, a day or two before; there came Mr. <hi>Killegree, Gresley, Wood</hi> and <hi>Davies,</hi> one upon the neck of another with a new Commission to my Lord of <hi>Bristoll</hi> immediatly from his Majesty, countermanding him to deliver the <hi>Proxy</hi> aforesaid, untill a full
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97056:93"/>
and absolut satisfaction were had for the surrendry of the <hi>Palatinat</hi> under this Kings hand and Seal, in regard he desir'd his Son should be married to <hi>Spain,</hi> and his Son in law remarried to the <hi>Palatinat</hi> at one time; hereupon all was dasht to peeces; and that frame which was rearing so many years, was ruin'd in a moment. This news strook a damp in the hearts of all people here, and they wisht that the Postillons that brought it, had all broke their necks in the way.</p>
                        <p>My Lord of <hi>Bristoll</hi> hereupon went to Court to acquaint the King with his new Commission, and so propos'd the restitution of the <hi>Palatinat,</hi> the King answer'd 'twas none of his to give, 'tis true he had a few Towns there, but he held them as Commissioner only for the Emperor, and he could not command an Emperor; yet if his Majesty of great <hi>Britain</hi> would put a Treaty a foot, hee would send his own Ambassadors to joyn; In the interim, the Earl was commanded not to deliver the foresaid <hi>Proxy</hi> of the Prince, for the desposorios or espousall untill <hi>Christmas:</hi> (And herein it seems his Majesty with you was not well inform'd, for those powers of <hi>Proxies</hi> expir'd before) the King here said further that if his Uncle the Emperor, or the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> would not be conformable to reason, he would raise as great an Army for the Prince <hi>Palsgrave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> as he did under <hi>Spinola</hi> when he first invaded the <hi>Palatinat;</hi> and to secure this, he would ingage his Contratation House of the West <hi>Indies,</hi> with his Plate Fleet, and give the most binding instrument that could be under his hand and Seal. But this gave no satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, therfore my Lord of <hi>Bristoll</hi> I beleeve hath not long to stay here, for he is commanded to deliver no more Letters to the <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> nor demand any more audience, and that she should be no more stiled Princess of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Wales.</hi> The foresaid Caution which this King offer'd to my Lord of <hi>Bristoll,</hi> made me think of what I read of his Grandfather <hi>Philip</hi> the second, who having been maried to our Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and it being thought she was with child of him, and was accordingly prayed for at <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross, though it proved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward but a tympany, King <hi>Philip</hi> prepos'd to our Parliament that they would pass an Act that he might be Regent during his or her minority that should be born, and he would give good caution to surrender the Crown, when <hi>he</hi> or <hi>she</hi> should com to age: the motion was hotly canvas'd in the house of Peers, and like to pass, when the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> rose up and said, <hi>I, but who shall sue the Kings bond?</hi> so the busines was dasht. I have no more news to send you now, and I am sory I have so much, unless it were better; for we that have busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to negotiat here are like to suffer much by this rupture:

My Lord of <hi>Bristoll</hi> is preparing for <hi>England,</hi> I waited upon him lately when he went to take his leave at Court, and the King washing his hands took a Ring from off his own finger, and put it upon his, which was the greatest honor that ever he did any Ambassador as they say here; he gave him also a Cupbord of Plate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Earl did not only wave, but disdaind these Propositions made unto him by <hi>Olivares;</hi> and said he was so confident of the King his Masters justice and high judgment, and of his own innocency, that hee conceiv'd no power could be able to do him hurt. Ther hath occurd nothing lately in this Court worth the advertisement: They speak much of the strange carriage of that boisterous Bishop of <hi>Halverstad,</hi> (for so they term him here) that having taken a place where there were two Monasteries of Nuns and Friers, he caus'd divers feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds to be rip'd and all the feathers to be thrown in a great Hall whither the Nuns and Friers were thrust naked with their bodies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>I Have many thanks to render you for the favor you lately did to a kinsman of mine, Mr. <hi>Vaughan,</hi> and for divers other which I defer till I return to that Court, and that I hope will not be long. Touching the procedure of matters here, you shall understand that my Lord <hi>Aston</hi> had speciall audience lately of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and afterwards presented a Memorial wherin ther was a high complaint against the miscarriage of the two <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadors now in <hi>England</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Inopifa</hi> and <hi>Don Carlos Coloma,</hi> the substance of it was that the said Ambassadors in a privat audience his Majesty of great <hi>Britain</hi> had given them, informd him of a perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions plot against his Person and royall authority, which was that at the beginning of your now Parliament, the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> with others his complices often met and consulted in a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destin way, how to break the treatie both of <hi>Match</hi> and <hi>Palatinat:</hi> and in case his Majesty was unwilling therunto, he should have a Countrey house or two to retire unto for his recreation and health, in regard the Prince is now of years &amp; judgment fit to govern. His Majesty so resented this, that the next day he sent them many thanks for the care they had of him, and desird them to perfect the work, and now that they had detected the treason to discover also the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but they were shy in that point, the King sent again desiring them to send him the names of the Conspirators in a paper, seald up by one of their own confidents, which he would receive with his own hands, and no soul should see it els; advising them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that they should not prefer this discovery before their own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, to be accounted false Accusers: they replied that they had don enough already by instancing in the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and it might easily be guest who were his Confidents, and Creatures. Hereupon his Majesty put those whom he had any grounds to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to their oaths: And afterward sent my Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Cotington,</hi> to tell the Ambassadors that he had left no means unassaid to discover the Conspiration, that he had sound upon oath such a clearness of ingenuity in the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97056:94"/>
conceive that this information of theirs, proceeded rather from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and som politicall ends then from truth, and in regard they would not produce the Authors of so dangerous a Treason, they made themselves to be justly thought the Authors of it: And therfore though he might by his own royall justice, and the law of nations punish this excesse and insolence of theirs, and high wrong they had done to his best servants, yea to the Prince his Son, for through the sides of the Duke they wounded him, in regard it was impossible that such a design should be attempted without his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet he would not be his own Judge herein, but would refer them to the King their Master whom he conceiv'd to be so just, that hee doubted not but he would see him satisfied, and therfore hee would send an express unto him hereabouts to demand Justice, and repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: this busines is now in agitation, but we know not what will become of it.

                        <p>YOu have had knowledge (none better) of the progression and growings of the <hi>Spanish</hi> match from time to time; I must acquaint you now with the rupture and utter dissolution of it, which was not long a doing; for it was done in one audience that my Lord of <hi>Bristoll</hi> had lately at Court, whence it may be inferr'd, that 'tis far more easie to pull down, than reare up, for that stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture which was so many years a rearing, was dasht as it were in a trice: Dissolution goeth a faster pace than Composition. And it may be said, that the civill actions of men, specially great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Monarchs (as this was) have much Analogie in degrees of progression with the naturall production of man. To make man there are many acts must procede, first a meeting and copulation
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97056:95"/>
of the Sexes, then Conception, which requires a well-disposed womb to retain the prolificall seed, by the constriction and occlusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the orifice of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> which seed being first bloud, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards cream, is by a gentle ebullition coagulated, and turnd to a crudded lump, which the womb by vertue of its naturall heat pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to be capable to receive form, and to be organiz'd; wherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Nature falls a working to delineat all the members, beginning with those that are most noble: as the Heart, the Brain, the Liver; wherof <hi>Galen</hi> would have the Liver, which is the shop and source of the bloud, and <hi>Aristotle</hi> the Heart to be the first fram'd, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard 'tis <hi>primùm vivens, &amp; ultimùm moriens:</hi> Nature continues in this labor untill a perfect shape be introduc'd, and this is call'd <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> which is the third act, and is a production of an organicall body out of the spermatic substance, caus'd by the plastic vertue of the vitall spirits: and somtimes this act is finisht thirty days after the Conception, somtimes fifty, but most commonly in forty two, or forty five, and is sooner don in the male. This being done, the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryon</hi> is animated with three souls; the first with that of Plants call'd the vegetable soul, then with a sensitive, which all brute A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals have, and lastly, the Rationall soul is infus'd, and these three in man are like <hi>Trigonus</hi> in <hi>Tetragono;</hi> the two first are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated <hi>ex Traduce,</hi> from the seed of the Parents, but the last is by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat infusion from God, and 'tis controverted 'twixt Philosophers and Divines, when this infusion is made.</p>
                        <p>This is the fourth act that goeth to make man, and is called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimation:</hi> and as the Naturalists allow <hi>Animation</hi> double the time that Formation had from the Conception, so they allow to the ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Embryo</hi> in the womb, and to the birth therof treble the time that <hi>Animation</hi> had, which hapneth somtimes in nine, somtimes in ten months. This <hi>Grand</hi> busines of the <hi>Spanish</hi> match, may be said to have had such degrees of progression; first there was a meeting and coupling on both sides, for a <hi>Iunta</hi> in in <hi>Spain,</hi> and som select Counsellors of State were appointed in <hi>England;</hi> After this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction the busines was conceiv'd, then it receiv'd form, then life, (though the quickning was slow) but having had nere upon ten years in lieu of ten months to be perfected, it was infortunately strangled when it was ripe and ready for birth; and I would they had never been born that did it, for it is like to be out of my way 30: ol, And as the <hi>Embryo</hi> in the womb is wrapt in three mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes or tunicles, so this great busines, you know better than I, was involv'd in many difficulties, and died so intangled before it could break through them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="85" facs="tcp:97056:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>There is a buzz here of a match 'twixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> I pray God send it a speedier Formation and <hi>Animation</hi> than this had, and that it may not prove an abortive.</p>

There raignd in <hi>Spain Don Rodrigo,</hi> who kept his Court then at <hi>Malaga;</hi> He emploid the Conde <hi>Don Julian</hi> Ambassador to <hi>Barbary,</hi> who had a Daughter, (a young beautifull Lady) that was maid of Honor to the Queen: The King spying her one day refreshing her self under an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, sell enamour'd with her, and never left till he had deslowrd her: She resenting much the dishonor, writ a letter to her Father in <hi>Barbary</hi> under this Allegory, <hi>That there was a fair green Apple upon the table, and the Kings poignard fell upon't and clest it in two. Don Iulian</hi> apprehending the meaning, got letters of revocation, and came back to <hi>Spain,</hi> wher he so complied with the King, that he became his Favorite: Amongst other things he advis'd the King that in regard he was now in Peace with all the world, he would dismisse his Gallies and Garrisons that were up and down the Sea coasts, because it was a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous charge. This being don and the Countrey left open to any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader, he prevaild with the King to have leave to go with his Lady to see their friends in <hi>Tarragona,</hi> which was 300. miles off: Having bin there a while, his Lady made semblance to be sick, and so sent to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition the King, that her daughter <hi>Donna Cava</hi> (whom they had left at Court to satiat the Kings lust) might com to comfort her a while;

A few yeers before this happend, <hi>Rodrigo</hi> came to <hi>Toledo,</hi> where un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great Church ther was a vault with huge Iron doors, and none of his Predecessors durst open it, because ther was an old Prophesie, <hi>That when that vault was open'd</hi> Spain <hi>should be conquered; Rodrigo</hi> slighting the Prophesie, caus'd the doors to be broke open, hoping to find there som Treasure, but when he entred, there was nothing sound but the pictures of <hi>Moores,</hi> of such men that a little after fulfilled the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.</p>
                        <p>Yet this last conquest of <hi>Spain</hi> was not perfect, for divers parts North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west kept still under Christian Kings, specially <hi>Biscay,</hi> which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conquer'd, as <hi>Wales</hi> in <hi>Britanny,</hi> and the <hi>Biscayners</hi> have much Analogy with the <hi>Welsh</hi> in divers things: They retain to this day the originall Language of <hi>Spain,</hi> they are the most mountainous people, and they are reputed the ancientst Gentry; so that when any is to take the order of Knighthood, ther are no Inquistors appointed to find whether he be cleer of the bloud of the <hi>Moors</hi> as in other places. The King when he comes upon the confines, pulls off one shoo before he can tread upon any <hi>Biscay</hi> ground: And he hath good reason to esteem that <hi>Province,</hi> in regard of divers advantages he hath by it, for he hath his best timber to build ships, his best Mariners, and all his iron thence.</p>
                        <p>Ther were divers bloudy battells 'twixt the remnant of Christians, and the <hi>Moors</hi> for seven hundreth yeers together, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> getting ground more and more, drive them at last to <hi>Granada,</hi> and thence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the time of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi> quite over to <hi>Barbary:</hi> their last King was <hi>Chico,</hi> who when he fled from <hi>Granada</hi> crying and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, the people upbra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>In <hi>Philip</hi> the seconds time the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy came to its highest cumble, by the conquest of <hi>Portugall,</hi> wherby the <hi>East Indies,</hi> sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Islands in the <hi>Atlantic</hi> Sea, and divers places in <hi>Barbary</hi> were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> By these steps this Crown came to this Grandeur; and truly give the <hi>Spaniard</hi> his due, he is a mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, he hath Dominions in all parts of the world (which none of the four Monarchies had) both in <hi>Europe, Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> (which he hath solely to himself) though our <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh had the first proffer made him: So the Sun shines all the foure and twenty houres of the naturall day upon som part or other of his countreys, for part of the <hi>Antipodes</hi> are subject to him. He hath eight Viceroys in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> two in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> two in the <hi>West,</hi> two in <hi>Afric,</hi> and about thirty provinciall soverain Commanders more; yet as I was told lately, in a discours twixt him and our Prince at his being here, when the Prince sell to magnifie his spacious Dominions, the King answer'd, <hi>Sir, 'tis true, it hath pleas'd God to trust me with divers Nations and Countreys, but of all these ther are but two which yeeld me any clear revenues,</hi> viz.

some forty, some thirty, and divers twenty thousand pounds per annum. The Church here is exceeding rich both in revenues, plate, and buildings; one cannot go to the meanest Countrey Chappell, but he will find Chalices, lamps and candlesticks of silver. There are some Bishopricks of 30000l. per annum, and divers of 10000 l. and <hi>Toledo</hi> is 100000 l. yearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue. As the Church is rich, so it is mightily reverenced here, and very powerfull, which made <hi>Philip</hi> the second rather depend upon the Clergy, than the secular Power: Therfore I do not see how <hi>Spain</hi> can be call'd a poor Countrey, considering the revenues aforesaid of Princes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats; nor is it so thin of People as the world makes it, and one reason may be that ther are sixteen Universities in <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp; in one of these there were fifteen thousand Students at one time when I was there, I mean <hi>Salamanca,</hi> and in this <hi>Village</hi> of <hi>Madrid</hi> (for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> cannot keep his constant Court in any <hi>City</hi>) there are ordinarily 600000 souls. Tis true that the colonizing of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the wars of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> have much drain'd this Countrey of people: Since the expulsion of the <hi>Moors,</hi> it is also grown thinner, and not so full of corn; for those <hi>Moors</hi> would grub up wheat out of the very tops of the craggy hills, yet they us'd another grain for their bread, so that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had nought els to do but go with his Ass to the Market, and buy corn of the <hi>Moon.</hi> Ther liv'd here also in times past a great number of <hi>Jews,</hi> till they were expell'd by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and as I have read in an old <hi>Spanish</hi> Legend, the cause was this; The King had a young Prince to his son, who was us'd to play with a <hi>Jewish</hi> Doctor that was about the Court, who had a Ball of gold in a string hanging down his brest, the little Prince one day snatcht away the said gold Ball, and carried it to the next room, the Ball being hollow, opend, and within there was painted our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our kissing a Iews tail: Hereupon they were all suddenly disterr'd and exterminated, yet I beleeve in <hi>Portugall</hi> there lurks. yet good store of them.</p>
                        <p>For the soil of <hi>Spain,</hi> the fruitfulnes of their vallies recompences the sterillity of their hills, corn is their greatest want, and want of rain is the cause of that, which makes them have need of their neighbors; yet as much as <hi>Spain</hi> bears is passing good, and so is every thing else for the quality, nor hath any one a better horse under him, a better cloak on his back, a better sword by his side, better shooes on his feet, than the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> nor doth any drink better Wine, or eat better fruit than he, nor flesh for the quantity.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97056:98"/>
he can endure much in the war, yet he loves not to fight in the dark, but in open day, or upon a stage, that all the world might be witnesses of his valor; so that you shall seldom hear of <hi>Spaniards</hi> employed in night service; nor shall one hear of a <hi>Duell</hi> here in an age: He hath one good quality, that he is wonderfully obedient to Government: for the prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest <hi>Don</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> when he is prancing upon his Ginet in the streets, if an <hi>Alguazil</hi> (a Sargeant) shew him his <hi>Vare,</hi> that is a little white staff he carrieth as badge of his Office; my <hi>Don</hi> will down presently off his horse, and yeeld himself his prisoner. He hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commendable quality, that when he giveth Alms, he puls off his Hat, and puts it in the beggars hand with a great deal of humility. His gravity is much lessned since the late Proclamation came out against ruffs, and the King himself shewd the first example, they were come to that hight of excess herein, that twenty shillings were us'd to be paid for starching of a ruff: and som, though perhaps he had never a shirt to his back, yet would be have a toting huge swelling ruff about his neck. He is sparing in his Ordinary diet, but when he makes a Feast he is free and bountifull. As to Temporall Authority, specially Martiall, so is be very obedient to the Church, and beleeves all with an implicit faith: he is a great servant of Ladies, nor can he be blam'd, for as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he coms of a <hi>Gotish</hi> race; yet he never brags of, nor blazes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad his doings that way, but is exceedingly carefull of the repute of any woman, (A civility that we much want in <hi>England</hi>) Hee will speak high words of <hi>Don Philippo</hi> his King, but will not endure a stranger should do so: I have heard a <hi>Biscayner</hi> make a <hi>Rodomonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> that he was as good a Gentleman as <hi>Don Philippo</hi> himself, for <hi>Don Philippo</hi> was half a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> half a <hi>German,</hi> half an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian,</hi> half a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> half I know not what, but he was a pure <hi>Biscayner,</hi> without mixture. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> is not so smooth and oyly in his Complement as the <hi>Italian,</hi> and though hee will make strong protestations, yet he will not swear out Complements like the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> as I heard when my Lord of <hi>Carlile</hi> was Ambassador in <hi>France,</hi> there came a great Monsieur to see him, and having a long time banded, and sworn Complements one to another who should go first out at a dore, at last my Lord of <hi>Carlile</hi> said, ô <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seigneur ayez pitie de mon ame,</hi> O my'.

                        <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> is generally given to gaming, and that in excesse; he will say his prayers before, and if he win he will thank God for his good fortune after; their common game at cards (for they very seldom play at dice) is <hi>Primera,</hi> at which the King never shews his game, but throws his cards with their faces down on the Table: He is Merchant

of all the cards and dice through all the Kingdom, he hath them made for a penny a pair, and he retails them for twelve pence; so that 'tis thought he hath 30000 l. a year by this trick at cards. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> is very devout in his way, for I have seen him kneel in the very dirt when the <hi>Ave Mary</hi> bell rings: and som if they spy two straws or sticks lie cross-wise in the street, they will take them up and kisse them, and lay them down again. He walks as if he marcht, and seldom looks on the ground, as if he contemnd it. I was told of a <hi>Spaniard</hi> who having got a fall by a stumble, and broke his nose, rose up, and in a disdainfull manner said, <hi>Voto a tal esto es caminar por la tierra,</hi> This is to walk upon earth.

                        <p>It was my fortune to be on Sunday was fortnight at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> wher his late Majestie King <hi>Iames</hi> departed this life, and went to his last rest upon the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>rest,</hi> presently after Sermon was don: A little before the break of day, he sent for the Prince, who rose out of his bed, and came in his Night-Gown; the King seem'd to have som earnest thing to say unto him, and so endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to rowse himself upon his Pillow, but his spirits were so spent, that he had not strength to make his words audible. He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a Feaver which began with an Ague, and som <hi>Scotch</hi> Doctors mutter at a Plaster the Countess of <hi>Buckingham</hi> applied to the outside of his stomack: Tis thought the last breach of the march with <hi>Spain,</hi> which for many yeers he had so vehemently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fir'd, took too deep an impression in him, and that he was forc'd to rush into a war, now in his declining Age, having liv'd in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall uninterrupted peace his whole life, except som collaterall aydes he had sent his Son in Law: as soon as he expir'd, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Counsell sate, and in less then a quarter of an hour, King <hi>Charls</hi> was proclaimed at <hi>Theobalds</hi> Court Gate, by Sir <hi>Edward Zouch</hi> Knight Marshall, Master Secretary <hi>Conway</hi> dictating unto him, <hi>That wheras it hath pleas'd God to take to his mercy, our most gracious Soveraign King</hi> Iames <hi>of famous memory, We proclaim Prince</hi> Charles, <hi>His rightfull and indubitable Heir, to be King of</hi> England, Scotland, France, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Knight Marshall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stook, saying, <hi>His rightfull and dubitable Heir,</hi> but he was rectified by the Secretary.

His now Majesty took Coach, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> with him, and came to Saint <hi>Iames;</hi> In the evening he was proclaim'd at <hi>White-Hall</hi> Gate, in <hi>Cheapside,</hi> and other places, in a sad showre of Rain; and the Weather was sutable to the condition wherin he finds the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is Cloudy; for he is left engag'd in a War with a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

                           <pb n="111" facs="tcp:97056:108"/>Ther is an open rupture twixt us and the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> though he gives out, that he never broke with us to this day: Count <hi>Gonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> was on his way to <hi>Flanders,</hi> and thence to <hi>England</hi> (as they say) with a large Commission to treat, for a surrender of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainat,</hi> and so to peece matters together again; but he died in the journey, at a place call'd <hi>Bunnol,</hi> of pure apprehensions of grief, as it is given out.</p>
                        <p>The match twixt his Majesty and the Lady <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> youngest Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the great (the eldest being maried to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the second to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>) goes roundly on, and is in a manner concluded; wherat the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> is much discontented, who gave himself hopes to have her; but the hand of Heaven hath predestin'd her for a far higher condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors who were sent hither to conclude the busines, having privat audience of his late Majesty a little before his death, he told them pleasantly, <hi>That he would make war against the Lady</hi> Henrietta, <hi>because she would not receive the two Letters which were sent her, one from himself, and the other from his son, but sent them to her Mother; yet he thought he should easily make peace with her, because he understood she had afterwards put the latter Letter in her bosome, and the first in her Coshionet, wherly he gather'd, that she intended to reserve his son for her Affection, and him for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</hi>

                        <p>The Letter which Mr. <hi>Ellis Hicks</hi> brought them of <hi>Mountauban</hi> from <hi>Rechell,</hi> through so much danger, and with so much gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, was an infinit advantage unto them; for wheras ther was a politic report rais'd in the Kings Army, and blown into <hi>Mountau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> that <hi>Rochell</hi> was yeelded to the Count of <hi>Soissons,</hi> who lay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of this month in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> the other the eleventh day following in the great Church of <hi>Paris,</hi> by the Cardinall of <hi>Rochefoucand;</hi> ther was som clashing 'twixt him, and the Archbishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who alleg'd 'twas his duty to officiat in that Church, but the dignity of Cardinall, and the quality of his Office, being the Kings great <hi>Almner,</hi> which makes him chief Curat of the Court, gave him the prerogative. I doubt not but your Lordship hath heard of the Capitulations, but for better assurance, I will run them over briefly.</p>

                           <hi>The King of</hi> France <hi>oblig'd himself to procure the Dispensation; the mariage should be celebrated in the same form as that of Queen</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet, <hi>and of the Dutchess of</hi> Bar; <hi>her Dowrie should be</hi> 800000 <hi>Crowns six shillings a peece, the one moitie to be paied the day of the Contract, the other a twelvemonth after. The Queen shall have a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in all the Kings Roiall houses, and any wher else, where she shall recide within the Dominions of his Majestie of great</hi> Britain, <hi>with free exercise of the</hi> Roman <hi>Religion, for her self, her Officers, and all her Houshold, for the celebration of the</hi> Mass, <hi>the Predication of the Word, Administration if the Sacraments, and power to procure Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the Holy Father. That to this end, she shall be allow'd</hi> 28 <hi>Priests or Ecclesiasticks in her House, and a Bishop in quality of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner, who shall have jurisdiction over all the rest, and that none of the Kings Officers shall have power over them, unless in case of Treason; therfore all her Ecclesiastics shall take the Oath of fidelitie to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie of great</hi> Britain; <hi>ther shall be a Cymitier or Church-yard clos'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, to burie those of her Family.

The two first things he did, was to make sure of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Hollander;</hi> he thinks to have us safe enough by this mariage; and <hi>Holland</hi> by a late League, which was bought with a great sum of money; for he hath furnish'd the <hi>States</hi> with a Million of Liures, at two shillings a peece in present, and six hundred thousand Liures every year of these two that are to com; provided, That the <hi>States</hi> repay these sums two years after they are in peace or truce: The King press'd much for Liberty of Conscience to <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, and the Deputies promis'd to do all they could with the <hi>States</hi> Generall about it; they Articled likewise for <hi>French</hi> to be associated with them in the trade to the <hi>Indies.</hi>

                        <p>For forrain tidings, your Lordship may understand, that the Town of <hi>Breda</hi> hath bin a good while making her last will and testament, but now ther is certain news com, that she hath yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up the Ghost to <hi>Spinalo's</hi> hands after a tough siege of thirteen months, and a circumvallation of nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>My Lord of <hi>Southampton</hi> and his eldest son sickned at the siege, and died at <hi>Berghen;</hi> the adventrous Earl <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to tax the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> of slacknes to fight, was set upon a desperat Work, wher he melted his grease, and so being carried to the <hi>Hague,</hi> he died also: I doubt not but you have heard of Graye <hi>Maurice's</hi> death, which happen'd when the Town was pass'd cure, which was <hi>his</hi> more than the <hi>States,</hi> for he was Marquis of <hi>Breda,</hi> and had neer upon thirty thousand dollars annual rent from her: Therfore he seem'd in a kind of sympathy to sicken with his Town, and died before her. He had provided plentifully for all his Naturall children, but could not, though much importun'd by Doctor <hi>Roseus,</hi> and other Divines upon his death bed, be induc'd to make them legitimat by marying the mother of them, for the Law there is, That if one hath got children of any Woman, though unmaried to her, yet if he mary her never so little before his death, he makes her honest, and them all legitimat; but it seems, the Prince postpos'd the love he bore to his <hi>woman and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> to that which he bore to his <hi>brother Henry;</hi> for had he made the children legitimat, it had prejudic'd the brother in point of command and fortunes; yet he hath provided very plentifully for them and the mother.</p>
                        <p>Grave <hi>Henry</hi> hath succeeded him in all things, and is a gallant Gentleman, of a <hi>French</hi> education and temper; he charg'd him
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97056:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at his death to marry a young Lady, the Count of <hi>Solms</hi> Daughter, attending the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> whom he had long courted, which is thought will take speedy effect.</p>
                        <p>When the siege before <hi>Breda</hi> had grown hot, Sir <hi>Edward Vere</hi> being one day attending Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> he pointed at a rising place call'd <hi>Terbay,</hi> wher the enemy had built a Fort, (which might have bin prevented) Sir <hi>Edward</hi> told him, he fear'd that Fort would be the cause of the loss of the Town; the <hi>Grave</hi> spatter'd and shook his head, saying, 'twas the greatest error he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted since he knew what belong'd to a Soldier; as also in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the plot for surprising of the Cittadell of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented that he had not imployed <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> in lieu of the slow Dutch who aym'd to have the sole honour of it, and were not so fit instruments for such a nimble peece of service. As soon as Sir <hi>Charls Morgan</hi> gave up the Town, <hi>Spinola</hi> caus'd a new Gate to be erected with this inscription in great Golden Characters.</p>

The sinking of the long <hi>Robin</hi> with 170 souls in her, in the Bay of <hi>Biscay,</hi> erc she had gon half the voyage was no good augury; And the Critics of the time say, ther were many other things that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd no good fortune to this Fleet; besides they would point at divers errors committed in the conduct of the <hi>main</hi> design; first, the odd choice that was made of the Admirall, who was a meer Land-man, which made the Sea men much slight him, it belonging
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97056:113"/>
properly to Sir <hi>Robert Mansell,</hi> Vice-Admirall of <hi>England,</hi> to have gon in case the High-Admirall went not; then they speak of the incertainty of the enterprize, and that no place was pitch'd upon to be invaded, till they came to the height of the South Cape, and to sight of shore, where the Lord <hi>Wimbledon</hi> first cal'd a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of War, wherin som would be for <hi>Malaga,</hi> others for Saint <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Port,</hi> others for <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> but most for <hi>Cales,</hi> and while they were thus consulting, the Countrey had an alarum given them; Add hereunto the blazing abroad of this expedition ere the Fleet went out of the <hi>Downs,</hi> for <hi>Mercurius Gallobelgicus</hi> had it in print, that it was for the Streights mouth; <hi>Now 'tis a rule, that great designs of State should be mysteries till they com to the very act of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and then they should turn to exploits:</hi> Moreover, when the locall attempt was resolv'd on, ther wer seven ships (by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of one Captain <hi>Love</hi>) suffer'd to go up the River, which might have bin easily taken, and being rich, 'tis thought they would have defrayed well neer the charge of our Fleet, which ships did much infest us afterwards with their Ordnance, when we had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Forr of <hi>Puntall:</hi> Moreover, the disorderly carriage and excess of our Land-men (wherof ther were 10000) when they were put a shore, who broke into the Fryers Caves, and other Cellers of Sweet-Wines, wher many hundreds of them being surprizd, and found dead-drunk, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came and toar off their Ears, and Noses, and pluck'd out their Eies: And I was told of one merry fellow escaping, that kill'd an Asse for a Buck: Lastly, it is laid to the Admiralls charge, that my Lord <hi>de la Wares</hi> Ship being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, he should give order, that the sick men should be scatter'd in o divers ships, which dispers'd the contagion exceedingly, so that som thousands died before the Fleet return'd, which was don in a confus'd manner without any observance of Sea Orders: Yet I do not hear of any that will be punish'd for these miscarriages, which will make the dishonour fall more fouly upon the State: but the most infortunate passage of all was, that though we did nothing by Land that was considerable, yet if we had stayd but a day or two longer, and spent time at sea, the whole Fleet of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons, and <hi>Nova Hispania,</hi> had faln into our mouths, which came presently in, close along the Coasts of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, we might have had the opportunity to have taken the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est prize that ever was taken on salt-water.

                        <p>My Lord, you are a great Prince, and all eyes are upon your actions, this makes you more subject to envy, which like the Sun beams, beats alwayes upon rising grounds.

                        <p>My Lord, under favor, it were not amiss if your Grace would be pleased to part with som of those places you hold, which have least relation to the Court, and it would take away the mutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings that run of multiplicity of Offices, and in my shallow ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, your Grace might stand more firm without an <hi>Anchor:</hi> The Office of High Admirall in these times of action requires one whole man to execute it, your Grace hath another Sea of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97056:114"/>
to wade through, and the voluntary resigning of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice would fill all men, yea even your enemies, with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and affection, and make you more a Prince, than detract from your greatnes: If any ill successes happen at Sea (as that of the Lord <hi>Wimbledons</hi> lately) or if ther be any murmur for pay, your Grace will be free from all imputations, besides it will afford your Grace more leasure to look into your own affairs, which lie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, and unsetled: Lastly, (which is not the least thing) this act will be so plausible, that it may much advantage His Majesty in point of Subsidy.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it were expedient (under correction) that your Grace would be pleas'd to allot som set hours for audience and access of Suters, and it would be less cumber to your Self, and your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and give more content to the World, which often mutters for difficulty of access.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, it were not amiss, that your Grace would settle a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Mansion-house and Family, that Suters may know whither to repair constantly, and that your Servants evry one in his place, might know what belongs to his place, and attend accordingly; for though confusion in a great Family carry a kind of state with it, yet order and regularity gains a greater opinion of vertue and wisdom. I know your Grace doth not (nor needs not) affect popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity: It is true, that the peoples love is the strongest Cittadell of a Soveraign Prince, but to a great subject, it hath often prov'd fatall; for he who pulleth off his <hi>Hat</hi> to the People, giveth his <hi>Head</hi> to the Prince; and it is remarkable what was said of a late infortunat Earl, who a little before Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> death, had drawn the Ax upon his own Neck, <hi>That he was grown so popular, that he was too dangerous for the times, and the times for him.</hi>

                        <p>SIr <hi>Iohn North</hi> delivered me one lately from your Lordship, and I send my humble thanks for the Venison you intend me.</p>
                        <p>I acquainted your Lordship as opportunity serv'd with the nimble pace the <hi>French</hi> Match went on by the successfull negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Earls of <hi>Carlile</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> (who outwent the Monsieurs themselves in Courtship) &amp; how in less than nine <hi>Moons</hi> this great busines was propos'd, pursued, and perfected, wheras the <hi>Sun</hi> had leasure enough to finish his annuall progres, from one end of the <hi>Zodiac</hi> to the other so many <hi>years,</hi> before that of <hi>Spain</hi> could com to any shape of perfection: This may serve to shew the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference 'twixt the two Nations, the <hi>Leaden-heeld</hi> pace of the one, and the <hi>Quick-silver'd</hi> motions of the other; It shews also how the <hi>French</hi> is more generous in his proceedings, and not so full of scruples, reservations, and jealousies, as the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but deales more frankly, and with a greater confidence and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,</p>
                        <p>The Lord Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> is now in <hi>Paris</hi> accompanied with the Earl of <hi>Montgomerie,</hi> and hee went in a very splendid equipage. The <hi>Venetian</hi> and <hi>Hollander</hi> with other <hi>States</hi> that are no friends to <hi>Spain,</hi> did som good offices to advance this Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and the new <hi>Pope</hi> propounded much towards it; But <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu</hi> the new Favorit of <hi>France</hi> was the <hi>Cardinall</hi> instrument in it.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Pope Urban</hi> grows very active, not onely in things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but ripping up of old matters, for which ther is a select Committee appointed to examin accounts and errors pass'd, not only in the time of his immediat Predecessor, but others. And one told me of a merry Pasquill lately in <hi>Rome;</hi> that wheras ther are two great Statues, one of <hi>Peter,</hi> the other of <hi>Paul,</hi> opposit one to the other upon a Bridge, one had clapt a pair of Spurs upon Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Heels, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> asking him whither hee was bound, he answered, <hi>I apprehend som danger to staie now in</hi> Rome, <hi>because of this new Commission, for I fear they will questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me for denying my Master.

                        <p>I Thank you for your late Letter, and the severall good tydings you sent me from <hi>Wales;</hi> In requitall I can send you gallant news, for we have now a most Noble new Queen of <hi>England,</hi> who in true beuty is beyond the Long-Woo'd <hi>Infanta;</hi> for she was of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Flaxen-Hair, Big Lipp'd, and somwhat heavy Ey'd; but this Daughter of <hi>France,</hi> this youngest Branch of <hi>Bourbon</hi> (being but in her cradle when the great <hi>Henry</hi> her Father was put out of the World) is of a more lovely and lasting complexion, a dark brown, shee hath eyes that sparkle like Stars; and for her Physiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy she may be said to be a mirror of perfection: She had a rough passage in her transfretation to <hi>Dover</hi> Castle, and in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> the King Bedded first with her; ther were a goodly train of choice Ladies attended her coming, upon the Bowling-green on <hi>Barram-Down</hi> upon the way, who divided themselves into two rows, and they appear'd like so many Constellations; but me thought that the Countrey Ladies out-shin'd the Courtiers: She brought over with her, two hundred thousand Crowns in Gold and Silver, as halt her portion, and the other Moitie is to be payed at the yeers end. Her first suit of servants (by Article) are to be <hi>French,</hi> and as they die <hi>English</hi> are to succeed; shee is also allowed twenty eight Ecclesiastics of any Order, except Iesuits; a Bishop for her Almoner, and to have privat exercise of her Religion, for her and her servants.</p>
                        <p>I pray convey the inclosed to my Father by the next convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and present my dear love to my Sister; I hope to see you at <hi>Dyvinnock</hi> about <hi>Micha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>The <hi>French</hi> that came over with Her Majesty, for their petulan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and som misdemeanors, and imposing som odd penancy's up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Queen, are all casheer'd this week, about a matter of sixscore, wherof the Bishop of <hi>Mende</hi> was one, who had stood to be Steward of Her Majesties Courts, which Office my Lord of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath; It was a thing suddenly don, for about one of the clock as they were at dinner, my Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,</hi> came with an Order from the King, that they must instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away to <hi>Somerset</hi> House, for there were Barges, and Coaches staying for them; and there they should have all their Wages paied them to a peny, and so they must be content to quit the Kingdom: This sudden, undream'd of Order, struck an astonishment into them all, both men and women; and running to complain to the Queen, His Majesty had taken her before into his Bed-chamber, and lock'd the doors upon them, untill he had told her how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters stood; the Queen fell into a violent passion, broke the Glass-Windows, and tore her Hair, but she was calm'd afterwards: Just such a destiny happen'd in <hi>France</hi> som years since to the Queens <hi>Spanish</hi> Servants there, who were all dismiss'd in like manner for som miscarriages; the like was don in <hi>Spain</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> therfore 'tis no new thing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="131" facs="tcp:97056:118"/>They are all now on their way to <hi>Dover,</hi> but I fear this will breed ill bloud 'twixt us and <hi>France,</hi> and may break out into an ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd quarrell.</p>
                        <p>Master <hi>Mountague</hi> is preparing to go to <hi>Paris</hi> as a Messenger of Honour, to prepossess the King and Counsell there, with the truth of things.</p>

                        <p>I Met lately with <hi>I. Harris</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and I had not seen him two years before, and then I took him, and knew him to be a man of thirty, but now one would take him by his Hair to be near three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score, for he is all turnd gray. I wonderd at such a Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis in so short a time, hee told me 'twas for the death of his Wife, that nature had thus antidated his years, 'tis true that a weighty setled sorrow is of that force, that besides the contraction of the Spirits, it will work upon the radicall moisture, and dry it up, so that the Hair can have no moisture at the Root. This made me remember a Story that a <hi>Spanish</hi> Advocat told me, which is a thing very remarkable. <hi>When the Duke of</hi> Alva <hi>was in</hi> Brussels, <hi>about the beginning of the tumults in the</hi> Netherlands, <hi>he had sat down before</hi> Hulst <hi>in</hi> Flanders, <hi>and ther was a Provost Marshall in his Army, who was a Favorit of his; and this Provost had put som to death by secret Commission from the Duke: Ther was one Captain</hi> Bolea <hi>in the Armie, who was an intimat friend of the Provosts, and one evening late, he went to the said Captains Tent, and brought with him a</hi> Confessor, <hi>and an</hi> Executioner, <hi>as it was his custom; He told the Captain, that he was com to execut his Excellencies Commission, and Marshall Law upon him; the Captain started up suddenly, his hair standing at an end, and being struck with amazement, ask'd him wherin he had offended the Duke; the Provest answer'd, Sir I com not to expostulat the busines with you, but to execut my Commission, therfore I pray prepare your self, for ther's your</hi> Ghostly Father <hi>and</hi> Executioner: <hi>so he fell on his knees before the Priest, and having don, the</hi> Hangman <hi>going to put the Halter about his neck, the Provost threw it away, and breaking into a laughter, told him, ther was no such thing, and that he had don this to try his courage, how be could bear the terror of death, the Captain look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>SIR, 'Twas no great matter to be a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and to have foretold his rupture 'twixt us and <hi>France</hi> upon the sudden <hi>renvoy</hi> of her Majesties servants, for many of them had sold their estates in <hi>France,</hi> given money for their places, and so thought to live and die in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the Queens service, and so have pittifully complained to that King, therupon he hath arrested above 100 of our Merchant men that went to this Vintage at <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> We also take som straglers of theirs, for ther are Letters of Mart given on both sides.</p>
                        <p>Ther are Writs issued out for a Parliament, and the Town of <hi>Richmond</hi> in <hi>Richmond</hi> shire hath made choise of me for their Burgess, though Master <hi>Christopher Wansford</hi> and other powerfull men, and more deserving than I, stood for it. I pray God send fair weather in the House of Commons, for ther is much mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring about the restraint of those that would not conform to <hi>loan-moneys.</hi> Ther is a great Fleet a preparing, and an Army of Land-men, but the design is uncertain whether it be against <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> for we are now in enmity with both those Crowns. The French Cardinall hath been lately tother side the Alpes, and setled the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> in the Duchy of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the opposition of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Emperor, who alleg'd that he was to receive his investiture from him, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Another merry passage a Captain told me, that when they were rifling the dead bodies of the French Gentlemen after the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion, they found that many of them had their Mistresses favors tyed about their genitories. The French do much glory to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd us thus, and they have reason, for the truth is, they compor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves gallantly; yet they confess our landing was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table piece of courage, and if our <hi>Retreat</hi> had been answerable to the <hi>Invasion,</hi> we had lost no honor at all.

                        <p>Upon Saturday last, which was but next before yesterday being <hi>Bartholmew</hi> yeeve, the Duke did rise up in a well disposed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor out of his bed, and cutt a Caper or two, and being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and having been under the Barbers hands (wher the Murtherer had thought to have don the deed, for hee was lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the Window all the while) hee went to breakfast at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a great Company of Commanders, where Monsieur <hi>Soubize</hi> came unto him, and whispered him in the ear that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell</hi> was relieved, the Duke seem'd to slight the news, which made som think that <hi>Soubize</hi> went away discontented; After Breakfast the Duke going out, Colonell <hi>Fryer</hi> stepped before him, and stopping him upon som busines, one Lieutenant <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> being behind, made a thrust with a common tenpeny knife over <hi>Fryers</hi> arm at the Duke, which lighted so fatally, that hee slit his heart in two, leaving the knife sticking in the body; The Duke took out the knife, and threw it away, and laying his hand on his Sword, and drawn it half out said, the Villain hath killd me (meaning as som think Colonell <hi>Fryer</hi>) for ther had been som difference 'twixt them, so reeling against a Chimney hee fell down dead; The Dutchess being with child hearing the noise below, cam in her night geers from her Bed Chamber, which was in an upper room, to a kind of Rayl, and thence beheld him weltering in his own bloud. <hi>Felton</hi> had lost his Hat in the croud, wherin ther was a Paper sowed, wherin he declared that the reason which mov'd him to this act was no grudg of his own, though hee had been far behind for

send forth, as it were, whole volleys of Oaths and Curses in a calm humor, to verifie every triviall discours is a thing of horror. I knew a King that being cross'd in his game would amongst his Oaths fall on the ground, and bite the very earth in the rough of his passion; I heard of another King (<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi>) that in his highest distemper would swear but <hi>Ventre de Saint Gris,</hi> by the belly of Saint <hi>Gris;</hi> I heard of an Italian, that having been much accustomed to blaspheme, was wean'd from it by a pretty wile, for having been one night at play, and lost all his money, after many execrable Oathes, and having offerd money to another to go out to face heaven and defie God, he threw himself upon a Bed hard by, and there fell asleep; The other Gamsters plaid on still<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and finding that he was fast asleep, they put out the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and made semblance to play on still, they fell a wrangling, and spoke so loud, that he awaked, he hearing them play on stil fell a rubbing his eyes, and his conscience presently prompted him that he was struck blind, and that Gods judgment had deservedly fallen down upon him for his blasphemies, and so he fell to sigh and weep pittifully, a ghostly Father was sent for, who undertook to do som acts of penance for him, if he would make a vow never to play again or blaspheme, which he did, and so the candles were lighted again, which he thought were burning all the while; so he becam a perfect Convert. I could wish this Letter might produce the same effect in you; Ther is a strong Text, that the curse of heaven hangs always over the dwelling of the swearer, and you have more fearfull examples of miraculous judgments in this particular, than of any other sin.</p>
                        <p>Ther is a little town in <hi>Languedoc</hi> in France that hath a multitude of the Pictures of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> up and down, but she is made to carry Christ in her right arm contrary to the ordinary custom, and the reason they told me was this, that two gamsters being at play, &amp; one having lost all his money, and bolted out many blasphemies, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And the greatest symptom of amendment I find in mee is, because whensoever I hear the holy name of God blasphem'd by any other, it makes my heart to tremble within my brest: Now it is a penitentiall Rule <hi>that if sins present do not please thee, sins pass'd will never hurt thee.</hi> All other sins have for their object, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleasure or profit, or some ayme and satisfaction to body or mind, but this hath none at all, therfore fie upon't, my dear Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

transported to a true Elysium all the while, ther were such flexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous strong ravishing strains throughout it. To deal plainly with you, it wer an injury to the public good, not to expose to open light such divine raptures, for they have an edifying power in them, and may be tearm'd the very quintessence of devotion; you discover in them what a rich talent you have, which should not be buried within the walls of a privat study, or pass through a few particular hands, but appear in public view, and to the sight of the world, to the enriching of others, as they did me in reading them. Therfore I shall long to see them pass from the Bankside to <hi>Pauls</hi> Churchyard, with other precious peeces of yours, which you have pleas'd to impart unto me</p>

                        <p>OUr two younger brothers, which you sent hither, are disposed of; my brother Doctor hath placed the elder of the two with Mr. <hi>Hawes,</hi> a Mercer in Cheapside, and he took much paines in't, and I had plac'd my brother <hi>Ned,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Barrington,</hi> a Silk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>man in the same street, but afterwards for som inconveniences, I remov'd him to one Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> at the Flower-de-Luce in Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard-street, a Mercer also; Their Masters are both of them very wel to pass, and of good repute; I think it will prove som advantage to them hereafter, to be both of one trade; because when they are out of their time, they may joyn s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>Now your Lordship shall understand, that the said King is at <hi>Mentz,</hi> &amp; keeps a Court there like an Emperour, there being above twelve Ambassadors with him. The King of <hi>France</hi> sent a great Marquis for his Ambassador to <hi>put</hi> him in mind of his Articles, and to tell him that his Christian Majesty wondred he would cross the <hi>Rhine</hi> without his privity, and wondred more that he would invade the Church-lands, meaning the Archbishop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who had put himself under the protection of <hi>France;</hi> The <hi>Swed</hi> answer'd, That he had not broke the least title of the Articles agreed on, and touching the said Archbishop, he had not stood Neutrall as was promised, therfore he had justly set on his skirts. The Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor replied, in case of breach of Articles, his Master had eighty thousand men to pierce <hi>Germany</hi> when he pleas'd; The King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd that he had but twenty thousand, and those should be soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at the walls of <hi>Paris,</hi> then his fourscore thousand should be on the frontiers of <hi>Germany.</hi> If this new Conquerer goes on with this violence, I beleeve it will cast the pollicy of all Christendom into another mould, and be get new maximes of State, for none can foretell wher his monstrous progress will terminat; Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> is still in <hi>Germany,</hi> observing his motions, and they write that they do not agree well; as I heard the King should tell him that he spoke nothing but <hi>Spanish</hi> to him: Sir <hi>Robert Anstruther</hi> is also at <hi>Vienna,</hi> being gon thither from the Diet at <hi>Ratisbon.</hi>

The Kings of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> have sued to be their Protector, but they refus'd them, because they were not Princes of the Empire; they put off also the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> with a Complement, nor would they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the King of <hi>Spain</hi> when he was most potent in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> though afterwards when 'twas too late, they desir'd the help of the <hi>Ragged Staff;</hi> nor of the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> notwithstanding that, the world thought he should have married our Queen, who interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for him, and so 'twas probable, that therby they might reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their privileges in <hi>England;</hi> so that I do not find they ever had any Protector, but the great Master of <hi>Prussia;</hi> and their want of a Protector did do them som prejudice in that famous difference they had with our Queen.</p>

                        <p>The King begins to fill his Chests apace, which were so emptied in his late marches to <hi>Germany:</hi> He hath set a new Toll upon all Ships that pass to this Town; and in the <hi>Sound</hi> also ther be som ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary duties impos'd, wherat all Nations begin to murmure, specially the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who say, that the old Primitive Toll of the <hi>Sound</hi> was but a Rose-noble for evry <hi>Ship,</hi> but by a new Sophistry, it is now interpreted for evry <hi>Sail</hi> that should pass thorow, insomuch, that the <hi>Hollander</hi> though he be a <hi>Low-Countrey</hi> man, begins to speak <hi>high-Dutch</hi> in this point, a rough language you know; which made the <hi>Italian</hi> tell a <hi>German</hi> Gentleman once, That <hi>when God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thrust</hi> Adam <hi>out of Paradise, he spake Dutch;</hi> but the <hi>German</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted wittily, <hi>Then Sir, if God spake Dutch when</hi> Adam <hi>was eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi> Eve <hi>spake Italian when</hi> Adam <hi>was seduced.</hi>

                        </opener>
                        <p>I Am newly return'd from <hi>Germany,</hi> whence ther came lately two Ambassadors extraordinary in one of the Ships Royall, the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Anstruther;</hi> the latter came from <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and I know little of his negotiations; but for my Lord of <hi>Leicester,</hi> I beleeve ther was never so much busines dispatch'd in so short a compas of time, by any Ambassador, as your Lordship, who is best able to judg, will find by this short relation: When my Lord was com to the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Court, which was then at <hi>Rhensberg,</hi> a good way within <hi>Holstein:</hi> The first thing he did, was to condole the late Queen <hi>Dowagers</hi> death (our Kings Gran-Mother) which was don in such an equipage, that the <hi>Danes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd, ther was never Queen of <hi>Denmark</hi> so mourn'd for: This cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony being pass'd, my Lord fell to busines; and the first thing which he propounded, was, That for preventing of further effusion of Christian blood in <hi>Germany,</hi> and for the facilitating a way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store peace to all Christendom, His Majesty of <hi>Denmark</hi> would joyn with his Nephew of great <hi>Britain,</hi> to send a solemn Ambassie to the Emperour, and the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> (the ends of whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings were doubtfull) to mediat an accommodation, and to appear for <hi>him,</hi> who will be found most conformable to reason. To this, that King answer'd in <hi>writing</hi> (for that was the way of proceeding) that the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>Swede</hi> were com to that height, and heat of war, and to such a violence, that it is no time yet to speak to them of peace; but when the fury is a little pass'd, and the times more proper, he would take it for an Honour to joyn with his Nephew, and contribut the best means he could to bring about so good a Work.</p>
                        <p>Then ther was computation made, what was due to the King of great <hi>Britain,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> out of their Gran-Mothers Estate,: which was valued at neer upon two Millions of Dollars, and your Lordship must think it was a hard task to liquidat such an account: This being don, my Lord desird that part which was due to his Majesty (our King) and the <hi>Lady</hi> his Sister, which appear'd to amount unto eightscore thousand pounds sterling:
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97056:147"/>
That King answer'd, That he confess'd ther was so much money due, but his Mothers Estate was yet in the hands of Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and neither he, nor any of his Sisters, had receiv'd their portions yet, and that his Nephew of <hi>England,</hi> and his Neere of <hi>Holland,</hi> should receive theirs with the first; but he did intimat besides, that ther were som considerable accounts 'twixt him and the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> for ready moneys he had lent his Brother King <hi>Iames,</hi> and for the thirty thousand pounds a moneth, that was by Covenant promis'd him for the support of his late Army in <hi>Germany.</hi> Then my Lord propounded, That His Majesty of Great <hi>Britains</hi> Subjects were not well us'd by his Officers in the <hi>Sound:</hi> for though that was but a Transitory passage into the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi> Sea, and that they neither bought nor sould any thing upon the place, yet they were forc'd to stay there many daies to take up money at high interest, to pay divers Tolls for their Merchandize, before they had expos'd them to vent: Therfore it was desired, that for the future, what <hi>English</hi> Merchant soever should pass through the <hi>Sound,</hi> it should be sufficient for him to Register an invoice of his Cargazon in the Custom-House Book, and give his Bond to pay all duties at his return, when he had made his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. To this my Lord had a fair answer, and so procur'd a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Instrument under that Kings Hand and Seale, and sign'd by his Counsellors, which he had brought over, wherin the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition was granted; which no Ambassador could obtaine before. Then 'twas alledg'd, that the <hi>English</hi> Merchant <hi>Adventurers</hi> who trade into <hi>Hamburgh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </hi> have a new Toll lately impos'd upon them at <hi>Luckstad,</hi> which was desir'd to be taken of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>. To this also, ther was the like Instrument given, that the said Toll should be levied no more, Lastly, my Lord (in regard he was to pa's by the <hi>Hague</hi>) desir'd that Hereditary part which belong'd to the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> out of her Gran-Mothers Estate, because His Majesty knew well what Crosses and Afflictions she had pass'd, and what a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Issue she had to maintain; And my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> would ingage his Honour, and all the Estate he hath in the World, That this should no way prejudice the accounts he is to make with his Majesty of Great <hi>Britain.</hi> The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> highly extoll'd the Noblenes of this motion; but he protested, that he had bin so drain'd in the late Wars, that his Chests are yet very empty. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon my Lord was feasted, and so departed.</p>
                        <p>He went then to the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> to <hi>Sleswick,</hi> wher he found him at his Castle of <hi>Gothorp,</hi> and truly I did not think to have found such a magnificent building in these bleak parts; Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>e
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97056:148"/>
also my Lord did condole the death of the late Queen that Dukes Gran-Mother, and he receiv'd very Princely entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>Then he went to <hi>Husem,</hi> where the like ceremony of Condole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was perform'd at the Dutchess of <hi>Holsteins</hi> Court, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties (our Kings) <hi>Ant.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then he came back to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> wher that instrument which my Lord had procur'd, for remitting of the new Toll at <hi>Gluckslad,</hi> was deliver'd the Company of our Merchant Adventurers; and som other good offices don for that Town, as matters stood twixt them and the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then we came to <hi>Stode,</hi> wher <hi>Lesly</hi> was Governour, who carried his foot in a scarfe for a wound he had received at <hi>Bucks<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                                 <desc>•…</desc>
                              </gap>obo,</hi> and he kept that place for the King of <hi>Sweden:</hi> And som busines of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence was don there also.</p>
                        <p>So we came to <hi>Broomsbottle,</hi> wher we staid for a Wind som daies; and in the midway of our voyage, wee met with a <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ship, who told us, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was slain; and so we return'd to <hi>London</hi> in less then three moneths: And if this was not busines enough for such a compass of time, I leave your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to judg.</p>
                        <p>So craving your Lordships pardon for this lame account, I rest,</p>

will lay wagers he is not yet dead, and the <hi>Exchange</hi> is full of such peeple. He was slain at <hi>Lutzen</hi> field battle, having made the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Army give ground the day before; and being in pursuance of it, the next morning in a sudden Fog that fell, the Cavelry on both sides being engag'd, he was kill'd in the midst of the Troops, and none knows who kill'd him, whether one of his own men or the enemy; but finding himself mortally hurt, he told <hi>Saxen Way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, Cousin, I pray look to the Troops, for I think I have enough:</hi> His body was not only rescued, but his forces had the better of the day; <hi>Papenheim</hi> being kill'd before him, whom he esteem'd the greatest Captain of all his enemies; for he was us'd to say, that he had three men to deal withall, a <hi>Pultron,</hi> a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> and a <hi>Souldier;</hi> by the two first, he meant <hi>Walstein,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> by the last <hi>Papenheim.</hi>

In requitall, I can tell you of a strange thing I saw lately here, and I beleeve 'tis true; As I pass'd by St. <hi>Dunstans</hi> in Fleet street the last Saturday, I stepp'd into a Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary or Stone-cutters shop, to treat with the Master for a stone to be put upon my Fathers Tomb: and casting my eyes up and down, I might spie a huge Marble with a large Inscription upon't, which was thus to my best remembrance:</p>
                        <q>Here lies <hi>John Oxenham,</hi> a goodly young man, in whose Chamber, as he was strugling with the pangs of death, a Bird with a white brest was seen fluttering about his Bed, and so vanish'd.</q>
                        <q>Here lies also <hi>Mary Oxenham,</hi> the sister of the said <hi>John</hi> who died the next day, and the same Apparition was seen in the Room.</q>
                        <p>Then another Sister is spoke of.</p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>Then,</hi> Here lies hard by <hi>James Oxenham,</hi> the son of the said <hi>John,</hi> who died a child in his Cradle a little after, and such a Bird was seen fluttering about his head, a little before he expir'd, which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd afterwards.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </q>
                        <p>At the bottom of the Stone ther is,</p>
                        <q>Here lies <hi>Elizabeth Oxenham,</hi> the Mother of the said <hi>John,</hi> who died sixteen years since, when such a Bird with a white brest was seen about hex Bed before her death.</q>
                        <p>To all these ther be divers Witnesses, both Squires and Ladies, whose names are engraven upon the Stone: This Stone is to be sent to a Town hard by <hi>Exeter</hi> wher this happen'd.</p>
                        <p>Were you here, I could raise a choice Discours with you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:97056:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Though such a Discours, exactly fram'd, might make up a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, yet I will twist up what I know in this point, upon as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a Bottom as may be shut up within the compass of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>The first Christian Countrey that expell'd the <hi>Iews,</hi> was <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; France</hi> followed our example next, then <hi>Spain,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Portugall;</hi> nor were they exterminated these Countreys for their Religion, but for Villanies and cheatings; for clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Coins, poisning of Waters, and counterfeiting of Seals.</p>
                        <p>Those Countreys they are permitted to live now most in amongst Christians, are <hi>Germany, Holland, Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> but not in those parts where the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath to do. In the <hi>Levant</hi> and <hi>Turkey,</hi> they swarm most, for the gran <hi>Vizier,</hi> and all other great <hi>Boshawes,</hi> have commonly som <hi>Iew</hi> for their Counsellor or Spie, who inform them of the state of Christian Princes, possess them of a hatred of the Religion, and so incense them to a war against them.</p>
                        <p>They are accounted the subtill'st and most subdolous peeple up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; the reason why they are thus degenerated from their primitive simplicity, and innocence, is their often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>

The Cook bringing in the Dish accordingly, Monsieur <hi>Faiel</hi> commanded all to void the room, and began a serious discours with his wife, how ever since he had married her, he observ'd she was always melancholly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he feared she was inclining to a Consumption, therfore he had provided for her a very precious Cordiall, which he was well assured would cure her: Therupon he made her eat up the whole dish; and afterwards much importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him to know what it was, he told her at last she had eaten <hi>Coucy's</hi> heart, and so drew the Box out of his pocket, and shewed her the Note and the Bracelet: in a sudden exultation of joy, she with a far-fetch'd sigh said, <hi>This is a precious Cordiall indeed,</hi> and so lick'd the Dish saying, <hi>It is so pretious, that tis pity to put ever any meat upon't.</hi> So she went to bed, and in the morning she was found stone-dead.</p>
                        <p>This Gentleman told me that this sad story is painted in <hi>Coucy-Castle,</hi> and remains fresh to this day.</p>

                        <p>IT seems ther is som angry Star that hath hung over the busines of the <hi>Palatinat</hi> from the beginning of these <hi>German</hi> Wars to this very day; which will too evidently appear, if one should mark and deduce matters from their first rise.</p>
                        <p>You may remember how poorly <hi>Prague</hi> was lost: The Bishop of <hi>Halverstat</hi> and Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi> shuffled up and down a good while, and did great matters, but all came to nothing at last. You may remember how one of the Ships-Royall was cast away in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying over the last, and the 12000 men he had hence perish'd many of them very miserably, and he himself, as they write, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a poor Hostrey with one Laquay, as he was going to <hi>Venice</hi> to a bank of money he had stor'd up there for a dead lift. Your Lordship knows what success the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had (and our 6000 men under Sir <hi>Charles Morgan</hi>) for while he thought to make new acquests, he was in hazard to lose all that he had, had not he had favorable Propositions tendred him. Ther were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> never poor Christians perished more lamentably than those 6000 we sent under M. <hi>Hamilton</hi> for the assistance of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who did much, but you know what became of him at last: How disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously the Prince <hi>Palatin</hi> himself fell, and in what an ill conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of time, being upon the very point of being restor'd to his Country.</p>
                        <p>But now we have as bad news as any we had yet; for the young Prince <hi>Palatin,</hi> and his Brother Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> having got a jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considerable Army in <hi>Holland,</hi> to try their fortunes in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> they had advanc'd as far as <hi>Munsterland,</hi> and <hi>Westphalia,</hi> and having lain before <hi>Lengua,</hi> they were forc'd to raise the siege; and one Generall <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Prince <hi>Palatin</hi> himself, with Major <hi>King,</hi> thinking to get over the <hi>Weser</hi> in a Coach, the Water being deep and not sordable, he sav'd himself by the help

of a Willow, and so went a foot all the way to <hi>Minden,</hi> the Coach and the Coach-man being drown'd in the River: Ther wer neer upon 2000 slain on the <hi>Palsgraves</hi> side, and scarce the twentieth part so many on <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>I Receiv'd yours this Maunday-Thursday: and wheras amongst other passages, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> high endearments of love, you desire to know what method I observe in the exercise of my devotl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I thank you for your request, which I have reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve doth proceed from an extraordinary respect unto me; and I will deal with you herein, as one should do with his Confessor.</p>
                        <p>Tis true, though ther be rules and rubrics in our <hi>Liturgy</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to guide evry one in the performance of all holy duties, yet I beleeve evry one hath som mode and modell or formula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his own, specially for his privat cubicular devotions.</p>
                        <p>I will begin with the last day of the week, and with the latter end of that day, I mean Saturday evening, on which I have fasted ever since I was a youth in <hi>Venice,</hi> for being delivered from a very great danger: This yeer I use som extraordinary acts of devotion to usher in the ensuing Sunday in Hymns, and various prayers of my own penning, before I go to bed. On Sunday Morning I rise earlier than upon other dayes, to prepare my self for the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it; nor do I use Barber, Tailor, Shoo-maker, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mechanick that morning; and whatsoever diversions, or lets, may hinder me the week before, I never miss, but in case of sicknes, to repair to Gods holy House that day, wher I com before prayers begin, to make my self fitter for the work by some praevious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, and to take the whole Service along with me; nor do I love to mingle speech with any in the interim about news or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly negotiations. In Gods holy House I prostrat my self in the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:97056:162"/>
and decent'st way of genuflection I can imagin; nor do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve ther can be any excess of exterior humility in that place; therfore I do not like those squatting unseemly bold postures upon ones tail, or muffling the face in the Hat, or thrusting it in so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap> hole, or covering it with ones hand; but with bended knee, and an open confident face, I fix my Eyes on the East part of the Church, and Heaven. I endeavour to apply evry tir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>le of the <hi>Service</hi> to my own Conscience and Occasions; and I believe the want of this, with the huddling up, and careless reading of som Ministers, with the commoness of it, is the greatest cause that many do undervalue and take a Surfet of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Service.</p>
                        <p>For the reading and singing <hi>Psalmes,</hi> wheras most of them are either Petitions or Eucharisticall ejaculations, I listen to them more attentively, and make them mine own: When I stand at the <hi>creed,</hi> I think upon the custom they have in <hi>Poland,</hi> and else-where, for Gentlemen to draw their Swords all the while, intimating therby, that they will defend it with their lives and bloud; And for the <hi>Decalog,</hi> wheras others use to rise, and sit, I ever kneel at it in the humblest and trembling'st posture of all, to crave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission for the breaches pass'd of any of Gods holy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (specially the week before) and future grace to observe them.</p>
                        <p>I love a holy devout Sermon, that first checks and then cheers the Conscience, that begins with the Law and ends with the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; but I never prejudicat or censure any Preacher, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>aking him as I find him.</p>
                        <p>And now that we are not only <hi>Adulted</hi> but <hi>ancient</hi> Christians, I beleeve the most acceptable Sacrifice we can send up to Heaven, is <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>praise,</hi> and that <hi>Sermons</hi> are not so essentiall as either of them to the tru practice of devotion. The rest of the holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, I sequester my body and mind as much as I can from worldly affairs.</p>
                        <p>Upon Monday morn, as soon as the <hi>Cinq-ports</hi> are open, I have a particular prayer of thanks, that I am reprieved to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that week; and evry day following, I knock thrice at Heavens gate, in the Morning, in the Evening, and at Night; besides, Prayers at Meals, and som other occasionall ejaculations, as upon the putting on of a clean Shirt, washing my hands, and at lighting of Candles, which because they are sudden, I do in the third person.</p>
                        <p>Tuesday morning I rise Winter and Summer as soon as I awake,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:97056:163"/>
and send up a more particular sacrifice for som reasons; and as I am dispos'd, or have busines, I go to bed again.</p>
                        <p>Upon Wensday night, I always fast, and perform also som ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary acts of Devotion, as also upon Friday night; and Saturday morning, as soon as my senses are unlock'd I get up. And in the Summer time, I am oftentimes abroad in som privat field, to attend the Sun-rising: And as I pray <hi>thrice</hi> evry day, so I fast <hi>thrice</hi> evry week, at least I eat but one meal upon Wens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, Fridays, and Saturdays, in regard I am jealous with my self, to have more infirmities to answer for, than other.</p>
                        <p>Before I go to bed, I make a scrutiny what peccant humors have reign'd in me that day, and so I reconcile my self to my Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and strike a <hi>tally</hi> in the Exchequer of Heaven for my <hi>quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              </gap>us est,</hi> ere I close my eyes, and leave no burden upon my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
                        <p>Before I presume to take the Holy Sacrament, I use som ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary acts of Humiliation to prepare my self som days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and by doing som deeds of Charity; and commonly I compose som new Prayers, and divers of them written in my own bloud.</p>

                        <p>YOur being then in the Country, when I began my journey for <hi>Ireland,</hi> was the cause I could not kiss your hands, therfore I shall do now from <hi>Bath,</hi> what I should have don at <hi>London.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Being here for a distillation of Rheum that pains me in one of my Arms, and having had about three thousand stroaks of a pump upon me in the Queens Bath: <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>And having bin here now divers daies and view'd the severall qualities of these Waters, I fell to contemplat a little what should be the reason of such an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary actuall heat, and medicinall vertue in them. I have seen and read of divers Baths abroad, as those of <hi>Caldanel</hi> and <hi>Avinian</hi> in <hi>agro Senensi,</hi> the <hi>Grotta</hi> in <hi>Viterbio,</hi> those between <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Puteolum</hi> in <hi>Campania;</hi> And I have bin a little curious to know the reason of those rare Lymphaticall properties in them above other waters. I find that som impute it to Wind, or Ayr, or som Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations shut up in the Bowels of the Earth, which either by their own nature, or by their violent motion and agitation, or attrition upon Rocks, and narrow passages do gather heat, and so impart it to the Waters.</p>
                        <p>Others attribut this <hi>balneal</hi> heat unto the Sun, whose all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searching Beams penetrating the Pores of the Earth, do heat the Waters.</p>
                        <p>Others think this heat to proceed from quicklime, which by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience we find to heat any Water cast upon't, and also to kindle any combustible substance put upon't.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, ther are som that ascribe this heat to a subterranean fire kindled in the bowels of the Earth upon sulphury and bituminous matter.</p>
                        <p>'Tis true, all these may be generall concurring causes, but not the adaequat proper and peculiar reason of <hi>balneal</hi> heats; and herein truly our learned Countryman Dr. <hi>Iorden</hi> hath got the start of any that ever writ of this subject, and goes to work like a solid Philosopher; for having treated of the generation of mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, he finds that they have their Seminaries in the Womb of the Earth replenish'd with active spirits; which meeting with apt

matter and adjuvant causes, do proceed to the generation of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall species, according to the nature of the efficient, and fitnes of the matter: In this work of generation, as ther is <hi>generatio uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> so ther is <hi>corruptio alterius;</hi> and this cannot be don without a superiour power, which by moysture dilating it self, works upon the matter like a leav'ning and ferment, to bring it to its own purpose.</p>
                        <p>This motion 'twixt the agent spirit, and patient matter, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth an actuall heat; <hi>for motion is the fountain of heat,</hi> which serves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So then it may be concluded, that this soyl about the Bath is a minerall vein of earth, and the fermenting gentle temper of generative heat that goes to the production of the said Mineralls, do impart and actually communicat this <hi>balneal</hi> vertue and medicinall heat to these Waters.</p>
                        <p>This subject of Minerall <hi>Waters</hi> would afford an <hi>Ocean</hi> of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wer one to compile a solid discours of it: And I pray excuse me, that I have presum'd in so narrow a compas as a Letter, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend so much, which is nothing I think, in comparison of what you know already of this matter.</p>

Sir <hi>Iohn Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington</hi> was then abroad with seven of His Majesties Ships: and <hi>Don Antonio</hi> being daily warn'd what forces were preparing in <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and so advis'd to get over to the <hi>Flemish</hi> Coasts: in the interim with a haughty spirit, he answer'd, <hi>Tengo de quedar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me aqui para castigar estos Rebeldes: I will stay here to chastise these Rebels.</hi> There were ten more of His Masties Ships appointed to go joyn with Sir <hi>Iohn Pennington,</hi> to observe the motions of these Fleets, but the wind continuing still East, they could not get out of the River.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet had Fresh-waters, Victualls, and other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries from our Coasts for their money, according to the capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of peace, all this while; at last, being half surprized by a cloud of <hi>Hollanders,</hi> consisting of one hundred and fourteen ships, the launc'd out from our Coasts, and a most furious fight began, our ships having retir'd hard by all the while: The Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of <hi>Portugall,</hi> a famous Sea Captain, <hi>Don Lope de Hozes,</hi> was engag'd in close fight with the Vice-Admirall of <hi>Holland,</hi> and after many tough rancounters they were both blown up, and burnt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

                              </gap>nia</hi> from the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> it seems the sparkles of those fires are flown to <hi>Portugall,</hi> and put that Countrey also in combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> whom you may well remember about the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> is now King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> by the name of <hi>El Rey Don Iuan,</hi> and he is as generally obey'd, and quietly setled, as if he had bin King these twenty yeers there; for the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey fell suddenly to him, not one Town standing out. When the King of <hi>Spain</hi> told <hi>Olivares</hi> of it first, he slighted it, saying, <hi>That he was but Rey de Havas, a Bean-cake King.</hi> But it seems strange to me, and so strange, that it transforms me to wonder, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> being accounted so politic a Nation, and so full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, could not foresee this; specially, ther being divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences given, and evident symptoms of the generall discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of that Kingdom (because they could not be protected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Hollander</hi> in <hi>Brasil</hi>) and of som designes a yeer before, when this Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> was at <hi>Madrid.</hi> I wonder I say, they did not secure his person by ingaging him in som employment out of the way: Truly, I thought the <hi>Spaniard</hi> was better sighted, and could could see further off than so. You know what a huge lim the Crown of <hi>Portugall</hi> was to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monarchy, by the Islands in the <hi>Atlantic</hi> Sea; the Towns in <hi>Afric;</hi> and all the <hi>East-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> insomuch, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath nothing now left beyond the <hi>Line.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Ther is no <hi>offensive</hi> war yet made by <hi>Spain</hi> against King <hi>Iohn,</hi> she only stands upon the <hi>defensive</hi> part, untill the <hi>Catalan</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd; and I beleeve, that will be a long-winded busines; for this <hi>French</hi> Cardinall stirs all the devills of Hell against <hi>Spain,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that most men say, that these formidable fires which are

                        <p>Ther was a ruthfull distaster happen'd lately at Sea, which makes our Merchants upon the <hi>Exchange</hi> hang down their heads very sadly. The Ship <hi>Swan,</hi> wherof one <hi>Limery</hi> was Master, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bin four yeers abroad about the Streights, was sailing home with a <hi>Cargazon,</hi> valued at eight hundred thousand pounds, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of four hundred and fifty thousand was in Money, the rest in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells and Merchandise; but being in sight of shore, she sprung a leak, and being ballasted with Salt, it choak'd the Pump, so that the <hi>Swan</hi> could swim no longer: Som sixteen were drown'd, and som of them with ropes of Pearl about their necks, the rest were sav'd by an <hi>Hamburgber</hi> not far off. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> loseth little by it (only his affairs in <hi>Flanders</hi> may suffer) for his Money was insur'd, and few of the <hi>Principalls,</hi> but the <hi>Insurers</hi> onely, who were most of them <hi>Genowayes</hi> and <hi>Hollanders:</hi> A most infortunat chance, for had she com to safe port, she had bin the richest ship that ever came into the <hi>Thames;</hi> so that <hi>Neptun</hi> never had such a morfell at one bit.</p>
                        <p>All your frends here are well, as you will understand more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by those Letters that go herewith.

                           <salute>SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>IT was my fortun to be in a late communication wher a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man spoke of a hideous thing that happen'd in High <hi>Holborn,</hi> how one <hi>Iohn Pennant</hi> a young man of 21, being dissected after his death, ther was a kind of Serpent with divers tails found in the left Ventricle of his heart, which you know is the most defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded part, being thrice thicker than the right, and in the Cell which holds the purest and most illustrious liquor, the arteriall blood,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:97056:170"/>
and the vitall spirits. This Serpent was it seems three yeers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring, for so long time he found himself indisposed in the brest; and it was observ'd, that his eye in the interim grew more sharp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and firy, like the eye of a Cock, which is next to a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents eye in rednes; so that the symptome of his inward Disease might have been told by certain exterior Rays and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures.</p>
                        <p>God preserve us from public calamities; for Serpentin Monsters have been often ill favoured presages. I remember in the Roman story, to have read how, when Snakes or Serpents wer found neer the statues of their gods, as one time about <hi>Iupiters</hi> neck, another time about <hi>Minerva's</hi> thigh, ther follow'd bloudy Civill War after it.</p>
                        <p>I remember also, few yeers since, to have read the relation and deposition of the Carrier of <hi>Tewxbury,</hi> who, with divers of his servants, passing a little before the dawn of the day with their packs over <hi>Cots</hi>-hill, saw most sensibly and very perspicuously in the air, Muskettiers, harnassed men, and horse-men, moving in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell-aray, and assaulting one another in divers furious postures. I doubt not but that you heard of those fiery Metcors and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts that have fallen upon sundry of our Churches, and don hurt. Unless God be pleas'd to make up these ruptures 'twixt us and <hi>Scotland,</hi> we are like to have ill days. The Archb. of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was lately out-rag'd in his House by a pack of common peeple: and Captain <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <p>THough we are not in the same <hi>prison,</hi> yet are we in the same <hi>predicament</hi> of suffrance; therfore I presume you are subject to the like fits of melancholly as I: <hi>The fruition of liberty is not so pleasing, as a conceit of the want of it is irksom,</hi> specially to one of such free-born thoughts as you. Melancholly is a black noxious humor, and much annoys the whol inward man; if you would know what cordiall I use against it in this my sad condition, Ile tell you, I pore somtimes on a Book, and so I make the <hi>dead</hi> my companions, and this is one of my chiefest solaces: If the humor work upon mee stronger, I rouze my spirits, and raise them up towards Heaven, my future Countrey; and one may be on his journy thither, though shut up in Prison, and happly go a straighter way, than if hee wer abroad: I consider, that my soul while shee is coop'd up within these walls of flesh, is but in a kind of perpetuall prison. And now my <hi>body</hi> corresponds with her in the same condition; my <hi>body</hi> is the prison of the one, and these <hi>brick-walls</hi> the prison of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And let the English peeple flatter themselves as long as they will, that they are free, yet are they in effect, but prisoners, as all other Islanders are; for being surrounded and clos'd about with <hi>Salt-water</hi> (as I am with these <hi>Walls</hi>) they cannot go where they list, unless they ask the <hi>Winds</hi> leave first, and <hi>Neptun</hi> must give them a pass.</p>
                        <p>God Almighty amend the times, and compose these wofull divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which menace nothing but public ruin, the thoughts wherof drown in me the sense of mine own <hi>privat</hi> affliction.</p>
                        <p>So wishing you courage (wherof you have enough, if you put it in practise) and patience in this sad sad condition, I rest</p>

                        <p>I Saw such prodigious things daily don these few yeers, that I had resolv'd with my self to give over <hi>wondering</hi> at any thing; yet a passage happen'd this week, that forc'd me to wonder once more, because it is without parallel. It was, that som odd fellows went skulking up and down <hi>London</hi>-streets, and with Figs and Reasons allur'd little Children, and so pourloyn'd them away from their Parents, and carried them a Ship-board for beyond Sea, where by cutting their hair, and other devises, they so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd them, that their Parents could not know them. This made me think upon that miraculous passage in <hi>Hamelen,</hi> a Town in <hi>Germans,</hi> which I hop'd to have pass'd through when I was in <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> had we return'd by <hi>Holland;</hi> which was thus, (nor would I relate it unto you wer ther not som ground of truth for it.) The said Town of <hi>Hamelen</hi> was annoyed with Rats and Mice; and it chanc'd, that a Pied-coated Piper came thither, who covenanted with the chief Burgers for such a reward, if he could free them quite from the said Vermin, nor would he demand it, till a twelve-month, and a day after: The agreement being made, he began to play on his Pipes, and all the Rats, and the Mice followed him to a great Lough hard by, where they all perish'd; so the Town was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected no more. At the end of the yeer, the Pied-Piper return'd for his reward, the Burgers put him off with slightings, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; offring him som small matter, which he refusing, and stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing som dayes in the Town, on Sunday morning at High Mass, when most peeple were at Church, he fell to play on his Pipes, and all the children up and down, follow'd him out of the Town, to a great Hill not far off, which rent in two, and opened, and let him and the children in, and so clos'd up again: This happen'd a matter of two hundred and fifty yeers since; and in that Town, they date their Bills and Bonds, and other Instruments in Law, to this day, from the yeer of the going out of their children: Besides, there is a great piller of stone at the foot of the said Hill, wheron this story is ingraven,</p>

That which sinks deepest into me, is the sense I have of the common calamities of this Nation; ther is a strange Spirit hath got in amongst us, which makes the Idaea of holines, the formality of good, and the very facultie of reason to be quite differing from what it was. I remember to have read a tale of the Ape in <hi>Paris,</hi> who having got a child out of the cradle, &amp; carried him up to the top of the tiles, and there sat with him upon the ridg; The parents behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this ruthfull spectacle, gave the Ape fair and smooth language, so he gently brought the child down again, and replac'd him in the cradle.

                        <p>The City of <hi>London</hi> sticks constantly to the Parlement, and the Common-Councell swayes much, insomuch, that I beleeve, if the Lord Chancelor <hi>Egerton</hi> were now living, he would not be so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant with them, as he was once to a new Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> whom

The counterbuffe that happen'd 'twixt <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, and <hi>Francis</hi> the first of <hi>France</hi> is very remarkeable, who being both met at <hi>Bolonia,</hi> the King seemd to give a light touch at the Popes pomp, saying, '<hi>twas not used to be so in former time.

Now, as Christian Religion hath the purest and most abstracted, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and highest spirituall notions, so it hath bin most subject to differences of opinions and distractions of conscience, the purer the wheat is the more subject 'tis to tares, and the most precious gems to flaws. The first bone that the Devill flung was into the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Churches, then twixt the Greek and the Roman, but it was rather for jurisdiction and power then for the fundamentalls of faith, and lately twixt <hi>Rome</hi> and the North-west Churches: Now the extent of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Church is larger far then that of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> (excluding <hi>America</hi>) which makes som accuse her as well of uncharitablenes as of arrogance that she should positively damne so many millions of Christian souls who have the same common simboll of faith with her, because they are not within the close of her fold.</p>

                     <p>But in <hi>Afric</hi> their number is incredible, for from <hi>cape Blanc</hi> the most westerly Point of <hi>Afric</hi> all southward to the Cape of good Hope, and thence turning by the back of <hi>Afric</hi> to the Cape of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zambric,</hi> all these coasts being about the one half of the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Afric</hi> is peepled by <hi>Idolaters,</hi> though in som places inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with <hi>Mahometans and Christians,</hi> as in the Kingdom of <hi>Congo</hi> and <hi>Angola:</hi> But if we survey the inland territories of <hi>Afric</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the river of <hi>Nile,</hi> and the west sea of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> even all that Countrey from about the north paralell of ten degrees, to the south paralell of six degrees, all is held by <hi>Idolaters,</hi> besides, the Kingdom of <hi>Borno,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Nubia</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> continue still in their old <hi>Paganisme,</hi> so that by this account above one half of that immence continent of <hi>Afric</hi> is peepled by <hi>Idolaters.</hi> But in <hi>Asia,</hi> which is far more spatious and more populous then <hi>Afric, Pagans, Idolaters, and Gentiles, Swarm</hi> in greater numbers, for from the River <hi>Pechora</hi> Eastward to the Ocean, and thence Southward to the Cape of <hi>Cincapura,</hi> and from that point returning Westward by the South coasts to the out-lets of the River <hi>Indus,</hi> all that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritine tract which makes a good deal more then half the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Asia</hi> is inhabited by <hi>Idolaters;</hi> so are the inland parts: Ther are two mighty mountaines that traverse all <hi>Asia, Taurus and Imaus,</hi> the first runs from West to East, the other from North to South, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

but tother side, they are all Idolaters: And as on the firm continent <hi>Paganisme</hi> thus reigns, so in many thousand Islands that lye squandred in the vast Ocean, on the East and South east of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> Idolatry orespreads all, except in some few Islands that are possess'd by <hi>Spaniards and Arabs.</hi>

                     <p>From the <hi>Greek</hi> Isles, Philosophy came to <hi>Italy,</hi> thence to this Western world among the <hi>Druydes,</hi> whereof those of this Isle were most celebrous, for wee read that the <hi>Gauls</hi> (now the <hi>French</hi>) came to <hi>Britanny</hi> in great numbers to be instructed by them. The <hi>Romans</hi> wer mighty great Zelots in their Idolatry, and their best Authors affirm, that they extended their Monarchy so far and neer, by a particular reverence they had of their Gods, (which the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> seems now to imitate) though those Gods of theirs wer made of men, and of good fellows at first, besides in the course of their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97056:194"/>
conquest, they adopted any strange Gods to the society of theirs, and brought them solemnly to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the reason as one saith was, that they believed the <hi>more Gods they had the safer they were, a few being not sufficient to conserve and protect so great an Empire:</hi> The <hi>Roman Gentiles</hi> had their Altars and Sacrifices, their Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamins, and vestall Nuns; And it seems the same genius reigns still in them, for in the Primitive Church, that which the Pagans misliked most in Christianity was, that it had not the face and form of a religion, in regard it had no Oblations, Altars &amp; Images, which may be a good reason why the Sacrifices of the Mass and other Ceremonies wer first instituted to allure the Gentiles to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But to return a little further to our former subject in the condition that man-kind stands now, if the Globe of the earth wer divided to thirty parts, tis thought that Idolaters (with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror I speak it) having as I said before, the one half of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fric,</hi> both for the inland Country and Maritim Coasts with four parts of five in <hi>America</hi> inhabit twenty parts of those Regions that are already found out upon earth, besides in the opinion of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingst and most inquisitive Mathematitions, ther is towards the <hi>sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> clime as much land yet undiscovered as may equal in dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the late new world, in regard, as they hold ther must be of necessity such a portion of earth to balance the Centre on all sides, and tis more than probable, that the Inhabitants there must be <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</hi> Of all kind of Idolaters those are the horridest, who adore the Devill whom they call <hi>Tantara,</hi> who appears often unto them specially in a <hi>Haraucane</hi> though he be not visible to others; In som places they worship both God and the Devill, the one, that he may do them good, the other, that they may do them no hurt; the first they call <hi>tantum,</hi> the other <hi>squantum.</hi> 'Twere presumption beyond that of <hi>Lucifers</hi> or <hi>Adam's</hi> for man to censure the justice of the Creator in this particular, why hee makes daily such innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vessells of dishonor; It is a wiser and safer course far to sit down in an humble admiration and cry out, on the profound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrutable judgments of God! his ways are past finding out, and so to acknowlege with the divine Philosopher, <hi>Quod oculus vesper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilionis ad solem, idem est omnis intellectus humanus ad Deum,</hi> what the Eye of a Bat is to the Sun, the same is all human understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God-wards.</p>
                     <p>Now to draw to a Conclusion, touching the respective largnes of <hi>Christianity</hi> and <hi>Mahometisme</hi> upon the earth, I find the first to exceed, taking the new world with the old, considering the spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Plantations of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> the Colonies the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97056:194"/>
                        <hi>English</hi> have there in <hi>Virginia, New-England</hi> and <hi>Charibbi</hi> Islands; with those of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Canada,</hi> and of the <hi>Hollander</hi> in <hi>East India:</hi> nor do I find that ther is any region purely <hi>Mahometan</hi> without intermixtures, as <hi>Christianity</hi> hath many: which makes me to be of a differing opinion to that Gentleman, who held that <hi>Christianity added little to the generall religion of man-kind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now touching the latitude of Christian faith, in reference to the differing Professors therof, as in my former I shewd that the Eastern Churches were more spacious than the <hi>Latin or Roman</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the two Indies) so they who have fallen off from her in the Western parts are not so far inferior to her in <hi>Europe</hi> as som would make one beleeve; which will appear if we cast them in counterbalance.</p>
                     <p>Among <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> ther is the Emperor, and in him the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the three Kings of <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Poland;</hi> all <hi>Italy,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Savoy, Bavaria,</hi> and <hi>Lorain,</hi> the three spirituall Electors with som few more; Touching them who have renounc'd all obedience to <hi>Rome,</hi> ther are the three Kings of <hi>great Britain, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> and <hi>Swethland,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxon, Holstein,</hi> and <hi>Wittemberg:</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and <hi>Baden,</hi> the Landgrave of <hi>Hesse;</hi> most of the <hi>Hansiatic</hi> Towns which are 88 in number<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> som wherof are equall to Republiques, the (almost) seven Provinces the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> hath.

                     <p>THer are two sayings which are father'd upon Secretary <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham</hi> and Secretary <hi>Cecil,</hi> a pair of the best weighd Statesmen this Island hathbred: one was used to say at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell Table, <hi>My Lords stay a little, and we shall make an end the sooner:</hi> the other would oft-times speak of himself, <hi>It shall never be said of me that I will d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ision: Among other Nations the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is observ'd to have much phlegme, and to be most dilatory in his proceedings; yet they who have pryed nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into the sequell and success of his actions, do find that this gravity, reservednes, and tergiversations of his, have turn'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his prejudice than advantage, take one time with another: The two last matrimoniall treaties we had with him, continued long, the first 'twixt <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh for <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> seven yeers; That 'twixt King <hi>Iames,</hi> and the now <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the fourth for <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> lasted eleven yeers (and seven and eleven's eighteen) the first took effect for Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> the latter miscarried for Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> may thank himself and his own slow pace for it, for had he mended his pace to perfect the work, I beleeve his Monarchy had not received so many ill favour'd shocks since. The late revolt of <hi>Portugall</hi> was foreseen, and might have bin prevented, if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had not bin too slow in his purpose to have sent the duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> out of the way up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on som employment as was projected.</p>
                     <p>Now will I reconcile the former savings of those two renowned Secretaries, with the gallant comparison of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor (and he was of a more temperat mould, than a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> being a <hi>Flemin</hi> born) he was us'd to say, that while any great busines of State was yet in consultation we should observe the motion of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> which is plumbeous long and heavy, but when it is once ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely resolved upon, then we should observe the motion of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> the nimblest of all the planets, <hi>ubi desinit Saturnus ibi in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I have sent you the Philosophy Books you writ to me for; any thing that you want of this kind for the advancement of your studies, do but write and I shall furnish you: When I was a student as you are, my practise was to borrow ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than buy som sort of Books, and to be always punctuall in restoring them upon the day assign'd, and in the intrim to swallow of them as much as made for my turn; this obligd me to read them thorow with more haste to keep my word, wheras I had not been so carefull to peruse them had they been my own Books, which I knew wer always ready at my dispose. I thank you heartily for your last Letter, in regard I found it smelt of the Lamp, I pray let your next do so, and the oyl and labor shall not bee lost which you expend upon</p>

                     <p>I presume you are constant in your desire to travell, if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it at all you cannot do it in a beter time, ther being little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, God wot, to breath English aire, as matters are carried: I shall be glad to steed you in any thing that may tend to your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; for to tell you truly, I take much contentment in this inchoation of frendship, to improve and perfect which, I shall lie centinell to apprehend all occasions.</p>

man to be their Master; Then looking upon them quietly grasing up and down, I fell to consider that the flesh which is daily dish'd upon our Tables is but concocted grass, which is recarnified in our stomacks, and transmuted to another flesh; I fell also to think what advantage those innocent Animalls had of man, who, as soon as nature casts them into the world, find their meat dress'd, the cloth laid, and the table cover'd, they find their drink brew'd and the buttery open, their beds made, and their cloaths ready; And though man hath the faculty of reason to make him a compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the want of these advantages, yet this reason brings with it a thousand perturbations of mind, and perplexities of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, griping cares, and anguishes of thought, which those harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les silly creatures were exempted from: Going on, I came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose my self upon the trunk of a tree, and I fell to consider fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what advantage that dull <hi>vegetable</hi> had of those feeding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimalls, as not to be so troublesom and beholding to nature, nor to be so subject to starving, to diseases, to the inclemency of the weather, and to be far longer liv'd: I then spyed a great stone, and sitting a while upon't, I fell to weigh in my thoughts that that stone was in a happier condition in som respects, than either those <hi>sensitive</hi> creatures or <hi>vegetables</hi> I saw before, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that that stone, which propagates by <hi>assimilation</hi> as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers say, needed neither grass nor hay, or any aliment for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration of nature, nor water to refresh its roots, or the heat of the Sun to attract the moisture upwards to encrease growth as the other did: As I directed my pace homeward, I spyed a Kite soa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>SInce among other passages of entertainment we had lately at the Italian ordinary (where your Lordship was pleas'd to honour us with your presence) their happen'd a large discourse of <hi>wines,</hi> and of other <hi>drinks</hi> that wer us'd by severall Nations of the earth, and that your Lordship desir'd me to deliver what I observ'd ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in abroad, I am bold now to confirm and amplifie in this letter what I then let drop <hi>extempore</hi> from me, having made a recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my self for that purpose.</p>
                     <p>It is without controversie that in the nonage of the world, men and beasts had but one buttery which was the fountaine and river, nor do we read of any vines or wines till two hundred yeers after the flood, but now I do not know or hear of any nation that hath <hi>water</hi> only for their drink except the <hi>Iaponois<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>The vine doth so abhor cold, that it cannot grow beyond the 49 degree to any purpose; Therfore God and nature hath furnish'd the Northwest Nations with other inventions of beverage. In this Island the old drink was <hi>Ale,</hi> noble <hi>Ale,</hi> than which, as I heard a great forren Doctor affirm, ther is no liquor that more encreaseth the radicall moisture, and preserves the naturall heat, which are the two pillers that support the life of man; but since <hi>Beer</hi> hath
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97056:218"/>
                        <hi>hopp'd</hi> in among us, <hi>Ale</hi> is thought to be much adulterated, and nothing so good as Sir <hi>Iohn Old Castle</hi> and <hi>Smug</hi> the Smith was us'd to drink: Besides Ale and Beer, the naturall drink of part of this Isle may be said to be <hi>Metheglin, Braggot, and Mead,</hi> which differ in strength according to the three degrees of comparison: The first of the three, which is strong in the superlatif, if taken immoderately, doth stupifie more than any other liquor, and keeps a <hi>humming</hi> in the brain, which made one say that he lov'd not <hi>Metheglin</hi> because he was us'd to speak too much of the <hi>house</hi> he came from, meaning the hive: <hi>Sider and Perry</hi> are also the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall drinks of part of this Isle; But I have read in som old Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of a famous drink the ancient Nation of the <hi>Picts,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved 'twixt <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Tweed</hi> and were utterly extinguished by the over-powring of the <hi>Scot,</hi> wer used to make of decoction of flowers, the receipt wherof they kept as a secret and a thing sacred to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, so it perish'd with them: These are all the common drinks of this Isle, and of <hi>Ireland</hi> also, where they are more given to milk and strong waters of all colours, the Prime is <hi>Vsquebagh</hi> which cannot be mado any where in that perfection, and wheras we drink it heer in <hi>aqua vitae</hi> measures, it goes down there by beer glassfulls, being more naturall to the nation.</p>
                     <p>In the seventeen Provinces hard by, and all low <hi>Gernmany, beer</hi> is the common naturall drink, and nothing else, so is it in <hi>Westfalia,</hi> and all the lower circuit of <hi>Saxony,</hi> in <hi>Denmark, Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Norway;</hi> The <hi>Prusse</hi> hath a beer as thick as hony, in the Duke of Saxes Country, ther is beer as yellow as gold made of wheat, and it inebriates as soon as Sack. In som parts of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> they use to spice their beer, which will keep many yeers, so that at som weddings ther will be a but of beer drunk out as old as the Bride. <hi>Poland</hi> also is a beer Country, but in <hi>Russia, Muscovie,</hi> and <hi>Tartary</hi> they use <hi>mead,</hi> which is the naturallest drink of the Country, being made of the decoction of water, and hony, this is that which the Ancients call'd <hi>Hydromel;</hi> Mares milk is a great drink with the Tartar, which may be a cause why they are bigger then ordinary, for the Physicians hold, <hi>that milk enlargeth the bones, Beer strengtheneth the nerves, and wine breeds bloud sooner than any other liquor.</hi> The <hi>Turke</hi> when he hath his tripe full of pelaw, or of Muton and Rice, will go to natures cellar, either to the next Well or River to drinke water, which is his naturall common drink, for <hi>Mahomet</hi> taught them, that ther was a devill in evry berry of the grape, and so made a strict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition to all his sect from drinking of wine as a thing prophane;

                     <p>But the reason that the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue found not such entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the orientall parts, was that the Greek had fore-stall'd her, which was of more esteem among them because of the learning that was couch'd in her, and that she was more usefull for negotiation and trafic, wherunto the Greeks wer more addicted than any pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: therfore though the <hi>Romans</hi> had an ambition to make those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Nations that wer under their yoak to <hi>speak</hi> as wel as to <hi>do</hi> what pleased them, and that all orders, edicts, letters, and the Lawes themselves civill as well as martiall, wer publish'd and executed in Latine, yet I believe this Latine was spoken no otherwise among those Nations than the Spanish or <hi>Castillian</hi> Tongue is now in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> in <hi>Sicily, Sardinia, Naples,</hi> the two Indies, and other Provinciall Countreys which are under that King: Nor did the pure Latine Tongue continue long at a stand of perfection in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Latium</hi> it self among all sorts of peeple, but she receiv'd chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and corruption, neither do I beleeve that she was born a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Language at first, but she receiv'd nutriment, and degrees of perfection with time, which matures, refines and finisheth all things: The verses of the <hi>Salii</hi> compos'd by <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> wer scarce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible by the Flamins and Judges themselves in the wane of the Roman Common-wealth, nor the Laws of the <hi>Decemviri:</hi> And if that Latine wherin were couch'd the capitulations of peace 'twixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> a little after the expulsion of the Kings, which are yet extant upon a pillar in <hi>Rome,</hi> wer compar'd to that which was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>Caesars</hi> reign 140. after, at which time the Latine Tongue was mounted to the Meridian of her perfection she would be found a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>The mother toungs of <hi>Europe</hi> are thirteen, though <hi>Scaliger</hi> would have but eleven; Ther is the <hi>Greek</hi> 1, the <hi>Latine</hi> 2, the <hi>Dutch</hi> 3, the <hi>Slavonian</hi> 4, the <hi>VVelsh</hi> or <hi>Cambrian</hi> 5, the <hi>Bascuence</hi> or <hi>Cantabrian</hi> 6, the <hi>Irish</hi> 7, the <hi>Albanian</hi> in the Mountaines of <hi>Epire</hi> 8, the <hi>Tartarian</hi> 9, the old <hi>Illirian</hi> 10, remaining yet in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnia,</hi> the <hi>Iazrgian</hi> 11, on the North of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the <hi>Cauchian</hi> 12, in East <hi>Frizeland,</hi> the <hi>Finnic</hi> 13, which I put last with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because they are the only heathens of <hi>Europe;</hi> all which were known to be in <hi>Europe</hi> in the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; Ther is a learned antiquary that makes the <hi>Arabic</hi> to be one of the mother toungs of <hi>Europe,</hi> because it was spoken in som of the mountains of South <hi>Spain,</hi> 'tis true 'twas spoken for divers hundred yeers all <hi>Spain</hi> over after the conquest of the Moors, but yet it could not be call'd a mother toung, but an adventitious toung in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that part of <hi>Europe.</hi>

besides secondary tongues and dialects which exceed the number of their mothers, what shall we think of the other three huge continents in point of differing languages? Your Lordship knowes that ther be divers meridians and clymes in the heavens whence influxes of differing qualities fall upon the inhabitants of the earth, and as they make men to differ in the idea's and concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mind, so in the motion of the tongue, in the tune and tones of the voice, they com to differ one from the other: Now, all languages at first were imperfect confus'd sounds, then came they to be syllables, then words, then speeches and senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which by practice, by tradition, and a kind of naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from Parents to children, grew to be fix'd. Now to attempt a survay of all the languages in the other three parts of the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble earth wer rather a madness than a presumption, it being a thing of impossibility, and not only above the capacity, but beyond the search of the activ'st, and knowingst man upon earth: Let it therfore suffice while I behold those Nations that read and write from right to left, from the Liver to the heart, I mean the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes,</hi> and <hi>Asians,</hi> that I take a short view of the <hi>Arabic</hi> in the one, and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Syriac</hi> in the other, for touching the <hi>Turkish</hi> language, 'tis but a dialect of the <hi>Tartarian</hi> though it have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a late mixture of the <hi>Armenian,</hi> the <hi>Persian,</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> tongues, but specially of the <hi>Arabic,</hi> which was the mother tongue of their Prophet, and is now the sole language of their <hi>Alchoran,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strictly inhibited, and held to be a prophaness to translate it to any other, which they say preserves them from the encroachment of Schismes.</p>
                     <p>Now the <hi>Arabic</hi> is a tongue of vast expansion, for besides the three <hi>Arabia's</hi> it is becom the vulgar speech of <hi>Syria, Mesoptoamia, Palestine</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> from whence she stretcheth her self to the streight of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> through all that vast tract of earth, which lieth 'twixt the Mountain <hi>Atlas</hi> and the Mediterranean Sea, which is now call'd <hi>Barbary,</hi> where Christianity and the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue with divers famous Bishops once flourished.

                     <p>Thus we see, that as all other sublunary things are subject to corruption and decay, as the poten'st Monarchies, the proudest Republiques, the opulentest Cities have their growth, declinings, and periods; As all other elementary bodies likewise by reason of the frailty of their principles, com by in sensible degrees to alter and perish, and cannot continue long at a stand of perfection; so the learnedst and more eloquent languages, are not free from this common fatality, but they are liable to those alterations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, to those fits of inconstancy, and other destructive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies which are unavoidably incident to all earthly things.</p>

                     <p>YOurs of the 7th current was brought me, wherby I find that you did put your self to the penance of perusing som <hi>Epistles,</hi> that go imprinted lately in my name; I am bound to you for your <hi>pains</hi> and patience (for you write, you read them all tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough) much more for your candid <hi>opinion</hi> of them, being right glad that they should give entertainment to such a choice and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Geetleman as your self: But wheras you seem to except against somthing in one <hi>Letter,</hi> that reflects upon Sir <hi>VValter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh's</hi> voyage to <hi>Guyana,</hi> because I tearm the gold Mine he went to discover, an <hi>ayrie and supposititious Mine,</hi> &amp; so infer that it toucheth his honour; Truly sir, I will deal clearly with you in that point, that I never harbour'd in my brain the least thought to expose to the world any thing that might prejudice, much less traduce in the least degree that could be, that rare and renowned Knight, whose fame shall contend in longaevity with this Island it self, yea with that great <hi>VVorld</hi> which he <hi>Historiseth</hi> so gallantly; I was a youth about the Town when he undertook that expedition, and I remember most men suspected that <hi>Mine</hi> then to be but an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary politic thing, but at his return, and missing of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, these <hi>suspitions</hi> turn'd in most to reall <hi>beliefs</hi> that 'twas no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And king <hi>Iames</hi> it that Declaration which he commanded to be printed and published afterwards touching the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this action (upon which my Letter is grounded, and which I have still by me) tearms it no less; And if we may not give faith to such publick regall instruments, what shall we credit? besides, ther goes another p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

breath open air, should relate nothing but what should be derived from good fountains; And truly sir, touching that Apologie of Sir <hi>Walter Rawleighs</hi> you write of, I never saw it, and I am very sorry I did not, for it had let in more light upon me of the cariage of that great action, and then you might have bin well assur'd that I would have don that noble Knight all the right that could be.</p>
                     <p>But sir, the severall arguments that you urge in your Letters are of that strength, I confess, that they are able to rectifie any indifferent man in this point, and induce him to believe that it was no Chymera, but a reall Mine; for you write of divers pieces of gold brought thence by Sir <hi>Walter</hi> himself, and Captain <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys,</hi> and of som Ingotts that wer found in the Governours Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set at St. <hi>Thoma,</hi> with divers crusibles, and other refining instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet, under favour, that might be, and the benefit not countervail the charge, for the richest Mines that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath upon the whole Continent of <hi>America,</hi> which are the Mines of <hi>Potos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> yeeld him but six in the hundred all expences de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed, You write how King <hi>Iames</hi> sent privately to sir <hi>VValter</hi> being yet in the Tower, to intreat and command him, that he would impart his whole designe unto him under his hand, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon the word of a King to keep it secret, which being don accordingly by Sir <hi>VValter Rawleigh,</hi> that very originall paper was found in the said Spanish Governours closet at St. <hi>Thoma;</hi> wherat, as you have just cause to wonder, and admire the active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Spanish Agents about our Court at that time, so I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no less at the miscariage of som of His late Majesties Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who notwithstanding that he had pass'd his royall word to the contrary, yet they did help Count <hi>Gondamar</hi> to that paper, so that the reproach lieth more upon the English than the Spanish Ministers in this particular: Wheras you allege that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous sicknes of Sir <hi>VVatler</hi> being arrived neer the place, and the death of (that rare sparke of courage) your brother upon the first landing, with other circumstances discourag'd Captain <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys</hi> from discovering the Mine, but to reserve it for another time, I am content to give as much credit to this as any man can; as also that Sir <hi>VValter,</hi> if the rest of the Fleet according to his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest motion had gon with him to revictuall in <hi>Virginia</hi> (a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try wher he had reason to be welcom unto, being of his own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery) he had a purpose to return to <hi>Guyana</hi> the Spring follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing to pursue his first designe: I am also very willing to believe that it cost Sir <hi>VValter Rawleigh</hi> much more to put himself in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page for that long intended voyage, than would have payed for
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97056:231"/>
his liberty, if he had gon about to purchase it for reward of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at home, though I am not ignorant that many of the co-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers made large contributions, and the fortunes of som of them suffer for it at this very day. But although <hi>Gondamar,</hi> as my Letter mentions, calls Sir <hi>Walter</hi> Pyrat, I, for my part am far from thinking so, because as you give an unanswerable reason, the plundering of St. <hi>Thoma,</hi> was an act done beyond the Equator, wher the Articles of Peace 'twixt the two Kings do not extend; yet, under favor, though he broke not the <hi>Peace,</hi> he was said to break his <hi>Patent</hi> by exceeding the bounds of his Commission, as the foresaid Declaration relates, for King <hi>Iames</hi> had made strong promises to Count <hi>Gondamar,</hi> that this Fleet should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no outrages upon the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> Subjects by Land, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they began first, and I beleeve that was the main cause of his death, though I think if they had proceeded that way against him in a legall course of triall, he might have defended himself well enough.</p>
                     <p>Wheras you alledg that if that action had succeeded, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards been well prosecuted, it might have brought <hi>Gondamar's</hi> great Catholic Master to have been begg'd for at the Church dores by Fryars, as he was once brought in the latter end of Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeths</hi> days; I believe it had much damnified him, and interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in the possession of his West Indies, but not brought him, under favor, to so low an ebb; I have observed that it is an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in your Popish Countreys for Princes to borrow from the Altar, when they are reduc'd to any straights, for they say, <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> could have been made use of to take off his head afterwards, considering that the Lord Chancellor <hi>Verulam,</hi> as you write, told him positively (as Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was acquainting him with that proffer of Sir <hi>William St. geons</hi> for a pecunia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to avoid superstition some peeple should bee brought to belch out such horrid prophanenes, as to call the Temples of God the Tabernacles of Sathan; The Lords Supper a Two-penny Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; to make the Communion Table a Manger, and the Font a Trough to water their Horses in; to term the white decent Robe of the Presbyter the Whores Smock; the Pipes through which nothing came but Anthems and holy Hymns, the Devills Bag-pipes; the Liturgy of the Church, though extracted most of it out of the Sacred Text, call'd by som another kind of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choran,</hi> by others raw Porredge, by som a peece forg'd in Hell; Who would have thought to have seen in <hi>England</hi> the Churches shut and the Shops open upon <hi>Christmas</hi> day? Could any soul have imagined that this Isle would have produc'd such Monsters, as to rejoyce at the <hi>Turks</hi> good successes against Christians, and wish hee were in the midst of <hi>Rome?</hi> Who would have dream't ten yeers since, when Arch-bishop <hi>Lawd</hi> did ride in state through <hi>London</hi> streets, accompanying my Lord of <hi>London</hi> to bee sworn Lord high Tresurer of <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Mitre</hi> should have now com to such a scorn, to such a Nationall kind of hatred, as to put the whole Island in a combustion; which makes mee call to memory a saying of the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, which Earl, having deadly feud with the Bishop of <hi>Cass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>I Thank you in a very high degree for that precious Table of Poems you pleas'd to send me: When I had well viewd them, I thought upon that famous <hi>Table of Proportion,</hi> which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>Aristaeus</hi> to have sent <hi>Eleazar</hi> to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> which was counted a stupendious piece of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Art, and the wonderment of those times: what the curiosity of that Table was, I have not read, but I believe it consisted in extern mechanicall artifice only: The beauty of your Table is of a far more noble extraction being a pure spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall work, so that it may be call'd the Table of your soul, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the opinion of that divine, though Pagan Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, the high wing'd <hi>Plato,</hi> who fancied that our souls at the first infusion wer as so many Tables, they were <hi>abrasae Tabulae,</hi> and that all our future knowledg was but a reminiscence; But under favor these rich and elaborate Poems which so loudly eccho out your worth and ingenuity deserve a far more lasting monument to preserve them from the injury of time than such a slender board, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be engraven in such durable dainty stuff that may be fit to hang up in the Temple of <hi>Apollo;</hi> your <hi>Eccho</hi> deserves to dwell in som marble or porphyry grot, cut about <hi>Parnassus</hi> Mount neer the source of <hi>Helicon,</hi> rather than upon such a slight suprfiecies.</p>

                     <p>I Had yours upon Maunday Thursday late, and the reason that I suspended my answer till now, was, that the season engaged me to sequester my thoughts from my wonted negotiations to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templat the great work of mans <hi>Redemption,</hi> so great, that wer it cast in counterballance with his <hi>creation,</hi> it would out-poyze it far, I summond all my intellectuals to meditat upon those passions, upon those pangs, upon that despicable and most dolorous death, upon that cross wheron my Saviour suffer'd, which was the first Christian altar that ever was, and I doubt that he will never have benefit of the <hi>sacrifice</hi> who hates the harmeles resemblance of the <hi>altar</hi> wheron it was offer'd; I applied my memory to fasten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on't, my understanding to comprehend it, my will to embrace it; from these three faculties, me thought I found by the mediation of the fancy som beames of love gently gliding down from the head to the heart, and inflaming all my affections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the human soul had far more <hi>powers</hi> than the Philosophers afford her, if she had as many faculties within the head as ther be hairs without, the speculation of this mystery would find work enough for them all; Truly the more I scrue up my spirits to reach it, the more I am swallowed in a gulf of admiration, and of a thousand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect notions, which makes me ever and anon to quarrell my soul that she cannot lay hold on her Saviour, much more my heart, that my purest affections cannot hug him as much as I would.</p>
                     <p>They have a custom beyond the Seas (and I could wish it wer the worst custom they had) that during the passion week divers of their greatest Princes, and Ladies will betake themselves to som covent or reclus'd house to wean themselves from all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encombrances, and convers only with heaven, with perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of som kind of penances all the week long; A worthy Gentleman that came lately from <hi>Italy,</hi> told me that the Count of <hi>Byren</hi> now Marshall of <hi>France,</hi> having bin long persecuted by Cardinall <hi>Richelieu,</hi> put himself so into a Monastery, and the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:97056:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>
next day news was brought him of the Cardinalls death, which I believe made him spend the rest of the week with the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in that way. <hi>France</hi> braggs that our Saviour had his face turnd towards her when he was upon the Cross, ther is more cause to think that it was towards this Island, in regard the rays of Christianity first reverberated upon her, her King being Christian 400 yeers before him of <hi>France,</hi> (as all Historians concur) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that he arrogates to himself the title of the first Son of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Let this serve for part of my Apologie: The day following, my Saviour being in the grave, I had no list to look much abroad, but continued my retirednes; ther was another reason also why, because I intended to take the holy Sacrament the Sunday ensuing, which is an act of the greatest consolation, and consequence that possibly a Christian can be capable of; it imports him so much that he is made or marr'd by it, it tends to his damnation, or salvation, to help him up to heaven, or tumble him down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to hell: Therfore it behoves a man to prepare and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect himself, to winnow his thoughts from the chaff and tares of the world beforehand; This then took up a good part of that day to provide my self a wedding garment, that I might be a fit guest at so precious a banquet, so precious, that manna and angels food are but cours viands in comparison of it.</p>
                     <p>I hope that this excuse will be of such validity that it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my pardon for not corresponding with you this last week. I am now as freely as formerly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <hi>species of living Creatures in the Orb of the Moon, which may hear som analogie with those of this Elementary world;</hi> Although it be not my purpose to maintain and absolutely assert this Problem, yet I will say this, that whosoever cryeth it down for a new <hi>neotericall opinion,</hi> as divers do, commit a grosser error than the opinion may be in its own nature: For 'tis almost as ancient as Philosophy her self, I am sure, 'tis as old as <hi>Orpheus,</hi> who sings of divers fair Cities and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles within the Circle of the Moon; Moreover the profoundest Clerks and most renowned Philosophers in all ages have affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it: Towards the <hi>first</hi> Age of learning among others <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> avouch'd it, the first of whom was pronounc'd the wisest of men by the Pagan Oracle, as our <hi>Solomen</hi> is by holy Writ. In the middle age of <hi>Learning Plutarch</hi> speaks of it, and in these mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times the most speculative and scientificall'st men, both in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> seem to adhere to it; subinnuating that not only the sphear of the Moon is peepled with <hi>Selenites</hi> or Lunary men, but that likewise evry Star in Heaven is a peculiar world of it self, which is Coloniz'd and replenish'd with <hi>Astrean</hi> Inhabitants, as the Earth, Sea and Air are with Elementary, The body of the Sun not excepted, who hath also his <hi>Solar</hi> Creatures, and <hi>they</hi> are accounted the most sublime, the most pure and perfectest of all: The <hi>Elementary</hi> Creatures are held the grossest of all, having more matter than form in them; The <hi>Solar</hi> have more form than matter, the <hi>Selenites</hi> with other Astraean Inhabitants are of a mix'd na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the nearer they approach the body of the Sun, the more pure and spirituall they are: Were it so, ther were som grounds for his speculation who thought that humane souls be they never so pious and pure ascend not immediatly after their dissolution from the corrupt Mass of flesh before the glorious presence of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to behold the <hi>Beatificall Vision,</hi> but first into the body of the <hi>Moon,</hi> or som other Star according to their degrees of goodnes, and actuat som Bodies there, of a purer composition; when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>find theie they ascend to som higher Star, and so to som higher than that, till at last by these degrees they be made capable to behold the lustre of that glorious Majesty in whose sight no impurity can stand; This is illustrated by a comparison, that if one after hee hath been kept close in a dark Dungeon a long time, should be taken out, and brought suddenly to look upon the Sun in the Miridian, it would endanger him to be struck stark blind; so, no humane soul suddenly fallying out of a dirty prison as the body is, would be possibly able to appear before the incomprehensible Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of God, or be susceptible of the brightnes of his all-glorious
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97056:260"/>
countenance, unless he be fitted therunto before hand by certain degrees, which might be don by passing from one star to another, who, we are taught differ one from the other in glory and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</p>
                     <p>Among our Modern Authors that would furbish this old opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of lunary creatures, and plant colonies in the orb of the Moon with the rest of the celestiall bodies, <hi>Gasper Galileo Galilei</hi> is one, who by artificiall prospectives hath brought us to a neerer commerce with Heaven, by drawing it sixteen times nearer the earth then it was before in ocular appearance by the advantage of the said optic Instrument.</p>
                     <p>Among other arguments which the Assertors of Astrean Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants do produce for proof of this high point, one is, that it is neither repugnant to <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> to think, that the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Fabricator of the Univers, who doth nothing in vain, nor suffers his handmaid Nature to do so, when he created the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratic and fixed stars, he did not make those huge immense bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, wherof most are bigger than the earth and sea though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated, to twinkle onely, and be an ornament to the roose of heaven, but he plac'd in the convex of every one of those vast capacious spheres som living creatures to glorifie his name, among whom ther is in evry one of them one supereminent like <hi>man</hi> upon <hi>Earth</hi> to be Lord paramount of all the rest; To this haply may allude the old opinion that ther is a peculiar <hi>Intelligence</hi> which guides and governs every orb in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>They that would thus colonize the stars with Inhabitants do place in the body of the Sun, as was said before the purest, the most immateriall and refined'st Intellectuall creatures, whence the Allmighty calls those he will have to be immediately about his person, and to be admitted to the Hierarchy of Angels; This is far dissonant from the opinion of the <hi>Turk,</hi> who holds that the Sun is a great burning globe design'd for the damned.</p>
                     <p>They who are transported with this high speculation that ther are Mansions and habitable conveniences for creatures to live within the bodies of the Celestiall Orbs, seem to tax <hi>Man</hi> of a high presumption, that he should think all things were created principally for <hi>Him,</hi> that the Sun and Stars are serviceable to him in chief, <hi>viz.</hi> to measure his daies, to distinguish his seasons, to direct him in his navigations, and powr wholsom influences upon him.</p>
                     <p>No doubt they were created to be partly usefull and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, but to imagine that they are solely and chiefly for <hi>him,</hi>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:97056:260"/>
is a thought that may be said to be above the pride of Lucifer: They may be beneficiall unto him in the generation and encrease of all Elementary creatures, and yet have peculiar Inhabitants of their own besides to concur with the rest of the world in the service of their Creator. 'Tis a fair prerogative for <hi>man</hi> to be Lord of all <hi>Torestirall, Aquatic,</hi> and airie creatures; that with his harping Iron he oan draw ashore the great Leviathan, that He can make the Camell and huge Dromedary to kneel unto him, and take up his burthen, That he can make the fierce Bull though ten times stronger than himself to endure his yoke, that he can fetch down the Eagle from his nest, with such priviledges, but let <hi>Him</hi> not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume too far in comparing himself with heavenly bodies, while he is no other thing than a worm crawling upon the surface of this Earth: Now the <hi>Earth</hi> is the basest creature which God hath made therfore 'tis call'd his <hi>footstool,</hi> and though som take it to be the <hi>Centre,</hi> yet it is the very <hi>sediment</hi> of the Elementary world, as they say the Moon is of the celestiall; tis the very sink of all corruption and frailty, which made <hi>Trismegist</hi> say that <hi>Terra, non mundus est nequitiae locus,</hi> The <hi>Earth,</hi> not the <hi>World</hi> is the seat of wickednes; And though, tis true, she be susceptible of light, yet the light terminats only on her superficies, being not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten any thing els, as the stars can do.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I proportioned my short discours upon this spacious problem to the size of an Epistle, I reserve the fulnes of my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in this point, till I receave yours touching <hi>Copernicus.</hi>

                     <p>VVHen I orelook'd the list of my choicest frends to insert your name, I paws'd a while, and thought it more proper to begin a new collaterall file, and put you in the front therof, where make account you are plac'd.

                     <p>I am glad you are so well return'd to your own family, and touching the Wheelwright you write of, who from a cart came to be a Captain, it made me think of the perpetuall rotations of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> which you know Antiquity seated upon a Wheel in restles though not violent volubility; And truly is was never more veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied than now, that those spokes which were formerly but collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and som of them quite underneath are now coming up apace to the top of the wheel, I hope ther will be no cause to apply to them the old verse I learnt at school,</p>
                     <q>Asperius nihil est humili cùm surgit in altum.</q>
                     <p>But ther is a transcendent over-ruling providence who cannot on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly check the rowlings of this petty wheel, and strike a naile into it that it shall not stir, but stay also when he pleaseth the motions of those vast spheres of Heaven wher the stars are alwaies stirring, as likewise the whirlings of the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> itself, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers say drawes all the world after it in a rapid revolution.

                     <p>SAint <hi>Paul</hi> cannot reascend to Heaven before he gives you also a salute, my Lord, your father having bin a star of the greatest magnitude in the Firmament of the Church. If you please to observe the manner of his late progress upon earth, which you may do by the guidance of this discours, you shall discover ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which are not vulgar, by a curious mixture of Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>h and State-affaires; you shall feel heerin the pulse of <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; how it beats at this time since the beginning of these late Wars 'twixt the Pope and the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> with the grounds, procedure, and success of the said War, together with the interest and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, the pretences and quarrells that most princes there have with <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I must confes, my Genius hath often prompted me that I was never cut out for a Translator, ther being a kind of servility therin; For it must needs be somwhat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>dious to one that hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny free-born thoughts within him, and genuin conceptions of his own (wherof I have som though shallow ones) to enchain himself to a verball servitude, and the sense of another. Moreover <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations</hi> are but as turn-coated things at best, specially among lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages that have advantages one of the other, as the <hi>Italian</hi> hath of the <hi>English,</hi> which may be said to differ one from the other as <hi>silk</hi> doth from <hi>cloth,</hi> the common wear of both Countries where they are spoken: And as <hi>cloth</hi> is the more substantiall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so the English toung by reason 'tis so knotted with consonants is the stronger, and the more sinewy of the two; But <hi>silk</hi> is more smo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>th and slik, &amp; so is the <hi>Italian</hi> toung compar'd to the <hi>English.</hi> Or I may say <hi>Translations</hi> are like the wrong side of a Turky carpet, which useth to be full of thrums and knots, and nothing so even as the right side: Or one may say (as I spake elsewhere) that Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are like Wines tane off the lees, and powr'd into other ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, that must needs lose somwhat of their first strength and brisknes, which in the powring, or passage rather evaporates into air.</p>
                     <p>Moreover touching Translations, it is to be observ'd that evry
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97056:267"/>
language hath certain <hi>Idiomes,</hi> proverbs and peculiar expression<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> of its own which are not rendible in any other but paraphrastical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, therfore he overacts the office of an Interpreter who doth es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave himself too strictly to words or phrases: I have heard of an exces among Limmers call'd too much to the life, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens when one aimes at similitudes morethan skill; So in versi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of languages one may be so over-punctuall in words, that he may mar the <hi>matter;</hi> The greatest fidelity that can be expected in a Translator is to keep still a foot and entire the tru genuin sense of the Author, with the main design he drives at; And this was the principall thing which was observ'd in this <hi>Version.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore let it not be thought strange that ther are som <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> words made free denizens of <hi>England</hi> in this discours, for by such meanes our language hath grown from time to time to be so copious, and still growes more rich, by adopting or <hi>naturalizing</hi> rather the choicest forren words of other Nations, as a Nosegay is nothing els but a tuft of flowers gatherd from divers beds.</p>
                     <p>Touching this present version of Italian into English, I may say 'tis a thing I did, when I had nothing to do; 'Twas to find somthing wherby to pass away the slow houres of this sad condition of captivity.</p>
                     <p>I pray be pleas'd to take this as a <hi>small</hi> argument of the great respects I ow you for the sundry rare and high vertues I have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in you, as also for the obligations I have to your noble La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whose hands I humbly kiss, wishing you both, as the season in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites me a good New yeer (for it begins but now in <hi>Law</hi>) as also a holy Lent, and a healthfull Spring.</p>

                        <hi>Christ, and the extended woman meaning the blessed Virgin, he must contemn the Sacraments, tread on the cross, spit at the host, &amp;c.</hi> Ther is a famous story of such a paction which Fryer <hi>Louis</hi> made som half a hundred yeers ago with the Devill in <hi>Marseilles,</hi> who appear'd to him in shape of a Goat and promis'd him the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any woman whom he fancied, with other pleasures for 41. yeers, but the Devill being too cunning for him put the figure of I before, and made it 14 yeers in the contract, (which is to be seen to this day with the Devills claw to it) at which time the Fryer was detected for Witchcraft and burnt, and all those children whom he had christned during that term of 14 yeers were rebaptized, and the Gentlewomen whom he had abus'd, put themselves into a Nunnery by themselves. Heerunto may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the great rich Widdow that was burn'd in <hi>Lions,</hi> because 'twas prov'd the Devill had lain with her; as also the history of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant <hi>Iaquette</hi> which stands upon record with the former, but if I should insert them heer at large it would make this letter swell too much.</p>
                     <p>But we need not cross the sea for examples of this kind, we have too too many (God wot) at home: King <hi>Iames</hi> a great while was loth to beleeve ther were Witches, but that which happend to my Lord <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Rutlands</hi> children convinc'd him, who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd by an old woman that was servant at Belvoir Castle, but being displeas'd, she contracted with the Devill who convers'd with her in form of a cat, whom she call'd <hi>Rutterken</hi> to make away those children, out of meer malignity, and thirst of revenge.</p>
                     <p>But since the beginning of these unnaturall Wars ther may be a clowd of witnesses produc'd for the proof of this black tenet, for within the compas of two yeers neer upon three hundred Witches were arraign'd, and the major part executed in <hi>Essex</hi> and <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> only: <hi>Scotland</hi> swarmes with them now more than ever, and persons of good quality executed daily.</p>
                     <p>Thus, sir, have I huddled together a few arguments touching this subject, because in my last communication with you, me thought I found you somwhat unsatisfied, and staggering in your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on touching the affirmative part of this thesis, the discussing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is far fitter for an elaborat large treatise than a loose letter.</p>
