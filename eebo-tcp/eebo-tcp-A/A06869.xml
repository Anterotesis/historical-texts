            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO RENDER YOV THE CAVSE or rather the causes (Righte Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull Maistresse) that first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me to take in hande the trauell of this diuine Historie of the holy Prophet king Dauid? This, in my iudgement, were not so necessarie, as it might proue tedious vnto you, and therefore I omit it, sauing that thus much I affirme, that aswell in the writing, as in the deliuering of it to the presse, I not meanely regarded that suche histories as Gods spirite hath left and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs in the sacred Scriptures, might be aduaunced before, and infinitely farre aboue those vayne, vnstable, and most vnfruitfull deuises whatsoeuer (so I terme them as they are to be compared with the histories of Gods holy Scriptures) whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer (I saye) proceeding from the penne of man, albeit neuer so throughly dipped in the deapth and soundest parte of that that mans reason might reach vnto: But muche more I intended to the vttermost of mine habilitie, to impayre hereby the credite aswell of all leude lying legends of vnsound Saintes, consecrated and canonized in the high Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> (the soueraigne seate of that purple Whore, whom the Lorde with the breath of his mouth shall shortly destroy to the great glory of the Lambe) as also of all filthy, fonde, and vnsauery songs, bookes, and fancies
<pb facs="tcp:21285:4"/>
farre vnfit and ill beseeming the eies of baptized Christians. And the better to bring this to passe, I haue not only endeuoured my selfe to be playne and familiar in all things, but also (for the more delectation to the Reader) haue continued the historie whole and entier of it selfe, without entermingling any matter or discourse that might seeme to digresse from the order of the Story. And now, hauing in this sort finished the same, and not finding in my selfe habilitie sufficient whereby to expresse the thankfulnes and entier affection of my heart, which I would should be manifested vnto you (to whom, as to the right worshipfull gentleman your husbande, the Lord hath graunted great measure of zeale to his trueth, and loue to his poore Saincts) what other shift shoulde I make, beeing now, as my yeeres and infirmities tell me, trudging to the end of my race, but to vse this as a pledge of these the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises which the Lord Iesus alone must make absolute at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming? This litle booke therefore, in this onely consideration and respect, I humbly dedicate and exhibite vnto you, beseching you (right worshipfull Gentlewoman) that in receyuing it at my hands, you will looke into that that my heart hath herein behigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, namely that it be taken as a poore supply of the thing which I owe, but (for want of habilitie) can not otherwise render. I leaue to be tedious vnto you, beseeching that Lorde that hath a continuall eye to his Churche, to preserue you and your right worshipful husband long time as bright burning lamps to the comfort of the same, and in the end of your earthly pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, to clothe you, as he hath already cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen and called you, to waite vpon the Lambe, and with him to liue and reigne eternally.</p>

            <l>WHen as the Lorde out of his sight</l>
            <l>had <hi>Saul</hi> the king reiect,</l>
            <l>Unto the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi>
            </l>
            <l>his worde he did direct,</l>
            <l>On this wise saying vnto him:</l>
            <l>How long wilt thou lament</l>
            <l>For him that I haue cast away,</l>
            <l>and of his reigne repent?</l>
            <l>Fill now thy horne with oyle and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome, for I haue great delite</l>
            <l>To send thée forth to <hi>Isai</hi> that auncient <hi>Bethlemite</hi>:</l>
            <l>Because I haue prouided me a king among his séede</l>
            <l>To rule and gouerne <hi>Israel</hi>: make hast and go with spéede.</l>
            <l>O Lord, quod he, how shall I go? for I do greatly feare</l>
            <l>That <hi>Saul</hi> shall take away my life, when he therof doth heare.</l>
            <l>The Lord made answere thus &amp; sayd, with thée an Heyfer take:</l>
            <l>And say thy onely comming is, an offring there to make.</l>
            <l>Giue warning vnto <hi>Isai,</hi> call him vnto the same,</l>
            <l>And whom thou shalt to me annoynt, him will I to thee name.</l>
            <l>So then the Prophet tooke his way, &amp; came to <hi>Bethlem</hi> towne,</l>
            <l>The Elders feared much to sée his sodayne comming downe:</l>
            <l>Demaunding if he came in peace, or what was his intent?</l>
            <l>An offring héere to make (quod he) the Lorde me hither sent.</l>
            <l>Do therfore sanctifie your selues, and come with one accord,</l>
            <l>That we together may go forth, and offer to the Lord.</l>
            <l>He sanctifide both <hi>Isai,</hi> and eke his sonnes also,</l>
            <l>Exhorting them (as he was did) with all the rest to go.</l>
            <l>Now, as the people stood before the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He cast his eye on <hi>Eliab,</hi> whose stature did excell:</l>
            <l>Wherefore he gan within him selfe to thinke, and thus to say,</l>
            <l>The Lords annoynted certenly is present here this day.</l>
            <l>Then spake the Lord, let not thy minde nor eye be so abusde</l>
            <l>With fauour nor with comelynes, for I haue him refusde.</l>
            <l>God doth not sée as mortall man, nor looke on outward showes,</l>
            <l>But doth behold the heart within, &amp; vertue where she growes.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:21285:5"/>
               <hi>Eliab</hi> in his fathers sight when he repulse had take,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Abinadab</hi> was brought to proue if he should be forsake:</l>
            <l>But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet had him séene, he made this answer plaine,</l>
            <l>How that the Lorde had neither cald nor chosen him to raigne.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Samma</hi> was set foorth in place to waite the prophets will,</l>
            <l>And as his brethren sped before, his lucke was euen as ill.</l>
            <l>Thus <hi>Isai</hi> seuen of his sonnes he brought foorth one by one,</l>
            <l>Wherof the Prophet gaue to witte, the Lorde had chosen none.</l>
            <l>Hast thou no mo, quod <hi>Samuel,</hi> of sonnes then héere be tolde?</l>
            <l>I haue (quod he) a litle one remayning with my folde.</l>
            <l>Let him be fet, now out of hande send of thy seruaunts some,</l>
            <l>For we will stay and not sit downe till he be hither come.</l>
            <l>Then was he fet out of the field, and from the shepefold brought</l>
            <l>Unto the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> as God the thing had wrought.</l>
            <l>This yong mans fauour did excell, in whom such beautie was,</l>
            <l>That with a speciall comely grace all other he did passe.</l>
            <l>Now sayd the Lord to <hi>Samuel,</hi> arise, do him annoynt,</l>
            <l>For this is he whom I do choose, and vnto thée appoynt.</l>
            <l>The Prophet tooke his horne of oyle, and with aduisement good,</l>
            <l>He shed it out on <hi>Dauids</hi> head before them as they stood,</l>
            <l>And so foorthwith returned home to <hi>Rama</hi> where he lay:</l>
            <l>And <hi>Dauid</hi> to his folde agayne made spe spéede and went away.</l>
            <l>From that day foorth the spirit of god from <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Dauid</hi> went,</l>
            <l>And vnto <hi>Saul</hi> a cruell sprite in stead thereof was sent,</l>
            <l>Which vexed him full often times, and did him so molest,</l>
            <l>That for the time of all his wittes he was quite dispossest:</l>
            <l>Which gréeued sore his men to sée, wherefore they gan to say,</l>
            <l>Behold how this most wicked wight doth hau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thée day by day:</l>
            <l>Let there be sought a cunning man, of good and perfect skill,</l>
            <l>On harpe or other instrument, some comfort bring it will.</l>
            <l>Prouide me then of such a one, go search both <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <l>Where that the best is to be had, and bring him to me here.</l>
            <l>Then one did say that <hi>Isai</hi> had a sonne that did excell</l>
            <l>In musike, and vpon the harpe he played passing well:</l>
            <l>A strong and valiaunt man of warre, well made of bone &amp; lim,</l>
            <l>Excéeding wise in his affayres, and hath the Lorde with him.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:21285:5"/>Then sent the king, and made request that <hi>Isai</hi> would him send</l>
            <l>His yongest sonne, that on his shéepe and shepefold did attend.</l>
            <l>Who at the kings commaundement prepared therewithall</l>
            <l>A simple present with his sonne, and sent him vnto <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>So <hi>Dauid</hi> serued now the king, and in the Court remaynd,</l>
            <l>Where he was well accept of <hi>Saul,</hi> and gently entertaynd.</l>
            <l>His harnesse bearer he became. The king sent once agayne</l>
            <l>To <hi>Isai,</hi> that <hi>Dauid</hi> should with him a while remayne.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Dauid</hi> great atendance gaue vpon his master <hi>Saul,</hi>
            </l>

            <l>Gan to declare what he of late had done by him, and sayde:</l>
            <l>Thy seruant kept his fathers shéepe that they should not astray,</l>
            <l>Among the which a Lion came to féede vpon his pray,</l>

            <l>So that I rid him of his life for all his ramping pawes.</l>
            <l>A Beare likewise with gréedy paunch came to deuour his pray,</l>
            <l>Whom I by strength did onely kill before I went away.</l>
            <l>And as thy seruant now hath done to these two beasts in déede,</l>
            <l>I doubt not but this <hi>Philistine</hi> shall haue no better spéede.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:21285:7"/>I mind (God willing) to remoue the infamy and shame,</l>

            <l>So from this bosting <hi>Philistine</hi> he will I do not feare.</l>
            <l>The king well pleased with his talke, gaue leaue &amp; bad him go,</l>

            <l>His sword, his head peece, and his shield, and euery other thing.</l>
            <l>Then Dauid did assay himselfe how well that he could do,</l>
            <l>For he had neuer proued them ne wonted him thereto.</l>
            <l>Wherfore he turned to <hi>Saul</hi> and sayd, I can not go with these:</l>
            <l>So out of all he stripped him to haue his armes at ease.</l>
            <l>With staffe in hand he gat him forth vnto a litle brooke,</l>
            <l>Out of the which fiue pibble stones into his bagge he tooke,</l>
            <l>And so from thence he made his way apace vnto the man,</l>
            <l>No other weapon but a sting he had to fight with than.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Philistine</hi> then drue him neare to view him that was sent,</l>
            <l>A page before him bare his shield as he to <hi>Dauid</hi> went.</l>
            <l>Now when he saw so yong a man so nakedly arayed,</l>
            <l>Disdaynefully on him he cast his eye, and to him sayd:</l>
            <l>Am I a dogge that with a staffe thou commest me to beate?</l>
            <l>So cursing him by all his goddes he gan to fume and freate:</l>

            <l>How that there is a mighty Lord and God in <hi>Israel</hi>:</l>
            <l>And eke the whole assembly here shall perfect notice haue,</l>

            <l>He will this day confound you all, and put you in our hands.</l>
            <l>With that he stepped forth and came with weapon in his fist,</l>
            <l>The other gan to buckle him his malice to resist:</l>
            <l>A stone he had already set and folded in his sling,</l>

            <l>And sanke so déepe into his brayne that downe he fell as dead.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Dauid</hi> ran the groueling corps there lying to bestride,</l>
            <l>And from the body with his sword his head he did deuide.</l>
            <l>A sight no doubt that pleased much the <hi>Israelites</hi> that day,</l>
            <l>But so dismayed the <hi>Philistines</hi> that they did runne away.</l>
            <l>Then all the hoast of <hi>Israel</hi> they shouted at that sight,</l>
            <l>Pursuing them with bloudy swords, &amp; slue them in the flight:</l>

            <l>The king also for this his act did cause him to remayne,</l>

            <l>The king beheld him earnestly, and to him selfe did say,</l>
            <l>I mind this iauelin here of mine shall rid him cleane away.</l>
            <l>So in his rage and madding moode at <hi>Dauid</hi> forthwithall</l>

            <l>Thou diddest thy sinne most secretly to hide the same from me,</l>

            <l>Here <hi>Dauid</hi> with repentant hart his wickednes confest,</l>

            <l>Then <hi>Nathan</hi> béeing at his hande, said to him by and by,</l>

            <l>Whose paine and griefe in eury place increased more and more.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:21285:22"/>Then <hi>Dauid</hi> fasting for the child besought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord with teares,</l>
            <l>To giue it health and life withall to runne his race of yeares.</l>
            <l>Great mourning made he for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childe, &amp; none could him intreate</l>
            <l>To rise from ground, but there he lay absteining fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his meate.</l>
            <l>The seuenth day came, &amp; then the child did end his fatal thread,</l>
            <l>But none durst signifie so much or tell that he was dead.</l>
            <l>For al the while he was aliue he would not heare them speake,</l>
            <l>And now to tel him of his death would cause his hart to breake.</l>
            <l>But <hi>Dauid</hi> through the whispering he saw among his men,</l>
            <l>Perceiued well the child was dead, and asked of them then,</l>
            <l>If that the child did liue or no? who told him how it was,</l>
            <l>How God had wrought his will in him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> life to death to pas.</l>
            <l>Then from the earth he lift him vp and washed all away,</l>
            <l>Annoynting him and putting on apparell fresh and gay,</l>
            <l>And gat him first vnto the house of God to giue him prayse,</l>
            <l>And béeing turned home to eate his seruauntes to him sayes.</l>
            <l>We maruell why thou didst lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thy child while it was here,</l>
            <l>And now that he is gone from hence to be of so good chere?</l>
            <l>So long (quod he) as it had life I did both fast and wéepe,</l>
            <l>For this I thought, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God alwaies doth mercy with him kéepe.</l>
            <l>And who could tell if that he would his mercy to him show,</l>
            <l>And saue the child from cruell death if that his will were so?</l>
            <l>But now he is departed hence it booteth not to fast,</l>
            <l>Nor yet to wéepe, for nothing here on earth is made to last.</l>
            <l>I can not bring his life agayne, but rather I shall go</l>
            <l>To him then he shall come to me, no doubt the truth is so.</l>
