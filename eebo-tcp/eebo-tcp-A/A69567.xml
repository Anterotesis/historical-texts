            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>SO long as I kept my private Station (in which I have ſpent a great part of my Life:) I thank God I can ſay, That though my Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the World have been conſiderable, I have had my Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſo, as not to meet with, or deſerve (as I reaſonably hope) any Reproach from man.</p>
            <p>But no ſooner was I (contrary to my Inclinations and Humour) called forth by my Fellow-Citizens, to a Publick Employment, than the Envy and Malice of ill-minded Men was awakned, ſo, as that (to uſe the Prophets words) <hi>They bent their Tongues like their Bow, for lies againſt me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I found in a great meaſure upon my Election to the Place I now bear in this City; but when I was Nominated at the late Election, for one of the Burgeſſes for <hi>Southwark,</hi> This Malevolent Spirit (being grown out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious) muſtered up all its Force, and poured forthwith upon me whole Volleys of as Spiteful Calumnies as Wit, ſharpened by the keeneſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, could invent.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all which, I conſidered, That this was not my Caſe alone, but a common Accident attending Perſons ſtanding in Competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Places of ſo great Honour and Truſt; and eſpecially, where the Election is to be determined by the Suffrages of a great Body of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, divided by their ſeveral Parties and Intereſts; amongſt whom will be ſtill found ſome Ill Men, who preferring their Private Intereſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Publick Service, will not baulk the fouleſt Practices, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of their own Ends; and therefore I was at the firſt Reſolved to ſit down quietly under the Satisfaction and Aſſurance of mine own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, rather than to foul my Fingers by Raking into that filthy Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil of Reproaches caſt up againſt me, without the leaſt Colour of Truth or Reaſon.</p>
            <p>But being told by divers of my Fellow-Citizens that I ought to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98455:3"/>
as well to Vindicate the Honour of the Place I now bear amongſt them, as to Juſtifie their Choice of me to that Office: And alſo, that thoſe of the Neighbouring <hi>Burrough,</hi> may not be thought to have been miſtaken, and deceived in the Perſon whom (ſince that time) they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to a place of ſo great Truſt: I thought fit to do them and my ſelf ſo much Right, as to Publiſh that which here follows, for the detecting of the Malitious Falſhood of thoſe impudent Slanders, which have been ſet on Foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> on purpoſe to diſable me from holding any place of ſo great Truſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Then it was Objected, that I am a</hi> Papiſt <hi>and a</hi> Jeſuit <hi>and</hi> (to give that lye the better Credit,) <hi>that upon ſome variance happening between me and Dr.</hi> Oates, <hi>he did declare that he knew me beyond the Seas to be ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This indeed would have been a ſufficient barr, to my admiſſion to any place of Publick Truſt, and much more to my Sitting in the Parliament, who have ſhewed ſo great a Zeal to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and would have forfeited my Head alſo, had the ſame been true. But (not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here the Teſts that I have lately taken to the contrary,) as thoſe that have known my conſtant Converſation, or what I have Writ and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, will not believe that I have any kindneſs for that Religion, ſo the Doctor is ready to declare to any one that deſires information in that point, that he was never the Author of any ſuch Report; nor could he know me beyond Sea, under any Character whatſoever; for I do affirm, That I was never out of <hi>England</hi> ſince One thouſand ſix hundred ſeventy two, and I doubt not but the <hi>Doctor</hi> will ſatisfie any, that ſhall ask the queſtion, that he never went beyond the Seas till the Year One thouſand ſix hundred ſeventy ſeven. Nevertheleſs, the <hi>Doctor</hi> not being in Town, to contradict this Story at the time of the Poll in <hi>Southwark,</hi> it was well enough Deſigned to ſerve that turn.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>It was ſaid, that I was a Souldier in the Parliament Army in the time of the late Wars, and was moſt Cruel and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmerciful in the exerciſe of Arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, as it ſeems inconſiſtent with the former Character, ſo hath it in it ſelf as little of Truth; but among a divided Multitude, in a jealous Age, when the generality of Men are more prone to believe any thing of ill that they hear, than to be at the trouble to examine the Truth of what is ſaid, it matters not whether Reports be true or probable, ſo as they be delivered with ſufficient Confidence, and the more variety there is in thoſe Stories (however inconſiſtant they may be) the better are they fitted to the various and different Humours and Intereſts of Man-kind: And the bold and induſtrious Calumniator by this Method of Proceeding, doth often prevail ſo far upon ſome of all Parties, as to bring the perſon he hath a mind to oppoſe, under their diſlike; And although (the matter of this Election remaining under queſtion,) I ſhall not ſay, that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject had its full effect in my Caſe; yet to demonſtrate, that the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Objection was a meer Fiction; deſigned onely to ſerve this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and could not be juſtly reflected on me: I do affirm, and ſeveral <hi>Hambrough</hi> Merchants now living may remember, and the Regiſtries of their Courts will plainly ſhew, That I went to <hi>Hambrough</hi> in the Year One thouſand ſix hundred thirty ſeven, and lived there in continual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, until <hi>December,</hi> One thouſand ſix hundred forty nine; ſo as I could have no hand in the War, or change of Government which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98455:3"/>
in <hi>England</hi> within that time: And though after my return into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I did with others ſubmit to the Government I found there, yet did I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Imbrace any other then Civil Offices; in which, I hope I may ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arrogancie, I demeaned my ſelf with that Integrity, Indifferencie, and Moderation, that I may juſtly challenge the greateſt of my Enemies, to inſtance in, or to name any one Act of Severity, Injuſtice, or Partiality, that I ever ſhewed towards any Party or Perſon whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That being at</hi> Hambrough <hi>at ſuch time as the late Kings Death was reſolved of in</hi> England, <hi>I did there ſay, That rather than he ſhould want an Executioner, I would come thence to perform the Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although I do reſent this moſt odious, and malicious Slander, with the higheſt Indignation imaginable, yet having brought my Action at Law, for Vindication of my ſelf in this Point, I ſhall not in this place, diſcourſe any thing of that Subject, leſt I ſhould ſeem to anticipate Publick Juſtice, or in any ſort gratifie my Adverſaries, by letting them know, what I have to give in Evidence, to prove the wilful Malice of thoſe that caſt this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon me; or what I have to offer in aggravation of this Scandal: Nevertheleſs, I ſhall take that liberty here, to ſay I was born a Gentleman, and have had my Education accordingly, and am of too great a Spirit to ſtoop to an Office of ſo baſe a nature to ſerve the greateſt Prince or State in the World.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> only one of the late Kings Judges, but one of thoſe two perſons in Vizards, that Aſſiſted on the Scaffold at his Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I may call a home thruſt, a blow levelled, not at my Honour and Reputation only, but (ſince the Perſons ſo Characterized are Excepted out of the Act of General Pardon and Oblivion,) at my Life and Fortune alſo, and ought more deſervedly to be Vindicated by ſome ſolemn courſe of Law, then the forementioned Scandal: but the Promoters of this loud Cry, being loſt in a Croud of People, I cannot give my ſelf, or others, that Publick ſatisfaction that the Merits of the Cauſe requires, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am neceſſitated to give my ſelf and the World, the beſt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this Point that I can.</p>
            <p>And ſince Malice is ſo bold and daring, I do bleſs that good Providence of God, that ſet me in ſuch Circumſtances at that time, when ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is Charged to be done; that although I am of the Negative part, I am able to convince the Author of that Report, to the ſatisfaction of all Mankind, of a moſt foul and malicious Slander; and it is ſhortly thus, Except I could be at <hi>Hambrough</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> at one and the ſame time, (which all will agree is wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible) the odious Matter Charged upon me in this <hi>Article</hi> cannot be true; and to prove that I was at <hi>Hambrough</hi> at the ſame time that the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Charged in this <hi>Article</hi> were Tranſacted at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> I vouch the ſame Evidence, which I have Cited in my Defence upon the Second <hi>Article.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Malice of this Deſign againſt my Honour, will plainly appear by what is already ſaid, ſo that theſe ſeveral Slanders were broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſent abroad on ſet purpoſe to way-lay me in my Election for one of the Burgeſſes for <hi>Southwark</hi> will yet further appear by that Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Libel that goes abroad under the Name of <hi>How and Rich,</hi> wherein the Author (pretending) to give an impartial Account of that Election, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had given a worthy Character of the reſt of the Competitors ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up all the forementioned Reports which are ſounded forth at large
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98455:4"/>
againſt me in a few ſofter words, is pleaſed by an Elegant Irony to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterize me as <hi>a Perſon ſufficiently Eminent for the Figure I made in the late Revolutions.</hi> And that this Character may find the better Credit with the World, and that I may be thought ſtill a Man of the ſame Spirit, the <hi>Libellers</hi> adds, That at the Election, <hi>I threatned to pull one of the Kings Water-mens Coats over his Ears; and that he thereupon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to me, Aye Sir, ſo perhaps you would my Maſters too, if it were in your Power.</hi> All which is moſt notoriouſly falſe, and without any colour or ground of Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The next exception they take to my Nomination to ſerve as a Burgeſs in the preſent Parliament is, <hi>That being one of the preſent Sheriffs for the Renowned City of</hi> London, <hi>I live in a Garret,</hi> and <hi>keep no Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were this admitted to be wholly true, yet will it not be allowed (as I conceive,) for a good exception in the Caſe of a Burgeſs to ſerve in Parliament, if I be otherwiſe qualified for ſo great a Truſt; it being a <hi>Maxime,</hi> That thoſe that are moſt ſaving of their own Eſtates, will be moſt careful of the Peoples: But ſince it doth caſt ſome Reflection on me in the Office I now bear, I confeſs it will require a further Anſwer.</p>
            <p>I ſay then, that (though this be not altogether true, yet) having leſs of Malice then the former, I can the better bear it.</p>
            <p>In the former matters Charged, my Adverſaries run upon me as if they deſigned nothing leſs then to tear me in pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>; by this, they ſeem de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous only to pull me down, and degrade me: by thoſe they gave me the Character of a very bad Subject; by this, they would have me thought no good Citizen.</p>
            <p>And as I have diſclaimed thoſe, with that juſt abhorrencie, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Caſe required; ſo I doubt not, but upon a due Conſideration of ſo much of the aforeſaid Exception as ſhall be found true, as alſo, of that which follows, they will admit of ſo fair an Apology, as will not leave me under the guilt of any miſdemeanour.</p>
            <p>But before I enter upon the Examination and Anſwer of Particulars, I ſhall here enter my Proteſt, That I have a true and real Veneration and Eſteem for that Renowned City, and have been ready to expreſs the ſame upon all occaſions, both at home and abroad; even before I had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be Called to the Office I now bear amongſt them.</p>
            <p>That I am always ready to pay that due obſervance and reſpect to the Government thereof that the Laws ordained for that purpoſe do require. That though for many years laſt paſt I have not had any private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Concern by way of Trade, not expect hereafter any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or advantage thereby, yet I have as hearty good wiſhes for the Trade, Welfare, and Proſperity of the ſaid City, as any Citizen whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And as I have been always ready and willing in my place and ſtation to promote thoſe good ends, ſo I brought the ſame reſolutions with me into that Office which I now bear, and ſhall endeavour to diſcharge with all integrity, governing my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf therein (ſo far as I am able) by the Laws of the City, and of the Land, (to both which, I acknowledge my ſelf to be a Servant) as my beſt Warrant, as well as ſafeſt Guides. And if in any thing I ſhall chance to fail, or fall ſhort of this, it ſhall not be through any willful miſcarriage or neglect, but from miſtake, which may eaſily happen to one of my Education in the manage of an Office of that importance.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:98455:4"/>
And now to return to that which is objected to my diſparagement, it is ſaid, <hi>That I live in a Garret, and keep no Houſe:</hi> and this they aggravate by ſuggeſting that for this reaſon I have been denyed ſeveral Priviledges granted to other Sheriffs, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done the City that honour, in this reſpect, as others in my place have done.</p>
            <p>Ill will, as it never ſpeaks well, ſo it ſeldom ſpeaks true; as it makes the worſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all Actions, ſo it commonly miſ-reports all Perſons againſt whom it hath any pique or prejudice; this ſeems to be my Caſe, and how I come to fall under theſe Circumſtances will beſt appear by that which follows.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, being a ſingle Perſon (as I have been for many years) and having neither the Concerns of a Family nor of Trade lying upon me, that I might have a ſetled and known Being for ſuch time of the Year as I commonly ſpend in Town, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the trouble and inconveniency which commonly attends the ſhifting of Lodgings: I took the Houſe I now live in, (not the Garrets but) all ſave the Garrets, Cellars, and one ſmall Room upon the firſt Floor, with accommodations ſufficient for a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of better Quality than my ſelf; and this I have kept for Ten years laſt paſt, as my Landlord and many other perſons, if need be, will teſtifie.</p>
            <p>Being Choſen into this Office (not having then any knowledge of thoſe Sumptua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Laws which our wiſe and prudent Anceſtors had enacted for the limiting and bounding the Extravagancies of Entertainments as well as other exorbitances) ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to that grand Impoſer, Cuſtome, I kept thoſe Feaſts which the Sheriffs have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made in the beginning of their year (which I find were two Feaſts (of great Charge) more than thoſe Laws will Warrant) and I have not heard, that any one man hath complained, that I was over ſparing in my Proviſions and Expences upon thoſe occaſions.</p>
            <p>And being miſguided by the ſame Error (having agreed for a Houſe for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) I reſolved (as ſome others in my Office had done before me) to ſettle my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſo as to begin Houſe-keeping at Chriſtmas, which was as ſoon as I could well ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle my own private Affairs, and under-Officers; ſo as the weighty concern of my Office might not ſuffer, and that I might be at leiſure to give my ſelf to the daily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon the honourable Imployment of an Hoſt.</p>
            <p>But it fell out (moſt unluckily for this purpoſe) that the Alderman of the Ward wherein I live, dying, and that Ward (as big as five or ſix of ſome other Wards,) having (it ſeems) a better opinion of me, then thoſe that have made this out-cry againſt me, thought fit by general Conſent to chooſe me for one of the two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were to be offered to the Court of Aldermen as Candidates for that Office; and the competition for the ſecond place being between Sir <hi>Richard How,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pilkinton,</hi> and the latter carrying it upon the Poll, and we two being accordingly preſented to the Court of Aldermen, they thought fit, (contrary to their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and cuſtoms in that Caſe) to wave me in the choice, and to take Mr. <hi>Pilkinton</hi> (a then Commoner) to ſupply that place amongſt them, and this I take to be principally meant by the Priviledges which the Exception chargeth to be forfeited by my not keeping Houſe.</p>
            <p>This accident ſo falling out, and the good and wholſome Laws before mentioned coming to my Knowledge, (and I think no Laws are more properly called wholeſome, than thoſe that prohibit the exceſs of Feaſting) theſe two Accidents (I ſay) gave no ſmall check to my complacent humour, and ſoon induced me to change my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer purpoſe and intention of Houſe-keeping.</p>
            <p>Since thoſe Gentlemen ſhewed ſo great a diſlike of my Company, beſides other ſlightings and diſreſpects I found from them, which I had not known offered to any before in my place, and eſpecially, of my Age; I thought my ſelf in no ſort ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to carreſs them by the uſual voluntary Treats and Entertainments; nor ſo far to forſake my wonted privacy, as to incumber my ſelf with more magnificent Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations for ſo ſhort a time as I was to abide in Office amongſt them, reſolving ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs to maintain ſuch an Equipage as ſhould be ſuitable to my Office, and to pay ſuch ſervices to the City as their Laws and the duty of my place requires.</p>
            <p>I would not be thought in what I have ſaid to deſign in the leaſt to detract from the worth of that Gentleman the Bench of Aldermen thought fit to prefer before me in that Choice, or to ſhew any regret I have for miſſing of that preferment: I acknowledge the Gentleman they have Choſen to that place, to be a very worthy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98455:5"/>
Citizen, and well deſerving of that Honour, as well as of being one of their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives in Parliament.</p>
            <p>But being to vindicate my ſelf againſt the Exceptions taken to me upon this account, I think I may, upon this occaſion (without prejudice to that worthy Gentleman or my ſelf) borrow a diſtinction from the Papiſts (though I am none of their belief) which I conceive with greater reaſon may be applicable to my Caſe, then to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they commonly uſe it. They ſay, <hi>There is a merit of Congruity, as well as of Condignity;</hi> and if any ſuch diſtinction can be made, I think I may ſay, (without any ſhew of Arrogancy) that though the Perſon preferred to that place, may be of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Perſonal and Inherent Worth then I can challenge to my ſelf, yet the advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Circumſtances by which I came recommended to the Court of Aldermen being duly conſidered, I might well expect in Congruity with thoſe common Rules of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by which that Court had wont to Govern themſelves in that Affair, to have been preferred in the Choice. And if thoſe that preſented me miſſed of their aim in that point, I think thoſe of the Neighbouring Burrough had as little reaſon to reflect it upon me, to my diſhonour, as that Court had to give them the occaſion to do it.</p>
            <p>But when this is ſaid, leaſt by arguing the Caſe ſo Nicely, it ſhould be thought that I am more concerned for the loſs of the place, then for thoſe Reflections that were caſt upon me upon that occaſion; or that I ſend this Paper a begging for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment: I ſhall here moſt freely declare, That as I had not the leaſt Ambition for that Office, ſo I lay as little weight upon thoſe Arguments I have uſed to juſtifie my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to it. I think in themſelves they have but little force, though I eſteem them very cogent and proper to be turned upon thoſe men with whom I have to do in this matter.</p>
            <p>As I reſt ſatisfied, that I had the Concurrent Votes of ſo many worthy Citizens for that place, and do think my Reputation well ſecured thereby, ſo I am very well contented, that I have miſſed the preferment; and ſhall be as well pleaſed (ſince it appears ſo practicable in my caſe) that thoſe Courtly Rules by which that Court hath formerly governed themſelves in their choice of Magiſtrates, may for the future be ſet aſide as over-partial, and that for ever hereafter thoſe perſons only may be Elected into Places in the City, that ſhall be found to be of greateſt integrity, and of beſt ability for the diſcharge thereof, without any regard to be had to any of thoſe ranks and orders of men, who from thoſe External Qualifications only, do expect the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of preferrence in the Choice.</p>
            <p>For my part (being for many years laſt paſt delivered from the Incumbrances of Trade and publick Buſineſs,) I have taſted too much of the Pleaſures and ſatisfaction of a private Life, to be fond of any Publick Truſt. I have known what it is to injoy the ſweet repoſe of quiet ſleep, after the divertiſements of the Day, whilſt that Care and Anxiety that commonly attend thoſe in Publick Places do not ſeldom render their very Beds uneaſie to them. And for that reaſon, I ſhould not have accepted of the Office I now hold, could I honeſtly have declined it; but I thought I could not fairly deſert thoſe many worthy Citizens, who after a full and free choice of me to that place, endured the fatigue of many days throng and ſweat, in Juſtifying of their Election by the Poll. And if I can in any meaſure anſwer their Expectations in this ſervice, I ſhall be very well pleaſed, without giving them any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture trouble of the like kind.</p>
            <p>And now I have ſpoken in general to the Exception taken againſt me, for not keeping houſe, and to the diſreſpects incurred by me upon that occaſion; It remains that I ſhould ſay ſome thing to that other point of the exception, whereby they would aggravate this neglect of mine, as redounding to the diſhonour of the City, from whom I have received the honour of being preferred to this Office.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, I ſhould deem my ſelf very unhappy if I ſhould deſervedly fall under this Cenſure but Cuſtom (which I have ſaid before is a grand Impoſer) exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its Tyranny in nothing more than in Creating in Man a habit of Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding things much other wiſe then the reaſon of the thing will bear; and many practiſes (upon this account) that in themſelves are very unbecoming and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, are not ſeldom urged and enforced as moſt commendable and neceſſary, And I doubt not, but that upon a due conſideration of this matter, this will appear to be our Caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:98455:5"/>
This City is indeed a great and opulent City, full of People and Trade; a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eminent for the great Charters, Priviledges, and Immunities with which it is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted; Renowned for its many Courts, and Counſels, Companies, and Societies, and for the good Laws therein Inſtituted and Ordained for the better Government of the ſeveral Ranks and Orders of men amongſt them, whereby they are enabled to obtain their own Juſtice, maintain their own Peace, and purſue all the good and advantageous ends of Trade, with the better ſucceſs and greater ſecurity.</p>
            <p>And as the happineſs and good eſtate of this City doth depend upon the right uſe and improvement of theſe advantages, and upon a due and righteous Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe good Laws, ſo the honour and eſteem which this great City moſt juſtly finds from all men both at home and abroad, doth principally reſult and ariſe from hence.</p>
            <p>I confeſs there is another thing that doth well befit this great City, which we call State and Grandeur, which (though it is far below, and differs in the eſteem of wiſe men, as much from that honour which I have before deſcribed, as my Lord Mayors Horſe accoutred with his richeſt Furniture and Trappings, doth from that honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perſon that ſits upon him, cloathed with eminencie of Power and Authority) is found nevertheleſs moſt neceſſary to attract that Reverence from the Vulgar and common People towards ſo Auguſt a Government; which they (giving Judgment of things more by outward appearance then by intrinſick worth, and real value) would otherwiſe hardly give to the greateſt Potentates.</p>
            <p>To this end the City hath its ſeveral Enſigns of Authority and Power fitted to all Degrees of Magiſtracy, and ſhewing the place they bear in the Government with becoming greatneſs. They have their ſolemn Proceſſions and Cavalcades, ſet forth with Habits, Equipage, Attendants, and other Ornaments, ſutable to the ſeveral degrees and orders of Men, for the greater State.</p>
            <p>They have alſo their Publick Shews and Triumphs upon ſet times and occaſions, edorned with much ſplendor, to entertain and divert the People with Gaze and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</p>
            <p>And they have (beſides theſe) their Publick Feaſts upon ſet times and ſolemn oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Aſſembling and rejoycing together for their refreſhment. And I do agree, that as theſe being practiſed with that moderation, and within thoſe limits which the Laws of the City upon great reaſon have wiſely Ordained, may be of good uſe to the ends aforeſaid; ſo I have not been wanting in performing my part therein, unleſs it ſhall be ſaid, That I have not attended thoſe Cavalcades and Proceſſions, which were made laſt <hi>Eaſter</hi> to thoſe Sermons which ought to have been at the <hi>Spittle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for this I ſhall only ſay, that though I did intend to bear my part in thoſe Solemnities alſo, yet my Lord Mayor (on whoſe Perſon only I am obliged to attend upon all Publick occaſions within the Liberties of <hi>London)</hi> not being in a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to go abroad, and the reſt (who I thought would have been more tender impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that antient Cuſtom which had been but once Changed in Three hundred years, (and then upon an extraordinary occaſion) as I could ever hear) being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (for what private reaſon I know not) to ſtear another Courſe, I did not think I was obliged to ſuffer my ſelf to be led by the Noſe by thoſe that thought me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be privy to their Councels, or to know the reaſons of ſo myſterious a Reſolution for the alteration of that Antient Practice.</p>
            <p>But let the Conſequence of this Accident be what it will, I conceive it falls not within our preſent queſtion: as to the matter of the Sheriffs ordinary courſe and way of Houſe-keeping, the neglect of which, is here to be Anſwered: And therefore, to ſpeak more directly to the point, I ſay, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that this (not being accounted amongſt thoſe Publick Solemnities which (as I have before noted) make up the Cities Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure) I conceive detracts nothing from the honour of the City, whatever reflection it may have upon my own perſonal Reputation.</p>
            <p>In the next place I do little doubt, but that the common courſe, and method of the Sheriffs Houſe-keeping, upon due conſideration will appear to be of ſo little Honour, that on the contrary it will be found a great prejudice to the City, and a real ſcandal to the Government that allows it; as well as an unbecoming and unreaſonable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ſlavery to him that bears it.</p>
            <p>In this Method of Houſe-keeping they divide the Week into certain and ſet days,
<pb facs="tcp:98455:6"/>
ſome whereof are called Publick days, which they imploy in Feaſting of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the City, and other grand Feaſts; the other called private days, are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpent in Treating of particular Friends and Relations, and ſuch as come upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional Viſits.</p>
            <p>As to that of the Feaſting of the Companies (of which the greateſt Obſervation is made) I think nothing can be leſs honourable to the Sheriffs, and nothing more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to the Citizens, and prejudicial to that ſober Induſtry by which a Trading City thrives beſt.</p>
            <p>As to the honour that accrues to the Sheriffs thereby I cannot well underſtand it, ſince (according to the uſual practiſe in this caſe) the Companies Generally Invite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Sheriffs, and as a token of their Reſpects preſent them with two or three Guineys towards the Charge of a double Treat; one in Winter of the Livery Men alone, with ſuch other perſons as may accidentally come to fill up the Tables, and the other in Summer of the ſame Perſons with their Wives. I muſt Confeſs as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I conſider this, it ſeems to me much like that Cuſtom in ſome Countries where two poor Servants being newly Married keep a Bride Chamber (as it is Called) and making a Proviſion for that purpoſe, Invite ſome of the beſt of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to a Treat, the Iſſue of which imports a Gift of Money, Houſhold-goods, Stock or Cattle, or ſome ſuch like Preſent to ſet up the New Houſe-keepers, which much exceeds the Value of the Treat. And if in our Caſe the exorbitant expences, (in which the Sheriffs of late have generally ſtriven to exceed one another) bring it to an indifferent Club, I cannot ſee that any great honour redounds to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs thereby, and it is ſo far from obliging the Citizens, that it is become a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable yearly Tax upon them, which many cannot ſo well ſpare, nor would ſo eaſily pay, were they not ſolicited by the Maſters and Wardens of their ſeveral Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, urging this unreaſonable Cuſtome as the Argument for the Payment of this Tribute.</p>
            <p>And how great an Enemie this great expence of time, in Luxurious Eating and Drinking is, to that ſober Induſtry, which is the riſe and glory of a Trading City, is eaſily ſeen, and the leſs to be excuſed, ſince thoſe days for Aſſembling and Feaſting in their ſeveral Companies at their reſpective Halls, are ſufficient for their reaſonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, and Divertiſement as well as for maintaining that Amity and Friendſhip, which is one of the ends of thoſe meetings.</p>
            <p>And leſt there ſhould be ſufficient Matter wanting for the encreaſing of the Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie, as well as the Expence of the Sheriffs, and that this Extravagant Courſe may continue the whole Year, invitations are provided for the filling up of thoſe Publick days which are not ſpent in Feaſting of the Companies, wherein by an unwarrantable ſort of Emulation, Men ſeem often to Vie one with the other in laviſhneſs of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. And others leſs able, being Ambitious to keep pace with thoſe that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, do not only Squander many a good Childs Portion, but tranſgreſſing thoſe good Laws made for the bounding of their Expence, ſometime ſpend in one year half, (if not the whole, of that which they) or their Parents have been many years getting with ſore labour and travail, as manifeſtly appears by thoſe who not long after they have born theſe grand Offices dye Beggars, or ſpend the remaining part of their Lives in a Goal.</p>
            <p>And it may be further noted, as a bad Conſequence attending this Extravagancie, to the no little detriment of the City, and diminution of its greatneſs, That ſince Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy by this means is rendred ſo over-burdenſome, many Rich and Prudent Men, otherwiſe well qualified for Places of Publick Truſt, and who (as matters were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ordered) would have embraced the freedom of the City as a matter of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and great Priviledge, by a wiſe foreſight have thought fit rather to decline it, than ſubmit to thoſe grand inconveniencies, which (through the neglect of thoſe good Laws, and the Preval ency of bad Cuſtoms) ſeem to be entailed on it; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon likewiſe, many Freemen that are in all reſpects well qualified for ſo great a Truſt, being called upon for that purpoſe, chuſe rather to purchaſe their own Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by Paying a conſiderable Fine, than to bear any place in the Government; or run the hazard of thoſe Clamours that they ſhould find by a more Frugal manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I hope I ſhall endeavour to govern my ſelf ſo in this Affair, as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98455:6"/>
neither to be wanting in any thing that ſhall be Eſſential to the Duty of my place, nor to exceed ſo far, as for the vanity of one years jollity or applauſe, to diſappoint or diſcourage the hopes of thoſe that may reaſonably expect ſome conſiderable ſhare of the Fruits of my former Labours, which (conſidering my Age, and that the time for the encreaſing of my Eſtate is long ſince gone) ought the rather to be regarded. And I pray God, that Pride, fullneſs of Bread, and Idleneſs, which was charged upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the Cauſe of Gods Judgments, may not grow to that height of Exceſs in this City, as to become the Ruine and Deſtruction of it.</p>
            <p>There remains one part of the Objection in the matter of Houſe-keeping yet behind; that is, <hi>That I keep no ſetled Houſe, nor a ſet Table:</hi> to which, (though I lightly touched it before) I ſhall give this further Anſwer, and I think my Cirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſidered, it will admit of a very eaſie excuſe.</p>
            <p>I conceive that my Condition, as being called out of the Country (where my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns lye) to ſerve this Office in the City, (where for many years laſt paſt I have had no ſetled Habitation or Dealing) doth much reſemble that of ſome Citizens, that having their ſetled aboade and buſineſs in the City, in reſpect of their Eſtates in the Country are many times put to bear the Office of Sheriff there; in which Caſe, they do not look upon themſelves as obliged, nor is it expected from the Country, that they ſhould keep a conſtant Houſe and Table there, as they are wont to do which have their conſtant Reſidence amongſt them. And if they do attend the Judges, and the buſineſs of the County with a ſufficient Retinue, and with due Care, and make ſuch ſolemn Entertainments as the Law requires upon thoſe occaſions, no exception is taken to them; and why more ſhould be expected from me in the like Caſe, I do not well underſtand.</p>
            <p>Had I a ſetled Houſe and Family in this City (as commonly thoſe that are Choſen to this Office have) of Courſe I ſhould have kept a Houſe, and a ſet Table, and ſhould not have grudged to have inlarged it in ſome meaſure upon this occaſion; and there is this further in my Caſe, that being a ſingle Perſon, without Wife or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that might require a Houſe, and which, (beſides the divertiſement of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany) would be aſſiſting to me in the Management thereof, I thought I had the leſs reaſon to take upon me that melancholy piece of trouble; and I am well aſſured, that thoſe friends that would have looked upon themſelves as obliged to Viſit me upon this occaſion, and are the only perſons concerned in this part of the exception, will not have the worſe thoughts of me upon this account, but had rather that I ſhould enjoy them with wonted freedom, than out of meer Formality be confined for a year, to ſo great a trouble and inconveniency, for the ſake only of receiving their Viſits.</p>
            <p>The laſt exception that is taken to me, is that according to the example of my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, I do not voluntarily contribute to the Neceſſities of the Poor Priſoners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the City Priſons, and County-Goal.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Capital Crimes that have been before objected, carryiing with them no colour of Truth; I take this Objection (that hath much of Truth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n it) to be more preſſing then all the reſt, there being more to be pleaded for Acts of Charity, than for profuſeneſs.</p>
            <p>My Conteſt is not with the Poor Priſoners, to whom Bowels of Compaſſion ought to be ſhewn, but with that Male-Adminiſtration that hath occaſioned this Grievance. The Lawyers ſay, <hi>That a particular miſchief ought rather to be born, then a general and publick inconveniency admitted.</hi> And as thoſe Laws which provide for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Priſons have been much neglected by occaſion of the Sheriffs taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves this Charge, ſo I know not but the putting a ſtop to theſe Payments (which are but voluntary) may give a good occaſion for enquiry into thoſe Laws, and to the reſtoring of them to a due execution, which would be of greater advantage to the Poor Priſoners than any thing that is now done, and would alſo encourage others to ſuch Charitable Benevolencies, and Legacies, as have been formerly given for their better ſupport, and alſo prevent the loſs of thoſe charitable Donations which its ſaid have happened by want of due care in the Execution of the ſaid Laws.</p>
            <p>As the Laws of the Land do provide, that the Counties ſhall maintain their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, ſo the Laws of this City both Antient and Modern do place the Government and Care of the Priſons in the Court of Aldermen and a Committee of the City, to be Annually appointed by and out of the Common Councel, as the beſt Expedient
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98455:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our Wiſe and Prudent Anceſtors could find, for preventing thoſe inconveniencies under which the Poor Priſoners now groan.</p>
            <p>And if by holding of my hand, and by thoſe Arguments I have given to excuſe my ſparingneſs in this and other matters, I ſhould prove ſo happy as to give an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for Retrieving of thoſe good Laws which the Ancient Prudence of this City hath moſt plentifully Provided for preſerving and promoting the good Eſtate of Her Citizens, ſo as they may no longer lye Dormant amongſt their Records, but be put in due Execution; I think neither Priſoner, nor any Freeman will hereafter find any juſt cauſe to complain of me.</p>
            <p>And in effecting ſo good a Work, as the World would eaſily believe that I ſhould have greater ſatisfaction in my ſelf, ſo I ſhould not doubt in the end of my Year, notwithſtanding the great Cry that hath been made againſt me with ſo little reaſon, to have more thanks from the greateſt part of my fellow Citizens, upon that account; and that the Obligation would laſt longer with them, then if I had according to late Example ſpent Eight or Nine thouſand pound in the Year of my Shrievaltie.</p>
            <p>But this is but a good wiſh, that fell out occaſionally in the Current of my Diſcourſe, a matter, rather to be deſired, than effected by any thing that I can ſay, or do; it is not for me to think I can bear back the ſtrong Torrent of Cuſtome, when the Laws of the City are not ſtrong enough to do it: If I ſhall by this eſſay be able in any meaſure to ſtem that Tyde of Reproach which runs upon me with that violence, that it threatens to over-ſet and make Shipwrack of my Honour and Reputation, (which is the proper Deſign of this Paper) I ſhall deem my ſelf in no ſmall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Happy and Succeſsful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A good name is as precious Oyntment,</hi> and as I ought to Value it, ſo (me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks) I ſhould now at length be able to prevail with the World to be ſo juſt, as to conſider what real grounds or reaſons there may be for ſo great a Noiſe and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and the better to enforce this Juſtice, I ſhall lay before them, the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the All-righteous Judge.</p>
            <p>When the Cry of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> was very great, and their Sin very grievous calling for Vengeance from Heaven againſt the Unrighteous Inhabitants thereof, he would not ſtreight-way rain down Fire and Brimſtone upon them; but ſaid, <hi>I will go down now, and ſee whether they have done altogether according to the Cry of it, which is come unto me, and if not, I will know.</hi> And we find, that he gave <hi>Abraham</hi> leave to make the beſt Defence he could for them before the Judgment came.</p>
            <p>The Sin of <hi>Sodom</hi> was very Great and Notorious, and the Cry of it came up to Him that could not be deceived by falſe Reports; therefore his Deſign in this was not to ſalve his own Juſtice, but to give the credulous and ill-natured World (which is apt to believe all the ill that is ſaid, rather than to examine the Truth of things:) this Great, and Early Example, as a moſt Sacred and Divine Rule to Govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by in all caſes, of this Nature.</p>
            <p>And if by what I have ſaid, and here offered, I ſhall be able to prevail with a too cenſorious World, to leave the Judgment Seat a little while, and come down and ſee, whether the Matters Charged againſt me, be according to the Cry thereof that is come unto them, or not, before they give final Judgment: I think in what I have here ſaid, I ſhall not have troubled my ſelf, nor them in vain.</p>
