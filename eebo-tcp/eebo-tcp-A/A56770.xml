            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Perceive by your Letter, that your Lady
is ſubject to frequent Miſcarriages, and
finds her Health very much Impaired
thereby. I greatly compaſſionate your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44438:3"/>
becauſe it occaſions Melancholly
Thoughts, to conſider that you are not like
to ſurvive in your Poſterity, Virtuous Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
being the Beſt Monuments to preſerve
our Names to future Ages. I'll therefore give
you the Beſt advice I can: And I think I
am obliged to communicate what I know,
for the Good of Mankind: Therefore, I pray
take Notice, that the Root above named
hath done great Service in preventing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Miſcarriages, whereof I could give ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Examples. I obſerve, that our yearly
Bills of Mortality give an account of many
Hundreds of Children that are loſt in a year
by Abortion; beſides the great Danger that
many Women are expoſed unto upon that
account.</p>
            <p>I know there are many Cauſes of Aborti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but let it proceed from Wind, or Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
or ſharp Humours, or any of thoſe
uſual Cauſes, which are well known to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
yet this Root affords Help in them
all; but it neither purges, vomits, nor ſweats,
but performs its Operation only by Corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44438:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nature, and mending the Soyl, that
it may be rendred fit to bear Fruit, and to
preſerve it untill it's ripe.</p>
            <p>There are very few Gentlewomen who
have had Children, but to their ſorrow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that one Miſcarriage doth impair
Nature, and injures their Health, more than
ſeveral Natural compleat Births.</p>
            <p>This Root not only prevents the Womans
Coming before her time, but alſo gives a
ſafe, ſpeedy and Eaſie Delivery when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
Time is accompliſht. I have told this
Remedy unto divers Midwives, and they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
recommend it to their Women, and
by this means we have very few Miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or very rarely need the help of Mans
hands to bring the Child into the World:
our Wives are like the Hebrew Women we
read of, ſpeedily delivered.</p>
            <p>I could tell you of a Citizens Wife, who
had miſcarried of five Children, and almoſt
brought to Deaths door with every one.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44438:4"/>
We gave her Broaths and Caudles made
with this Root beaten to powder, and ſhe
went out her Time, and is now bravely
brought to Bed of a luſty Lad, like to live
to do his King and Countrey good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>Another Gentlewoman, a Juſtice of the
Peace his Wife, who had miſcarried Eleven
times, and ſpent many Pounds upon Advice
in order to prevention, but all in vain, at
length ſhe was Recommended to the Drops
drawn out of this Root, which ſhe drank
three times a day in Tent, or what Liquor
ſhe pleaſed; and although ſhe had many
Frights, yet they made no Impreſſion upon
her, ſhe went out her time, and had a
Good Delivery, and enjoys an Heir to the
Family.</p>
            <p>An Eminent Midwife told me, ſhe had
recommended this Root to a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
who had been Married Nine years,
and had never been with Child; ſhe made
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44438:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Caudles with it, which ſhe drank every
Morning one Month, and proved with
Child, to the Great Joy of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</p>
            <p>Some Authors ſay, 'twas the Flowers that
Grew upon this Root, were the Mandrakes
of <hi>Leah</hi> we read of, becauſe they had the
reſemblance of a Man.</p>
