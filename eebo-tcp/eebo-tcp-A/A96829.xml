            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Womens Petition, To the Right Honorable, his Excellency, the moſt Noble and Victorious Lord General CROMWELL.</head>
            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of many thouſands of the poor enſlaved, oppreſſed and diſtreſſed Men and Women in this Land, who by theſe their ſubſcribed Repreſentators, moſt humbly complaining,</head>
            <opener>Shew,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the Norman Yoke of Bondage and Oppreſſion is ſtill continued upon this Nation, by the impious, oppreſſive, delatory, and moſt chargeable practiſe of the Law, and deſtructive Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Men and VVomen for Debt, in the ſeveral priſons, Goals, Counters, holes and Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Cruelty in this Land.</p>
            <p>That priſons are none other then Sanctuaries and places of Freedom to all unconſcionable, rich, obſtinate, and wilful Debtors; and moſt cruel Slaughter-houſes to all poor Debtors, that have nothing left to pay their Creditors, or to <hi>Fee</hi> Lawyers and Goalers.</p>
            <p>That the two Acts ſet forth for releaſe of poor Debtors not worth five pounds, are of little or no benefit to any hitherto; but rather are become a ſnare to all that have reaped any benefit by them.</p>
            <p>That the preſent intricate, delatory, chargeable, oppreſſive, endleſs practiſe of the Law, is become an abettor, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and prop to all Oppreſſors and Defrauders, and an Egyptian reed and diſcouragement to moſt men; but in eſpecial to all the poor: who thereby are utterly diſabled and diſheartned from ſuing for their Debts, Rights, and Inheritances, violently held from them by the rich and mighty: And if at any time (by the Law) their Debts and Rights are ſeemingly recovered, yet then their able Debtors have freedom (by the Law, and ſtrength of their purſes) to vacate Judgements, to Arreſt and Impriſon their poor Creditors upon falſe and fained Actions (for many yeers) thereby enforcing ſome of them to compound with them at their own rates; others of them to periſh miſerably in Goals, and ſo to loſe both their-Debts and Lives; whereby their VVives and Children are expoſed to unexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſery; beſides the many other unexpreſſible oppreſſions daylie practiſed by the Rich and Mighty, on poor and ſimple hearted Men and VVomen in this Land, by Sons of Belial.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we ſay? Our hope is even departed, and our expectation of Freedom (the fruits of our bloud ſhed, and expence of our eſtates) is removed far away; yea, the hope of our Liberty is cut off like a Weavers thrumb. We have for many yeers (but in eſpecial ſince 1647.) chattered like Cranes, and mourned like Doves; yea, with many ſighs and tears have we preſented our ſeveral complaints againſt God's and our enemies; but are hitherto ſo far from gaining redreſs, as that our eyes behold them ſtill exalted to bear Rule over us; and thus for felicity, we reap bitter grief; for freedom, ſlavery; for true judgement, juſtice and mercy, injuſtice tyrannie and oppreſſion; becauſe the <hi>Head</hi> of Tyrannie being cut off in 1648 (was expected to dy, and be dead) ſtill liveth in and by his ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed members of Injuſtice and Oppreſſion; and the Norman Laws of the Oppreſſors ſtill bear Dominion over us.</p>
            <p>Thus are we covered with VVrath, and perſecuted, oppreſſed and deſtroyed by Cruelty: Theſe our enemies have opened their mouths wide againſt us; fear and the ſnare of ſlavery hath taken hold of us; unleſs Your Excellency (into whoſe hand the ſword is put for that very end and purpoſe) as a faithful <hi>Joſhua</hi> in the zeal of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> ſtand up for us in the gap, and make up the breach; by ca<gap reason="illegible" extent="4 letters">
