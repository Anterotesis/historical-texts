            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:15682:3"/>
bounded by the Sea-bordering limits of his M. dominions, but is streatched out and spred abroad, as farre as the trumpet of Fame, (which hath borrowed all mens mouthes to sound the Heroick ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues most perspicuouslie eminent in our late Soveraigne) is heard: and chieslie, his M. vnparalelled Pietie, and Goodnesse. And for the first, was it not cleere by the whole progresse of his blessed Life, that Hee was ever most anxious, and carefull to maintaine the Profès<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, (whereof Himselfe was a Princelie, and practicall example) of the true and catholick Religion. The vse and practise whereof, Grace from aboue, and industrious Learning had so refyned in him, &amp; turned to so excellent a temper; that all the good Kings of the World, (of whom it is said <hi>Omnes bonos Principes in vno annulo posse perscribi,</hi>) were but as small starres compared to this raying Planet. And all those properties, which Holy write doth attribute to the few good Kings of Israell, &amp; Iuda; and dispersed among them, did all concurre (as Propheticall epithets) in one symbolizing har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, to make vp the perfite patterne and modell of a most excellent King in the person of his Majestie. And to his Goodnesse (a vertue answerable to Theologicall charitie) it was of a splendour so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in his M. as the forgetfull silence of future times should never haue the power to smoother, or extinguish. And therefore should Hee not justlie be called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, who alwayes affected the weale, and good of his subjects; yea, of all men; His Iustice was ever mixed with mercie; and His wrath, though justlie conceived, was tempred, and mitigated with the smooth oyle of his naturall clemencie; so that the Poets speach may bee turned ouer to Him;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee did but hate the fault, and not the faultie one.</hi> Compare him also with Ethnicke, and Paynim Princes, whose radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and splendide vices were busked vp with the false ornaments of vertue; and you shall find that there the best of them, as their <hi>Titus,</hi> their <hi>Trajane,</hi> &amp;c. were but obscure glimpses, &amp; as it were a twilight, in respect of that All-refreshing Sunne, which is risen in our age to this Northerne World: For their supposed morall vertues were but enforced sparkes, and flashes of fire, glancing from the recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of pride, and naturall magnanimitie; and in this kinde a Beast tamed by industrie, as they were by precepts and imitation, may bee
<pb facs="tcp:15682:3"/>
called generous. But our SOVERAIGNES morall parts, were true flames of sacred fire, (still burning vpon the altar of Faith, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp the sweet smelling sacrifice of prayers, and contrition; (na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and grace concluding and consummating in Him, what is most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent both in practicall Theologie, and morall Philosophie. It is said by a learned Man, <hi>Pulchra haec laudatio, O virum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum! sed illa melior, O virum sapientem! &amp; ista optima, O virum bonum!</hi> But all the three haue met together in this Wonder of Time, not a Man only, but a King; so that we are obliged with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to cry out; <hi>O Regem doctum, sapientem, bonum!</hi> and that by excellence; and in a superlative degree. To explain by induction these His M. heroick parts deserveth whole Volumes, long tract of time, pennes of the most approved, and tongues of the most admired Spirits, wherein to bee summar and by an vmbragious vaile to lessen the native splendour of so excellent a Light, were impietie, and a crime almost of La

But knowing that as your L. by nature and education, by common duetie of a subject, and many speciall obligements; was tyed in the most strict and forcible bond of sincere love, to your deceased Prince: and that the threnes, and grips of sorrow at this time possesseth your Heart; So I am sure, that these doleances, and complaints (abruptlie bursted foorth when first mine cares suckt in the never-enough deplored newes of His M. decease, as Symboles and tokens of my love, and allegeance) will bee favoourablie accepted, and gratiouslie protected by Your authoritie.
