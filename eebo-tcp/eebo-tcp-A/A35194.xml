            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:50849:3"/>
taken her leave of us: for where there is dissention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong brethren, there can bee no love nor amitie abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Honesty,</hi> she left us long agoe; before these warres began, because shee could not finde an honest man.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Religion,</hi> she hath been so cuft and beaten by the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> and <hi>Separatists</hi> of these times, that she hath absented her selfe from us for a time, to see what the en of these things will be; notwithstanding she hath a hope that the King and Parliament will not see her quite troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet: and when it shall please God that the King and Parliament accord together, then will shee fly unto them for succour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sobriety</hi> seeing swords drawne in Churches, and <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on</hi> put to flight, was ashamed to stay among such uncivill and unnaturall people. But stay, who comes here? Our old friend <hi>Honesty:</hi> alas poore wretch, thou departedst in an ill time, and art returned in a worse.</p>

                  <p>What? Our old friend <hi>Honesty?</hi> what, goe away from us in an ill time, and returne againe in a worse? alasse! here is no imployment for thee.

                  <p>I am sorry to heare it; but where are all the rest of our brethren? Me thinkes your number is very small. What's become of our old friend <hi>Peace,</hi> the quietest wretch that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was knowne.</p>

                  <p>Oh <hi>Charity!</hi> although she be not here with us, yet she is one of our Court, and one of our Counsell; and although she was very fearfull to stay in the kingdome, and was once minded to leave the Kingdome; but that she feared, that if she went, the Kingdome could not stand, she resolved then not onely to stay, but to doe the best service shee could for the common good of the weale publicke; and to this end got a Frock, and turned Porter, and carries in every day whole baskets of plate and money, to maintaine a warre, as I heare, in defence of the Gospell.</p>

                  <speaker>Patience.</speaker>
                  <p>No, but of some that are about him, as Papists, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb facs="tcp:50849:4"/>
ill-affected persons, that may perhaps divert the King from what he is, or keep him from what hee should bee, so that <hi>Charity</hi> takes not this Porters paines to maintaine a warre against the King, but against them that keep his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty from his Parliament.</p>

                  <speaker>Honesty.</speaker>
                  <p>That is one way, but faire meanes is another way, and a safer way to stay the effusion of blood; for in such a war the father kils the son, the sonne kils the father, one friend kils another. Ah poore England! there is strange alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons since I was here last.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Alas brother! you say true, but it can no way be helpt, but by taking up Armes, the more is the pitty, all the faire meanes that could possibly be used, have beene put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, both by petition, perswadement, and what not: and shall the Parliament suffer the Countrey to bee ruined, and the City spoiled by those malignant persons of his side, and not seeke to prevent it?

                  <p>Yes truely in that they did very iustly, and very honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably: As for <hi>Canterbury</hi> he wou<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But there was a little great bird there called <hi>Wren,</hi> Pray what is become of him? I remember, I once asked a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at his doore; and after he heard my name was hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, he gave me a kick, and bid me be packing: and then I thought it was time to leave England, when the pillars of the Church refused me.</p>

as his Father before him was so is he, (<hi>Semper eadem</hi>) one and the self same, <hi>Defeador</hi> of the self same Faith: and bids her be of good comfort: For He is fully resolved to venture his estate, life, liberty and all, before He will see her suffer the least iniury that may be: The Parliament assures her of the same.</p>

                  <p>O Sir, to tell you the the truth; there are adverse par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both sides, which hinders the cause, and keepes the work unfinished: For first the strongest and most ablest Papists in the land are of the Kings side, and keepes him from his Parliament: secondly there are a many, who out of a blinde zeale cry out no Bishops, no this thing, no that thing, as if His Maiesty and and the Parliament under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not what they did without their directions: so the Papists gives offence one way, and these theot her way, and what setled peace are we like to have; till God turne these Achithophels wisdoms unto foolishnesse.</p>

                  <p>Then I perceive this is a place of abiding for me, if they entertaine <hi>Religion,</hi> they will also entertaine <hi>Honesty:</hi> with hat the whole Courrrose, and all with one voyce cryed, <hi>Lord, put an end to these sinfull dayes;</hi> and shaking hands said, <hi>The world is at an end.</hi> And so I end.</p>
