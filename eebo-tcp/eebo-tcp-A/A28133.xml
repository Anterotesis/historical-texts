         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

prize the Day of their Viſitation, before it paſs away:

            <head>One Warning more from the Lord God of Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
ſounded forth unto Thee, Oh City of
London.</head>
            <p>OH <hi>London, London!</hi> The dreadful Lord God of
Everlaſting ſtrength, which faileth not, his notable,
terrible, and dreadful Day is coming upon thee as
at noon day, and from it thou canſt not eſcape, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
canſt thou quench God's Fire which burns as an Oven,
which is overtaking thee: Oh the burden of the Lord concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Treacherous and Backſliding City! Oh! Calamity, upon
Calamity, Miſery upon Miſery, Plagues upon Plagues,
Sickneſs upon Sickneſs, and one Diſeaſe upon another will
the Lord God of Power bring upon thee, and the Lord will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
thee from being inhabited, unleſſe thou doſt repent from
the bottom of thine heart, and lead a new Life, and abhor thy
ſelf in duſt and aſhes; The Everlaſting Counſellour and
Prince of Peace is come, and coming to take Peace from thee,
and to hide comfort from thine Eyes.</p>
            <p>Oh! wo is me for thee, my heart is even broken within me, and
mine Eyes as a Fountain Floweth forth before the Lord in thy
behalf, that the bitter Cup which thou and thy joyning Siſter
hath to drink, may be taken away, if it be his will. Oh! that
thou wouldt return unto the Lord as <hi>Nineveh</hi> did, who received
the Meſſage of Cod; And the King came from his Stately
Throne, and humbled himſelf before the Lord, and his Soul
was obedient unto the higher Power, which is God, and all that
had a being in that City, both Man and Beaſt, was covered with
Sackcloth and aſhes; Three dayes and three nights they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
themſelves before the higher Power, who is King of Kings
and Lord of Lords, who is Governour amongſt the Gods, even
he repented himſelf of the Evil which he thought to bring upon
them, and accepted of their Humiliation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106891:3"/>
Oh <hi>London!</hi> it would be well for thee to conſider thy wayes,
and Worſhip, and Religion, and ſearch with the Light, and let
the Light ſhew thee whether thy wayes and Worſhip, and
Law is pure, which is given forth in thee; if it be not ſo, I
pray thee as in Chriſt ſtead, let his Light lead thee into his way
and Judgements, and Worſhip, and Religion, which are holy,
that thy Soul may be ſaved in the Terrible Day of the Lord; for
there are hundreds in thee, that do not know their right hand
from their left, neither can they diſcern the Power of the Lamb
from the Power of the Beaſt. Therefore hath the Lord ſtayed
his fury from breaking forth upon thee; yet a little while and
the Mighty hand, and out-ſtretched Arm of the Lord, which is
ſtretched forth from Sea to Sea, will come upon thee ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly.</p>
            <p>Oh thou City! ſaith the Lord, who formed thee in the womb,
and gave thee Life and Breath, and hath been as a tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and loving Nurſe even from thy Cradle; have not I made
the Earth to bring forth her Corn, and Oyl, and Wine for thee?
have I not cloathed the Earth with Graſſe, and the dew to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
upon it, and the ſoftly Showers of Rain? have not I
cauſed to diſtill upon thy Flowers and Vines that they might
give a Fragrant Smell unto thee? how have thy Streets and
houſes been dreſſed with the glory of them? and have not thine
eyes beheld the Glorious Collours of the Flowers and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
of my hands, the which many of you ſhall ſee no more
becauſe of my deſtroying Angel.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>London!</hi> have not I who am the God of the whole World,
placed a glorious burning Fire in thee, which all the water in
the Sea cannot quench, which gives light in thee, and unto thee,
and all Nations; which is my witneſs in every man, which
ſtands up for me againſt all manner of Sin? hath not the Lord
broken up the Seals of the great deep, and opened the Fountain
of Everlaſting Life in the midſt of thee, to waſh thee from thy
Leproſie, and to heal thy putrifying ſores: Oh! thou art full of
running ſores, from the crown of thine head, to the ſole of
thy foot, there is not a free place; have not I opened a well
of pure water to bathe and make thee white? I the Lord of Hoſt
hath cauſed my Sons, and Daughters, and Handmaids to leave
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106891:3"/>
both Father, and Mother, Houſe and Land, Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
and indeed all outward things, to come unto thee, riſing
up early in ſore Travels and labours, to warn thee, and call thee
to Repentance, that thou mightſt be ſaved before my dreadful
ſtroke be ſtruck at thee, which will not fail: have not they
ſhewed thee many things which hath come to paſſe? I have
ſhewn and am ſhewing Signes in Heaven and Earth, in thee,
which ſhall make the keepers of the houſe to tremble; have
not the dead been raiſed, the blind made to ſee, the Lame to
walk, the dumb to ſpeak, the Leopards been cleanſed in thee?
have not I made the Elements to melt with fervent heat, the
Powers of Heaven have been ſhook by me, the Sun have I
turned into darkneſs, and the Moon hath loſt her Light: The
old Heaven, and the old Earth hath the Lord made to paſſe
away at the Brightneſs of his coming; and as I have worked
and ſuffered in you, ſo I will do until I have made up my
Jewels, which I am perfecting through ſufferings in thee; And
until I have gathered my Seed from the four winds in thee, into
my Boſom, from whence it came, until then will I work, and
bear the burden of iniquity, even until the Seed ſuffering mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is come to an end; and then ſhall not my eye pitty, nor
hands ſpare thee, but I will bathe my ſword in thy blood, and I
will give thee blood to drink, even as thou haſt done by my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Lambs, even ſo will I do by thee; and as they have
ſeen their blood lie in thy Streets, ſo ſhalt thou ſee thine, and
the day will be hot and terrible that is coming upon thee,
unleſſe thou doſt repent; I the Everlaſting God have looked
down out of my Holy Habitation, and have beheld the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of my People, notwithſtanding the noble and worthy Acts
that have been done by my People in thee, how haſt thou
Bruiſed, Beaten, and Knocked down, Killed and Spilt the
blood of my innocent Lambs, and haled them into thy naſty
Priſons until they die; Oh! the blood of the innocent is found
in thee, which cryeth aloud for Vengeance unto my Throne,
Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, and Gluttony, and all manner of
Ungodlineſs, Tyranny and Oppreſſion, is found in thee; Thy
<hi>Prieſts Preach for hire, and thy People love to have it ſo; Rioting
and ungodly meetings, Stage-Playes, Ballad Singing, Cards, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106891:4"/>
Dice,</hi> and all manner of Folly (not in corners only, but in the
high places of thy ſtreets) wicked works &amp; actions are not puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
by thee, and hundreds may meet together to commit fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and take the name of the pure God in vain, and cauſe his ſoul
to mourn, and abuſe themſelves with his Creatures, until they
can neither go, nor hardly ſpeak; <hi>Taverns</hi> and <hi>Ale-houſes</hi>
are frequented day and night, and are ſeldom diſturbed by the
Magiſtrates, or ſent to Priſon, or Bruiſed, or Knocked down;
but they that are Innocent and cannot lift up a hand, or bear
Arms for or againſt any man, and have no evil or hard thought in
their Hearts againſt any one, neither do they ſpeak evil of things
they know not, or contemn Magiſtracy, but <hi>reprove Sin in the
Gate, and ungodlineſs in the Streets,</hi> and ſo have made themſelves
a Prey; theſe are they that are Puniſhed by thee, and whoſe Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
are deeper than any People upon the Earth beſides.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>London!</hi> the ſins of the old world is found in thee; art
thou guilty or not guilty? for thy time draweth near, wherein
thou muſt give an account unto me, who am a dreadful and moſt
terrible Judge, unto that Spirit which leadeth thee into Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution:
Oh! thou art grown numerous, and very great, thy beam
reacheth unto Heaven, and thy Glory unto the end of the
Earth, and thou haſt Crowned thy ſelf with Dignity, and haſt
built thy Neſt among the Stars, and <hi>ſitteth as a Queen,</hi> thou
haſt made thy ſelf ſtrong, and haſt ſaid in thy Heart, <hi>Thou ſhalt
not ſee Sorrow;</hi> thou ſeeſt no Scarcity within thy Gates, but
Fulneſs within thy Pallaces: But know this as from the Lord,
thou bloody City, thou ſhall know his terrible ſtroak, who is
God Almighty; He will plead with thee as in the Valley of
<hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> even with the Fire of his Wrath, and the glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sword of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>Oh! thou famous and beautiful <hi>Harlot,</hi> who art beautified with
the Glory of <hi>Egypt,</hi> thou haſt played the Whore with many
Lovers; Oh! thy Bed is defiled, and thou haſt forgotten thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
which maketh my Soul to mourn; thy ſtrength ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
weakneſs, and thy Glory ſhall periſh, thy beauty ſhall be
turned into aſhes, and thy honour ſhall become contemptable,
becauſe thou art covered with a dark Cloud of Sin and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
and ſo cannot behold the Lord; Envy hath miſled thy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106891:4"/>
mind, which hath cauſed thee to Impriſon his Meſſengers, not
only them of thy own City, but Strangers, who hath forſaken
all to viſit thee in Bowels of Everlaſting Love; and thus
haſt thou rewarded them, which is contrary to Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
which is to love Strangers.</p>
            <p>In the Dayes of Old, they received Strangers and waſhed
their Feet, and gave them to eat and to drink; but thou briuſeſt
and knockeſt them down, and keepeſt them in Priſon from their
Families; and haſt ſaid, The Pariſh will look after them: Oh
thou mercileſs City! doſt thou think to obtain Mercy from the
Lord? How many Families haſt thou ſeperated, the Wife from
the Husband, and the Husband from the Wife, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from her Children, and the Servant from the Maſter, not
ſuffering them to ſee each other for a time; The Lord hath
ſaid, <hi>Curſed is He that ſeparateth a man from his Wife;</hi> and duſt
not thou bring that Curſe and many more upon thy head? we
have been found in no Plots nor Riſings, but have ſeeked the
good of all Souls, and the Proſperity of all Nations; in <hi>Olivers</hi>
Dayes, and ever ſince we have been gathered out of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
and Vanities of this City, and could not Bow unto <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
we have been a ſuffering People, and nothing could be
found againſt us but concerning the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of our <hi>God,</hi> which
muſt diſanul all unjuſt Laws made by Man: The <hi>Medes</hi> and
<hi>Perſians</hi> had nothing againſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> but concerning his Faith;
and I know <hi>Daniels</hi> Spirit liveth amongſt us.</p>
            <p>Therefore conſider what thou art doing, for in vain doſt thou
ſet up Briers and Thornes in Battle againſt the terrible
God, for by the brightneſs of his Coming ſhall they be burnt
up; for aſſuredly the Lord will ariſe mightily for his Seeds ſake,
for as a Lyon rouſed up, is he come, who is the munition of
Rocks, and as a ſhe Bear bereaved of her young Ones, will
he roar and diſquiet all thy Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>London!</hi> God hath a remnant in thee, which he hath
marked for his own, which ſhall eſcape the Wrath that is to
come; Glory, Glory, Songs of Everlaſting Praiſes be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the living God, who hath not left himſelf without a
witneſs in thee; Oh <hi>London! If thou wouldſt return ſaith the Lord
Almighty, I will heal thy Back-ſlidings, and forgive thee all thy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106891:5"/>
Sins;</hi> I will withdraw my bitter Cup which I have filled full of
my Indignation, and I will cover thee with my Garment of
Everlaſting Love, and I will be married unto thee, even as
a young Man marrieth a Virgin, never to be ſeperated; I looked
down from the Throne of my Glory, and I ſaw thy diſtreſſed
Condition, thou art as a Sheep without a Shepherd, as upon
the Mountains of Prey, and art ſcattered hither and thither,
amongſt the Clouds of Religions; thou knoweſt not which way
to turn, thou art like the Dove, thou canſt find no reſt nor
footing for the ſoal of thy foot; thou art liable to be torn by
the Woolfs, and devoured by the Lyons; thy TeachErs are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
into corners, And thou art diſpoſeſſed of thy wonted
Houſes and Service: Therefore ſaith the Lord, do I pitty thy
ConDition, and if thou wilt hearken unto me, who am <hi>near
thee in thy Heart, and in thy mouth; at thy down lying I am with
thee, and in the night ſeaſon I viſit thee, and at thy upriſing I call
thee to repentance:</hi> how many years have I born with thee, as I
did with the old World? but my Patience came to an end, and
my Wrath waxed hot, and ſo it will againſt thee, if thou wilt
not hear my beloved Son, which I have ſent a Light into the
World; and if thou wilt learn of the Light which ſhines in
thy Heart, then thou wilt be on heaps no more, neither will
thy Teachers, and Worſhips, and Church, be any more remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into Corners, but thou wilt be built upon Chriſt, the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and Ground of Truth, who is the Church of the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born;
then wilt thou have Fellowſhip with the Lord, and
thy-Glory, and Crown, and Beauty ſhall never have an end,
but thou ſhalt be the Glory of the whole Earth, and the Beauty
of all Nations, and Kings, ſhall come to thy riſing, and Princes
to the brightneſs of thy Glory; there is no City upon the
Earth can ſay as thou canſt in this latter day, for the Power of
the Lord hath been ſhed abroad in thee, and thou haſt been
viſited more than any; therefore prize the Son of the Lord,
leaſt thou art caſt into utter Darkneſs; for it is I the Lord that
chaineth <hi>Leviathan,</hi> which no man can tame, who am God, and
there is none beſides me; by my Wiſdom the World was made,
and the Heavens framed; I created the Sea, and cauſed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
to run into it, and have ſet the Sands, as ſwadling bands
that it cannot over-paſs; and this is my decree which I will have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106891:5"/>
ſealed unto my people, <hi>I am the Quakers God,</hi> and will be with
them unto the end of this World, and in the end they ſhall
be with me in my Glorious Kingdome, where they ſhall be
kept from their Perſecutors, and lye down in joy, peace and
tranquility, with the reſt of my holy Martyrs, and Prophets,
and Apoſtles, in years paſt: and I am utterly againſt all that
do oppoſe them, who am a terrible God, and will bring the
wickedneſs of the wicked to an end, but the righteouſneſs of
the righteous doth live with me.</p>
            <p>This is my Decree, and it ſhall live for ever, and remain
World without end; and if thou canſt cauſe the rain from rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or the Stars from ſhining, or the Sun from going her
Courſe, or giving light to the Nations, then mayeſt thou alter
my Decree with my People, whoſe ſeed ſhall be for number
as the ſand upon the Sea ſhore, and for Multitude as the Stars
of Heaven, and they ſhall ſhine in Glory more brighter than the
Sun at noon day, in the Firmament of my Power, when the
generation of the wicked, ſhall be caſt into the Lake, which

            <head>The Trumpet of the Lord ſounded forth unto England,
Scotland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Ireland, with a Word of wholſome
Advice and Counſel to the King, Rulers, and Judges
thereof.</head>
            <p>OH <hi>King!</hi> this is my Counſel unto thee, and thy Rulers and
Judges; Oh! hearken unto the Light of Chriſt in your
Conſciences, that it may bear rule in your hearts, that you may
Judge for the Lord, and oppreſſion may be expel'd in your Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
Oh! that you would <hi>do Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>love Mercy,</hi> and <hi>walk
humbly with the God of heaven,</hi> then would the Lord give you
length Of dayes, and a long life, Peace and Plenty ſhall be in

ſhall be in your Palaces; this ſhall you ſee and know to be
accompliſhed, if you will leave off oppreſſing the Righteous, and
ſet the Captive free.</p>
            <p>Oh ye <hi>Rulers, Judges,</hi> and <hi>Juſtices,</hi> and all People high and
low! be it known unto you from the mighty Judge of Powerful
Majeſty, that he is riſen, who will ſcatter Rulers in his anger,
and will pluck down Kings in his wroth. Oh! the anger of the
Lord waxeth hot againſt all workers of iniquity, and he will ſet
his oppreſſed ſeed free, which cryeth unto him for deliverance;
and know this, what cruelty ſoever be in your hearts againſt us,
the Lord will confound it and bring it to nothing; for the Lord
is on our ſides, and we fear not <hi>Impriſonment, Baniſhment, Fine</hi>
or <hi>Tortures,</hi> or whatever the wrath of man can inflict upon us;
for our hearts are firmly fixed upon the Lord, and we are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given up in Body, Soul, and Spirit to ſuffer for God's Cauſe:
Oh you Rulers! if the Lord ſuffereth you to Baniſh us, I know
that the Lord will go along with us, as he did with <hi>Abraham</hi>
in a ſtrange Land, but know this, we ſhall leave a ſeed behind
us, which ſhall be your tormentor, and ſhall witneſs for us
when we are gone.</p>
            <p>Oh Lord! I commit our caſe unto thee, who art faithful, and
keepeth Covenant for ever, and I know thou wilt fight our Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
and plead our cauſe with the mighty on earth, who would
deſtroy us from being a People if thy Power did not preſerve
us; Glory and Honour be given unto thee, who hath compaſſed
us about with ſongs of everlaſting praiſes; and we may bleſſe
the hour and time that thou raiſed up a People in the North,
even a dreadful and terrible Army, who Marched ſwiftly in thy
Power through the Nations, and by them we were convinced,
and turned towards the Lord, and they ſhall be the dread of all
Nations, and God hath crowned them with an everlaſting
Crown, which neither Men nor Devils ſhall be able to take
from them.</p>
            <p>Oh you <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> of theſe Nations! do you think to
overcome us or make us yeeld by keeping them in Priſon, which
you think are our Teachers, and Ring-leaders? nay, Chriſt is
our Teacher, and he cannot be removed into a corner, who is
the Antient of Dayes, and will cauſe us to increaſe dayly, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106891:6"/>
to grow as Calves in the ſtall; we are not like the World, who
muſt have a Prieſt to Interpret the Scriptures to them, and
when he is removed, they are ſcattered and knows not what to
do; but my friends, we witneſs the Scriptures fulfil'd, who hath
ſaid in the latter dayes, <hi>He would pour out his Spirit upon Sons

taught of me,</hi> and <hi>great ſhall be their peace,</hi> and <hi>in righteouſneſs
ſhall they be eſtabliſhed:</hi> So the Lord doth not ſpeak unto us in
an unknown Tongue, but in our own Language do we hear
him perfectly, whoſe voice is better than life; and for this
cauſe doth the unlearned hate us, and the uncircumciſed revile
us, becauſe we cannot own the Teaching that is of this World,
but that which cometh immediately from God, and that is pure
and refreſheth the Soul, and holdeth up the head in the day of
Battel, and it cauſeth us to meet together, to worſhip the
Lord as we ought to do; and Oh you Rulers, and People! it is in
vain for you to ſtrive againſt us, for the God of heaven is with
us.</p>
            <p>Oh <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland!</hi> but more eſpecially thou
O <hi>England,</hi> that art the moſt fruitful and famous Land, in which
the Lord hath been pleaſed to make manifeſt his Life and
Power, Beauty and Glory, more than in any Nation under

from death to life, and hath made them bold and valiant
Souldiers for his Teſtimony, which he hath given them to bear
forth unto all Nations; and by the Glorious and Powerful Word
of Life, which hath proceeded out of their mouthes, hath thy
<hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> been convinced of the evil of their way, and
have been made to confeſſe to the Truth, both Prieſts and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
both High and Low, Rich and Poor, hath the Lord viſited
in this day of great Salvation, and everlaſting love; ſo that
none could plead inorance, but many like <hi>Demas</hi> hath denyed
the Truth, and Imbraced this preſent evil World: And now
Oh <hi>England!</hi> will the Lord try and prove all thy Inhabitants,
from the King that ſitteth upon his Throne, unto the Beggar
that ſitteth upon the dunghill, even all ſorts of profeſſors and
prophane; Oh! the Fire is kindled, and the Furnace is even

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106891:7"/>
muſt be tryed, and that which will not remain in the Furnace,
muſt be conſumed by the Fire of the Lord; for the moſt high

Furnace, as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that they may come forth as polliſhed
Silver, and well refined Gold; and he hath brought many
through the Furnace, and hath ſet them as Pillars in his houſe,
to bear forth a Valiant and Noble Teſtimony of what they have
ſeen, taſted and handled of the Word of Life, unto thy inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
and unto the whole World, that they may fear that

whole World is but as the drop of a Bucket, and at whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
the heavens ſhall wax old as a garment that moths have
eat, and the Element ſhall paſſe away with a great noiſe, the
Earth ſhall be diſſolved, and all things therein ſhall mourn, and
the ſouls ſhall fail before him which he hath made.</p>
            <p>Oh! let your <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen, Dukes</hi> and <hi>Earls, Lords</hi> and

that all the honeſt-hearted in thy Dominions may worſhip the

calls for <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> without which you <hi>cannot ſee the
Lord;</hi> therefore conſider you are but Men, and made of the
duſt of the Earth, and you know not how ſoon you may return
to your long homes, and ſhall be ſeen no more; have you the
length of your life, or the number of your dayes in your own
hands? have you the command of Death, or can you ſtay its
ſtroke? nay, you are but as potſheards broken by the hand of the
Potter, you are here to day and gone to morrow, <hi>your Beauty is
as the graſs, and your glory as the Flower thereof,</hi> cut down by the

Ah, poor duſt and aſhes, why do you perſecute us even to Death,
for no other cauſe but for worſhiping the God of Heaven? Oh!
do you think that the Lord is ſuch a one as your ſelves? or are
you ſo vain to believe, that he winks or joyns with you in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting,
Knocking down, and ſpilling our blood in your
Streets; and Murdering of us in your Priſons? nay, nay although
he hath ſuffered ſuch things to be done, for the Tryal of our

God, who am cloathed with <hi>Vengeance</hi> as with a <hi>Robe,</hi> and

and for <hi>Sions</hi> ſake I will not be quiet, and for my beloved <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
I will not be ſilent, but I will roar and thunder forth
my voice out of my Holy Mountain, and the Beaſts ſhall trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the Earth ſhall be as a ſmoke, the tall Cedars ſhall fall,
and the ſtirdy Oakes ſhall be plucked up by the Roots, and all
things of this World ſhall be afraid; the Bats ſhall go into
their Holes, and the Lyons into their Dens, when the Lord
appeareth in his Beauty, to make Inquiſition for blood, then
ſhall your hearts fail you for fear of thoſe things that are coming
upon you; in that Terrible Day, all your lovers will do you
no good, and your familiars will ſtand afar off; then muſt you
be left to the Judge of Judges, where you ſhall ſee the Book of
Conſcience opened, where your Indictments will be read at
large, and he will Judge you according as your deeds ſhall be.
Oh then! if you have not done Juſtice, nor loved mercy, or did
the thing that was Juſt in the ſight of the Lord, then ſhall you
be Baniſhed from the preſence of the King of Heanen for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
into utter darkneſs, where is <hi>weeping, wailing,</hi> and <hi>gnaſhing</hi>
of Teeth, and you ſhall be a ſtink to Ages to come.</p>
            <p>Oh! bleſſed and happy will it be for thoſe <hi>Judges,</hi> and <hi>Rnlers,</hi>
and <hi>Poople,</hi> who hath clean hands, and pure hearts, and have not
joyned with the wicked in perſecuting the Innocent; ſurely
there reward will be great in Heaven.</p>
            <p>My Friends, I was once of this Religion which is now in
Power, I was ſigned with the ſign of the Croſs, &amp; baptized into
the Faith; my <hi>Godfathers and Godmothers Promiſed and Vowed,</hi> that I
<hi>ſhould forſake the Devil and all his works, the Pomps and Vanities
of this wicked World, and all the ſinful luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> and that
I ſhould <hi>keep Gods Holy Will and Commandments all the dayes of my
life;</hi> and when I was young, my Father had me <hi>Biſhop'd,</hi> thinking
thereby to gain a bleſſing for me: I ſpent many years in <hi>Oxford,</hi>
where the carriages of the Schollars, did trouble me in that
day, they were ſo wilde; after the beſt ſort of Religion and
cuſtom of the Nation, was I brought up; then the Lord drew
me to this City, where I applyed my heart both Evening and
Morning, and at noon day, unto reading and hearing the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer;</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106891:8"/>
when there was but one place of Worſhip left in
this City, I went to it, and when there Books were burned, I
ſtood for them, for my heart was wholly joyned unto them; and
when the King's head was taken off, my heart and Soul was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened,
that I was even weary of my Life, and the Enemy waited
to devour me; then did the Lord take away my hearing that I
was deaf as to all Teachings of Men for a year; then that Faith
which I was baptized in, did no good, for all that the Man and
Women had promiſed, and vowed, I ſhould do, I could not
forſake the Pomps and Vanities, and ſinful luſts of the Fleſh
I run into; and they ſtood alwayes before my eyes, my cry was
continually unto the Lord, that I might put off that body of
death, which hindred me from his preſence; then did the Lord
carry me to a Meeting of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> where
I was filled with the dread and Power of the Lord, and it
raiſed my Soul to bear Teſtimony to the Truth, and after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſeaſon the Lord ſet my ſins in order before me, and every
idle word which I had ſpoken was brought to my remembrance,
where I received a juſt reward from the Lord, and ſo came to
have Peace of Conſcience with my Saviour, which I never could
obtain whilſt I walked with thoſe People.</p>
            <p>Oh my Friends! I can truly ſay, ever ſince I was a Child,
the witneſs of God purſued me, and what ever I did, I had no
Peace in this worſhip, or Service, which is now in being; it
tired and vexed my tender Soul, to ſee what a ſad eſtate I was
in; but now Glory be to the Lord, I am ſet at Liberty from
this vain Religion, which never profited me at all; and would
you have me to conform to this Religion, which keepeth the
Soul in the grave? hay I ſhall never conform unto this worſhip
whilſt I have breath, but ſhall bear my Teſtimony againſt it, for
I know the powerful Cod is riſen to throw it down, and wo be to
all that uphold it.</p>
            <p>Oh your Rulers! be it known unto you, if you will not do
Juſtice and eaſe the oppreſſed, and ſet the Captives free, the
Lord will overturn you, and deſtroy you from being a People,
as he hath done in years paſt; for his ſword is in his hand, and
it will cut you down, unleſs you do repent, ye ſhall likewiſe
periſh.</p>

do oppoſe the Lamb in this City, as the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi>
and holy <hi>Martyrs,</hi> have done in their day, againſt all falſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106891:10"/>
               <hi>Gods, Worſhips,</hi> and <hi>Worſhippers;</hi> we have the ſame Spirit to
fight againſt in this City, as they had in the World before:
Therefore my Companions, and fellow Sufferers, have we not
need to ſtand up for God's Cauſe, for the which we have, and
are called to bear forth our Teſtimony, in ſo deep Sufferings as
we have come through? and if we are to drink of a deeper Cup,
yet let us be thankful unto the Lord of the Harveſt, for it is for
the gathering of the Exiles into <hi>Abraham's</hi> boſome, and the
poor thirſty Soules unto the place of broad Rivers: Oh! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
and give Praiſes unto God on high, who hath begun his
Work, and will finiſh it in his time: Oh my Friends! let us
keep clear of this City, let us not taſt nor handle any of her
Works, for her works are Vanity and falſhood, the Poyſon
of Aſpes is under her tongue, and Deceit is in her hands;
therefore it is good that we bear a faithful Teſtimony for the
moſt high againſt this Generation, and if our lot be to die,
and we appointed to be Slain for the ſame, it will be well with
us, our Souls ſhall be received into the boſome of the Father,
where we ſhall glorifie God day and night, and ſhall be free
from Oppreſſion: Oh dear Hearts! be not afraid of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
or proud looks of vain Man, which is but like a bubble,
he can but kill the Body, but cannot kill the Soul; Oh! be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
prepared to die, that none may be afraid of Death
when it comes, for it may come ſuddenly, when ye are aſleep,
or in the twinckling of an Eye; Oh! that then the reſt which
God hath prepared for his People, may be entred into, or elſe
Miſery and Pain will be found, which is the Reward of the
Slothful and Diſobedient; the Way of the Righteous is Life
Eternal, and the Path of the Juſt is a burning and a ſhining
Light, which our Eyes have ſeen, and our hands have handled
of the Word of Life, by which we have been preſerved unto
this day; and I am certain if thouſands of thouſands ſhould
riſe up againſt us, they ſhall not prevail, for the Lord the
mighty <hi>Jehovah</hi> is with us, and will fight our Battel, and plead
our Cauſe with the mighty Ones of the Earth; we need do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſtand ſtill in Gods Salvation, which is the ſaving health
of all Nations, and will plead with all Tongues and Kindreds
of the Earth, who do oppoſe Him; <hi>And his Lambs and Babes,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106891:11"/>
who walketh in his holy Path, which is Life to the upright in heart.</hi>
Oh! the Wiſdom, Power and Glory of the unlimitted God,
what tongue is able to declare it, or what heart can conceal the
infiniteneſs of the Riches of the Judge of Heaven and Earth?
it even fills the Heart with Love and Life, and over-ſhadows
the Soul and Mind with the Glory and Beauty of the unſpotted
Lamb, which <hi>taketh away the Sins of the World;</hi> Oh! the
weight of his Glory, I am even ſwallowed up with the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſibleneſs
of it; Oh! the height and the depth of it
is paſt finding out, by the Wiſdom of this World; Oh my
Friends! is not that God amongſt us, who created <hi>Adam</hi> in
Innocency, and <hi>Eve</hi> of the Duſt of the Earth? did not he
cauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> to leave the Land of his Nativity, and go into
a ſtrange Land? and did he not compaſs him about with
Strength and Power, and gave him Favour in the ſight of the
People? and is he not the ſame God ſtill? Yes, although <hi>the
Earth may wax old, and Heavens vaniſh away as ſmoak, and the
Elements with fervent heat,</hi> yet he remains unchangeable, who
is our head; Oh! What is all the World before him, who is
<hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Judges,</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings?</hi> it's but as the drop of
a bucket in his ſight; and a thouſaud Years is but as one day
with our God: Therefore it is expedient for all <hi>Friends</hi> to
watch and wait, and Pray leaſt they enter into Temptation:
And this have I ſeen my beloved Friends this night as from the
Lord, that there muſt be a watching and waiting for the Inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Power of the Lamb to ariſe, to move, to pray, to ſpeak, and
then it will be a pure and a holy Sacrifice which the Lord will
accept: Oh my <hi>Friends!</hi> let us whilſt we have breath ſacrifice
our Sighs, Tears and Groans, Prayers, and Faſtings, upon God's
holy Altar, that a ſweet Savour may aſcend into the Noſtrels of
the Moſt High God, that ſo we may receive a Bleſſing from
Heaven for evermore: And this the Lord hath put into my
Heart, and I cannot forbear but Write, that if any prayeth or
ſpeaketh unleſs in the holy Power of the dreadful God amongſt
us, it is as water ſpilt upon the ground, and it will bring a
Curſe rather than a Bleſſing; the Lord looketh for a holy and
clean Sacrifice from us, above all the People in the World,
becauſe he hath raiſed up his own Life in us, and choſen us to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106891:11"/>
be his People, and the Lot of his Inheritance, and the Place
where his Honour dwelleth, is with us; and I know Sacrifices
have been offered by us, and is to this day, which the Lord's
Soul loves, and He doth delight to make us his choice; He is
our God, and we have none in Heaven nor in Earth to plead
our Cauſe but He, that Suffered, and layd down his Life on
Earth, but now ſits in Majeſty and Glory in the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
who is our chief leader and guide, and doth lead us into
his Power to meet together, and to <hi>ſtand in awe and Sin not;</hi>
and if (Friends) we ſhould not meet together, we ſhould
Sin againſt God, and ſhould miſs of his Preſence, who hath
ſaid, <hi>Where two or three are met together in my Name, there will I
be</hi> (ſaith the Lord) and this is my Teſtimony as a Witneſs to
this thing, I never went to any Meeting ſince I knew the
Truth, even from the firſt Meeting to this day, but I was filled
with the Living Power of the Lord; Oh! the ſweet ſhowers
that doth deſcend from the preſence of the Lord, and the
pleaſant rains that falleth from his Throne like ſilver drops, it
doth diſtil upon our Hearts, whilſt we are in our Meetings in
the Name and Power of Jeſus, who is amongſt us, and hath
raiſed us, and is raiſing us from the Dead; and hath, and is
quickning our mortal Bodies, that they may be like unto his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Body; he hath and doth turn us from Darkneſs to Light,
from Satans Power to his own: Oh! can we forget or refuſe
ſuch glorious Benefits, which we have received from the God of
our Life, in our Meetings together? I know my Friends, you
are not unſenſible of this great gain, by loſing the Love of the
World, to meet together with the King of Heaven and Earth,
whoſe preſence is better than Life: Oh! how hath he opened
the Sluce of Everlaſting Mercies and Love, that it hath poured
down from the crown of our head, to the ſoal of our foot, ſo
that we have been waſhed throughout by the endleſs Goodneſs
of the Lord in our Meetings: And this is my mind, and I
hope you are and will be of the ſame with me, and I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Lord will carry me on to the end; I had rather
die the cruelleſt Death that ever was, or can be deviſed by man,
than to neglect or abſtain from Meeting together in his Name;
for I know who ever doth it, neglects their own Salvation, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106891:12"/>
the day of their Viſitation. Oh my beloved Friends! if we
Suffer Impriſonment, or loſs of Life upon the account of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together, let us rejoyce, for it is for Chriſt ſake that we are
Perſecuted, for <hi>great is our reward in Heaven;</hi> Oh! Chriſt is
our meat and drink, he is become our Table in the midſt of our
Perſecutors, our Cup doth overflow, when we are in cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Chriſt is with us, who cannot be expoſed from us by the
Wrath of Wicked men; when we are brought out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and had before the Rulers, then Chriſt goeth along with
us, and teacheth us what to ſay; He is a Mouth, and Wiſdom,
and Utterance, we take no care what to do; when we are ſent
back again to Priſon from the Rulers, if it be into a naſty Hole
or Dungeon, our Saviour goeth with us, and he teacheth us
Patience, and Meekneſs, and poureth upon our Head and Hearts
his holy Oyle, which maketh us ſing for joy of heart, that he
hath counted us worthy to Suffer for his name: So my Friends,
if they fight againſt us, they fight againſt God, for God is with
us, and it is his Cauſe we ſtand for, and Suffer in Goods, Body
and Spirit: And therefore ſeeing it is ſo weighty a thing that
we lye at ſtake for, we value not what Men, or Devils, Spirits,
or Angels can do unto us, for our Hearts and Spirits are firmly
fixed upon the Lord and his Cauſe; and for Meeting together
as long as we are moved of the Lord, the which will be I hope
as long as we have breath; Oh all you my Friends! who are
young and tender, and all you who are looking abroad to ſee
what will become of us, and cannot joyn with us, becauſe of
Perſecution, have a care, I warn you in the Preſence of the
dreadful God, ſtand not in that ſlippery place, leaſt the day
of Mercy paſs over whilſt you ſtand gazing, and Repentance
be hid from your Eyes, then would you give the whole World
if you had it, for one hour to repent it, but then it will be too
late: Therefore I beſeech you not to look at us, but to mind
your own Salvation, and what the Lord ſaith unto you by his
witneſs in you; for every one in the day of God's account ſhall
anſwer for himſelf, and receive a reward according to their
Works; the Lord is no reſpecter of Perſons, the King as well
as the Beggar ſhall know the ſtroak of God's hand, when the
Book of Conſcience is opened, wherein their Sins are written
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106891:12"/>
as with the point of a Diamond; and I know that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can blot them out but the blood of the Lamb; and
therefore do we utterly deny and abhor any Pardons from the
<hi>Biſhops,</hi> for I know they cannot pardon themſelves, nor keep
their own Soul alive; our confidence is in God, who hath tryed
our Reins and ſearched our Hearts by his living Power; Glory
everlaſtingly be given unto the higher Power, to whom our
Souls are ſubject, and in whom we live, and ſhall do world
without end.</p>
