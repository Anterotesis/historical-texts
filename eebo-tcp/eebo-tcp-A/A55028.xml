         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I ſet before you this day, a bleſſing and

all the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> now upon

11. 26. Ever ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> knew them, they
had not been in ſo good a temper, as they
were at this inſtant when he ſpake theſe
words; and yet he holds it no <hi>diſcourteſie</hi>
in him, nor <hi>diſparagement</hi> to them, to ſet home his Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with theſe incentive quicknings, which he after purſues
with a great deal of variety and emphaſis, in the latter end of
that Book, Chap. 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32.</p>
            <p>We are fallen into times, wherein, if ever, Gods people need
all manner of quicknings from Gods word, when as his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is about to do ſome terrible thing, for, or againſt the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59075:4"/>
Church, or both. I would hope, we are upon the borders of that
promiſed bleſſing, which we at leaſt have made to our ſelves
many a time: And I do hope, we are not now in the worſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
that ever we were. Though on the other ſide, it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
apparent, we are ſtill upon the borders of ruine, and of one
of the wofulleſt curſes, that ever befell a Nation profeſſing Gods
Name. Let it not then ſound harſh to any ear, ſpecially on ſo
ſolemn a day of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> that a Text is preſented, which
carries not a <hi>bleſſing</hi> onely, but alſo a <hi>curſe</hi> in the very Forehead

Iſrael</hi> with us, at leaſt, in the Good, the Bleſſing held forth.</p>
            <p>But I Preface no longer.</p>

Church on earth, were now in one of the greateſt dangers that
ever threatned a Nation. The ſtory is well known, I cannot
ſpend time to decipher it. It is my great comfort, in that and
the whole of my Diſcourſe, that I ſpeak to wiſe men; elſe the
multitude of matters to be crowded together, within the allotted
compaſſe of time for this holy Exerciſe, would ſuffer prejudice
among us, by my neceſſary haſt; Therefore alſo I ſhall give you
no other diviſion of the Text, then into the Points that thence
offer themſelves to our preſent inſtruction. I will name them
all together, and ſhew you the Riſe of the ſeveralls as we go
along.</p>
            <p>The firſt Doctrine is, [<hi>Every one of Gods profeſſed people owe
their endeavours, with the utmoſt hazard of themſelves, to help the
Church in time of danger.</hi>]</p>

whenſoever he pleaſes ſo to deale; (and that according to the
proportion of humane juſtice in many caſes) 1. <hi>Becauſe Men
oft forbear their duties for their children and poſterities ſake, as well as
their own,</hi> and ſo they ſtick not to ſay oft-times. Therefore their
children ſhall pay for their neglects together with themſelves.
2. <hi>They oft engage them according to their capacity in the ſinne, as
well as themſelves,</hi> and train them up (even from children) in
Neutrality and Lukewarmneſſe, and a ſpirit of ſelfe-love and
ſelfe-ſeeking; therefore God cuts off ſometimes the children
too, as a corrupted generation. 3. <hi>At leaſt becauſe men take
themſelves to be puniſhed in their families and friends ruine:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the feare of that may help to antidote them againſt the
ſinne of neglect, and provoke them to the utmoſt of duty; God
both threatens ever, and puniſhes ſometimes the families, and
friends, as well as themſelves. And ſo I have diſpatched the
doctrinall part of this point alſo. I come now to a joynt Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of all the three points together, which will afford a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Uſe. 1. Of Examination. 2. Of ſpeciall and re-inforced
Humiliation. 3. Of Exhortation. All which have relation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

to Reformation and amendment, ſpecially the more

whom we ought in this caſe to be moſt jealoufly inquiſitive
even more then we need be of others; and yet thoſe that are
publike perſons (whether Miniſters or Magiſtrates) ſeeing wrath
upon a Nation, and ſo ſetting upon a Reformation, of neceſſity,
ought to make as much enquiry after others alſo, within their
ſpheares, as they can. But let me ſpeak chiefly to every ones
conſcience for themſelves in particular.</p>
            <p>Herein according to the help we might and ſhould have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded,

very much, though they have not yet altogether ventured ſo
much as others: ſo it may <hi>condemne</hi> thoſe greatly, that may ſeem
to have done a great deal. If any thinks what he hath done or
ventured for the Church, <hi>a great deale;</hi> ſo as he grudges and
ſhrinkes at any more offered to be cald for, what need ſoever
there may be: If any man think <hi>ought leſſe then all,</hi> enough, he

<note n="1" place="margin">Profeſſed Libertines.</note>1. Some there are, I am afraid too many, that are as far from
<hi>helping the Church</hi> againſt ſin by their <hi>examples</hi> in the leaſt, as
the <hi>profeſſed enemies</hi> are from helping her againſt their <hi>own compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi>
There are men who in ſtead of profeſſing <hi>godlineſſe,</hi> (which
yet in ſpight of their hearts, their very baptiſme and name of

they may and doe know their own <hi>practiſes,</hi> yet I wiſh that
they would but even this day, and this houre, by light of the
former Doctrines and Reaſons examine <hi>the guilt</hi> of thoſe <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
and the diſpleaſure that hangs over their heads, even for the
<hi>miſchiefe done to the Church</hi> and Nation hereby, <hi>in ſtead of the

            <p>
               <note n="2" place="margin">Scandalous Profeſſors of Religion.</note>2. A ſecond ſort no leſſe guilty, if not rather more (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

whom you repreſent, and of former Parliaments, whom you
ſucceed, to be humbled for, namely ſuch, and ſo many, as you
did, or could take notice of. But you had not then any actions
of your own, as a joynt body, to conſider, whether there were
any failings in you; as now after many dayes, and moneths,

that you may finde failings in ſome things, in ſo long

charge you with enough, with multitudes. I dare not ſecond

it is poſſible, you may have had failings, of ſome kinde or other.

<hi>And wherefore?</hi> I am far from ſaying, from thinking, <hi>that it is
not for my ſins,</hi> and all the reſt of ours, the people of the Land. (Oh
that our hearts could weep and bleed for it as we ought!) I know
and acknowledge, they are <hi>our ſins,</hi> that are puniſhed, if you

of His in Authority, they continuing ſteadily faithfull,</hi> I know
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſuffered much <hi>reproach,</hi> and was often endangered by the
<hi>peoples</hi> rebelling againſt him. But God <hi>inſtantly</hi> ſtill pleaded his
cauſe, and ended all. Alſo, ſo long as <hi>David</hi> kept his integrity,
he never had any <hi>defeat,</hi> in any battell; nor did <hi>any Enemy prevail
ſo as to diſtreſſe him</hi> at any time: But after his <hi>great fault,</hi> and

by <hi>Abſoloms</hi> conſpiracy, driving him almoſt out of his
Kingdome. And ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> while he kept cloſe to God, had no
Adverſary <hi>at home or abroad:</hi> But after his wives turning away
his heart, to countenance (at leaſt) their Idols, he had more then
one, that <hi>lifted up their hands</hi> againſt him. Think now how much
your <hi>Adverſaries</hi> and their <hi>Succeſſes</hi> call you to an enquiry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
your ſelves, <hi>why God ſhould let them attempt and prevail ſo far

to his remembrance; and then upon ſearch, he found <hi>Idols</hi> too,
that he before took no notice of, or at leaſt winkt at. So, <hi>David</hi>
failed in the manner of <hi>bringing up the Ark,</hi> (and the Prieſts,
Levites, and Elders of the people were in the ſame errour with
him;) and recovered not himſelf to ſee where the fault was in

to ſet about <hi>the building of the Temple,</hi> even though God
the while ſent divers judgements upon all the Nation for it.
All theſe inſtances ſtill make it the more neceſſary to have this
ſeriouſly laid to your hearts, that God may have the glory he
looks for from you, and that whatſoever you can find amiſſe, you
may the more zealouſly ſet your ſelves to make him (not <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi>
which Jeſus Chriſt only can; and hath done ſufficiently,
but) ſuch <hi>amends</hi> as poor creatures and his faithfull ſervants are

two farther? To propound according to the ſubject of my text,
that it is ſpecially requiſite, that you conſider, <hi>whether you have

in two words, concerning the <hi>execution of Iustice</hi> upon the

ſpared?</hi> For which their party hath well requited you ever ſince;
and ſo have others too, for all your gentleneſſe to many deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

               <hi>whether there be

3. Nor yet, whether in <hi>the next generation,</hi> when we have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

may not be <hi>ſuch a revolt</hi> from the truth and prevailing of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

4. But in brief the queſtion is, <hi>Whether the preſent dangers of the

in this Nation, by killing many, and driving away the

yeers</hi> together there ſhall be no <hi>ſhew</hi> or ſign of any <hi>number</hi> of the
true Religion? <hi>or whether they ſhall and at last, in a peacefull and
happy Reformation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to this I give a twofold anſwer. 1. That I grant we
have <hi>no ſuch promiſe</hi> to our Church of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſwered part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Negatively.</note> as the people of the
<hi>Jewes</hi> were in <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of at this time that the text ſpeaks of,
and ever before Chriſt was born;<note place="margin">No ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as the Jews had.</note> which yet was to them not as
<hi>inhabitants</hi> of that land, of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but as to the ſtock of <hi>Abraham,
Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacab.</hi> No Nation or <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of any land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <hi>ſtock of
the Gentiles,</hi> having any ſuch promiſes, that the Church of God
ſhould not be deſtroyed and ceaſe among them.</p>
            <p>2. Yet for all that I am perſwaded and <hi>doe beleeve, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have I ſpoken</hi> and doe ſpeak,<note place="margin">Poſitively, yet a ſufficient promiſe at this time.</note> that there is <hi>a ſufficient promiſe
for us Engliſh men at this time, that the Church of God in England
ſhall not be ſo deſtroyed or roated out, as that the true Religion and all
the faithful Profeſſours ſhould be dead and buried, as the effects of this
preſent warre.</hi> But contrarily, that ſuch a Deliverance ſhal come,
as that this Church in the iſſue of theſe preſent troubles, ſhall
get the upper hand, and enjoy a bleſſed Reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My grounds are theſe.</hi> 1. Though we have not a <hi>Formall</hi>
promiſe of Deliverance,<note place="margin">Grounds.</note> yet we may have (and have as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
a <hi>Virtualt;</hi> and though not a plain <hi>verball</hi> one, yet a <hi>reall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. When we have an <hi>example</hi> of Deliverance vouchrſaſed to
others, <hi>very like to us</hi> in condition; I take it to be a <hi>Virtuall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi>
of like favour to our ſelves,<note place="margin">By example particular.</note> So much faith <hi>Naamans</hi> little
maid had, that becauſe <hi>Eliſha</hi> had done many <hi>miracles,</hi> he could
and would cure her Maſter of his <hi>Leproſie, 2 Kings</hi> 5. 3. (even

                  <hi>Doct. 5. Application.</hi> Enquiry after a promiſe for our Church.</note>though he <hi>never had cured</hi> any of that particular diſeaſe of the
Leproſie, which is moſt remarkably inſinuated, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 20.)
And doubtleſſe Chriſts curing the <hi>woman of the bloody iſſue,</hi> was
by him meant as a <hi>virtuall</hi> promiſe, that he would revive <hi>Jairus
daughter, Mark</hi> 5. Indeed, becauſe diverſity in the perſons may
very much vary the caſe, therefore <hi>examples</hi> are in the <hi>lowest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi>
of virtuall promiſes, and yet they are not <hi>nothing,</hi> According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is not <hi>nothing,</hi> that God in a <hi>very like caſe</hi> (liker then either
of thoſe now noted) hath granted deliverance to <hi>Scotland.</hi> It is,
at leaſt <hi>probable,</hi> that he meant that, as a <hi>virtuall</hi> promiſe to
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note n="3" place="margin">No Church more ſeverely dealt with then the word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes.</note>3. But I take it for a much <hi>ſtronger</hi> ground, and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted;
<hi>That the word of God, in the Story, and in the threatnings
together, hath an epitome of all that God will do to his Church, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in my Nation.</hi> And that God will never deal more ſeverely
with any Nationall Church, then his Word (<hi>which is every way
moſt perfect)</hi> relates or threatens. Therefore if it cannot be found
in the Scripture, that God did <hi>ever bring deſtruction upon his
Church planted in a Nation,</hi> or tranſplant his Church wholly out
of ſuch a Land, <hi>while they were in ſuch a condition as ours is,</hi> then
will he not do it now. But contrarily, if he hath <hi>alwayes,</hi> in ſuch
<hi>a caſe</hi> as ours is <hi>now,</hi> afforded his Church deliverance, this I
beleeve to be a <hi>very ſtrong promiſe,</hi> that he will afford us the like
now. <hi>Logicians</hi> ſay, that even one <hi>example</hi> of a thing, and <hi>no
inſtance</hi> to the contrary, is a <hi>ſufficient</hi> argument. And if it hold
not in <hi>Scripture examples,</hi> (when none of a divers kinde can be
produced) I know not what uſe can be made of the <hi>greateſt</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of mercy, <hi>as meer examples,</hi> which yet were all <hi>written
for our learning,</hi> (as all Scriptures are) <hi>that we through patience and
comfort of the Scriptures might have hope,</hi> Rom. 15. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="4" place="margin">A reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church never wholly tranſplanted.</note>4. In ſpeciall, <hi>If God did never deſtroy a Reforming Nation,
never wholly transplant a Reforming Church; then will he not do ſo
to us, becauſe we are ſuch.</hi> And for this there is ſpeciall Reaſon,
whether we conſider the Reformation to be the <hi>speciall work of
God, and little of the Nation in it;</hi> as in <hi>Joſiahs</hi> time, God wrought
it by a ſpeciall work upon the King, who ſaw all done <hi>himſelf,</hi>
and the people ſhewed <hi>little, concurrence</hi> in it; yet God would,
and did carry it through. Becauſe he that loved the people ſo wel,

himſelf, when he had begun it once, would make <hi>ſomewhat</hi> of

the reformation</hi> much by the <hi>peoples hands,</hi> as it was in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi>
Reformation, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 1. Here again the ſame reaſon holds.
He who loved the Nation ſo well, as to put ſuch a <hi>beginning</hi> of
grace into them, would not let that fail ſuddenly. But he made
the work <hi>prosper</hi> in their hands,<note place="margin">The grounds applied,</note> and no enemie hindred them.</p>
            <p>And now to apply this to our ſelves:<note n="1" place="margin">We are a reforming Church in all parts of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> 
               <hi>If ever a Nation, or

            </p>
            <p>From all which, my Concluſions are three. Firſt, <hi>This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a time of Jacobs trouble, but he ſhall be delivered out of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The longer deliverance is delayed,</hi> and the <hi>lower we are brought,</hi>
before we obtain Reformation, the <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>glorious,</hi>
will the one and the other be, when the full time comes.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Who ever abuſes this to careleſſe neglect, is like never to ſee it,
or enjoy the good of it, but they and theirs to be deſtroyed,</hi> according
to the Text.</p>
            <p>But I muſt anſwer an Objection or two. Firſt,<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note>1. <hi>In ſtead of a
Reformation</hi> (ſay ſome) <hi>we ſee nothing but Deformation.</hi> All in
Confuſion, our Reformers, unreformed in life and opinion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled
in their fancies, and wayes. Hereſies, Schiſmes; and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiniſme
abound.</p>
            <p>This is the worſt can be ſaid;<note place="margin">Answer.</note> Yet may be ſatisfied divers
wayes.<note n="1" place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>1.It was ever ſo, where Reformation was working:</hi> So

at liberty, all appear in their worſt Poſture, (yet there are many
ſober ſtill and pious undeniably) <hi>and moſt of them will be ſoon

<note n="4" place="margin">4.</note>4. God ſeemes on purpoſe to <hi>prolong the warre,</hi> to cut off many,
that would <hi>abuſe a peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt earneſt for Reformation (ſay others) are ſo <hi>divided</hi>
in opinions,<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> as they will never <hi>agree,</hi> and ſo all will come to
<hi>nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is alſo a great grief and danger.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>

Aſſembly</hi> through Gods bleſſing, <hi>may be,</hi> and will be, <hi>a happy

bid them, <hi>Pray, pray, and not propheſie.</hi>
               <note n="2" place="margin">2.</note>2. Since <hi>they all</hi> (and all
that pretend to Reformation) <hi>profeſſe to hold to the Word;</hi> when
things come to be <hi>debated by the Word,</hi> there will, I doubt not, be
found <hi>more agreement</hi> in the iſſue, then any one thought of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
or at leaſt, a <hi>modeſt reſolution</hi> not to diſturb the Churches

            <p>But what ſay you to the <hi>killing of the two Witneſſes?</hi> May not
that be to come,<note place="margin">

Namely, by ſaying—<note n="2" place="margin">2.</note> 2.<hi>If this be the time of their killing, ere
this warre end;</hi> then is my <hi>confidence</hi> moſt certain, and we have
<hi>a moſt full verball promiſe,</hi> (which is more then I ſaid before)
<hi>That England ſhall not quite loſe the Gospel, nor the Church, at this

            <p>The phraſe in the Text, <hi>Who knows?</hi> is uſuall in Scripture,
to ſignifie <hi>great hope,</hi> if not altogether <hi>certainty, Jonah 3. 9. Joel</hi>

                  <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. From Gods wiſdome.</note>1. <hi>God is moſt wiſe, and doth nothing in vain.</hi> Now it would
at leaſt <hi>ſeem</hi> to be in vain, that when a work <hi>is to be done,</hi> He

               <note place="margin">Though he caſt aſide warping Inſtruments ſometimes.</note> or grow <hi>crooked,</hi> He may with <hi>apparent wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>

be <hi>humble,</hi> and aſcribe nothing <hi>to themſelves</hi> of their fitneſſe,
ſtrength, or ſucceſſe, but <hi>all to God.</hi> 2. And that thoſe that
look at the moſt hopefull inſtruments, ſhould not <hi>idolize</hi> them,
and forget God, by <hi>truſting</hi> too much in them, or <hi>applying</hi> our
ſelves to them too much, (<hi>neglecting God</hi>) as we are greatly apt
to do. But if they <hi>perſevere in faithfulneſſe,</hi> no reaſon can (by
us at leaſt) be conceived, why God ſhould refuſe to uſe them,
in that work which is to be done certainly; namely, the help of
his Church <hi>in desperate dangers.</hi>

in him.</hi> He is not <hi>weary</hi> of an inſtrument, which he hath
<hi>long</hi> uſed, much leſſe when the <hi>great time of uſing</hi> them comes.
Onely (as before) he will not have any think <hi>him tied</hi> to any
that ſhall carry themſelves untowardly, ſpecially <hi>in any viſible

               <note place="margin">Greatly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry failings.</note> And yet he alſo vouchſafes ſometimes to <hi>overlook</hi> a

Jeſus</hi>) yet raiſing up <hi>Joſhuah</hi> in his ſtead, he carries him through
the work, though <hi>he alſo had his failing,</hi> in not ſearching in time
for <hi>Achan.</hi> So after God had caſt off <hi>Saul,</hi> he ſo aſſiſts <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
(notwithſtanding his failings alſo) as when he died, <hi>Iſrael</hi>
was delivered from all enemies round about, <hi>and no adverſary
left unſubdued, 1 King.</hi> 5.3,4. And ſo after he had the ſecond
time ſet on <hi>Zerubbabell,</hi> and <hi>Jeſhua,</hi> upon the work of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
(<hi>after their long lingring</hi>) he carries it on by their hands,
and ſo <hi>promiſed them, Hag. 2.4. Zach.</hi> 4.7.9. And ſpecially,
having raiſed up faithfull <hi>Nehemiah</hi> extraordinarily, (who yet
acknowledges he had need of <hi>ſparing, according to the greatneſſe
of Gods mercy, Neh.</hi> 13. 22.) he was <hi>continually</hi> with him, and

to revive, unite, and ſtrengthen his people. <hi>The faith</hi> of the

that delay in <hi>Joſhua's</hi> time, was plainly for want of <hi>enquiry after

The Church is to be helped againſt them, which cannot be, if
you fear or favour them. Once more therefore let me remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you of <hi>your engagements moſt ſolemnly</hi> made in your former
<hi>Proteſtation</hi> and late <hi>Covenant</hi> about this; and to aſſure you, that
<hi>God will certainly require both the one and the other,</hi>
               <note place="margin">But keep to the Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> of you. You
have heard that founding word, (even out of this place) <hi>I will
bring a ſword upon you, which ſhall avenge the quarrels of my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
Lev.</hi> 26. 25. Take heed of that, You <hi>have had</hi> great help
by the <hi>Peoples cleaving</hi> to you, according to their <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> and
<hi>look</hi> for more by this <hi>Covenant.</hi> I beſeech you, <hi>doe not forfeit all,</hi>
by failing of your part. As you deal, <hi>you muſt expect to be dealt</hi>
with herein. Which however it would be <hi>ſinfull in them</hi> that
ſhould break <hi>their</hi> obligation, though <hi>you</hi> ſhould break <hi>yours;</hi> yet
would it be <hi>moſt juſt with God.</hi> Let me then <hi>pray</hi> you in his name
(who may command you,) that when ever we ſhall be ſo happy,
as that it is ſeaſonable to <hi>treat</hi> again,<note place="margin">Specially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with them in any Treaty.</note> 
               <hi>that you admit not, much leſſe

carefully, how <hi>they</hi> and any <hi>motion</hi> agree, and keep to your <hi>rules.</hi>
Having <hi>ſuch clauſes,</hi> as they have, you will find them to afford
<hi>juſt Liberty</hi> enough: But in the reſidue to be more <hi>unalterable to
you,</hi> or by you, <hi>then the Lawes of the Medes and Perſians.</hi> I am
no <hi>Iudge,</hi> nor ever <hi>ſhall be,</hi> nor ever <hi>deſire</hi> to be, what is the

not. And next, <hi>conſult</hi> not onely with <hi>your own</hi> ſafeties, but all
<hi>theirs</hi> you are entruſted with. The <hi>Land,</hi> the Church, <hi>Religion,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And now if you will be reſolute, and faithfull to God, and
for God, and his people, I am <hi>ſo far aſſured</hi> of your ſafety and

to read the <hi>victories</hi> Gods people obtained <hi>in the Old Teſtament,</hi>
who yet were not without <hi>ſome failings,</hi> but the beſt of them,
men <hi>ſubject to like paſſions</hi> as we are; and ſo it was the Covenant
