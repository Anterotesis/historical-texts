            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I was invited by you to Preach
this Sermon, so I am now deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by your Desires to Print
it: and do esteem it a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that I was made choice of
by you, to do at once both a great
Iustice to the Dead, and I hope some good to the
Living, at least, by that part of it which relates to
your Worthy Father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42435:3"/>
Excellent Patterns afford great Instruction: and
it is the more necessary to propose them to the Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of others, in an Age in which, while we are
disputing so hotly about Opinions and Forms, the
Power and Life of Religion is like to wear out of
the World: and so few instances of it appear, that
no wonder Atheists take great advantages from thence,
to perswade their weak and lewd followers, that none
believe inwardly what they outwardly profess: and
upon this account, we have great reason to make
the most we can of all those living arguments that
have been among us of the efficacy and amiableness of
true Religion.</p>
            <p>When I received from you some informations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
your dead Father, I perceived your chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
was, to have only so much told of him, as
might preserve a just character of him to posterity;
and particularly, for those descended from him: so
as it might either engage them to follow his steps and
imitate his Vertues; or remain as a witness against
them, if they should decline from that good way which
he both living and dying, has so earnestly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to you and them. But I found you had no
mind to have his praises raised to any indecent
pitch, or to have any thing said, that savoured of
vanity; but that his Funeral Sermon should be as
free from these, as his Life was; and that it
<pb facs="tcp:42435:3"/>
should so far resemble him, as that it should be all to
edification, and therefore that nothing should be put
in it for pomp or shew. In this, your inclinations
agreeing so much with my own, it was easie for
me, to observe this part of your desires very exactly:
and I was very glad to find most of the Hearers
agreed with me in that which in the beginning of his
Character I say I expected from them; that they
would think I had rather said too little, than too
much.</p>
            <p>I hope he shall still live in you all, and that you
shall happily reverse the Fable of the multiplication
of the <hi>Hydra</hi>'s head, seven shooting out, for one
that was cut off; so I am confident that we shall have
now in you, seven Heirs to your Fathers Vertues and
true Piety, and that every one of you will with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous,
yet kind emulation, study who shall come
nearest that shining example which he set you: for
which you shall never want the Prayers of,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HINGS that are very unusual
and strike upon our minds by
reason of their novelty, do
commonly attract our eyes,
and fix our attention: New
sights work somewhat on
most people, and a great deal on the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
sort. Men of remote Nations or Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Productions are run after and gazed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42435:5"/>
upon: but the proper subject on which every
wise man fixes his thoughts, is that which
can afford him such Instructions, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
wiser and better by his observations:
and indeed I am sorry to add, that there
are so few of those objects, that if a desire
to learn from them, does not work much
on us, yet meer curiosity might produce
more than ordinary care to observe them:
for we do not see such sights every day.</p>
            <p>We meet with crouds of fools and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
of corrupt and crooked men every
where, but for the <hi>perfect and upright man</hi> we
may be justly called upon,<note place="margin">Jer. 5. 1.</note> as <hi>Ieremy</hi> did on the
People of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to <hi>run to and fro through
the streets, and to see and know and seek in the
broad places thereof</hi> (somewhat like Exchanges
or Market-places) <hi>if we can find such a man,
if there be any that executeth judgement and seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the truth.</hi> If I tell you, that he who is to
be the subject of a great part of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
was such a man, I hope it may be
of some use, to let you see in what things
this Character agreed to him; though it
comes with this melancholy diminution, that
he <hi>was</hi> and <hi>is</hi> no more among us. The
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42435:5"/>
Prophet promises in the Name of God, that
upon their finding such a one, <hi>he would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
Ierusalem.</hi> But though upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
we cannot make that comfortable infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
from the discovery we are now about,
yet if the observing what he was, does in
any measure dispose us to imitate him, then
we may hope for a National Pardon, upon
yet more certain grounds, unless our sins
are grown to that pitch, that <hi>God will not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
them,</hi> and that good men among us shall
only be able to <hi>deliver their own souls,</hi> when
the Day of our Visitation shall come upon
us; which indeed does not seem to be very
far from us.</p>
            <p>But I shall prepare you for what I am to say
concerning this <hi>perfect and upright man,</hi> by
considering first the importance of the words
which I have read to you. There is a great
variety among the several Translations of
them, which make them have very different
senses. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> as it is pointed in our
Bibles, is rendred exactly in our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but the Seventy Interpreters have read
it otherwise, which in <hi>English</hi> is exactly this,
<hi>keep innocence and behold uprightness, for there is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42435:6"/>
a remnant to the peaceable man.</hi> They are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the Vulgar. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
renders them thus, <hi>Keep integrity and
behold uprightness, for the end of man is peace.</hi>
The <hi>Syriack</hi> has it thus, <hi>Observe sincerity, and
chuse uprightness, for there is a good end to the
man of peace.</hi> The <hi>Arabick</hi> is thus rendred,
<hi>Keep meekness, and thou shalt see uprightness; for
there will be an end to the peaceable man.</hi> We
see all these Translators have read the words
rendred in our Bibles <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> so,
that they did not understand them of an
<hi>upright</hi> and <hi>perfect man,</hi> but of <hi>uprightness</hi> and
<hi>perfection</hi> in the abstract; which the same
words a little varied in the pointing do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
signifie. The word rendred by us
<hi>mark,</hi> they have rendred <hi>keep,</hi> which it does
strictly signifie; and because what we <hi>mark</hi>
we keep in our memory, therefore it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
used in that sense. The word rendred
<hi>latter end</hi> does also sometimes signifie a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
because it is given at the latter end of
the performance of that for which it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised;
and so the sense will be much the
same, whether it be rendred thus, <hi>There will be
a reward at last for the men of peace,</hi> or the
<hi>latter end of that man is peace.</hi> Thus I have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42435:6"/>
shewed the different wayes of reading and
rendring these words; and in discoursing of
them, I shall consider them in all these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
senses which we see have been put on
them, and shall speak to these particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. I shall shew you, what is meant by
<hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>uprightness,</hi> or by the
<hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>upright man.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. I shall shew, how we are to <hi>keep</hi> and
observe those Vertues, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
we ought to have for such as
are eminent for them.</item>
               <item>3. I shall shew, what is the happy end
and conclusion of them, and of those
that possess them.</item>
               <item>And then I shall come to the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the occasion of our present
assembly.</item>
            </list>
            <p>To return:</p>
            <p>First, By <hi>perfection,</hi> we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
either such essential perfection as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
only to that eternal being in strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42435:7"/>
of speech; nor such a perfection as we
hope for in another state; but only such
a perfection as makes any thing compleat in
its kind; that is, such a soundness in the
faculties and powers of a mans soul, as makes
him an entire man, that is, one that is truly
a reasonable creature, acted and guided by
reason. All that belongs to a thinking na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is a clearness of understanding and
judging, an obsequiousness in the will to
the dictates of an enlightned mind, and a
disposition to consider things carefully, which
is the chief and best exercise of the freedom
of the will; together with the regulation
of a mans inward affections and passions,
and the conduct of his actions. He that has
a considerable soundness in every one of
these, is <hi>perfect</hi> in those parts that may be
said to compose a rational nature: But in all
these there are different degrees: some men
have a greater extent of knowledge than
others, though many of the pretenders to it,
are too often employed about things that
are either impertinent or hurtful to them:
but every one may be called perfect in his
knowledge, who rightly apprehends and
judges well those things which relate to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42435:7"/>
himself, who has his mind raised towards
the best objects, and possessed with deep
impressions of God and true goodness, and
the rewards of another state: and the more
deeply he considers these things, and the
more frequently he reflects on them, he is so
much the more <hi>perfect,</hi> how little soever he
may know or relish those vain and empty
Notions, which many magnifie as the highest
flights of knowledge. Again, he who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes
the powers of his will, and his facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of choice, or liberty to turn his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to the best objects, and breaks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
either of an obstinate and ungoverned
stiffness, or of a sluggish faintness and feeble
easiness, and attains to a due firmness in his
resolutions, and a stability in his purposes,
avoiding the extreams of being too perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory,
or too yielding, is also <hi>perfect</hi> in this part
of a rational nature; and if this temper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
in the main current of a mans life, he
may be well accounted a <hi>perfect man,</hi> though
in some particulars and upon some occasions
he leaves it behind him.</p>
            <p>As for a mans passions and affections,
he that resists their fury, and brings him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42435:8"/>
to an habitual calmness and gentleness,
that is not sudden and violent, but deliberate
and composed, that observes the weak sides
of his constitution, and keeps himself at
as great a distance as he can from that
which may inflame him too much, that
endeavours to raise his affections to the best
objects, which make him strong against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
objects and weak assaults, he that
has learn't to make a right estimate and
value of things, and studies to poise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
so that none of the various accidents of
life may very much alter him, that keeps
a watchful eye upon himself, and is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of every thing that is apt to heat him
too much, this is a <hi>perfect man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not think a man unless he be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
stupid, can really be perfectly the
same in all the turns of his life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am very apt to conclude, that the
pretensions of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> in this matter,
were either only extravagant boastings and
vain affectations, or that they first brought
their minds by a long constraint to a heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and dulness, by which the active pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of their souls were in a great measure
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42435:8"/>
enervated and stupified. That quickness of
thought or acrimony in the mind which is
called <hi>affection</hi> or <hi>passion,</hi> is often necessary
to animate us to great undertakings, and
to support us in difficult performances: and
if a man could so far prevail on himself, as
to root it out of his mind, it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
enable him to suffer uneasie things
with less pain, but it would mightily emas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
the vigour of his active powers. So
I conclude, a <hi>perfect man</hi> is he that cools
his passions, and governs his affections, and
not he that roots them out entirely.</p>
            <p>The last and most visible branch of this
perfection, is a good and wise conduct of a
mans actions: he that considers well the
station that God has set him in, and the
relation in which he stands, to the rest of
mankind, together with the duties incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on him, and acts prudently and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly,
that governs his tongue, so as
not to give advantages against himself, nor
to make enemies needlesly, that guides his
affairs with discretion, that orders his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with prudent care and foresight, that
lives to the good of mankind, that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42435:9"/>
himself born not only for himself,
but for the publick good, and therefore layes
himself out to do all the good that he
can, first by his own example and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<hi>that</hi> may have on the world, and
then by instructing, admonishing and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
those that are under his authority or
influence, and is ready to assist, advise and
relieve those that are in any difficulty, or
stand in need of any thing that he can spare,
this is the <hi>perfect man;</hi> and that temper is
the <hi>perfection</hi> which we are to observe or
<hi>keep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not raise the notion of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
too high, lest any should be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
from endeavouring to attain to it; nor
let it fall too low, lest some may come too
easily to imagine they are already perfect.
It's good to have such high and great no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Vertue as are on the one hand apt
to excite a generous temper of mind in us;
and yet on the other hand, are not impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable
Idea's, which subsist only in the
imaginations of high-flown men. A man
that has all these in a good and solid mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
is a <hi>perfect man,</hi> and a <hi>perfectly religious
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42435:9"/>
man,</hi> though he has not yet attained to such
degrees in every one of them, as he may
hope to grow up to, after some years pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency.
Single instances and errors now
and then may fall out, and yet he remain
still a <hi>perfect man:</hi> for we are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
a distinction between a perfection of
parts, and a perfection in degrees: as a
man in relation to his body is a perfect man,
if he has all the Vitals within, and all the
Organs and Members without, that belong
to the structure of his Body, though there
is not in all that exact symmetry of parts,
nor that agreeableness in every one of
them.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>uprightness</hi> or the <hi>upright man,</hi> the
true Notion of this will be easier formed,
and the sooner dispatched. <hi>Uprightness</hi> is
an exact correspondency between a mans
thoughts and his words and actions, when
a man is possessed with such a candour and
probity of mind, that he lyes under no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to disguise or dissemble his thoughts,
so that integrity and truth is that to which he
trusts,<note place="margin">Psal. 25. 22.</note> as knowing it <hi>will preserve him;</hi> and
therefore concludes, that he <hi>who walks uprightly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 9.</note>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:42435:10"/>
               <hi>walks surely:</hi> when a man is so far raised
above the World, that neither a desire to
recommend himself to any, by abject flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
nor to make unreasonable gains in his
dealings, can work on him, so as to say
any thing otherwise than as he thinks, he is
an upright man, and such as alwayes <hi>speaks
the truth as it is in his heart.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 15. 2.</note> This straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of soul, supposes many things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to prepare a man to it: he must be both
innocent and humble, moderate in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
and free from covetousness: for any
of all these things will make a man warp
insensibly, and bend into some crooked
postures, which after a long bending, will
grow to be so strangely rooted, that
that which <hi>is crooked cannot be made straight:</hi>
and when a man lets his integrity once
go, the fears of a discovery, together with
the other ill consequences of it, and that
fatal train that is in ill actions, by which
one draws on another, will make it much
harder to recover it, than it is at first to
maintain it. And if a man can once so
far prevail over those honest and candid
dispositions that are in him, as to let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
cool and sleep and go on, in any thing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42435:10"/>
that is indirect or disingenious, he will
come to be so fortified against those ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesses
and awakenings of Conscience,
that he is in a probable way of growing
up to any pitch of wickedness to which he
may be tempted.</p>
            <p>And thus I have considered the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of this Character, the <hi>perfect and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
man,</hi> or <hi>perfection and uprightness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come next to the Second Particular, which
is the observation and regard we ought to
have to such persons or such a temper.
We ought to <hi>mark</hi> them well; to consider
what they offer for our imitation, and to
keep well in our memory that instruction
which their example affords: and as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them, so as to learn from them, so
we ought to carry in our minds such a sense
of their Vertues, as to make us esteem them
highly while they live, and pay all due
honour to their memories when they are
dead.</p>
            <p>First, We are so to <hi>mark</hi> them as to learn
from them, and are to lay up in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42435:11"/>
what we have observed in them;
and thus we may both mark the <hi>perfect man,</hi>
and preserve or keep up that same temper in
our selves: There is no way more effectual
to the study of Vertue, than the observing
the excellent patterns that good men set us.
In them Vertue appears cloathed with all
those circumstances, that may both represent
it more amiable, and make it be more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imitated by us. The abstracted and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical
Idea's of Vertue are indeed very
beautiful and convincing to them that can
frame them right, and pursue and apply them
well; but every man has not that strength
of apprehension, and clearness of judgement
that is necessary for this: and general rules
are so diversified by various circumstances,
that every one has not a faculty of applying
them to the several actions and in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
turns of life: and therefore when God
was to instruct mankind in the excellentest
way of Religion that was ever proposed,
which was delivered in the greatest simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of expression that was possible, he set at
the same time before us the perfectest pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
that ever was.<note place="margin">John 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>The Word was made flesh
and dwelt among men:</hi> and the greatest part
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42435:11"/>
of the Gospels consists rather of a Narrative
of his holy and exemplary Life, than of an
exact system of his Precepts: for the one is
contained and delivered in the other. In
him we see those shining Vertues of Patience,
Contempt of the World, Humility, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Submission to the Will of God, Zeal
for his Glory, and an unwearied readiness
to do good, which could not be overcome
by the most ungrateful and injurious returns
that were possible.</p>
            <p>There is this difference between that and all
other patterns, that we cannot exceed in
our exactness of imitating it: whereas we
may grow affectate and apish in imitating
any other pattern. The best men have their
defects and failings, which made St. <hi>Paul</hi>
restrain and limit our being <hi>followers</hi> of the
Apostles themselves, by this Caution,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 1.</note> 
               <hi>as they
were followers of Christ.</hi> There are also par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
humours in very good men, which
do well enough in them, being natural to
them, and being set off with many other
excellencies that are in them; but these being
more visible and coming under more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
observation, some vain and foolish
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42435:12"/>
persons hoping to be thought like those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
persons, by an affectation of some
Gestures and Customs that were peculiar
to them, make themselves thereby the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the scorn of the Wise and Judicious.
We are to observe what is truly excellent
and useful in those whom we have known,
and as to small matters, we are still to do
that which is most natural, and has least of
constraint in it.</p>
            <p>It is a great blessing for one, especially
in his young and tender years, in which
he is scarce capable of any thing but imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
to have this easie and profitable
way of instruction offered to him: and
every one is to consider, that this will be
put to their account, and that they have
a great deal to answer for on this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
If Divine Providence was thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand
with them, and laid such a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
in their way so early, that good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
did prevent all bad ones, then what
a heavy charge will it be, if they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to blot all these out, and to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induce
bad ones?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:42435:12"/>
But as we owe our selves the good Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this way of Instruction, so we owe
those Persons, to whom the Characters in my
Text agree, great esteem and reverence as long
as they live, and all due respect when they are
dead. We ought to look on them <hi>as burning and
shining Lights, and are to rejoice in their Light:</hi> we
ought to consider them as the <hi>Salt,</hi> the <hi>Light,</hi>
and the <hi>Pillars of the Earth:</hi> we do not know
how much we owe them for the lengthning out
of our Tranquillity, their very being in the
World may be a mean to suspend such Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in which they might be involved, and
their Prayers and Intercessions have certainly
great Efficacy; so that every time we see such
a Person, it should rejoyce our Heart, and we
should conclude there goes one of the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and Supporters of the Nation, if not of the
World; for when the number of the Elect is
accomplished, then the rest are not to expect
those common Favours of Day and Night, of
Times and Seasons, of Sun-shine and Rain, in
which the wicked share more for their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hood
to good Men, than upon their own
account. We are to do nothing to grieve them,
nor to make those Lives that are so usefull to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42435:13"/>
us, uncomfortable to themselves. Every Man
is to consider a truly Good Man as his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
and as a sort of a Father to him: but
those who receive a more immediate Blessing
from them, owe greater returns of tender Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and reverent Duty.</p>
            <p>When they die, we are not to afflict our
selves with an unmanly Sorrow, especially if
they have lived out their course, and die in a
good old Age, full of Dayes, and full of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
but the true Decencies and Solemnities of
a Religious Mourning require better and more
useful Exercises. Those more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in them, ought to reflect on their Lives,
and gather, as the remains of a Shipwrack, all
that was memorable in them; that so that
which Humility and Modesty required should
be kept secret while they lived, may be then
published to the honour of Religion, and for
the instruction of others; and in particular to
be a Remembrance to those relating to them, or
descended from them. And, above all things,
when such are withdrawn, who, as may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
supposed, were a publick Blessing to
the Nation, those who survive, especially such
as do more immediately fill up their room in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42435:13"/>
respects, ought to set themselves with all
possible care to make up that Loss to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
and so endeavour to imitate, and as much
as they can to out do them (for in such a Case,
Emulation even with ones Father is a Vertue)
in all those excellent things in which they were
a Pattern to them, and a Blessing to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or place where they lived. Thus, if we so
mark <hi>Perfect and Upright Men,</hi> as to keep the
like temper in our selves, then we fully comply
with the Duty in my Text.</p>
            <p>The third Particular is the happy End and
Conclusion of those Vertues, and of them that
possess them. What ever the exact rendring of
these Words may be, of which I made mention
in the beginning of this Discourse, it comes all
to one purpose, that either those <hi>Men of Peace</hi>
shall have a <hi>good End,</hi> or that their <hi>End shall be
Peace.</hi> By this <hi>Peace</hi> in their End, we are not
to understand an easie or peaceable Death, tho'
perhaps in the old Dispensation, that consisted
much in Temporal Promises, this might have
been a part of their Reward. But under the
Religion of a Crucified Saviour, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of the Crofs, we are not to promise
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42435:14"/>
our selves an Exemption from uneasy and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things, neither in our lives, nor at our death.
The greatest Glory of the Christian Church
hath been in their Deaths, literally <hi>burning and
shining Lights,</hi> and in those fiery Chariots have
triumphed over the World; and what the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
observed under the Old Testament, is
much oftner verified under the New, that <hi>the
wicked have no Bands in their Death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">73 B. 4.</note> and both
living and dying, seem to have great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
over good and vertuous Men; of <hi>whom, as
the World is not worthy,</hi> so it does not know the
Value it ought to set on them, nor the Use it
ought to make of them: But <hi>verily, there is a
Reward for the Righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 58. 2.</note> because <hi>there is a God
that judgeth in the Earth:</hi> and since he doth not
always give them their Reward in this Life, it is
certain he has provided one for them after it;
and in order to their having a full Reward and
an higher degree of Happiness in the next State,
he does exercise them often very feverely as
to all outward Appearance in this Life.</p>
            <p>But if they have not a great measure of Peace
neither living nor dying; yet upon the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Souls and Bodies they do then <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42435:14"/>
into Peace,</hi> and into <hi>the Ioy of their Lord,</hi> into
those blessed and peaceful Habitations, where
none of those Jars and Contentions with which
this World is exercised, disturb their Rest. No
Disputes about Religion, no Factions of State,
mar that everlasting Quiet,<note place="margin">Ps. 55. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> which they always
enjoy, when they adore the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> and
follow the Lamb, <hi>the Prince of Peace.</hi> The
Contests and Heats now among us must needs
make all the Sons of Peace grow weary; and
wish with the Psalmist, that they had <hi>Wings
like a Dove, so that they might fly away and be at rest,
and hasten their escape from the windy Storm and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest;</hi>
for certainly we are fallen heavily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Curse in the following Words: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy,
O Lord, and divide their Tongues; for I have
seen Violence and Strife in the City:</hi> and when it is
come to that, that to be a Man of <hi>Peace,</hi> is
look'd on as an ill Character, of one that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
luke-warm and indifferent, or is a false,
and temporizing Man, who would not long
for those cool and silent Shades of the Grave,
and for that Peace that is in the Regions beyond
it? And since this is not in a Man's Power to
bring it sooner on him, than as it is ordered by
Divine Appointment, it would at least make a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42435:15"/>
Man seek a retreat in some solitary Place,
where he might neither hear nor see any more
of the disorders and madness of a wicked World,
than were necessary to direct him in his Prayers
and Intercessions: or, if this is likewise denied
one, and that his Station and Circumstances ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
him still to live in the World, it will at
least have this effect on him, to make him have
as little meddling, and to live as much within
himself as he can; and to maintain within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that Peace which he has ineffectually endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to advance in the World: and certainly
when ever Death comes on a good Man, it will
be so much the more welcome to him, because
he can find very little Pleasure in living among
People that seem to have lost both their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and their Wits. Let us raise our Thoughts
and Hopes above this present World, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
our selves, that tho' we live uneasy
here, and tho' we may be perhaps called to end
our Days in a most terrible manner, which may
prove our Punishment for those many Sins, for
which tho' God will be merciful to us with
relation to another State, yet he may think fit
to correct us severely for them in this Life;
yet if we continue so to <hi>mark the perfect
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42435:15"/>
Man, and so behold the Upright,</hi> as to follow
their Steps, then as their <hi>End is Peace,</hi> so shall
ours likewise be.</p>
            <p>I have now gone through those Particulars
which I proposed; the Application is still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind;
and this relates to this sad Occasion that
now calls us together. I am next to tell you
what you are to <hi>mark</hi> in this <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>upright
Man,</hi> who has now <hi>entered into Peace.</hi> But
how should I adventure to speak of one that
lived so long, and in so eminent a Condition
amongst you, of whose Praises you who knew
him are now so full! He that had not that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
must be forgiven, if he doth not describe
him with those Advantages that another might
have, who had observed him long, and had
known him intimately. I will be strictly cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in what I shall say, because I know that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Commendations, which are too ordinary
on these Occasions, have this ill Effect among
many others; that because, perhaps there is a
little too much said, the whole is disbelieved;
and generally those Discourses are considered,
rather as a flattery of the Living, than a peice of
Justice to the Dead. I shall therefore rather
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42435:16"/>
lessen things than enlarge them; and shall tell
you nothing but that of which I have good As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
and that upon such Information that I
have no reason to doubt of it. It is, I confess,
some comfort that I am to speak of a Man that
was well known in this very place, so that I am
perswaded many that hear me, shall say, I have
rather said too little than too much.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Iames Houblon</hi> was descended from that
worthy Confessor, Mr. <hi>Houblon,</hi> a Gentleman
of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who above an hundred Years ago
fled over to <hi>England,</hi> from the Persecution that
was raised there; against all that embraced the
Purity of the Christian Religion, and rejected
the Idolatry and Superstition of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who proceeded in
it with all the Rigor and Cruelty with which
that bloody Religion could inspire a Man of
so fierce a Temper, acting under a King no less
bloody than his Religion; that, as a second
<hi>Herod,</hi> defiled his own House with the Blood
both of a Son and a Wife, and having resolved
to root out of the World the Purity of the
Christian Religion, and to that end having set
up the bloody Tribunals of the Inquisition, he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42435:16"/>
put those Provinces under that implacable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.
Then all that received the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were reduced to those hard Straits, which
how far they are from us, the only wise God
only knows, either to act against their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and worship as a God that which they
believed was but a piece of Bread, the most bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and unaccountable of all the sorts of Idolatry,
or to seal their Faith with their Blood, and that
with all the Preparatives of Torments before
it that merciless Inquisitors could invent, and
in Conclusion, to be burnt at a Stake, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
in such numbers, that no fewer than
18000 were reckoned to have suffered by the
hand of the Executioner in seven Years time, or as
the least dreadful, to sit down with the loss of all
they had, and fly for their Lives to other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
This last being the most eligible, where
it can be done, our Saviour having allowed us,
<hi>when we are persecuted in one City,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 23.</note> 
               <hi>to flee to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
was the choice of that noble Person, who
did by this Action both ennoble himself, and all
that descended from him. It is true, in such
Persecutions every one cannot possibly fly;
tho' this is but a melancholy Comfort, that one
by leaving their Country and Friends, and all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42435:17"/>
they have, may hope to get safe, tho' almost na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
to another Kingdom; yet even this small
Mercy is denied under the Influences of that
cruel Religion. Here in <hi>England</hi> in Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s
Time, the Strangers were suffered to go away,
yet care was taken no secure the Ports, and not
to suffer Natives to fly beyond Sea, when they
were resolved to burn them at home; and
now in <hi>France,</hi> when Methods are taken to
make those of the Reformed Religion, either
die of Famine and in Misery, or to force them
to commit Idolatry, it is made capital to fly, and
those that endeavour it are to be condemned
to the Gallies. But I cannot leave this matter
without encouraging you to go on in your
Charities, and Readiness to releive those that are
forced to come and take Sanctuary among you.
You see what the Nation and this City has
gained by the Reception of the Strangers that
fled hither for refuge in the last Age: You see
how great a Citizen you had in him that is now
dead, and into how many he is now divided,
who by their Interest could almost make a City
alone: and you do not know how many such
may be in the Loins of those that now come
among you, who may produce many to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42435:17"/>
as great Blessings to the next Age, as this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
is to the present. But to return to this
<hi>Upright Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was born in this City, the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1592;
so that he wanted but a few days of being 90
Years of Age when he died. He was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
in the <hi>French</hi> Congregation, and continued
a Member of it his whole Life; he married one
of his own Country-Women, the Daughter of
Mr. <hi>Ducane,</hi> who fled over hither upon the
same account; so that this Family is descended
from Confessors on both sides. He was one
of the chief Pillars of that Congregation, in
which he often served as <hi>Antient,</hi> and to the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of which, and of all the poor Exiles that
came over, he contributed always so liberally,
that if he did not still live in so many Children,
to whom God has given Hearts as well as
Fortunes like his, this loss would be very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
felt. He did communicate once a month
constantly, and was never absent from their
Assemblies either on the Lord's-day or on the
Week-day, and this was become so customary to
him, that it was not without difficulty, that he
was kept from going thither even during his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42435:18"/>
Sickness. He was known to be a very devout
Man and frequent in Prayers, both in publick
and private; he was always breathing out that
deep Sense he had of Religon to those about
him, more particularly to his Children, on
whom, as he took care to have them all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
educated, so as they grew up, he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
still to exhort them to go on in that good
way in which he had early initiated them, and
he often recommended to them secret Prayer,
as the great means of keeping up the Life of
Religion, which he thought could not be kept
up without it; and not being satisfied with
what he said to them by word of Mouth while he
lived, he took care that after his Death he should
still speak to them, in a great many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Letters and Papers which he left behind
him, both for all his Children in general, and
for every one of them in particular, of which I
have seen some, and must say this of them,
that they express a most genuine and lively
sense of Religion, without any laboured Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods,
or Affectations of Words or Phrases, but
with a Simplicity which shews he writ as his
Heart dictated; of which I will give you an
Essay, taken out of the Letter he writ for them
all in general.</p>

The Lord bless you all, and give you
his Grace, that you may love and fear him all
your days. O! labour with all your Might
to be holy in all manner of Conversation,
eschewing all Evil, and the Appearance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Be charitable to the Poor, live in Unity and
Love among your selves; which if you do in
Sincerity, you may expect God's Blessings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Endeavours, so far as they be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Forget not daily Prayers in your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and walk humbly before him all your
days; if you do that which you ought as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
you will find Mercy with the Lord,
and Respect with good Men. The Lord in
Mercy bless you all (my sweet Ones) prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
in Spiritual Blessings, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is, I assure you, my daily Prayer, that
you may so do, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All my drift in all my Papers has been, that
you may live holily and righteously before
the Lord in this your Pilgrimage, that so you
may be happy to Eternity, when time shall
be no more, and that through his free Grace
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42435:19"/>
and Mercy in our Blessed Saviour and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Redeemer; for without Holiness and
Sanctification none shall see him with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
O love the Lord, and all Men, and live in
Love one with another, if you expect God's
Blessing.</p>

            <p>You see how fervently and seriously he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends
the Fear of God, and mutual Love, to
his Children. As he saw them to his great
Joy, live in this blessed Harmony, during his
own Life, so he took all possible care to have
it kept up after his Death; for he charged them
to enter into solemn Promises upon his removal
to continue still to love one another; which
they are resolved religiously to perform; and
of which no doubt very happy Effects will
appear.</p>

As he was very sensible of the Blessing of
Brethren dwelling together in Unity, so his
Love and Charity were more diffused than to
be restrained only to his own Family. He had
an univesal Charity for all good and worthy
Men, against which let hot and angry Men say
what they will, it is, and still wil be the Badg of a
true Disciple of Christ. He never engaged in our
unhappy Differences; but, without meddling
in matters that did not belong to him, he loved
all that was good in all Men, and extended his
Charity to the Relief of proper Objects of all
Perswasions, both in City and Country: Of
which I need say the less, because it was so
eminent, and so many did partake of it. And
he took particular care to manage this so secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that often the Persons themselves knew
not from whence their Relief came: He did
also industriously seek out such proper Objects
for it, without putting modest but necessitous
Persons to the uneasines of asking it. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
while in the City, did always joyn with
the <hi>French</hi> Congregation, but when he was in
the Country, he joyned in the Worship of the
Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:42435:20"/>
He looked on the Reformed Churches, by
reason of the unreformed Lives of the Members
of them, with great regret, and did apprehend
there was a severe Cup to go round them, and
was afraid <hi>England</hi> might drink the Dregs of it,
and might be again brought under the Tyranny
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the inundation of a
Forreign Power, in which we have all reason
to pray God that his Fears prove not too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical:
of this I have seen a full account in
one of his Letters to one of his Children, which
was sealed up with his Will.</p>
            <p>I need not enlarge upon other Particulars,
of his Justice and fairness in his Dealings, of
his gentle and affable Deportment to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and of his readiness to do all the Good
that was in his Power: you all know so much
of those things, that I may well say the less; for
I find his Memory lives, and is like to maintain
it self long in this place: the Witnesses of his
Vertues being so many and the Instances of
them having been so frequent and so signal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:42435:20"/>
Thus we see what a <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> Man
he was; now let us a little consider what his
<hi>latter end</hi> hath been. This good Man had a
great deal of that hundred-fold which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
promised even in this Life, to those who
forsook their <hi>Houses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Lands</hi> and <hi>Families for his
sake.</hi> This entail descended on him from his
Father, and he having taken care to secure and
maintain his Title to so great a Blessing, has had
as visible and long a share of the good things
of this Life, as, all things being put together,
any Man in this Age has had.</p>
            <p>He lived 90 Years, all to a few days; and
the last 35 years of his Life, till a little before
his Death, he enjoyed a vigorous and perfect
Health, together with the greatest of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Blessings, the perfect use of his Senses, his
Memory, and Judgment: so that he continued
to write many Letters weekly till his last Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
fell upon him.</p>
            <p>About 47 years ago, an unhappy Accident
had almost cut him off, when he was yet in the
Strength of his Age; he being at a Training
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42435:21"/>
near <hi>Morefields,</hi> some Powder took fire, by
which he, with several others, were blown up;
but tho' some of the rest were struck dead out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
yet God had a great deal of more Service
for him in the World, and so after an Illness of
six or seven Weeks continuance, of which it was
long doubted, whether he could ever recover,
he was again restored to his Family, and lived
to see his <hi>Childrens Children,</hi> and some of their
<hi>Children,</hi> to so great an Increase, that in his
time a full hundred came into the World de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from him, all born in full time, and all
baptized save one: of these, 67 are yet alive, to
which, if eleven, that are come into his Family
by Marriages, be joyned, there wanted but two
of fourscore, that had right to his daily Blessing.
And so entirely did the first Blessing of <hi>Encrease
and Multiply</hi> rest on him and his Children, that
there was never an Abortive nor a Child dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
in all his numerous Family: A rare and
singular Happiness, to which very few have ever
been known to have attained. I shall not add
any thing of the Comfort he had in them, tho'
that is a necessary Ingredient to make such
things Blessings indeed, but that belongs too
much to the Living, to be insisted on by me.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42435:21"/>
Having thus lengthened out his Days with a
great Increase both of Family and Fortune, he
at last for several Years withdrew himself from
all wordly Affairs, and so lived only to fear
God, and do Good. He having so entire a Health,
so plentiful a Fortune, and the Freedom of that
Leisure which he gave himself, added to his
Crown of Gray-hairs, and the Crown of his
Children, that of <hi>Good Works,</hi> and at last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
them all for a Crown of Glory.</p>
            <p>A few days before <hi>Christmass</hi> last, he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ill, and tho' it might have been imagined
that in so ancient a Man, Nature was so far
spent, that it could not have held out long;
yet the length of his Distemper, the great Pains
and Agonies he endured for about six Months,
and the Feaver in which his Life ended, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that there was still a great stock of Vigor
and Strength in him: but tho' his Memory
and Judgment were sometimes clouded during
his Sickness, yet it appeared that Goodness and
true Piety were become, by long Use and
Practice, so natural to him, that when the
Clearness of his Mind was much darkened, yet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42435:22"/>
the excellent Temper of his Soul remained with
him to the last.</p>
            <p>During his long Sickness, and under all the
returns of Pain, which were sometimes very
violent, he was never heard speak one impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
word; but was almost always either pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God, or praising him; he caused the
Scriptures to be read, and Psalms to be sung
often about him, and heartily prayed for all
that came to see him, and amidst those his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies,
he did not forget the Churches of God
both at home and abroad. The last sensible
Words he spake to his Children were the Night
before he died, upon his Sons coming to see
him; he prayed God <hi>to bless them, and their Children,
with all Temporal Blessings, and above all, with Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Blessings;</hi> after this he spoke nothing perfect
to any of them, but was heard say in a Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to God; <hi>My Soul doth magnify the Lord, and
my Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Saviour,</hi> which
he repeated several times; and as these words
were a very proper Conclusion to such a Life,
so they were, the last he spake distinctly.
And tho' it was likely that so long a Sickness
in so aged a Person had so shaken the whole
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42435:22"/>
Fabrick, that the Separation of that Soul and
Body that had dwelt so long together would
have been easy and perhaps insensible, yet it
proved otherwise, for he lay many Hours in his
last Agonies; but in Conclusion, God took
pity on, and released him, so that he entred into
his Rest on the <hi>20th</hi> of this Month.</p>
            <p>Thus was this <hi>Righteous and Merciful Man
taken away;</hi> he has now <hi>entred into Peace,</hi> and
we are to lay his Body in this his Bed, the
Grave. I wish we may all <hi>lay it to heart,</hi> and
consider well <hi>whether this righteous Man is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away from the Evil to come,</hi> which certainly
must come on the sooner, for the loss of those
that stand in the breach while the measure of
our Iniquities seems to be very near filled up:
for as it is in the words after my Text; <hi>The
Transgressors shall be destroyed together, and the end of
the wicked shall be cut off: But the Salvation of the
Righteous is of the Lord, he is their Strength in the
time of Trouble; and the Lord shall keep them and
deliver them; he shall deliver them from the Wicked,
because they trust in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:42435:23"/>
God of his infinite Mercy give us Grace so
to mark and follow this and all other <hi>perfect</hi> and
<hi>upright</hi> Men that have gone before us, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into <hi>Peace,</hi> that we may dy the Death
of the Righteous, and that our latter end may
be like his; that is, that our <hi>end may be Peace.</hi>
To which, let us earnestly pray to God that we
may attain, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
that came to make Peace, who is over all,
blessed for evermore; <hi>Amen.</hi>
