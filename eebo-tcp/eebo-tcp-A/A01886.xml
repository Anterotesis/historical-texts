            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(take it in which sence you please)
is dedicated to the World, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

reformation of vice, which is
Good mens wishes, and to the aduancement of
vertue, which is the ayme of all honest affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:6080:4"/>
so that making my summe iust with

my selfe, of that which I owe to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie,
to the ruine of sinne, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
safe-guarde of piety.</p>
            <p>But you will tell me, to detect sinne is to
teach sinne, the discouery of vice like <hi>Hydras</hi>
heads, doth rather increase then decrease the
vitious, for vertue is seldome found to spring
from <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Tables, and chastity much
lesse from <hi>Aretines</hi> pictures; that wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and wicked actions, should rather bee
damn'd in obscuritie, then preserued for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that it is a sinne against piety, to giue
wickednesse any life of memory, for so the

<hi>vnrepentant sinne</hi> is the Deuils Godsonne,
and when we talke of capital wickednes, we
ought to giue it no other name but deuill;

a <hi>Lamia</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> and a <hi>Lestrigon</hi> in great

Legend of <hi>Britanica Hollandia,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
all in insolence, instructs all in impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and runnes through a World of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
actions, with improuidence; no, as she
is without paralell in her profession, so I wil
striue to delineate her to the life, that she may
euer liue hatefull to all after succession.</p>
            <p>In the Kingdome of <hi>Eutopia,</hi> nere the fayre
citie of <hi>Maugsun,</hi> some fewe Leagues distant,
their liued a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of indifferent <hi>Fortunes,</hi>
neither so high that ambition did assaile him,
nor so low that contempt might follow him,
but Anchoring in a smooth low tyde, and a
safe harbor, made himselfe content only with
things necessary; he marryed a wife sutable to
his estate, and agreeable with his affections,
for shee had comelinesse enough to content
an honest eye; cleanlines sufficient for a chast
bed, or a frugall Table, and discretion at will
<pb facs="tcp:6080:5"/>
to gouerne and dispose all things committed
to her Steward-shippe; These had issue one
daughter whom they named <hi>Britanica Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hollandia her birth.</note> by reason of some neere allyances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them and the <hi>Neather-lands.</hi> A mayd
in the time of her innocence, and ignorance,
so accomplished and accomodated with all
the ornaments of Nature and education, that
shee farre surpassed all those of her rancke,
and might without the offence of modesty
challenge equalitie with those which were
accounted excellent; for shee had a fayre
Eye, full of strong inchauntment; a modest
cheeke, rich with bashfulnesse; and a face so
generally clothed with beauty, &amp; blushes, that
there was an infinite promise of much ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vertue: her stature was but low, yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
with such true Cymetrie, and so agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with euery other lineament through
the whole <hi>Fabricke</hi> of her body, that had <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi>
beheld her, he would haue forsworn his
<hi>Idol</hi> to haue made her his <hi>goddesse;</hi> but to leaue
off all further circumstance, let it suffice me to
<pb facs="tcp:6080:5"/>
say shee was truely handsome, exceeding
hopefull, and had not the Deuill beene
too ambitious, shee might have bin most
happy, but where the house is cleanest,
there <hi>Sathan</hi> desires to entersoonest; and
if the guard of Grace be Idle or vnwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
repentance may follow, but it cannot
prevent surprizall, and so it fares with this
Creature, for as heaven had bestowed
vpon her all outward imbelishments to
attract vertue vnto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her, so had some si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
power, or the corruption of her
owne flesh married to those bodily beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
such a wicked spirit, that all goodnes
became to her an vtter stranger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shee was
of such a proud, haughty, and disdainfull
nature, so Masculine in her disposition,
and so mad to encounter any crosse to
her best loued cogitations, that like the
Spider, which turneth all things to poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
which it tasteth, so she became an vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Athiest,</hi> and would acknowledge no
God but her own pleasure; She had from
mens prayses, womens envies, and her
glasses plain-dealing, her parents tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="tcp:6080:6"/>
her friends carefulnes, and her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
amazednesse, got such a true
knowlege of her handsomnesse, that she
did not onely beleeue it, and loue it, but
mightily doated vpon it; neither did this
foolishnesse of selfe-affection so bind her
to the admiration of her owne beautie,
as a proud and furious conceire of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of her wit, (aboue the sphere of
other womens capacities) did bind and
slaue her to imbrace to her selfe this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
that she only was excellent</p>
            <p>Now she begins to grow in hate with
her fathers house, the Country is vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
vnhabitable, obscure and durtie, that
house-wifely imployments, were slauish
ingagements; to live with parents, was
but to lye with bondage, that al comman
dements were curses, and obedience only
a figure of simplicitie, and ignorance;
shee would often say within her selfe,
what is beautie, if not seene, what seene,
if not admired, what admired, if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
and what any, or all if not enioyed;
and where shall these bee gathered from
<pb facs="tcp:6080:6"/>
the blossomes of trees, heaps of stones the
ouerflowes of fountains, or the dul rabble
of Clownes and heards-men? No, it is the
City that is the spheare of beauty, there are
her Temples, there live her votaries, and
there burnes her sacrifice, the Countrie is
but a rotten chest that conceales holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques,
let me live in the Citie, where if I
cannot out-shine all, or at least equall all,
yet a tworst I shall be hidde in an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Cabinet.</p>
            <p>Vpon these, and the like resolutions she
throws her-selfe into a deepe melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:
all meates are but course for her dyet,
shee forsakes them; sleepe is too neere a
kinseman to death, she hates it; all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
seemes rude, shee loathes it; all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
are vnpollish't, her eare will not
receiue them; and to conclude, as an exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated
carcasse, she walks with no soule,
and but halfe a motion.</p>
            <p>Her parents quickly perceiue this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and like noble Phisitians labor to
find out the cause to make the cure more
easie, more speedie, more certaine; but she
<pb facs="tcp:6080:7"/>
that had a lockt vp soule in a fort impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
what through disdaine, the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid
of Pride, &amp; Pride it selfe the Lord of
stubborne resolution, she became so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitrable,
that sooner might they bring
the Poles together, then separate her from
one tittle of her private resolution, so that
finding her fixed, they leaue to molest
her, onely obserue all occasions, and all
circumstances, euery passage, and euery
Action, that might give any light to those
designes on which shee laboured with
such difficultie; in the end, finding her set
one day in a priuate Roome, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
companion, but solitude &amp; her owne
thoughts, her Father stealing within the
distance of her speeches, might heare her
vtter these wordes. <hi>O life, which hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
so many, seduced so many, blinded so
many, thou art nothing at thy beginning, thy
light is nothing but a shaddow, thou art but
smoake at thy height, thou art sweet to fooles,
thou art bitter to the wise, who loueth thee,
knowes thee not, who knoweth thee, contemnes
thee;</hi> and here with a deepe sigh shee
<pb facs="tcp:6080:7"/>
made a full period, when her father pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vpon her, demanded the cause of this
quarrell betwixt her and life, vrging her
with much ingratitude, to condemne
that, from which her selfe had receiued
so much luster, applying her beauty, her
youth, her wit, and all her inward, and
outward faculties, as vnrefellible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of infinite beholdingnesse to life,
who had brought them into the World,
&amp; made them beloued of the World; but
she with a silent bashfulnesse (fuller of
deceit then innocence) forbearing to reply
gave him occasion to assaile her with all
the strength that nature, loue, &amp; a fathers
authority could collect together, and did
so vrge her to display, and lay open the
Cabinet of her deerest counsells, that she
either vnwilling to loose so faire an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
or to apparel her envious griefe
in the robes of obedience, with a seeming
vnwilling willingnesse, did disburden
her heart of that loade of griefe, which
so long had afflicted her: yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
many disguises, and false habits, as
<pb facs="tcp:6080:8"/>
not being weary of the Countrey for it's
solitude, but carefull to discharge him of
much cost, and incumbrance; that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was more hopefull for her aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because the two columbes of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie,
honorable Mariage, and wealthy
imployment had there a setled residence,
and threw away their fauors blindfold,
like the children of <hi>Fortune.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There did need small debatement,<note place="margin">Her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the City.</note>
When both the parties did agree vpon
one proposition, for he seemed to outrun
her in willingnes, and as if their thoughts
had bene cast in one mould, an equall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
made preparation for her speedy
departure, the mothers consent was
not wanting, so that all drawing by one
linke without hinderance, strife or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage,
the work was in a trice effected,
the daughter was brought to the City,
and setled in an honest <hi>Magnificos</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
            <p>Here, after the expence of some small
time, liuing as it were in a <hi>Burse</hi> of resort,
where men and their minds were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb facs="tcp:6080:8"/>
trucking for new commodities, it

which was without foyle; because it

had so shot her beames through euery
corner of the City, that her Suitors were
like <hi>Coriscas</hi> smockes, infinite in number,
many in good opinion, and but one at

seuerity she gouerned her passions, that
the strictest eye of modesty could hardly

That to sinne wisely, was to sinne safely,

by all mens report, frugall in her owne
experience, industrious in his affaires, and
painefull in euery circumstance of his
profession, one that was handsome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to loue, and stout enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole,
yet such an Idolater to her beauty, &amp;
such a slave to her commandements, that
neither his eyes, nor eares could carry
credit beyond her sufferance; of this man
she made a husband, and had not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

to make ship vvracke of her vertue, they

true, that loue in her friends, made them call
impudence an high spirit, and losenesse a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

brought vp in the same schoole where shee
learnt her complement, knew that the gate
was wide enough, and the way plaine enough
which leade to the ruine of her vertue.</p>
            <p>Many assault were giuen to this faire Fort,<note place="margin">Her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie.</note>
but some she with-stood, to gaine an opinion
of goodnesse, and they were great ones; some
she durst not entertaine for feare of after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and they were loose ones, some she
held at a distance to draw on benefit, and they
were the rich ones, and some she scorn'd, and
they were fooles, Fidlers, or base ones: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
at last, the deuill himselfe fearing to lose
so rich a prize, which hee knew would not
come to his kingdome alone with her owne
lading, but with the spoyles, and triumphs of
a world of vnfortunate creatures of both

               <note place="margin">The first that made her a whore.</note> a fellow, whom <hi>Lucifer</hi> had so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,

<pb facs="tcp:6080:10"/>
qualities and inchauntments of a seeming
goodnesse, that vertue herselfe could hardly
have discouered him, without the vse of her
diuinest spectacles; he had al the amiablenesses
of a good face, and a well-shap'd body, which
he made more glorious with grauity &amp; good
cloathes, he had an excellent wit, prompt and
ready, which he witnessed in his discourses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
full of delight and learning, he was full of
<hi>Bounty,</hi> and <hi>liberalitie;</hi> a world of poore decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
people (especially women) maintaining
his exchequor, and when the fire of lust
was kindled in him by the deuils bellowes, he
was so full of delicate <hi>Petulance,</hi> and inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dallyance, that a cold halfe buried <hi>Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi>
would haue ingendred a flame from his

            <p>This great <hi>General</hi> for <hi>Hel</hi> (not alone in this,

com's with his <hi>Legions</hi> of inchantments to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege
this <hi>Redoute,</hi> or weake <hi>Sconce,</hi> euen at the
time when there was a <hi>mutynie</hi> raised betwixt
her and her best souldiers; for indeed, <hi>Modestie</hi>
was in disgrace, and accus'd for a <hi>Coward, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity</hi>
was scorn'd as a shaddow &amp; no substance,
<pb facs="tcp:6080:10"/>
               <hi>Bashfulnesse</hi> was reputed weake and childish,
<hi>Honour</hi> a <hi>Chimera, Good-fame</hi> a dreame; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
all the <hi>Vertues</hi> stood cashired as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

and a <hi>Penall Statute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against these hee rais'd such a battery of
sweet discourse, and inchanting perswasions,
that she stood amazed, and staggering at the
first on-set, till feare of the <hi>Law,</hi> and a little
loue to <hi>good report,</hi> stept betwixt her and the
enemy, and beat him backe with these, or the
like arguments. First, that her <hi>Reputation</hi> (not
God or his Iudgements) were so deare and
tender vnto her, that she durst not give eare to
his sorceries: but he with a smile (wherein
a good eye might haue discerned scorne) asked
her what <hi>Reputation</hi> was; She told him it
was the very <hi>Manna,</hi> and <hi>Nepenthe</hi> of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Spirits,</hi> the Goddesse of great courages,
and the triumph of all <hi>Noble Actions;</hi> she sayd
it was a thing so delicate, so pure, and so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted,
that the least excesse did <hi>blemish</hi> it,
any <hi>vniust action dishonour it, indiscretion, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence</hi>
or <hi>Idlenesse</hi> deface it, but <hi>Prostitution</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:6080:11"/>
that did wholly ruine it; it is a constant friend
that will follow and go with any <hi>good action,</hi>
but if once forsaken, no <hi>inquisition,</hi> no search,
no prayers, or teares, can euer againe find it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it Sir, (said she) there is no such misery as
to outlive <hi>Reputation,</hi> nor any follies like that
vvhich puts it in hazard. But he, to whom
<hi>Blasphemy</hi> was familiar, &amp; <hi>Atheistical</hi> proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
more frequent, then holy sentences, had
soone brought her to a <hi>Non-plus;</hi> so that forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her guardians, she vvas content to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to composition. This capitulation assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him of future conquest, he now began to
sing his owne triumph; and to make his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
more glorious, the assurance of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
more serious, and his laciuious plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,

               <note place="margin">Rome.</note> of good,
but poore parentage: how after her Fathers
death, necessitty brought her to seeke shelter,
being accompanied with nothing but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
beauty, an vnmatchable personage, a
boundlesse wit, and an infinite spirit.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Hipolito</hi> the great <hi>Cardinall of Est,</hi> and
brother to the Duke of <hi>Ferara,</hi> beholding her,
grew enamored on her, bought her at an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
price, and maintained her aboue the ranck
of the greatest Princes: Insomuch that at an
enterview of Ambassadors, before the <hi>Pope,</hi> in
<hi>Mounte Angelo</hi> (being by torchlight) she came
amongst the Ladies so couered, and onerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
with Dyamonds, and the richest Iewel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that excepting her face, (which the Sun it

<pb facs="tcp:6080:12"/>
be discerned but a mouing flame of
most glorious fire; and those which had skill
did value her at more then a <hi>Million.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not to be exprest with what greedines
of spirit, and earnest delight, <hi>Britanica's</hi> eares
drunke in this Story, for she was infinitly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous;
not as <hi>Misers</hi> to cram her chests, but as
a discreete <hi>Prodigall</hi> to fill her pockets, placing
her delight in <hi>giuing, and spending, Ryot, Reuels,
Playes, Feasts,</hi> and all manner of <hi>wastful delights,</hi>
were to her such deare companions, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then loose them, she would lay both life
and soule in pawne for their ransome; nay, she
was such a true admirer of pleasure, that albe
shee knew there was no true pleasure vpon
earth, and that only <hi>Griefe</hi> Went vp &amp; downe,
couered in pleasures out-side, yet was her soule
so rauisht with delight, that she became dead

            <p>This <hi>Ignatius</hi> saw, this he knew, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
her <hi>Spirits</hi> take fire at his words, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
pursued his <hi>Story,</hi> and shewed her
how <hi>Paulina</hi> hauing nothing but the reuenue
of <hi>Lustre,</hi> a little beautie, was three times the
<pb facs="tcp:6080:12"/>
richest, the greatest and the most respected <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
of all <hi>Rome;</hi> and here he paul'd, for had he
followed the truth of the <hi>Story,</hi> it would have
shewed him that she was three times also the
poorest, the most deiected &amp; basest, miserable,
despised creature that <hi>Rome,</hi> or the world had
euer reserued for memory: nay, so exceeding
hatefull was her <hi>condition,</hi> &amp; so infinite her <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi>
that she gaue her body in prostitution to

his owne market, and made a <hi>Conuertite:</hi> But
they were vvhites beyond his Ayme; confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was only within the reach of his Arrow,

that freely she gaue him her body in possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and he inioyed her for some short space,
vvith out competitor.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lust</hi> is a <hi>Gangrene,</hi>

cloyd with saciety, and sin as weary of her, as
<pb facs="tcp:6080:13"/>
she was weary of sinning, she began to
turne ouer the leafe of her wickednesse,
and though she had no thought of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,
yet she wil take a new course
for the safety of her health and person.</p>
            <p>She will no more be a <hi>Layis,</hi> but a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>

            <p>At last she lights vpon an <hi>old ruined

            </p>
            <p>Of this house by contract, she got posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,

needed not much search, sin is found in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

water-men plying a rich fare,
will thrust themselues into the deuills
armes beyond hope,<note place="margin">With whom she trades.</note> beyond redemption.</p>
            <p>There was not a <hi>Carrier</hi> that had a

She had <hi>Counsailes</hi> of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

to protract and put off the dayes

her selfe thus hard beset, she now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to call vnto her the strength of a

woman with his flattery, so he may (for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends)
giue her some reliefe with his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,

came to visit her a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of very grave

<pb facs="tcp:6080:17"/>
his Salutations, with the name of an

as ashamed to looke vpon him, he giues
her comfort, but so mixt with seuere

            <p>After this conflict ended, and the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi>
preparing for his departure, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed

vp as if his thirst could never be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched;
In the midst of these quaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fings,
the <hi>Keeper</hi> and the <hi>Vncle,</hi> fall into
a discourse of such seriousnesse, that they
neglected all things but their owne
speeches; <hi>Britanica</hi> taking aduantage at
this <hi>Obliuion,</hi> rises from the Table, and
as if the Wine had stird in her some
Office of secret occasion, steales out
of doores, and knowing that at the

stoode a Monasterie of Gray Fryers,
looking backe, and seeing her <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
more and more inchaunted with
<hi>Mercurie,</hi> like light <hi>Salmacis</hi> hauing
her heeles at libertie, away she runs,

beeing, as all his <hi>Order</hi> are, faithfull and

promises her all reliefe, all safetie, which
done, hee conueies her through the
darke corners, and intricate passages
of their cloyster, whether he shewed her
his owne <hi>Cell</hi> or no, it is vncertaine; But
it is an apparant trueth, that he neuer
forsooke her, till hee had placed her in

            <p>By this time her <hi>Vncle</hi> and the <hi>Keeper</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Vncle</hi> perceiuing that his

amazement, his furie, his fretting, and

               <hi>Britanica</hi> being thus escaped, and by

on worke to sue, if not for

there was no way so safe or speedy as

some <hi>Caruils,</hi> and some <hi>Frigots,</hi> wealthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laden, but at their returne, they had
not so much as Ballast, but came forth
poore and emptie.</p>
            <p>All her entertainments had a <hi>Protean</hi>
condition, full of variety and changes,
and shee would euer suite them to the
nature of him that was entertained; if

hee were of worth and respect, hee was
respectiuely vsed, if otherwise, besides
the expence of his coyne, his clothes
were forfaited for his rude behauiour,

thence, both day and night halfe naked.</p>
            <p>These mil-dewes could not chuse but

               </gap>ssy, that she had scarce chests
enowe to containe them, this wealth
made her proud, and pride taught her to
be curious, she will not liue at so
low a rate as she hath done, but as shee
hath plenty of meanes, so she will have
plenty of attendants, and hereupon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
shee contracts and hyres sundry
retayners; as first, a <hi>Surgeon</hi> that tooke
care of her <hi>Spittle,</hi> then a <hi>Tyre-woman</hi>
of Phantasticall Ornaments, a <hi>Sempster</hi>
for Ruffes, Cuffes, Smocks, and wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coates,
and a <hi>Taylor</hi> for cloathes, of all

spring from such wicked examples,
come all with one voyce before the
throne of <hi>Iustice,</hi> appealing for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;

downe fell the <hi>Bridge,</hi> and the <hi>Corporall</hi>

in the water; where, to see how they
lay plunged in mud and myre, how one
