         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all the Sins, that the Children of Men are
guilty of, there is none, that our corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are more inclinable unto, than that of
<hi>Idolatry,</hi> a Sin, that may be towards Men, ſo
well as other Creatures, and things; For, as
that which a Man unmeaſurably relyes, and
ſetts his Heart upon, is Called his GOD,
even as that which he falls down before, and worſhippeth: ſo,
when one hath the Perſon of another in an exceſs of admiration,
whether for Greatneſs or Richneſs, &amp;c. which we are ſubject to
adore, we are ſaid to Idolize him; and therefore the wiſe <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
who, of all men, are moſt Jealous of their Liberty, Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that as the nature of Man is not prone to any thing more
than the Adoration of Men, So nothing is more deſtructive to
Freedom, hath, for preventing the Miſchiefs of it, made it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,
even ſo much as to mourn for their Duke at his death;
Intimating thereby, that their Felicity and Safety depends not
upon the uncertain Thred of any one Man's life; but upon the
Vertue of their good Laws, and Orders, well executed, and that
they can never want vertuous Perſons to ſucceed: and how do
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98342:3"/>
ſuch Principles in men, lead by little more than Moralitie, reprove
thoſe, who have a great meaſure of Goſpel-light, for their
ſenſeleſs exceſs, in their adoring the remembrance of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</hi>
For as the Objects of Idolatry are miſtaken Creatures, or
things, proceeding ſome times from ſelf-love, ſo well as other
cauſes, So the undeſerved approbation, and applauſe, that <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>'s
memory ſeems to have with his Adherents, amounting to
little leſs, than the Idolizing of him, appears to me, to be the
product of an exceſſive Veneration of Greatneſs, and a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Partiality towards him; for that the more honour is given to
him, the more prayſe they think will conſequently redound to
them, who were his Favourites; and they fortifie themſelves
herein, with the Credit they ſay he hath abroad, though there
is little in that, becauſe the opinion that Strangers have of him,
may well be put upon the accompt of their ignorance, in the
Affairs of <hi>England,</hi> which Travellers do finde, to be ſo great,
even amongſt Miniſters of State, as is to be admired. And now
as this Error in Idolizing <hi>Oliver</hi> hath two moral Evils in it,
(beſides the ſin in it ſelf:) The one, a reflection upon the preſent
times, as if the former were better than theſe; And the other,
the unjuſt defrauding the <hi>Long Parliament</hi> of that which is due to
them, to give it Idolitrouſly to him, to whom it doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long;
I eſteem it a Duty incumbent upon me, to diſcover the
Miſtake. I am not inſenſible, that I ſhall by this, draw the
envye of thoſe upon me, who, being Jealous of their Honour,
will be angry for touching them in their <hi>Diana;</hi> but knowing
my ſelf clear, from the Vices of envying Vertue in any, how
contrary ſoever he may be to me in Judgment, ſo well, as from
being unwilling to allow every one their due Commendations,
I will caſt my ſelf upon Providence, for the ſucceſs of this
Paper; And in reference to <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Government, and the
preſent times, make ſome Obſervations relating to both, and, in
order thereunto, ſhew,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the original cauſe of the low condition that we are
now (in relation to Trade) reduced unto, had its beginning in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98342:3"/>
               <hi>Olivers</hi> time, and the foundations of it, layed, either, by his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
miſtaking the Intereſt of this Kingdome, or wilfully do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, for the advancement of his own particular Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That his time, for the ſhort continuance, had as
much of oppreſſion, and injuſtice, as any former times.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, That he never in his later dayes, valued
either honour or honeſty. when they ſtood in the way of his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
and that there is nothing to be admired in him (though
ſo much Idolized) but that the partiallity of the world, ſhould
make him ſo great a favorite of ignorance, and forgetfullneſs, as
he ſeems to be.</p>
            <p>When this late Tyrant, or Protector, (as ſome calls him) tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
out the Long Parliament, the Kingdome was arrived at the
higheſt pitch of Trade, Wealth, and Honour, that it, in any
Age, ever yet knew. The Trade appeared, by the great Sums
offered then for the Cuſtomes and Exciſe, Nine hundred thouſand
pounds a year, being refuſed. The Riches of the Nation, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it ſelf, in the high value, that Land, and all our Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
bore, which are the certain marks of opulencie. Our
Honour, was made known to all the world, by a Conquering Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,
which had brought the proud <hi>Hollanders</hi> upon their Knees,
to begg peace of us, upon our own Conditions, keeping all other
Nations in awe. And beſides theſe advantages, the publick
ſtock, was Five hundred thouſand pounds in ready Money, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of ſeven hundred thouſand pounds in Stores, and the whole
Army in Advance, ſome four<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and none under two months; ſo that
though there might be a debt of near Five hundred thouſand
pounds upon the Kingdom, he met with above twice the value in
lieu of it.</p>
            <p>The Nation being in this flouriſhing and formidable poſture,
<hi>Cromwell</hi> began his Uſurpation, upon the greateſt advantages ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
having it in his power to have made peace, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Leagues, in what manner he had pleaſed withall our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
every one courting us then, and being ambitious of the
friendſhip of <hi>England;</hi> But as if the Lord had infatuated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98342:4"/>
him of common ſence and reaſon, he neglected all our
golden opportunities, miſimproved the Victory God had given
us over the <hi>United Netherlands,</hi> making peace (without ever
ſtriking ſtroak) ſo ſoon as ever things came into his hands, upon
equal tearms with them. And immediately after, contrary to
our Intereſt, made an unjuſt Warr with <hi>Spain,</hi> and an impolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
League with <hi>France,</hi> bringing the firſt thereby under, and
making the latter too great for Chriſtendome; and by that means,
broke the ballance betwixt the two Crowns of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
which his Predeceſſors the Long Parliament, had alwayes wiſely
preſerved.</p>
            <p>In this diſhoneſt Warr with <hi>Spain,</hi> he pretended, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
to impoſe a belief upon the world, that he had nothing
in his eye, but the advancement of the Proteſtant Cauſe, and
the honour of this Nation; but his pretences, were either fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
or he was ignorant in Forreign affairs (as I am apt to think,
that he was not guilty of too much knowledge in them) For he
that had known any thing of the temper of the Popiſh Prelacie,
and the French Court pollicies, could not but ſee, that the way
to increaſe, or preſerve the reformed Intereſt in <hi>France,</hi> was by
rendring the Proteſtants of neceſſary uſe to their King, for that
longer than they were ſo, they could not be free from perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that the way to render them ſo, was by keeping the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> even, as that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
make them uſefull to their King: But by overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ballance in his Warr with <hi>Spain,</hi> and joyning with <hi>France,</hi>
he freed the French King from his fears of <hi>Spain,</hi> inabled him to
ſubdue all Factions at home, and thereby to bring himſelf into a
condition of not ſtanding in need of any of them, and from
thence, hath proceeded the perſecution that hath ſince been, and
ſtill is, in that Nation, againſt the reformed there; ſo that <hi>Oliver,</hi>
inſtead of advancing the reformed Intereſt, hath by an error in
his Polliticks, been the Author of deſtroying it.</p>
            <p>The Honour and Advantage he propounded to this Nation,
in his pulling down of <hi>Spain,</hi> had as ill a foundation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if true,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98342:4"/>
as was ſaid, that we were to have had <hi>O ſtend,</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> ſo well
as <hi>Dunhirk</hi> (when we could get them) they bore no proportion
in any kind, to all the reſt of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> European Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
which muſt neceſſarily have fallen to the French Kings
ſhare, becauſe of their joyning, and nearneſs to him, and remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
from us, and the increaſing the greatneſs of ſo near a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
muſt have increaſed our future dangers: But this man,
who through ignorance, is ſo ſtrangely cryed up in the world,
was not guilty of this error in State only, but committed as great
a ſoleciſme, in his deſigning the outing of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
and ſetting up of the King of <hi>Sweden:</hi> For had the <hi>Sweeds,</hi> but
got <hi>Copenhagen,</hi> (as in all probability had <hi>Oliver</hi> lived, they would
have done) they had wanted nothing of conſequence, but the
Cities of <hi>Lubeck</hi> and <hi>Dantzigge,</hi> (which by their then potencie,
they would eaſily have gained) of being Maſters of the whole
<hi>Baltick Sea,</hi> on both ſides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the Sound or mouth down to the
bottome of it; by which, together with all <hi>Denmark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Norway,</hi>
and the <hi>Danes,</hi> part of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> which would conſequently have
been theirs (they then having as they ſtill have the Land of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>) there would have been nothing, but the ſmall Counties of
<hi>Ouldenburge,</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-Friezland,</hi> (which would eaſily have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into their mouths) betwixt them, and the <hi>United Netherlands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
whereby <hi>Sweden,</hi> would on the one ſide to the North, and
North-Eaſt, have been as great, as <hi>France</hi> on the other, to the
South, and South-Weſt, and they two, able to have divided the
Weſtern Empire betwixt them.</p>
            <p>And whereas, it had in all Ages been the policies of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
States and Potentates, to keep the Dominion of the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi>
Sea, devided amongſt ſeveral pettie Princes and States, that
no one might be ſole Maſter of it; becauſe otherwiſe, moſt of the
neceſſary Commodities for ſhipping, coming from thence and
<hi>Norway,</hi> any one Lord of the whole, might lay up the ſhipping of
<hi>Europe,</hi> by the walls, in ſhutting only of his Ports, and denying
the Commodities of his Country to other States. <hi>Cromwell</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this wiſe Maxime, endeavoured to put the whole <hi>Baltick</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98342:5"/>
Sea into the <hi>Sweeds</hi> hands, and undoubtedly had (though I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ingnorantly) done it, if his death had not given them that
ſucceeded him, the Long Parliament, an opportunity of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
preventing it: For if he had underſtood the importance of
the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea to this Nation, he could not have been ſo impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick,
as to have projected ſo dangerous a deſign againſt his new
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> as giving the opening and ſhutting of it to any one
Prince. I am not ignorant, that this error is excuſed, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
that we were to have had <hi>Elſinore</hi> and <hi>Cronenburge</hi> Caſtle,
(the firſt, the Town, upon the narrow entrance of the <hi>Baltick,</hi>
called the Sound, where all Ships Rides, and payes Toll to the
King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> and the latter, the Fortreſs, that defends both
Town and Ships,) by which we ſhould have been Maſters of the
Sound, and conſequently of the <hi>Baltick;</hi> but they that knows
thoſe Countries, and how great a Prince the <hi>Sweed</hi> would have
been, had he obtained all the reſt, beſides theſe two Bables, muſt
confeſs, we ſhould have been at his devotion, in our holding of
any thing in his Countries: And further, if the dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of ſetting up ſo great a Prince, had not been in the caſe, it
had been againſt the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to have had an obligation
upon us to maintain places ſo remote, againſt the enmity of many
States and Princes; and that for theſe reaſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the ordinary Tolls of the Sound, would not have
defrayed half the charge, and to have taken more than the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Tolls, we could not have done, without drawing a generall
quarrel upon us, from moſt of the Princes, and States of the
Northern parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe the experience of all former times ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us, that foreign acquiſitions, have ever been Chargeable,
and prejudicial to the people of <hi>England,</hi> as Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>
makes it clearly appear, That not only all thoſe Pieces of <hi>France,</hi>
which belonged to us by rightfull ſucceſſion; but alſo thoſe we
held by Conqueſt, were alwayes great burthens to our Nation,
and cauſe of much poverty and miſery to the People. And it is
not our Caſe alone, to be the worſe for Conqueſts, (although

               </gap>s, than other Countries, becauſe of the Charge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty
of the Windes and Weather in the Tranſportation of
Succours and relief by Sea, which contiguous Territories, which
are upon the Maine, are not ſubject to,) but the Caſe alſo of (I
think I may ſay) all other Kingdoms. In <hi>France,</hi> their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
and oppreſſions have grown in all ages, with the greatneſs
of their Kings; Nay, even after their laſt peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> by
which they had given them peace with all the world, beſides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> and <hi>Catalonia</hi> into boot: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the poor people promiſed themſelves (though vainly)
an unqueſtionable abatement of Taxes; inſtead of that, they
found their preſſures increaſed dayly, and their King, though
overgrownly great and rich himſelf, yet the people ſo poor, that
thouſands are ſaid to dye in a plentifull year, for want of bread to
their water, nothing being free there, but freſh water and aire;
For (except in ſome few priviledged places) wherever they
have the conveniencie by their Situation of Sea-water, (leaſt they
ſhould make uſe of the benefit of that, which God and Nature
hath given them, for ſaving the charge of Salt,) every family is
forced to take ſo much Salt of the King, at his own rate, (which
is above ten times the price it is ſold for to ſtrangers, for
tranſportation) as is judged they may ſpend in a year; the Lord
deliver all other Countries from their example. In <hi>Sweden,</hi> that
King, Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Military Officers, are the better for their
Conqueſts, in <hi>Germany, Denmark, Ruſsia,</hi> and ſome places anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
belonging to <hi>Poland;</hi> but the Commons the worſe: <hi>Spain</hi>
is undone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the great number of people ſent thence to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi>
which hath depopulated the Country, <hi>France</hi> reaping
more benefit by keeping their people at home to Manufactures,
than <hi>Spain</hi> doth by ſending theirs abroad for Silver and Gold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and now, though by theſe inſtances it may appear to be the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of the people of other Nations, ſo well as ours, to live in
peace, without covering additions; yet it is more our true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
(becauſe, by reaſon of our Situation, we have no need of
Forreign Frontier Towns, our Ships well ordered, being better
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98342:6"/>
than other Princes bordering Garriſons) than any other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
to neglect eſpecially <hi>Europian</hi> acquiſition, and colonies, and
apply our ſelves:</p>
            <p>Firſt, To the improving of our own Land, of which we have
more than we have people to manage.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To the Increaſing our Home and Forreign Trades,
for which we have natural advantages above any other Nation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and Laſtly, (by our ſtrength which Trade will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe)
To make uſe of it, together with the helps that God and
Nature hath given us in our Situation, and otherwiſe, in keeping
the Ballance amongſt our Neighbours; For if the Province of
<hi>Holland,</hi> which is but Four hundred thouſand Acres of profitable
ground, is by the benefit of Trade able to do ſo much, as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
the laſt Warr, what might we do, if Trade were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
who have much more advantages for it, than they have:
I aſcribe what was done by the <hi>Netherlands</hi> in the late Warr to the
Province of <hi>Holland;</hi> becauſe, that though the Provinces are
ſeven in number, <hi>Hollands</hi> due proportion of all charges, is 58⅓
in a hundred, to all the others 41⅔, of which 41⅔, <hi>Holland</hi> gets
little more than 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> honeſtly paid them, inſomuch, that it alone
may be reckoned to beat four fifths in a hundred, to one fifth that
all the other ſix bears; and how prodigious a thing is it, that
<hi>Holland,</hi> no bigger than as before mentioned, ſhould be able to
Coap with <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that though their
Charges in the late Warr was abundantly greater than ours, yet
by their good management, to be ſo little the worſe for it, that
at the concluſion of the Warr, to have their Credits ſo high, that
they could have commanded what Money they had pleaſed at
Three in the Hundred, and all this by the meer additional benefit
of Trade and good Order; and how by <hi>Comwells</hi> indiſcreet neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
of Trade, and chooſing Warr when he was in Peace, did
he miſs the true Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> as by his ill founded de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
he did the Intereſt of the Reformed Religion; For if he
had ſucceeded in his unjuſt Invaſion of the Spaniſh Territories in
the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> (as God ſeldome proſpereth diſhoneſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings)
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98342:6"/>
it being intended for a State acquiſition, the benefit
would not have been defuſive, but chiefly to himſelf and Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
and prejudicial to the people in generall, thought at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of their ſubſtance, the acqueſts would have been made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For had he met with ſo much ſucceſs in the gaining thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and in them, that plenty of Gold and Silver as he vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hoped for, we ſhould have been as unhappy in them (in the
depopulating of our Countries, by the loſs of the multitude of
people that muſt have been ſent thither, and in impoveriſhing our
Nations by the vaſt charge of a continual Warr) as <hi>Spain</hi> is, and
to no other end, than the making of him only Rich, able to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave
the remaining people, and to make himſelf abſolute over
them; for the preventing of which, in ſuch Tyrants as <hi>Cromwell,</hi>
ſurely <hi>Moſes</hi> had an eye, when he ſaid that they ſhould not greatly
multiply Silver and Gold. And thus, as <hi>Cromwells</hi> deſigns muſt,
to an impartial Judgement, appear to have been laid, ſome diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,
others impolitickly, and all contrary to the Intereſt of
the Kingdome, ſo the Iſſue of them was dammageable to the
people of <hi>England:</hi> As,</p>
            <p>Firſt, in his ſudden making a Peace with <hi>Holland,</hi> ſo ſoon as
he got the Government, without thoſe advantages for Trade,
as they who beat them did intend to have had, as their due, and
juſt ſatisfaction for their Charges in the War.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in his War with <hi>Spain,</hi> by the loſſe of that benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Trade to our Nation, and giving it to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> by
whoſe hands we drave (during the War) the greateſt part of
that Trade which we had of it, with 25. in the hundreth profit
to them, and as much loſſe to us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by our loſſe in that War with <hi>Spain,</hi> of 1500 <hi>Engliſh</hi>
ſhips, according as was reported to that Aſſembly, called <hi>Richards
Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, in the diſgracefulleſt defeat at <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> that ever
this Kingdom ſuffered in any age or time.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, and laſtly, in ſpending the great Publick ſtock he
found, and yet leaving a vaſt Debe upon the Kingdom, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98342:7"/>
by the Accompts brought into <hi>Richards Aſſembly;</hi> which
had, (I believe) been yet much higher, but that they who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him managed the Affairs, were a ſort of People who had
been long diſciplin'd, (before his time) to a Principle of Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality,
and againſt Cheating; though at couſening the poorer
People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their Maſters benefit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome of them were grown as
dexterous, as if they had been bred in the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> For
beſides impoſing <hi>Richard</hi> upon the People, after his Fathers death,
by a forged Title, according to the very Law they took to be
in being, when by his Aſſembly, they were ordered to bring in
an Accompt of the Receipts, and payments of the Kingdom;
they made about Sixty thouſand pounds ſpent in Intelligence,
whereas it coſt not above Three or Four thouſand at moſt; and
calculating the reſt by theſe, it may well be concluded, that they
were expert in their Trades.</p>
            <p>It is confeſſed, that <hi>Olivers</hi> Peace and League with <hi>France,</hi>
was upon honourable Articles; but as the tottering Affaires of
<hi>France</hi> then ſtood, much more could not have been ſooner
asked, than had; For <hi>Mazerine,</hi> being a Man of a large and ſubtle
wit, apprehending the Greatneſs of <hi>England</hi> at that time, which
was then dreadfull to the World, and the Vaſt advantages <hi>France</hi>
would have in pulling down, by their help, of <hi>Spain,</hi> granted
him, not onely any thing for the preſent that he demanded, but
diſregarded alſo, even his Parties making their boaſts of the
awe he had him under, Conſidering, that when <hi>Cromwell</hi> had
helped him, to do his Work, in bringing under the Houſe of
<hi>Auſtria,</hi> and therein caſting the ballance of Chriſtendom on his
ſide, he ſhould afterwards have leiſure to recover what then he
ſeemed to part with; And though nothing is more ordinary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
than to hear Men bragg, how <hi>Oliver</hi> Vapoured over <hi>France,</hi> I
do eſteem <hi>Mazerine</hi>'s complying with him, for his own ends,
to be the Chief piece of all his Miniſtry; For by that means only,
and no other, is his Maſter become ſo great at this day, that
no Factions at home can diſturb his Peace, nor Powers abroad
frighten him, Which is more than any King of <hi>France,</hi> ſince
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98342:7"/>
               <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, could ſay; And when his Neighbour Nations
have (too late I fear) experienced his Greatneſs, they will finde
cauſe to Curſe the ignorance of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Politicks; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when a true meaſure is taken of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> the approbation
that he hath in the World, will not be found to have its Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in ſence or reaſon, but proceeding from Ignorance, and
Atheiſme: From Ignorance, in thoſe that takes all that was done
by him, as a Servant, and whileſt under the direction of better
Heads, than his own, to be done by him alone; And from Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme,
in thoſe that thinks every thing lawfull that a man doeth,
if it ſucceed to his advancement; But they that ſhall take an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
View of his Actions whileſt he was a Single Perſon, and at
liberty to make uſe of his own Parts without controll, will
finde nothing worthy Commendations, but cauſe enough from
thence to obſerve, that the wiſedom of his Maſters, and not his
own, muſt have been that by which he firſt moved; and to attribute
his former performances, whileſt a Servant, (as is truly due) to
the Judgement and Subtilty of the Long Parliament, under
whoſe Conduct and Command he was. And now from <hi>Cromwells</hi>
neglecting to live in peace, as if he had pleaſed he might have
done with all the World, to the great enriching of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
The improvement of our Victory over <hi>Holland</hi> in his peace
with them, His being the Cauſe of the loſſe of our Spaniſh
Trade, during all his time, Of the loſſe of 1500 Engliſh ſhips
in that War, beſides, by it, breaking the Ballance of <hi>Europe,</hi>
Of the expence of the Publick Stock and Stores he found, with
the contracting a Debt of Nineteen hundred thouſand pounds,
according to his own accompt, (which, for ought I know he left
behinde him, but am apt to think the Debt was not altogether ſo
great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though made ſo to his Sonne <hi>Richard</hi>'s Aſſembly, as a
means to get the more Money from the poorer people:) And
laſtly, of the diſhonourable overthrow we met with at <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> It
may well be Concluded that he lay the Foundation of our preſent
want of Trade, to what we formerly enjoyed; and that the reaſon
why his miſcarriages were not ſooner under obſervation, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98342:8"/>
our Stock of Wealth and Honour at his Coming to the
Government, being then unſpeakably great, ſtifled their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
untill having ſince had ſome unhappy additional
Loſſes, they are now become diſcernable as firſt Loſſes to a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
who Concealedly bears up under them, are afterwards
diſcovered by the addition of ſecond Loſſes, that ſincks him:
When I contemplate theſe great Failings, I cannot but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the ſadd Condition any people are in, whoſe Governour
drive on a diſtinct contrary Intereſt to theirs; for doubtleſs <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's</hi>
over-weening Care to ſecure his particular Intereſt, againſt
His Majeſty, (then abroad) and the Long Parliament, whom
he had turned out, with a prodigious Ambition of acquiring a
glorious Name in the World, carried him on to all his Miſtakes
and Abſurdities, to the irrepairable loſſe and dammage of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Kingdom.</p>
            <p>To prove the ſecond Aſſertion, That <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Time was full
of Oppreſſion and Injuſtice, I ſhall but inſtance in a few of many
Particulars, and begin with <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> not that I think him
in any kinde one that deſerved favour or reſpect, but that equal
Juſtice is due to the worſt ſo well as beſt men, and that he comes
firſt in order of time.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>John</hi> in 1649. was by Order of the then Parliament tryed
for his Life, with an intent (I believe) of taking him away, but
the Jury not finding him Guilty, he was immediately, according
to Law, generouſly ſet at liberty by thoſe, that had quarrell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
againſt him. This Example in the Parliament of keeping
to the Laws in the Caſe of one, who was a profeſſed implacable
Enemy to them, ought to have been Copied by <hi>Cromwell;</hi> but
in the contrary, to ſhew that there was a difference betwixt his
and his Predeceſſors (the Long Parliaments) Principles, when
the Law had again upon a ſecond Tryal (occaſioned by <hi>Oliver</hi>)
Cleared <hi>Lilburne,</hi> the Parliaments ſubmitting to the Law was
no Example to him; For, contrary to Law, he kept him in Priſon,
untill he was ſo far ſpent in a Conſumption, that he onely turned
him out to dye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98342:8"/>
2ly. Mr. <hi>Conyes</hi> Caſe is ſo notorious, that it needs little more
than naming: He was a Priſoner at <hi>Cromwells</hi> Suit, and being
brought to the Kings Bench Barr by a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> had his
Counſell taken from the Barr, and ſent to the <hi>Tower</hi> for no other
reaſon, than the pleading of their Clients Cauſe; an Act of
Violence, that I believe the whole Story of <hi>England</hi> doth not
parallel.</p>
            <p>3ly. Sir <hi>Henry Vaine,</hi> above any one Perſon, was the Author of
<hi>Olivers</hi> Advancement, and did ſo long, and cordially Eſpouſe his
Intereſt, that he prejudiced himſelf (in the opinion of ſome)
by it, yet ſo ungratefull was this Monſter of Ingratitude, that he
ſtudied to deſtroy him, both in Life and Eſtate, becauſe he
could not adhere to him in his Perjury and Falſeneſs. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
he took was this, He appointing a Publick Day of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſeeking of God for him, invited all Gods people in his
Declaration, to offer him their adviſe in the weighty affairs then
upon his ſhoulders: Sir <hi>Henry</hi> taking a riſe from hence offered his
Adviſe by a Treatiſe, called <hi>The Healing Queſtion;</hi> But <hi>Cromwell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
angry at being taken at his word, Seized, Impriſoned, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to proceed further againſt him, for doing only, what
he had invited him to do; and ſome may think, that Sir <hi>Henry</hi>
ſuffered juſtly, for having known him ſo long, and yet would
truſt to any thing he ſaid.</p>
            <p>4ly. In <hi>Richards</hi> Aſſembly, certain Priſoners in the Tower,
under the then Lieutenant, and ſome ſent thence to <hi>Jerſey,</hi> and
other places beyond the Sea, complained of falſe Impriſonment.
Their Goalor was ſent for, and being required to ſhew by what
Authority he kept thoſe perſons in hold, produceth a Paper all
under <hi>Olivers</hi> own Hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as followeth. <hi>Sir, I pray you ſeife ſuch
and ſuch Perſons, and all others, whom you ſhall judge dangerous
men, do it quickly, and you ſhall have a Warrant after you have done.</hi>
The nature of this Warrant was by <hi>Richards</hi> Aſſembly debated,
and having firſt <hi>Richards</hi> own Counſells opinion in the Caſe, as
Serjeant <hi>Maynard,</hi> &amp;c. they Voted the Commitment of the
Complainants to be Illegall, Unjuſt, and Tyrannical; and that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98342:9"/>
firſt, becauſe the Warrant by which they were Committed was
under the hand of the then (as they called him) Chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
who by Law ought not to commit any by his own War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
Secondly, becauſe no Cauſe was ſhewn in the Warrant;
And Thirdly, (in the Caſe of thoſe ſent out of the reach of
a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> which in Law is a Baniſhment) becauſe no
Engliſh-man ought to be Baniſhed by any leſs Authority than an
Act of Parliament. And therefore, for theſe reaſons, they Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
farther, that the Priſoners ſhould be ſet at Liberty without
paying any Fees, or Charges, but the turning out, and puniſhing
the Lieutenant by the Aſſembly (for obeying ſo unjuſt a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant)
was prevented by their ſodain diſſolution.</p>
            <p>5ly. The Tyrany in the decemating a party reſtored to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Priviledges with all others, and the publick Faith given for
it, by a Law made to that end, by the then powers in being, is
ſufficiently ſhewed in the mentioning of it, only there is this
aggravating Circumſtance in it, That <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who was the
principal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perſon in procuring that Law, when he thought it for
his advantage not to keep it, was the only Man for breaking it:
But to the honour of his firſt Aſſemblie, next following, it may
be remembred, that they no ſooner came together, than like
true Engliſh-men, who are alwayes jealous of the Rights and
Priviledges of the people, damned the Act of Decemation as an
unjuſt and wicked breach of Faith.</p>
            <p>The third Aſſertion of <hi>Cromwells</hi> knowing no honeſty, where
he thought his particular Intereſt was concerned, is made good;
Firſt (though therein he miſtook his Intereſt) in his odious and
unjuſt Warr with <hi>Spain,</hi> without the leaſt provocations, meerly
out of an ambitious and covetous deſign of robbing that Prince
of his Silver and Gold Mines, and becauſe he judged it for his
Credit to diſguiſe his unlawfull deſires, he proceeded in it, by
imploying his Creatures in the City, to draw the Marchants to
complain of Injuries done them by <hi>Spain,</hi> and to Petition for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations;
but by a croſs Providence, his Project had a contrary
Succeſs; for inſtead of anſwering his ſeekings, the Marchants
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98342:9"/>
remonstrated to him, the great prejudice that a Warr with <hi>Spain</hi>
would be to <hi>England,</hi> and ſhewed, that, that King, had been ſo
farr from Iujuring us, that he had done more for Compliance and
preventing a Breach with <hi>England,</hi> than ever he had done in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of any other Nation; But when <hi>Oliver</hi> ſaw his Method
would not take, he called the Remonſtrators Malignants, and
begun the Warr of his own accord, in which, he was highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
in deſigning the ruine of that Prince, who all along
had been moſt faithfull to his Party.</p>
            <p>Secondly, His Falſeneſs and Ingratitude, appeared ſuperlative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in turning out his Maſters, who had not only advanced him,
but made themſelves the more odious by their partial affection
towards him, and in his doing it, with the breach of a poſitive
negative Oath, taken once a year, when made a Counſellor of
State, beſides the breach of all other Ingagements, Voluntary
Imprecations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Proteſtations, and Oaths, taken frequently upon
all occaſions in Diſcourſe and Declarations; and yet further
(when he had turned them out) and left them void of Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and expoſed them to the Furie of the people, in purſuing
them with falſe reproachful Declarations, enough to have ſtired up
the rude multitude to have deſtroyed them, wherever they had
met them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, His want of Honour, ſo well as Honeſty, appeareth,
yet further, in that having by a long <hi>ſeries,</hi> of a ſeeming pious
deportment, gained by his diſſimulation, good thoughts in his
Maſters, the Long Parliament, and by his Spiritual gifts, winded
himſelf into ſo good an opinion with his Souldiers, (men generally
of plain breeding, that knew little beſides their Military Trade, and
Religious Exerciſes) that he could impoſe, in matters of buſineſs,
what belief he pleaſed upon them; he made uſe of the credit he
had with each, to abuſe both, by many vile practices, for making
himſelf popular, and the Parliament and Army odious to one
another, and becauſe the Artifices he uſed are too many to
innumerant, I ſhall but inſtance in ſome few; As his ſlie
complaining Inſinuations againſt the Army to the Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:98342:10"/>
and againſt them to the Army: His being the chief Cauſe of the
Parliaments giving rewards to his Creatures, and then, whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Complaints amongſt his Officers, of their ill Husbandry: His
obſtructing the Houſe in their buſineſs, by long drawling
Speeches, and other wayes, and then complaining of them to his
Souldiers, that he could not get them to do any thing that was
good: His giving fair words to every one, without keeping promiſe
with any, except for his own advantage, and then excuſing all
with forgetfullneſs: And his deſerting his Major Generalls, in
their decimations, crying out moſt againſt them himſelf, when he
only had ſet them at work, becauſe queſtioned by his Aſſembly,
is not to be ſorgotten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I would not be underſtood, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
any thing here, in Favour of the Long Parliament, for
what might be Wicked in him, might be Juſt as to them; And
though, if what he did, had been for the Reſtauration of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
he might have been excuſed, yet being for his own Single
Advancement, it is unpardonable, and leaves him a Perſon to be
truly admired for nothing but Apoſtaſie &amp; Ambition, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Tyberius</hi> in diſſimulation. I am not ignorant, that ſome thinks
it matter of praiſe in him, that he kept us in peace, four years,
and nine months; but that hath little in it, his Majeſty having
done the like, almoſt double his time, ſince his Return, with one
fifth part of that number of Souldiers which he Commanded;
though he, hath alſo had the trouble of preſſing, and ſometimes
forcing Uniformity in Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he found under ſeverall
Forms; whereas <hi>Oliver,</hi> kept the Nation purpoſely divided in
opinions, and himſelf of no declared Judgement, as the ſecureſt
way of ingageing all ſeverall perſwaſions equally to him; which
Artifice, together, with his leaving the Church Lands alienated
as he found them, were all the true Principles of Policie that I
know of, which he kept unto. The Honeſty of theſe Principles,
I referr to the judgement of every mans Conſcience; but if we
may judge of things by experience and ſucceſs, they ſeem to have
been very happy in the world; For in comparing the Condition
of the Proteſtant Countries at preſent, to what they were in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98342:10"/>
times of Popery, we ſhall find them abundantly more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
now, than formerly; for in taking a true Survey of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Dominions, we ſhall diſcover them to bear no proportion
at all in largeneſs, to the Popiſh, and that there is nothing, that
keeps the Ballance betwixt the two parties, but the advantage
that the firſt hath, in being free from the Bondage of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the latters being under it; For as the
Church of <hi>Romes</hi> mercies, are (by their Principles) Cruelties,
ſo had they power anſwerable to the naturall richneſs of the
Soyl of their Countries, and extent of their Territories, they
would long ere this have ſwallowed up the Proteſtant Churches,
and made Bonefires of their Members; but as God, in his Mercy
and Wiſdome, hath by his Over Ruling Hand of Providence,
preſerved his Church; ſo for the Romiſh Churches inabilitie to
effect that which they have will, and malice enough to carry
them on to do, there are theſe natural reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There being generally of the Popiſh Countries, above
one Moyetie belonging to Churchmen, Monks, Fryars, and
Nunns, who like Droans, ſpends the Fat of the Land, without
contributing any thing to the good of mankind, renders them
much the leſs conſiderable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Marriage being forbidden to all theſe Sorts, and
Orders, occaſions great want of people every where, (they
being uncapable of any Children but thoſe of darkneſs) except in
<hi>France,</hi> which is an extraordinary Caſe, proceeding partly, by
not being ſo ſubject to <hi>Rome,</hi> as other Countries of that belief
are; but eſpecially from the Multitude of Proteſtants, that are
among them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The blind Devotion of theſe People, carrying them
on to vaſt expences, in the building, and richly adorning of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
needleſs and ſuperfluous Churches, Chapells, and Croſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
with the making chargeable Preſents by the better, and Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98342:11"/>
by the meaner ſort, to their Idolls, keeps all degrees
under.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The many Holydayes, upon which, the labouring
man is forbidden to work, adds much to their poverty.</p>
            <p>But Fifthly and Laſtly, The vaſt number of begging Fryars,
who living Idly, and purely upon the ſweat of other mens brows,
without taking any labour themſelves, makes it impoſſible,
for the lower ſort of people, who thinks they are bound in
Conſcience to relieve them, ever to get above a mean Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Now whoſoever ſhall ſeriouſly weigh and ponder theſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
under which the Popiſh Countries lyes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the Reformeds advantage in being free from them, muſt
confeſs it the leſs wonder, that the Evangelical Princes, and
States, with their ſmall Dominions, compared to the others
great, are able to bear up againſt them; and now as the alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Church-lands, the turning out the Romiſh Vermin, the
Prieſt, Monks, Fryars, and Nunns, (who devours all Countries
where ever they come) and freedom from the Popiſh Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon Conſcience, hath mightily increaſed the greatneſs of the
Proteſtant Princes, and States, to what they antiently were,
and the not doing the ſame in the Popiſh Countries, keeps thoſe
Princes under; ſo, even amongſt the Reformed, where the
Church Lands are moſt alienated, and Liberty of Conſcience
moſt given, they proſper moſt, as in <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſome parts
in <hi>Germany,</hi> with other places. And on the contrary <hi>Denmark,</hi>
where Church Lands are leaſt alienated of any of the Reformed
Countries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the City of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> where, of all the free Imperial
Cities of <hi>Germany</hi> Liberty of Conſcience is leaſt given they thrive
leaſt in both places. And I think it will alſo hold, that as this
famous Kingdome, in the times of Popery, was in no meaſure ſo
formidable as now it is; ſo before the Reſtauration of our Hierarchie
to their Lands, their hoording up the money which before went
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98342:11"/>
in Trade, and their diſcouraging and driving into corners the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious
ſort of people, by impoſing upon their Conſciences, it
flouriſhed more, was richer, and fuller of Trade, than now it is;
And I dare undertake to be a Prophet in this, That if ever any
Proteſtant Countrey, ſhould be ſo farr forſaken of the Lord as
to be ſuffered to turn unto Popery, theſe Obſervations will be
made good in their viſible loſſe of the Splendor, Riches, Power,
and Greatneſs, that they now know.</p>
            <p>Had <hi>Cromwell</hi> been a Perſon of an open prophane Life, his
Actions had been leſs ſcandalous; but having been a Profeſſor of
Religion, they are not to be pleaded for, neither can it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
with Religion to palliate them which have been of
ſo much offence, and (as may be feared) made ſo many
Atheiſts in the World; And I cannot but ſtand amazed,
when I hear him extolled by ſome, not Ignorant of his
Practiſes, knowing in Religion, and (as I hope) fearing
God.</p>
            <p>Now I will ſuppoſe, I may be ſuſpected to have been injured, or
diſobliged by <hi>Oliver;</hi> but I can with Truth affirm, I never recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
either Good or Evil from him in all my Life, more than in
Common with the whole Kingdom (which I think may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to render me the more a Competent Judge in his Caſe;) and
that I am ſo farr from being moved unto this, out of any quarrel
to him, that, as I have here mentioned, ſome few of many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtices,
and State-errors, that he was guilty of in his ſhort
time, If I were conſcious of any thing more, during his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectorſhip,
worthy applauſe, than I have here mentioned, I ſhould
not envy it him, but freely remember it; and if any think I have
not ſaid enough on his behalf, and too much to his diſadvantage,
I have this for my Buckler, that I wiſh I could have ſaid more
for him, and had known leſs againſt him; profeſſing, that beſides
what I have here hinted, I am wholly ignorant of any one Action
in all his Four Years and Nine Moneths time, done either
wiſely, Vertuouſly, or for the Intereſt of this Kingdom, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98342:12"/>
therefore that I am none of his Admirers, I ought to be pardoned
by my Readers.</p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid upon this Subject, but this may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to ſhew, that if <hi>Mazerine</hi> (at the hearing of <hi>Olivers</hi> death)
thought he had then reaſon for calling him a Fortunate Fool, if
he were now living he would finde more Cauſe for it, <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s
Lott, as to Reputation, having been exceedingly much greater
ſince his death, than whilſt he was in the World: And that
from forgetfulneſs of his impolitick Government, (from whoſe
Entrance we may date the commencement of our Trades decay;)
And (through want of memory) in mens giving to him the
Cauſe of our former Wealth and Proſperity, which truly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to others. But what opinion ſoever <hi>Mazerine</hi> may have had
of <hi>Oliver,</hi> he was without all peradventure a Perſon of more
than ordinary Wit, and no otherwiſe a Fool than as he wanted
Honeſty, no Man being wiſe but an Honeſt Man.</p>
