         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>PRefaces being generally to prepossess the Reader of a good Opinion of the Performance, how trifling soever; and commonly, Mountebank like, the meaner the Book the more Encomiums in the Preface; which you will be deceived of here, for I shall only give you matter of Fact, how this Book came to be publish'd.</p>
            <p>About four months ago I sent into the World a Collection of Poems on <hi>Affairs of State,</hi> from the time of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> to the time of King <hi>James II.</hi> Written by the greatest Wits of the Age, <hi>viz.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Lord <hi>Rochester,</hi> Lord <hi>B—st,</hi> Mr. <hi>Milton, And. Marvell</hi> Esquire, Mr. <hi>Sprat,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Waller, &amp;c.</hi> which being found to be genuine, met with good Acceptance; Since that Book came out, a great many excellent Poems have been sent me from very good hands, pressing to have a Continuation thereof made, which at last I resolved to do, upon the receiving some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of Verses printed at <hi>Oxford, 1654.</hi> in praise of <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> on his making Peace with the <hi>Dutch</hi>; finding several Persons, who now make the greatest figure in the Common-wealth of Learning to be concerned therein, I thought the World would be willing to see what such Great Men
<pb facs="tcp:35158:3"/>
as Dr. <hi>South,</hi> Mr. <hi>Locke, &amp;c.</hi> said on such an extraordinary Occasion, I have printed their own <hi>Latin,</hi> and kept strictly to their Sense in the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and those they wrote in <hi>English</hi> are also pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, this begins the Book. Then follow several excellent Poems, written by the Lord <hi>Rochester,</hi> Esquire <hi>Marvell, &amp;c.</hi> during the Reign of King <hi>Charles II.</hi> omitted in the former Collection: As also those writ in the Reign of King <hi>James II.</hi> by the Lord <hi>D—t.</hi> Sir <hi>F. S</hi>—, Mr. <hi>Prior,</hi> Mr. <hi>Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rymer,</hi> &amp;c. and particularly those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Pieces of the <hi>Hind</hi> and <hi>Panther</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd to the Story of the <hi>City-Mouse</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Mouse,</hi> and the <hi>Man of Honour,</hi> written by the Honourable Mr. <hi>M—ue.</hi> And since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, you have several Copies, writ by the Lord <hi>Cutts,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tate,</hi> Mr. <hi>Shadwell,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ayloffe, &amp;c.</hi> Lastly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some Miscellany Poems, by the same Great Men, <hi>never before Printed.</hi> And in this Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Names are not made use of to countenance spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Pieces, but the Poems themselves speak the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Authors, if no Name had been thereto.</p>
            <p>In short the said <hi>State-Poems,</hi> and this <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation</hi> thereof, make a <hi>Compleat Collection</hi> of all that are valuable in that nature, for these forty years; and is the best <hi>Secret History</hi> of our late Reigns, as being writ by such great Persons as were near the Helm, knew the Transactions, and were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove being brib'd to flatter, or afraid to speak truth. And so I leave them to the Reader.</p>

               <l>WHen <hi>Iames,</hi> our great Monarch, so wise and discreet,</l>
               <l>Was gone with three Barges to face the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet,</l>

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:35158:14"/>Our young Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> by Inheritance stout,</l>
               <l>Was going to aid him, and peep'd his Head out.</l>
               <l>But seeing his Father, without Ships or Men,</l>
               <l>Commit the Defence of us all to a Chain,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Taffy</hi> was frighted and sculk'd in again.</l>
               <l>Nor thought, while the <hi>Dutch</hi> domineer'd in our Road</l>
               <l>It was safe to come further and venture abroad.</l>
               <l>Not <hi>Walgrave,</hi> or th' Epistle of <hi>Seigneur le Duke</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Made her Majesty sick, and her Royal Womb puke;</l>
               <l>But the <hi>Dutch-men</hi> picqueering at <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Harwich,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Gave the Ministers agues and the Queen a miscarriage,</l>
               <l>And to see the poor King stand of Ships in such need,</l>
               <l>Made the Catholicks quake, and her Majesty bleed.</l>
               <l>I wish the sad Accident dont spoil the young Prince,</l>
               <l>Take off all his Manhood, and make him a Wench.</l>
               <l>But the <hi>Hero,</hi> his Father, no Courage did lack,</l>
               <l>Who was sorry on such a pretext to come back.</l>
               <l>He mark'd out his Ground, and mounted a Gun,</l>
               <l>And 'tis thought, without such a pretence he had run.</l>
               <l>For his Army and Navy were said to increase,</l>
               <l>As appears (when we have no occasion) in Peace.</l>
               <l>Nay, if the <hi>Dutch</hi> come, we despise them so much</l>
               <l>Our Navy <hi>incognito</hi> will leave them i'th' lurch;</l>
               <l>And to their eternal Disgrace we are able</l>
               <l>To beat 'em by way of a Post and a Cable.</l>
               <l>Why was this Sir, left out of the wise Declaration</l>
               <l>That flatter'd with hopes of more Forces the Nation,</l>
               <l>'Twould have done us great Good to have said you intended</l>
               <l>The Strength of the Nation, the Chain should be mended.</l>
               <l>Tho we thank you for passing so kindly your word,</l>

               <l>To be a Revenge, and as Malice forecast,</l>
               <l>Upon the King's Birth-day to set up a thing</l>
               <l>That shews him a Monkey more like than a King.</l>
               <l>When each one that passes finds fault with the Horse,</l>

               <l>Who upon their Panniers more decently ride.</l>
               <l>So loose are his Feet that all Men agree,</l>
               <l>Sir <hi>William Peak</hi> sits much faster than he.</l>
               <l>But a Market, as some say, doth fit the King well,</l>
               <l>Who oft Parliaments buys and Revenues doth sell:</l>
               <l>And others to make the similitude hold,</l>
               <l>Say his Majesty himself is oft bought and sold.</l>
               <l>Sure this Statue is more dangerous far,</l>
               <l>Than all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Pictures that caused the War.</l>
               <l>And what the <hi>Exchequer</hi> for that took on trust,</l>
               <l>May henceforth be confiscate for Reasons most just.</l>
               <l>But Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> to take the Scandal away,</l>
               <l>Does the fault upon the Artificer lay;</l>
               <l>And alleges the thing is none of his own,</l>
               <l>For he counterfeits only in Gold, not in Stone.</l>
               <l>But Sir <hi>Robert</hi> of the <hi>Vine,</hi> how cam't in your thought,</l>
               <l>That when to the scaffold your Liege you had brought,</l>
               <l>With Canvas and Deals you e'er since do him cloud,</l>
               <l>As if you had meant it his Coffin and Shrowd?</l>
               <l>Hath <hi>Blood</hi> him away as his Crown he convey'd?</l>
               <l>Or is he to <hi>Clayton</hi> gone in masquerade?</l>
               <l>Or is he now in his Cabal closely set?</l>
               <l>Or have you to the <hi>Compter</hi> remov'd him for debt?</l>
               <l>Methinks by the equipage of this vile Scene,</l>

               <l>As tho we'd as good have a King of a Clout.</l>
               <l>Or do you his Errors out of Modesty veil,</l>
               <l>With three shatter'd Planks and the rags of a Sail?</l>
               <l>To expose how his Navy was shatter'd and torn,</l>

               <l>If the Judges and Parliament dont him inrich,</l>
               <l>You will scarcely afford him a Rag to his Breech.</l>

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:35158:21"/>Sir <hi>Robert</hi> affirms they do him much Wrong,</l>
               <l>'Tis the Graver at work to reform him so long.</l>
               <l>But alas he will never arrive at his End,</l>

               <l>NOW <hi>Painter</hi> try if thy skill'd hand can draw,</l>
               <l>The horrid'st Scene the trembling World e'er saw.</l>
               <l>Wipe all your Pencils that the former drew,</l>
               <l>In dismal colours dip them all anew;</l>
               <l>Colours that may in lively parts express</l>
               <l>The plotted Fall of Monarchs; in a Dress</l>
               <l>May fright the World: Crimes which we can't atone</l>
               <l>With our best Blood, and Christians blush to own.</l>
               <l>But let me first advise you, e'er you take</l>
               <l>This work in hand, a small Reflection make,</l>
               <l>Of all that's heinous, Murthers, Treasons, Fires,</l>
               <l>Perjuries, Incests, Rapines, hot Desires</l>
               <l>Of murthering Kings, I tremble to rehearse,</l>
               <l>A tottering World and sinking Universe.</l>
               <l>Think well on these, e'er you begin the part,</l>
               <l>'Twill heighten Fancy, and affect your Heart.</l>
               <l>In the upper part of all the Canvas paint</l>
               <l>His Holiness the Pope, that mighty Saint,</l>
               <l>Old <hi>Satan</hi> his Associate too must stand</l>
               <l>Behind his Chair, to guide his heart and hand.</l>
               <l>Draw him stuck round with all the Toys that come,</l>
               <l>From the grand Mint of Lies, old foppish <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <l>When on such Terms as these you would be great.</l>

               <l>These base low tricks could never sure controul;</l>
               <l>But when a Mind's so firm on mischief bent,</l>
               <l>No thoughts of Honour can its Crimes prevent.</l>
               <l>In meanest Actions Princes should be true,</l>

               <l>Then they are sacred to the World and ought</l>

               <l>But when both base, degenerate they're grown,</l>
               <l>The Vulgar hurl them headlong from the Throne.</l>
               <l>Go on, vile Prince, in all these Arts and try</l>
               <l>How soon your Crown will fade, your Empire die.</l>

               <l>And may their first attempt be on thy Head,</l>

               <l>VVhen I dare boldly say, if the Truth were but known,</l>
               <l>The VVeakness of <hi>Patrick,</hi> and Strength of his own;</l>
               <l>He'd have call'd it a Madness, and much like a Curse,</l>
               <l>To have chang'd from a good one, to that which is worse;</l>
               <l>But the reasons which made most his Highness to yield,</l>
               <l>And so willingly quit to S. <hi>Patrick</hi> the Field,</l>
               <l>VVere —</l>
               <l>First, Sir, they cheat you, and leave you i'th' Lurch,</l>
               <l>VVho tell you there can be any more than one Church.</l>
               <l>And, next unto that he averr'd for a certain;</l>
               <l>No Footsteps of ours could be found before <hi>Martin.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>At which two Reasons, so deep and profound,</l>
               <l>His Highness had like to have fall'n in a Swoon;</l>
               <l>But at length he cry'd out, Father <hi>Patrick,</hi> I find</l>
               <l>By the sudden Conversion, and Change of my mind,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:35158:34"/>It is not your Reason, nor VVit can afford</l>
               <l>Such Strength to your Cause; 'tis the Finger o'th'Lord,</l>
               <l>For now I remember he somewhere has said,</l>
               <l>That by Babes and Sucklings his Truth is convey'd.</l>
               <l>Thus ends the dispute 'twixt the Priest and the Knight,</l>
               <l>In which, to say truth, and to do 'em both right,</l>
               <l>He manag'd the Cause, as he did the Sea-fight.</l>

                  <l>Is like her Life, which make up but one Jest,</l>
                  <l>Of all her Jokes this Mourning is the best.</l>
                  <l>As Jews, descended from the High-Priests Race,</l>
                  <l>Were thought the fittest to supply that place,</l>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE Favourers of the <hi>Hind</hi> and <hi>Panther</hi> will be apt to say in its Defence, That the best things are capable of being turn'd to Ridicule; that <hi>Homer</hi> has been Burlesqu'd, and <hi>Virgil</hi> Travested without suffering any thing in their Reputation from that Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry; and that in like manner, the <hi>Hind</hi> and the <hi>Panther</hi> may be an Exact Poem, though 'tis the Subject of our Raillery: But there is this difference, That those Authors are wrested from their true Sense, and This naturally falls into Ridicule; there is nothing Represented here as monstrous and unnatural, which is not equally so in the Original. First as to the General Design, Is it not as easy to imagine two <hi>Mice</hi> bilk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coachmen, and supping at the <hi>Devil,</hi> as to suppose a <hi>Hind</hi> entertaining the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> at a <hi>Hermit's Cell,</hi> discussing the greatest Mysteries of Religion, and telling you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her Son <hi>Rodriguez</hi> writ very good Spanish? What can be more improbable and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:35158:39"/>
contradictory to the Rules and Examples of all Fables, and to the very design and use of them? They were first begun and raised to the highest Perfection in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries; where they wrote in Signs, and spoke in Parables, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the most useful Precepts in delightful Stories; which for their Aptness were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining to the most Iudicious, and led the Vulgar into understanding by surprizing them with their Novelty, and fixing their Attention. All their Fables carry a double meaning; the Story is one and intire; the Characters the same throughout, not broken or chang'd, and always conformable to the Nature of the Creatures they intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. They never tell you that the Dog which snapt at a Shadow, lost his Troop of Horse, That would be unintelligible; a piece of Flesh is proper for him to drop, and the Reader will apply it to Mankind; they would not say that the Daw, who was so proud of her borrow'd Plumes, lookt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ridiculous when <hi>Rodriguez</hi> came and took away all the Book but the <hi>17</hi>th, <hi>24</hi>th, and <hi>25</hi>th Chapters, which she stole from him: But this is his new way of telling a Story, and confounding the <hi>Moral</hi> and the <hi>Fable</hi> together.</p>
                  <q>

                     <l>Before the Word was written, said the Hind,</l>
                     <l>Our Saviour Preacht the Faith to all Mankind.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>What relation has the <hi>Hind</hi> to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? Or what notion have we of a <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's</hi> Bible? If you say he means the Church, how does the Church feed on Lawns, or range in the Forest? Let it be always a Church, or always the cloven-footed Beast, for we cannot bear his shifting the Scene every Line. If it is absurd in Comedies to make a Peasant talk in the strain of a <hi>Hero,</hi> or a Country Wench use the Language of the Court; how monstrous is it to make a Priest of a Hind, and a Parson of a Panther? To bring 'em in disputing with all the Formalities and Terms of the School? Though as to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themselves, those, we confess, are suited to the Capacity of the Beasts; and if we would suppose a Hind expressing her self about these Matters, she would talk at that Rate.</p>
                  <p>As to the Absurdity of his Expressions, there is nothing wrested to make 'em ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, the terms are sometimes alter'd to make the Blunder more visible; <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35158:40"/>
misunderstood</hi> is not at all better sense than <hi>Understanding misunderstood,</hi> though 'tis confest the Author can play with words so well, that this and twenty such will pass off at a slight reading.</p>
                  <p>There are other mistakes which could not be brought in, for they were too gross for <hi>Bayes</hi> himself to commit. 'Tis hard to conceive how any Man could censure the <hi>Turks</hi> for Gluttony; a People that debauch in Coffee, are voluptuous in a mess of Rice, and keep the strictest <hi>Lent,</hi> without the Pleasures of a <hi>Carnival</hi> to encourage them. But 'tis almost impossible to think that any Man who had not renounced his Senses, should read <hi>Duncomb</hi> for <hi>Allen:</hi> He had been told that Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Discourse of Humility;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Difference betwixt a</hi> Protestant <hi>and</hi> Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, <hi>p. 62.</hi>
                     </note> to which he wisely answers, That that magnified Piece of <hi>Duncomb</hi>'s was Translated from the <hi>Spanish</hi> of <hi>Rodriguez</hi>; and to set it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond dispute,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Page 92.</hi>
                     </note> makes the infallible Guide affirm the same thing. There are few mistakes, but one may imagine how a Man fell into them, and at least what he aim'd at; but what likeness is there between <hi>Duncomb</hi> and <hi>Allen?</hi> do they so much as Rhime?</p>
                  <p>We may have this comfort under the severity of his Satyr, to see his Abilities
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35158:40"/>
equally lessen'd with his Opinion of us; and that he could not be a fit Champion against the <hi>Panther</hi> till he had laid aside all his Iudgment. But we must applaud his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his new Mother <hi>Hind</hi>;<note place="margin">

                     </note> she <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin'd</hi> him severely, she commanded him, it seems, to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> his <hi>darling Fame,</hi> and to do it effectually he publisht this learned Piece. This is the favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction we would put on his Faults, though he takes care to inform us, that it was done from no Imposition,<note place="margin">

                     </note> but out of a natural Propensity he has to Malice, and a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Inclination of doing Mischief. What else could provoke him to <hi>Libel the Court,</hi>

about, and destroy his Friends, and like a second <hi>Almanzor,</hi> change sides meerly to keep his hand in ure. This Heroick Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of his, has created him some Enemies, that did by no means affect Hostility; and he may observe this Candor in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, that none of his Works are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in these Papers, but his last Piece; and I believe he is sensible this is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. I was not ambitious of Laughing at any Persuasion, or making Religion the Subject of such a Trifle; so that no man is here concerned, but the Author himself, and nothing ridicul'd but his way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>But, Gentlemen, if you won't take it so, you must grant my Excuse is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable than our Author's to the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

Now it happen'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I could finish this Piece, the Scheme of Affairs was altered, and those People were no longer Beasts: Here was a Plunge now: Should I lose my Labour, or Libel my Friend? 'Tis not every Body's Talent to find a <hi>Salvo</hi> for this: But what do me I but write a smooth delicate Preface, wherein I tell them, that <hi>the Satyr was not intended to them,</hi> and this did the Business.</p>

one may write a very good <hi>polemical</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, without ever troubling one's head with the Books of <hi>Controversy.</hi> For I can take the slightest of their Arguments, and clap 'em pertly into four Verses, which shall stare any <hi>London Divine</hi> in the face.

               <l>Which yet we must confess you need not do:</l>
               <l>The labour to expose thee we may save,</l>
               <l>Thou stand'st upon thy own Records, a Knave;</l>
               <l>Condemn'd to live in thy Apostate Rhimes,</l>
               <l>The Curse of Outs, and Scoff of Future Times.</l>

               <l>Is always at a change to come too late:</l>
               <l>To keep his Plots from Coxcombs was his Care,</l>
               <l>His Policy was mask'd, and thine is bare:</l>
               <l>

               <l>And cou'd but guess, the Thred was spun so fine:</l>
               <l>But every pur-blind Fool may see through thine.</l>
               <l>Had <hi>Dick</hi> still kept the Regal Diadem,</l>
               <l>Thou hadst been Poet Laureat to him,</l>
               <l>And, long e're now, in Lofty Verse proclaim'd</l>
               <l>His high Extraction, among Princes Fam'd;</l>
               <l>Diffus'd his Glorious Deeds from Pole to Pole,</l>
               <l>Where Winds can carry, and where Waves can rowl.</l>
               <l>Nay, had our <hi>Charles,</hi> by Heav'ns severe Decree,</l>
               <l>Been found, and Murther'd in the Royal Tree,</l>
               <l>Ev'n thou hadst prais'd the Fact; his Father slain,</l>
               <l>Thou call'dst but gently breathing of a Vein:</l>
               <l>Impious and Villanous! to bless the blow</l>
               <l>That laid at once three lofty Nations low,</l>
               <l>And gave the Royal Cause a fatal Overthrow.</l>
               <l>What after this cou'd we expect from thee?</l>
               <l>What cou'd we hope for, but just what we see?</l>
               <l>Scandal to all Religions, New and Old;</l>
               <l>Scandal to thine, where Pardon's bought and sold,</l>
               <l>And Mortgag'd Happiness redeem'd for Gold:</l>
               <l>Tell me, for 'tis a Truth you must allow;</l>
               <l>Who ever chang'd more in one Moon, than thou?</l>
               <l>Even thy own <hi>Zimri</hi> was more stedfast known?</l>
               <l>He had but one Religion, or had none:</l>
               <l>What Sect of Christians is't thou hast not known,</l>
               <l>And at one time or other made thy own?</l>
               <l>A Bristled <hi>Baptist</hi> bred; and then thy Strain</l>
               <l>Immaculate, was free from sinful Stain.</l>
               <l>No Songs in those blest times thou didst produce</l>
               <l>To brand and sham good Manners out of use:</l>
               <l>The Ladies then had not one Bawdy Bob,</l>
               <l>Nor thou the Courtly Name of Poet Squab.</l>
               <l>Next thy dull Muse, an <hi>Independent</hi> Jade,</l>
               <l>On sacred Tyranny five Stanza's made,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:35158:70"/>Prais'd <hi>Noll,</hi> who ev'n to both extreams did run,</l>
               <l>To kill the Father, and dethrone the Son.</l>
               <l>When <hi>Charles</hi> came in, thou didst a Convert grow,</l>
               <l>More by thy Int'rest, than thy Nature so.</l>
               <l>Under his livening Beams thy Laurels spread;</l>
               <l>He first did place that Wreath about thy Head;</l>
               <l>Kindly reliev'd thy wants, and gave thee Bread.</l>
               <l>Here 'twas thou mad'st the Bells of Fancy Chime,</l>
               <l>And choak'd the Town with suffocating Rhime.</l>
               <l>Till Heroes form'd by thy Creating Pen,</l>
               <l>Were grown as Cheap, and Dull, as other Men.</l>
               <l>Flush'd with Success, full Gallery, and Pit,</l>
               <l>Thou bravest all Mankind with want of Wit.</l>
               <l>Nay, in short time, wer't grown so proud a Ninny,</l>
               <l>As scarce t'allow that <hi>Ben</hi> himself had any.</l>
               <l>But when the Men of Sense thy Error saw,</l>
               <l>They check'd thy Muse, and kept the Termagant in awe.</l>
               <l>To Satyr next thy Talent was Addrest,</l>
               <l>Fell foul on all, thy Friends among the rest:</l>
               <l>Those who the oft'nest did thy wants supply,</l>
               <l>Abus'd, Traduc'd, without a reason why.</l>
               <l>Nay, ev'n thy Royal Patron was not spar'd,</l>
               <l>But an obscene, a santring Wretch declar'd.</l>
               <l>Thy Loyal Libel we can still produce,</l>
               <l>Beyond Example, and beyond Excuse.</l>
               <l>O strange return, to a forgiving King!</l>
               <l>But the warm'd Viper wears the greatest Sting.</l>
               <l>Thy Pension lost, and justly without doubt,</l>
               <l>When Servants snarl, we ought to kick 'em out;</l>
               <l>They that disdain their Benefactors Bread,</l>
               <l>No longer ought by Bounty to be fed.</l>
               <l>That lost, the Vizor chang'd, you turn about,</l>
               <l>And strait a True-blue Protestant crept out;</l>
               <l>The <hi>Frier</hi> now was writ; and some will say</l>
               <l>They smell a Malecontent through all the Play.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:35158:70"/>The <hi>Papist</hi> too was damn'd, unfit for Trust,</l>
               <l>Call'd Treacherous, Shameless, Profligate, Unjust,</l>
               <l>And Kingly Pow'r thought Arbitrary Lust.</l>
               <l>This lasted till thou didst thy Pension gain,</l>
               <l>And that chang'd both thy Morals, and thy Strain.</l>
               <l>If to write Contradictions, Nonsense be,</l>
               <l>Who has more Nonsense in their Works than thee?</l>
               <l>We'll mention but thy <hi>Lay-mans Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hind,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who'd think both these (such clashing do we find)</l>
               <l>Cou'd be the product of one single Mind:</l>
               <l>Here thou wou'dst Charitable fain appear,</l>
               <l>Find'st fault that <hi>Athanasius</hi> was severe;</l>
               <l>Thy Pity straight to Cruelty is rais'd,</l>
               <l>And even the pious Inquisition prais'd,</l>
               <l>And recommended to the present Reign:</l>
               <l>"O happy Countries, <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Have we not Cause, in thy own Words, to say,</l>
               <l>Let none believe what varies every day,</l>
               <l>That never was, nor will be at a stay.</l>
               <l>Once, Heathens might be sav'd, you did allow;</l>
               <l>But not, it seems, we greater Heathens now:</l>
               <l>The Loyal Church, that buoys the Kingly Line,</l>
               <l>Damn'd with a Breath, but 'tis such Breath as thine:</l>
               <l>What credit to thy Party can it be,</l>
               <l>T' have gain'd so lewd a Profligate as thee?</l>
               <l>Stray'd from our Fold, makes us but laugh, not weep;</l>
               <l>We have but lost what was disgrace to keep:</l>
               <l>By them Mistrusted, and to us a Scorn;</l>
               <l>For it is Weakness at the best to turn.</l>
               <l>True, hadst thou left us in the former Reign,</l>
               <l>T' have prov'd, it was not wholly done for Gain;</l>
               <l>Now, the Meridian Sun is not so plain.</l>
               <l>Gold is thy God, for a substantial Sum,</l>
               <l>Thou to the <hi>Turk</hi> wou'dst run away from <hi>Rome,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And sing his Holy Expedition against <hi>Christendom.</hi>

               <l>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:35158:71"/>But to conclude, blush with a lasting Red,</l>
               <l>(If thou'rt not mov'd with what's already said)</l>

               <l>And all thy other Beasts, and other Fowls,</l>
               <l>Routed by two poor Mice: (Unequal fight)</l>
               <l>But easy 'tis to Conquer in the Right.</l>
               <l>See there a Youth (a shame to thy gray Hairs)</l>
               <l>Make a meer Dunce of all thy threescore Years.</l>
               <l>What in that tedious Poem hast thou done,</l>
               <l>But cramm'd all <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Fables into one.</l>
               <l>But why do I the precious Minutes spend</l>
               <l>On him, that wou'd much rather hang, than mend.</l>
               <l>No, Wretch, continue still just as thou art,</l>
               <l>Thou'rt now in this last Scene, that Crowns thy part;</l>
               <l>To purchase Favour, veer with every Gale,</l>

               <l>I've made thy haughty Domineerers bow,</l>

               <l>A Drudgery so great my Pen declines,</l>
               <l>Content to sum up all in these four Lines.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Greece</hi> boasts seven Sages, but the Story lies,</l>
               <l>For the whole World ne'r saw one truly Wise:</l>
               <l>All Men are Mad; and the sole Difference</l>

               <l>By which all Foreign <hi>Tyrannies</hi> were aw'd,</l>
               <l>Easie we were at <hi>home,</hi> and <hi>Terrible abroad.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>All our wise <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Empire</hi> were design'd</l>
               <l>Not for the <hi>Lust</hi> of one, but good of <hi>all Mankind</hi>;</l>
               <l>The great <hi>Prerogative</hi> was understood</l>
               <l>A vast <hi>unbounded</hi> pow'r of doing good:</l>
               <l>From doing ill, by <hi>Laws</hi> it was confin'd;</l>

               <l>By <hi>Ancient Usages</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> they sway'd,</l>
               <l>Which both were by the choice of <hi>Subjects</hi> made.</l>
               <l>Old <hi>Customs</hi> grew to <hi>Laws</hi> by <hi>long Consent,</hi>

               <l>Freedom in <hi>Boroughs,</hi> and in Land Freehold,</l>
               <l>Gave all, who had them, Voices, uncontroul'd:</l>
               <l>But few <hi>new Rights</hi> were by <hi>new Laws</hi> obtain'd,</l>
               <l>Only some <hi>ravish'd Liberties</hi> regain'd.</l>
               <l>Who had no <hi>Voices,</hi> yet alike were <hi>bound</hi>
               </l>
               <l>By the <hi>Protection,</hi> which from <hi>Laws</hi> they found;</l>
               <l>For every one in those had <hi>equal right,</hi>
               </l>

               <l>This was the <hi>Constitution</hi> of our <hi>State,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And true <hi>Religion</hi> flourish'd in its height:</l>

               <l>Thus we enjoy'd a happy Union,</l>
               <l>Under the great <hi>Eliza,</hi> perfect grown,</l>

               <l>Whereof is in our Constitution found.</l>
               <l>Thus they, by Ecclesiastick Flattery,</l>
               <l>Turn'd Kings to Tyrants, and to Slaves the free;</l>
               <l>These Furious Fools yet Wise Divines contemn'd,</l>
               <l>And their rash Doctrines, privately condemn'd;</l>
               <l>None dare in publick say they were unsound,</l>
               <l>But Fines, and Pillories, and Brands, were found.</l>
               <l>For now Commission'd from above the Sky,</l>
               <l>Kings soon were deem'd for Laws and Oaths too high;</l>

               <l>Some like <hi>Iaccals,</hi> before him prey'd for Blood,</l>

               <l>For three vile <hi>English</hi> Bishops, and twelve Scots.</l>
               <l>Then Valiant <hi>Fairfax</hi> and brave <hi>Hough</hi> made head,</l>
               <l>But by these Monsters were discomfited;</l>
               <l>And now the trembling Church began to reel,</l>

               <l>Seven Suffering Heroes gave it such a shock,</l>
               <l>It seem'd to dash its Surges on a Rock;</l>

                  <l>I travell'd farther for your Love,</l>
                  <l>Than <hi>Sheba</hi>'s Queen; I'll fairly prove.</l>
                  <l>She from the <hi>South,</hi> 'tis said, did rome,</l>
                  <l>And I as far from <hi>East</hi> did come.</l>
                  <l>But here the difference does arise,</l>
                  <l>Though equally we sought the Prize;</l>
                  <l>What that great Queen desir'd she gain'd,</l>
                  <l>But I soon found your Treasury drain'd,</l>
                  <l>Your Veins corrupted in your Youth,</l>
                  <l>'Tis sad Experience tells this Truth:</l>
                  <l>Though I had Caution long before</l>
                  <l>Of that which I too late deplore.</l>

                  <l>Pray, Madam, let me silence break,</l>
                  <l>As I have you, now hear me speak.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:35158:98"/>These Stories sure must please you well,</l>
                  <l>You're apt so often them to tell.</l>
                  <l>But, if you'll smooth your Brow a while,</l>
                  <l>And turn that Pout into a Smile,</l>
                  <l>I doubt not, but to make't appear,</l>
                  <l>That you the great'st Aggressor are.</l>
                  <l>I took you with an empty Purse,</l>
                  <l>Which was to me no trivial Curse;</l>
                  <l>No Dowry could your Parents give;</l>
                  <l>They'd but a Competence to live.</l>
                  <l>When you appear'd, your Charming Eyes</l>
                  <l>(As you relate) did me surprize</l>
                  <l>With Wonder, not with Admiration;</l>
                  <l>Astonishment, but no Temptation:</l>
                  <l>Nor did I see in all your Frame,</l>
                  <l>Ought could create an am'rous Flame,</l>
                  <l>Or raise the least Desire in me,</l>
                  <l>Save only for Variety.</l>
                  <l>I paid such Service as was due,</l>
                  <l>Worthy my self, and worthy you:</l>
                  <l>Caress'd you far above the rate</l>
                  <l>Both of your Birth, and your Estate.</l>
                  <l>When soon I found your haughty mind</l>
                  <l>Was unto Sov'raignty inclin'd;</l>
                  <l>And first you practis'd over me</l>
                  <l>The heavy Yoke of Tyranny,</l>
                  <l>While I your Property was made,</l>
                  <l>And you, not I, was still obey'd:</l>
                  <l>Nor durst I call my Soul my own,</l>
                  <l>You manag'd me as if I'd none.</l>
                  <l>I took such measures as you gave,</l>
                  <l>All Day your Fool, all Night your Slave.</l>
                  <l>Nor was Ambition bounded here,</l>
                  <l>You still resolve your Course to steer:</l>
                  <l>All that oppose you, you remove;</l>
                  <l>'Twas much you'd own the Pow'rs above.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:35158:99"/>Now several Stratagems you try,</l>
                  <l>And I'm in all forc'd to comply:</l>
                  <l>To Mother Church you take Recourse,</l>
                  <l>She tells you 'tmust be done by force;</l>
                  <l>And you, impatient of delay,</l>
                  <l>Contrive and execute the way.</l>
                  <l>When mounted to the place you sought,</l>
                  <l>It no Contentment with it brought:</l>
                  <l>One Tree within your Prospect stood</l>
                  <l>Fairest and tallest of the Wood:</l>
                  <l>Which to your prospect gave offence,</l>
                  <l>And it must be remov'd from thence.</l>
                  <l>In this you also are obey'd,</l>
                  <l>While all the fault on me is laid.</l>
                  <l>Now you was quiet for a while,</l>
                  <l>As flatt'ring Weather seems to smile,</l>
                  <l>Till buzzing Beetles of the Night</l>
                  <l>Had found fresh matter for your spite,</l>
                  <l>And set to work your busy Brain,</l>
                  <l>Which took Fire quickly from their Train.</l>
                  <l>Some Wise, some Valiant, you remove,</l>
                  <l>'Cause they your Maxims don't approve;</l>
                  <l>And in their stead such Creatures place,</l>
                  <l>Which to th'Employments bring disgrace:</l>
                  <l>While whatsoe're you do I own,</l>
                  <l>And still the dirt on me is thrown.</l>
                  <l>Straight new Chimera's fill your Brain,</l>
                  <l>The humming Beetles buz again;</l>
                  <l>A Goal-Delivery now must be,</l>
                  <l>All tender Consciences set free;</l>
                  <l>Not out of Zeal, but pure Design</l>
                  <l>To make Dissenters with us join,</l>
                  <l>To pull down Test and Penal Laws,</l>
                  <l>The Bulwark of the Hereticks Cause.</l>
                  <l>The sly Dissenters laugh the while,</l>
                  <l>They see where lurks the Serpent's guile;</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:35158:99"/>And rather than with us comply,</l>
                  <l>Will on our Enemies rely.</l>
                  <l>The Chieftains of the Protestant Cause,</l>
                  <l>We did confine, though 'gainst the Laws:</l>
                  <l>But soon was glad to set 'em free,</l>
                  <l>Fearing the giddy Mobile.</l>
                  <l>Now all is turning upside-down,</l>
                  <l>Loud Murmurings in every Town;</l>
                  <l>We've Foes abroad, and Foes at home,</l>
                  <l>Armies and Fleets against us come:</l>
                  <l>The Protestants do laugh the while,</l>
                  <l>And the Dissenters sneer and smile;</l>
                  <l>But no assistance either sends;</l>
                  <l>They're neither Enemies nor Friends.</l>
                  <l>Now pray conclude what must be done,</l>
                  <l>Consult your Oracle of <hi>ROME,</hi>

               <l>I waited, while the Clock struck Thrice,</l>
               <l>And Footman brought out fifty Lies;</l>
               <l>Till Patience vext, and Legs grown weary,</l>
               <l>I thought it was in vain to tarry:</l>
               <l>But did Opine it might be better,</l>
               <l>By Penny-post to send a Letter.</l>
               <l>Now, if you miss of this Epistle,</l>
               <l>I'm balkt again, and may go Whistle.</l>
               <l>My business, Sir, you'll quickly guess,</l>
               <l>Is to desire some little Place:</l>
               <l>And fair Pretentions I have for't,</l>
               <l>Much Need, and very small Desert.</l>
               <l>When e're I writ to you, I wanted;</l>
               <l>I always begg'd, you always granted.</l>
               <l>Now, as you took me up when little,</l>
               <l>Gave me my Learning, and my Vittle</l>
               <l>Askt for me, from my Lord, Things fitting,</l>
               <l>Kind as I'd been your own begetting;</l>
               <l>Confirm what formerly you've given,</l>
               <l>Nor leave me now at Six and Seven</l>

               <l>No Family that takes a Whelp,</l>

               <l>The spurious Barns that Strowlers dropt,</l>
               <l>Leave 'em when grown up lusty Fellows,</l>
               <l>To the wide World, that is, the Gallows:</l>
               <l>No thank 'em for their Love, that's Worse,</l>

               <l>My Uncle, rest his Soul, when Living,</l>

               <l>Taught me with Cyder to replenish</l>
               <l>My Fatts, or ebbing Tide of Rhenish.</l>

               <l>Where now, by forging Deeds and Cheating,</l>
               <l>I'd had some handsom ways of getting.</l>

                  <hi>Calliope,</hi> and God knows who.</l>
               <l>To add no more Invectives to it,</l>
               <l>You spoil'd the Youth to make a Poet.</l>
               <l>In Common Justice, Sir, there's no Man</l>
               <l>That makes the Whore but keeps the Woman.</l>
               <l>Among all honest Christian People</l>
               <l>Who e're breaks Limbs, maintains the Cripple.</l>
               <l>The Sum of all I have to say,</l>
               <l>Is, that you'd put me in some way</l>
               <l>And your Petitioner shall pray—</l>
               <l>There's one thing more I had almost slipt,</l>
               <l>But that may do as well in Post-script;</l>

               <l>THou best of Poets, and thou best of Friends,</l>
               <l>Best of that List which thy great Race commends,</l>
               <l>By <hi>Tunbridge</hi> noble Spring, much pleas'd, I lay,</l>
               <l>At Truce with Care passing the Summers day,</l>
               <l>When the Rich Present came in shining Verse;</l>
               <l>Ye Gods! how shall I half my Joy rehearse?</l>
               <l>I once was thinking to return the same</l>
               <l>In Lines that might express an equal Flame:</l>
               <l>I try'd in vain; my long-neglected Muse,</l>
               <l>Like Women past their Childing, did refuse,</l>
               <l>And cou'd not, to my mind, one Hint produce:</l>
               <l>For I was ne'er you know my Friend, at best,</l>
               <l>With a rich Vein by peevish Nature blest;</l>
               <l>I made my Court to the coy Nymphs in vain,</l>
               <l>And blest the Bards that cou'd their Loves obtain.</l>
               <l>Howe're, at call of Friendship's sacred Name,</l>
               <l>The faint Remains of my decaying Flame</l>
               <l>Exalt their head, ambitious now to try</l>
               <l>One Blaze, before they quite extinguisht dye.</l>
               <l>May your good Humour overlook Mistakes,</l>
               <l>And pardon all the Faults which Friendship makes:</l>
               <l>This Fountain then shall the fam'd Spring out-do,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Tunbridge</hi> for <hi>Castalian</hi> Waters go.</l>
               <l>You fain wou'd know how we employ the day,</l>
               <l>Which of it self makes too much haste away;</l>

               <l>With what Receipts and Helps prepar'd we come</l>
               <l>To lose the thought of Families at home.</l>
               <l>Assist me, gentle Muse, to answer these</l>

               <l>Ever the best Companion, walk or ride.</l>
               <l>Having now reach'd the Spring, a Country Lass</l>
               <l>Stands ready to present you with a Glass:</l>
               <l>Such Water tho' nor <hi>Rome</hi> nor <hi>Greece</hi> can show,</l>
               <l>Tho' here the Poets boasted Spring does flow;</l>
               <l>Impregnate with such Virtues it does come,</l>
               <l>As to add heat to the cold barren Womb.</l>
               <l>To an expiring House it gives an Heir,</l>
               <l>And wretched helpless Women here repair,</l>
               <l>Who joyful Mothers prove within the year.</l>
               <l>It cures the raging Feaver's Calenture,</l>
               <l>And keeps that Purple Flood from boyling o'er.</l>
               <l>The sad Sisyphian Task, the Stone, which still</l>

               <l>Than <hi>Hannibal</hi> with his Quack Arts cou'd boast:</l>

               <l>And made such quick and fierce Attacks, that I,</l>
               <l>Just on surrendring, thought I now must die.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:35158:107"/>I sought the Sons of Art, who try'd in vain</l>

                  <l>Proud Kings will to thy nobler Style submit,</l>

                  <l>What chearful Beams our rising <hi>Phoebus</hi> crown,</l>
                  <l>Tho yesterday's in bloody Clouds went down.</l>
                  <l>One Nation's King, to all a Blessing sent,</l>
                  <l>His wandring Course through various Nations spent.</l>

                  <l>His bloody Reign makes thine delightful all,</l>

                  <l>Then griefless Tears within our Eyes could play,</l>

                  <l>Nature no more could Left and Right decide.</l>
                  <l>So <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> round their Father move,</l>

               <l>WHat Fools are they, who use to cry,</l>
               <l>Nature's grown crazy, old and dry,</l>
               <l>No new Inventions now can boast</l>
               <l>For that vast store of old was lost;</l>
               <l>We know this is an Age of Light,</l>
               <l>Our Grandfires all were under Night,</l>
               <l>The sacred Story tells us, that</l>

               <l>With Napkins of peculiar Stuff,</l>
               <l>That could the Force of Fire rebuff,</l>
               <l>Throw'em into't, they took no hurt on't,</l>
               <l>Hot-brain'd <hi>Nero</hi> had a Shirt on't.</l>
               <l>These with others fill the Roll,</l>
               <l>Writ by learned <hi>Panciroll.</hi>

               <l>The modern Ages can produce,</l>
               <l>Inventions too of wondrous use,</l>

               <l>The Clouds give way, as thou dost go,</l>
               <l>And full-charg'd Thunder makes a Bow.</l>

               <l>To give the way let no Man scorn,</l>
