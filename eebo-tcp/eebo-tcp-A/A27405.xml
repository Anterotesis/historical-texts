         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>CHrist Jesus the true Prophet saith, <hi>Beware of
false Prophets which come to you in Sheeps
cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening
Wolves: Yee shall know them by their
fruits,</hi> Matth. 7. 15. And was ever such fruit brought

               </gap>th in any age? And in the 23 of <hi>Matth.</hi> he cryes Woe
to the Hypocrites; and they were such as devour Widows
hòuses, and for a pretence make long Prayer: And was
ever such devouring of the houses of Widows? therefore
shall they receive greater damnation. And <hi>Peter</hi> in his
2 Epistle, chap. 2. he discribes false teachers to be such as
through covetousness, and with feigned words make Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
of the People; and was ever such Merchandize
made of the People? Now these and such like be the fruits
of the corrupt tree, and of the false Prophets, Hypocrites,
and false Teachers: But the man of God doth flee such
things, and doth follow after Righteousness, Godliness,
Faith, Love, Patience, Meekness, <hi>I Tim.</hi> 6. 11. And they
who were Ministers of Christ, though they had power to eat
and drink, <hi>I Cor.</hi> 9. 4. the Labourer being worthy of his

meat: yet saith the Apostle we have not used this power;
but suffer all things lest we should hinder the Gospel of
Christ: for better (saith he) were it for me to die, than
that any man should make my rejoycing vain: what then
is my reward? Verily, that when I Preach the Gospel I
may make the Gospel of Christ without Charge, that I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
not my power in the Gospel, <hi>vers.</hi> 18. Now these be
the fruits of the good tree, and of the true Ministers of
Christ, who saith <hi>by their fruits ye shall know them.</hi>
Now Reader, with a single eye read the late practices, and
some of the fruits of several of the most godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
(as they are called) in the Northren parts of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
And let that of God in thee, which calls upon thee
to do to all men as thou would be done unto, judge of
them by their fruits, whose Ministers they are: By their
fruits (saith Christ) ye shall know them: The true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of Christ he used not his power, to take what the
power did allow him; but thou shalt finde that many of
these men who are called godly Ministers, have not only
used their power (as they call it) the Law of the Nation)
but abused their power, and in many particulars exceeded
the Law: the Statute which speaks of treble damages,
which is their power, which gives three pence for a peny,
which is much, which were they but men, they would not
exact, or take more than they call theirs: And were they
Christians, or Ministers of Christ, they would not seek
their own, but every man anothers wealth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 24
For the Ministers of Christ did not seek theirs, but them,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14. For the Children ought not to lay up
for the Parents, but the Parents for the Children: But
these have made themselves manifest by their actions that
they are no Fathers, they are so unnatural; but cursed
Children as Peter speaks of, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14. And now see
<pb facs="tcp:57600:3"/>
the Scriptures fulfilled and witnessed, which saith, Call
to remembrance the dayes that are passed, how that after ye
received the light ye indured a great fight in afflictions,
partly while ye were made a gazing stock, both by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and afflictions, and partly white ye became com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
of them which were so tossed to and fro, and such
took joyfully the sooyling of their Goods, knowing in
themselves, that in heaven a better and more enduring
substance was laid up for them: Therefore ye despised
ones, in whom, and upon whom the Scriptures are fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and fulfilling; who have received the light where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Christ Jesus, the Covenant of light and life, hath
you enlightened, and in it believed; cast not away your
confidence, which hath great recompence of reward, for ye
have nced of patience, that after ye have done the will of
God, ye may receive the promise, I or yet a little while,
and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry: Now
the just lives by Faith, but if any man draw back, my soul
shall have no pleasure in him, saith the Lord, but ye are
not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them
that believe to the saving of the soul; in your unity is
your strength, and in your faithfulness doth he rejoyce,
who is one with you in his measure.</p>

            <head>The Grounds why Tyths once commanded,
are now denied; as also, why Oaths once
used, are now laid aside.</head>
            <p>TYths were a Command and Ordinance of
God, and the first Priesthood had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to take Tyths of the People according
to the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 5. But the first Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
being changed, and the second Priesthood wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed,
there is made of necessity a change also of the
Law, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. And the Law being changed, and the
Commandment disa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nulled which the first Priesthood
had to take Tyths, <hi>vers.</hi> 18. Tyths of necessity must
also be taken away. But it is said, That Tyths now are
not required as of Divine right, but upon a civil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt.
To which it is answered, There is no Law in
this Nation publick that doth give Tyths, or require
the payment of them to any Parson, Vicar, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
as they are called, upon such an accompt as Civil.
The law saying, Tyths are due to God and holy
Church, 27 <hi>Hen. 8. Cap.</hi> 20. And where no law is,
there is no transgression; and are not they unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
men, that require that which the law (which is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable)
doth not allow? And if there were such a law,
how could that law be wholsom, which should set up
that which Christ Jesus the King of righteousness hath
disannulled, or write again, the hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
which he hath blotted out, and to his Crosse
nailed? And yet the Servant in his place, and who in
the house was faithful was worthy of his wage, which
<pb facs="tcp:57600:4"/>
was according to the law, and till the time of Resormation.
But the Son is free-born who the Heir is, and abides in the
house for ever, whose the inheritance is; and his gift is free,
and all who of his gift are made partakers, who is the Son of
righteousness, they are free indeed; for freely they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and freely they give (who so readeth let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand)
yet subjection to every Ordinance of man for the
Lords sake I have learned. For the earth is the Lords, and
the fulnesse of it; and therefore if any in Authority do take
the earth, or any part of it from me, and give it to another, I
resist him not, nor any other whom he shall appoint, for ye
must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
sake, for so have I learned Christ, to submit my self
to every Ordinance of man for the Lords sake whose the
earth is; But to put forth my hand to give that which is the
Lords (over which he hath made me a Steward, and me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
with my substance to honor him) I dare not for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
sake, give that which is the Lords to uphold that which
he hath abolished and disannulled, for that were to his disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
And yet by reason of oppressions the multitude of
them, the oppressed cry, and the Lord will hear the cry of
the oppressed. For because of swearing the land mourneth,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 10. yet the servant of the Lord swore in truth, in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
and in judgement; but in the house for ever the
servant abideth not, but the Son abideth for ever; who saith,
Swear not at all, but let your yea be yea, and your nay nay
in all your communications, for whatsoever is more than
these cometh of evil: These things spoke Jesus to his friends
to whom all things that he had heard of his Father he made
known: but the servant knoweth not what his Lord doth:
The servant swore who abode not in the house for ever; but
the Son who abides for ever, who doth the Will of God,
he testifieth what he hath seen and heard, and no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
<pb facs="tcp:57600:5"/>
his Testimony, who saith, Swear not at all, but he
that is of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 32. And saith the beloved Disciple,
We have seen, and do testifie that the Father sent the Son to
be the Saviour of the World, but the World him hates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he testifies of it; that the works thereof are evil, <hi>Joh.</hi>
7. 7. he that receiveth the Sonstestimony is come out of all
oaths and strife the occasion of them, to the yea and nay in
all his communications, and hath set to his seal that God is
true, and every man alyar that denieth the testimony which
God hath given of his Son, as all do who are out of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
but who abide in the Doctrine of Christ, their yea
is yea, and nay nay in all their communications, and they do
the Will of God, who his Commandments keep, and such
shall never be ashamed, but freely they testifie to all of what
they have seen and heard: And blessed are they that receive
his testimony, in whose mouth there is no guile. And as to
witness bearing to the truth, and of it before men, it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Doctrine of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 16. That in
the mouth of two or three Witnesses every word may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished;
And this was practised amongst the holy men of
God, and amongst the Saints as the Scriputures of truth do
declare, which were written for our learning. And of these
things they are Witnesses who have believed in him who is

goods, and making havock of them; who can but say the

them, and treads upon them, that are fed, and eats the fat,

they are fallen in the night, whose doth appear op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,

the hearts of the simple been long deceived by such, and doth
not the folly of these now appear unto all men? and are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that have the love of money that teaches for filthy lucre,
who pierce themselves through with many hurtfull lusts, who
have the love of money which is the root of all evill; which
things the man of God must flye: Marrk how many prisons
have been filled in this Nation by them for the love of money,
yea how many have been prisoned to death, witnesse <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
Colchester, York</hi> and <hi>Exceter,</hi> such as are prisoned to
death which the Priests are raging against, was ever <hi>Balaam</hi> so
mad who loved the wages of unrighteousness, who was in the
error, as are the teachers in this age, who are so greedy of gifts
and rewards; nay, if men will not give it them, they wil take it
by violence, &amp; summon them up into Courts, upper Bench,
Exchequer, Chancery Common Pleas, to answer before the
Barons of the Nation, and there cause poore men to come up;
these Priests some for 4 or 5 shillings, some for less, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
miles poor labouring men, and thus they use them
without any pity or compassion, and if they wil not pay them,
takes their Pots, or Kettles, or Platters, Priest sends to take
them away, or Plow-gear. Was ever the like heard in all
ages since the world began? Are not these they that makes
the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ chargeable? And are not
these things a shame to all Christians, that their teachers
should make such fruits manifest, nay their Colleges at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
where they make their Ministers, have caused some to
be cast in prison for not paying them their tythes. Here the
mother and her sons both make havock; one was prisoned at
<hi>York</hi> till he died for not paying tythes; prisoned another to
death by Priest <hi>Shaw,</hi> for not paying him tythes. Now if these
things doe not shame all Christian Magistrates and Rulers,
what will, that have not a feeling in them with these sufferers?
And if this be not a dishonor to truth and the Gospel, what
