            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
Sent to the Honourable <hi>George</hi>
Lord <hi>Digby</hi> in FLUSHING, from a
worthy Gentleman in WINDSOR,
January the 24. 1641.</head>
            <p>NOw the world seeth by wofull experience
in you, that it is end that crowneth the
accord, and that the fairest beginnings, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
are attended with sad, if not blacke
issues: let me advise you to reflect upon your
selfe, not onely as Baron, and eldest Sonne of
an Earle, but as a father of divers sweet chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and a husband unto a faire Lady; and
that your Lordship would not attempt both
causelessely and necessitously to make that
noble race on her side mourne. If true naturall
affection is so dead and stiffe in you, that you
have left us almost no hope to see or heare of
you, to be cause of joy unto your owne. Oh,
my Lord we have all too just cause to feare,
that the Straffordian leaven hath leavened the
better part, if not the whole lumpe: The Lord
God grant that you bleed not inward, and at
length prove a dolorous object to the world,
but most of all to none but your selfe: whose
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99644:3"/>
ruine will seeme to many the least condolea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by how much the more it will prove ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
wilfull, not casuall, much lesse ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
            <p>My Lord, there are too many eyes open:
there is no thought of dazeling them, all your
Lordships not long since saw a gallant starre
fall, and were pleased to give forth, that that
starre wanted not light but grace. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
was not for some good time together,
either unwilling or backward in the just per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of him, with the rest of the Worthies:
what caused you to retreat? God only knowes
certainly, men by conjecture: but this may be
assured of, that if you or others goe his wayes,
you will after so notorious and remarkeable
an example, find harder and more impassable
difficulties in the accomplishment of your
designes, and lesse favourable usage upon your
defeat. My Lord, notorious and wifull errors,
if not crimes, after so late and famous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
indiction and infliction of Law,
will seeme to be his, who is rather possessed
then reduced.</p>
            <p>My Lord, your Lordship did very ill to
take Sea, and for <hi>Flushing,</hi> worse to give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which may seeme, first to perswade it, if
not to enforce it. But good my Lord, as you
respect God, your Countery, your noble
Wife and Father, your owne honour, and that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99644:3"/>
of your ancient family looke no further: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
once thinke upon <hi>France,</hi> except with
griefe and feare, the one for those three unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
if I may not say unworthy: or unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
men, who by their unnaturall forwardnes
to violate their Country, have utterly as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly,
ruinated themselves, and caused di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of their friends though inno<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaour
ill, if not to stinke. My Lord, I beseech
you let me not heare of you; therefore if I
should, upon my truth and honour, I shall
not onely hold and esteeme you, but absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pronounce you and vote you for lost, there
is hopes either upon returning or staying,
there's some space. There may be hopes that
the Parliament, which seekes no mans over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
but his reclaiming, may passe by some
things, may forget others, may qualifie this,
and remit that: so that your Lordship be found
either in State or place, that may not give
cause.</p>
            <p>This counsell that may doe much good can
doe you no harme, you are heartily desired to
follow from him, who you perfectly know was
never guilty of any thing but of hearty love
and fidelity towards you and yours, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever willingly would alter his mind, you
still persisting in tearmes thereof capable.</p>

            <p>MY words have already been so misrepor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that I am forced to return my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
in writing, and think my condition at

the warrant of Summons, I received this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

I cannot personally attend there with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
both the breach of His Majesties expresse

took at my coming into this place, to observe
His Majesties commands. This I hope well

of that honourable House, whose just
Liberties and Privileges, I shall ever be ready

to maintaine with my life and fortunes. And I
most humbly desire the honourable House to
rest assured, that it is farre from my thought
(what false reports soever have been raised to
the contrary) to divide my selfe betwixt the
King and the Parliament, and that my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are united equally to serve both, though
in the condition I am indifferent from other
men) I can perform only a single personall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
here (unlesse His Majesty please to
absolve me from this command) In the mean
time, if by the house, it shall be thought fit to
demand any particulars, I am ready with all
clearnesse, and ingenuity to give satisfaction,
and with the like cander and fidelity, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
my selfe in all other actions, as becomes
a person intrusted, and one more willing to
deposite his life for the true Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
the peace and tranquillity of this City
