            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Confesſion of a Papiſt Prieſt, VVho was hanged drawn and quartred at Tiburne, For ſeducing the Kings people, the 26. of <hi>July</hi> 1641. and had foure ſeverall names which are theſe, <hi>William Waler,</hi> alias <hi>Walker,</hi> alias <hi>Ward,</hi> and alias <hi>Slater.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FIrſt he confeſſed, that he had beene a Papiſt Prieſt this twenty foure yeares, and preſumptuouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, that if he weare to live millions of yeares, he would more &amp; more perſevere in his wickedneſſe, and ſtrive to ſeduce the people towards this religion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he vowed and proteſted, that he was not at all ſorrowfull for his own death, for his pardon was granted him from his Ghoſtly father the Pope; and the laſt thing that ſtirred him up moſt to doe it, was that he was ſure to be canonized for a Saint.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he openly proteſted, that all thoſe whatſoever, which did not love and adore the Religion, in which faith he died, were damned Hereticks.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, he confeſſed how that he had beene baniſhed this kingdome of England, no leſſe then three or foure times, and ſtill he returned againe gathering Soules for Rome, but at laſt hee was hanged for his labour.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, he gave away his ink horne to one Father Grizley entreating him by his example to be conſtant to the ſea of Rome, and employ it no worſe then hee had done.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, hee gave his Beads to Maſter Croſtly an Auſtine Fryer, with the like admonitions.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, he bragged that he could ſpit defiance in the very face of death, for hee was aſſured that hee ſhould have what he had merited, viz. life everlaſting.</p>
            <p>Eightly, he threatned his adverſaries (as he tearmed them) with the Popes Bull.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, he invok'd the Saints that they would now at this time aſſiſt him with their aide, &amp; pray to God for him.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, he ſecretly repeated over to himſelfe his Avemaries, his ſalve Reginaes, with many more Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, and damnable prayers.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, he fitted the halter as neare as poſſibly hee could to the bur of his eare, that hee might ſwing the eaſier.</p>
            <p>Twelthly, and laſtly, young <hi>Gregory</hi> drove away the Cart, and left him to the mercy of the hempe.</p>
            <p>Thus beloved Chriſtians, may you ſee how deſperately many men will run the wrong way. I cannot ſee how this religion can ſtand with truth or reaſon, when the greateſt part of it is grounded upon murther &amp; miſchiefes; were it not too late, I would beſtow a charitable Lord Ieſus receive his ſoule on him, expect the laſt day, for moſt of our Saviours words are accompliſhed: one thing in this man, for he gave us warning that we ſhould not truſt falſe Prophets, for in theſe dayes they ſhould come.</p>
            <p>The manner of his execution: he was drawne upon an hurdle, with foure horſes, from Newgate to Tiburne, and was hanged, halfe a quarter of an houre, then taken downe, and ripped up, and his members and bowells burnt in the fire, then his body quartered, and put in a Basket, and brought to Newgate to be parboyled. This was the manner of his execution.</p>
