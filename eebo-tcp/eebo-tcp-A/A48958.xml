            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Noble Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my last to you, I signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to you, the difficulties which were like to befall us by the releeving of <hi>Droheda,</hi> but God by his infinite mercy hath freed us (I may say miraculously) from that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard: for when our men there were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to that extremitie to eat horse-flesh, Sir <hi>Henry Tichbourne</hi> sallied out of the Towne with only fourty Musketiers, and fourty Horse, and beat off foure hundred of the Enemies, killed above threescore of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63403:3"/>
of them, recovered fourescore Cowes and Oxen, and two hundred sheepe; burned foure townes, and brought home two of their Collours; Besides, I must relate unto you Gods abundant goodnesse unto us, in that the night before the reliefe and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which we sent by Sea from <hi>Dublin</hi> to them, should have entred into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of <hi>Droheda,</hi> (which was strongly fenced over with a Chaine and severall boates) there happened a storme which broke their chainer, and gave our men so free a passage, as with little difficulty they came safely to the towne. The Rebels were gathered at <hi>Kilshalgham</hi> within se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven miles of <hi>Dublin,</hi> above two thousand men, where they were settled in a very strong wood. My Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> carried out part of our Army, and beat them out of that great strength (for they would not come into the Champaine) and killed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a hundred of them, without any considerable losse of our side, only Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Iames Rochfort,</hi> a most gallant and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63403:3"/>
couragious gentleman. This was an act of great bravery, wherein Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> did, (as he doth alwayes) beyond expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, exposing his person to as much danger as any man living could; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth he is a gallant man, full of courage and good affections, and deserves great incouragement from that side. Our soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours are in great want of money, which causes a generall want of all other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet notwithstanding God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused such courage into them (for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it is his worke) that they thinke there is no danger so great, but they may attempt it.</p>
            <p>Colonell <hi>Munke</hi> is arrived here with my Lord Lieutenants Regiment of fifteen hundred foot, and Sir <hi>Richard Greevill</hi> with neere foure hundred Horse, which puts much heart into us, and makes us looke big upon our neighbours, yet we grieue wee cannot be able to releeve our friends in other parts; but I hope when our full succours shall come, we shall not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63403:4"/>
only defend this place, but adde comfort to our poore distressed friends abroad.</p>
            <p>The enemy though their numbers bee very great, even beyond beleefe, yet their hearts begin to faint, and I beleeve they repent their furious madnesse.</p>
            <p>If my Brother be in <hi>London,</hi> I pray you impart this Letter to him, I would have written to him, but that I thought he was at <hi>Chester,</hi> or on his way thither; By the next hee shall heare from me at large, and I shall likewise trouble you.</p>
            <p>I must now only tell you, that I thanke you for your care of those things which concerne mee, and that I am, Sir, your most affectionate servant,</p>
