            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Pag. 4. §. 3. <hi>I looked upon him as a Man of ſome Learning, Judgment and Conſcience; but I find my ſelf Miſtaken, in reference to his Judgment and Conſcience.</hi> How can he chooſe, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Infallibility? But if Miſtaken before, why not in the <hi>Quakers</hi> now? and ſo, <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> being ſo fallible.

                  <hi>Vagrant.</hi> It is Honeſty in us to own our Books, and an high Self-denial to ſuffer our Names to be ſubjected to the Reviling of every ſuch Detractor. But take notice, that <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſo often begins with his Name, and every other Author extant, is reproved by this Angry <hi>Momus,</hi> But hear him.</p>
               <p>Pag. 5. §. 5. Next, <hi>He is much offended at a Quondam Friend of his, who was ſo Kind as to give away ſome Six-Penny Books to thoſe he knew would not buy them.</hi> A Notable Charge! And who was this Quondam Friend? <hi>that Little Great Pragmatical</hi> Thomas Firmin: A Monſter, all <hi>Tongue,</hi> and <hi>no Ears;</hi> it ſeems he is now become an Enemy then, but for what? becauſe I abhor his <hi>Folly, Lightneſs</hi> and <hi>Foul Mouth.</hi> Who bid him buy the Books? <hi>Was he beg'd to do it?</hi> or did I ſell them him? or was he Angry he could not ſell them himſelf? What! <hi>Would he have added the</hi> Stationer, <hi>without Licence, to his many other little Trades?</hi> It ſeems he took Money of as many as would buy them: and if he gave them to thoſe that would not, let him look to that. But Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous Men? <hi>Chriſtians?</hi> No, I would deteſt to faſten ſuch Dirty Scandals upon a <hi>Turk.</hi> Away with your <hi>Socinian-Agency.</hi> Is this the End of all your Creeping Daubs, Diſſimulated Praiſe, and Hypocritical Addreſs? But indeed, what other could there be?</p>
               <p>Pag. 6. §. 6. He proceeds, <hi>Meaſure his Book by the Title,</hi> The Spirit of Truth Vindicated againſt that of Error and Envy Unſeaſonably Manifeſted <hi>(as if there were a Seaſon for the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of Error and Envy)</hi> in a late Malicious Libel. My Title is Serious: I did not ſay, <hi>The Spirit of the</hi> Socinians <hi>Tryed, according to that Diſcovery it has made of it ſelf, in their</hi> (Lamentable, yet Conceited Agent) <hi>Henry Hedworth;</hi> as he did of the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>G. Fox,</hi> much leſs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them to be <hi>Impoſtors, Lyars</hi> and <hi>Falſe Prophet:</hi> No, God forbid, though Provok't thereto, by an Envious Libel, which <hi>Controverſie Ended</hi> begun with us upon. Nor is there any Time or Seaſon, in which to manifeſt Error and Envy juſtifiably, yet for all this Carping <hi>Zoilus,</hi> every thing has its Time, and even Wicked Men may, as to the Proſperity of their own Concerns, Unſeaſonably Time their Projects, as did the Author of that Diſcourſe. For his Collection of my Expreſſions, with reſpect to his Epiſtle, let the Reader peruſe my Book, and ſee the Occaſion: There is nothing ſo Deteſtable and Hard as <hi>Impoſtor, Lyar, Falſe Prophet;</hi> nor ſo Foul as <hi>Puppy, Fool, Cheat, Knave, &amp;c.</hi> But no more after this time of the Latter, as freſh Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, becauſe Recanted, which is the firſt time I ever heard of it: only, <hi>that Free Way,</hi> as <hi>H. Hedworth mincingly calls it,</hi> of ſo ſpeaking, and that not privately, as he pretends; <hi>but in the Hearing of many, in a Publick Place,</hi> much better deſerves a <hi>Bridewell,</hi> than an <hi>Exchange.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. But <hi>W. P.</hi> (like a Man that will Rob his Neighbour for Praiſe, rather then go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it) ſaith thus, Sect 2. <hi>If we Excel in All Things;</hi> I ſaid, <hi>Whilſt ſome of you Excel in Many Things. Here</hi> W. P. <hi>has committed a Double Falſity.</hi> 1. <hi>He puts All for Many.</hi> 2. Quakers <hi>indefinitely, for Some of Them. I have lookt among the Printers Errata's, whether he had not Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ALL for MANY, but I find no ſuch thing: If I ſhould grant him that Error</hi> (without good Reaſon) <hi>yet the other piece of Falſity, viz. Putting We, the</hi> Quakers <hi>in general, for Some of them, will abide by him, to the Groſs Injury of Me, and Shame of Himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, Reader, which he layes ſo great a Streſs upon, I will manifeſt to be deep Ignorance or Malice. 'Tis true, ALL is put for MANY in the place cited, and has been by me Corrected with a Pen, and never was in my Copy. But what then? do I anſwer it as <hi>All</hi> or <hi>Many?</hi> If as the Firſt, then I Err; yet perhaps not deſignedly neither: but if as the Laſt, MANY; what Hurt have I done. Sober Reader, hear my Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If we excel in <hi>ALL</hi> Things, as he confeſſeth (there's the Cavil) which is to ſay, there are but <hi>Few Things</hi> wherein we do not tranſcend all others: how poſſibly can we be Dangerous and Diſhonourable to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion?</hi> Is the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> among the <hi>Few Things,</hi> wherein we are ſuppoſed wanting, which is the main Thing of all? If ſo, what are the MANY?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Judge O Impartial People! How Diſ-ingenuouſly, and with what Envy he hath aggravated, that <hi>All</hi> for <hi>Many,</hi> when my own Anſwer makes no Advantage by it, but runs as it would have done had <hi>Many</hi> been inſtead of <hi>All:</hi> Is it true then, that to eſteem it an Error in Printing is <hi>without Good Reaſon,</hi> for which there is ſo evident a Reaſon? Does this Man make Conſcience of a Lye? <hi>An Idle Shifter.</hi> To his Second, He is here as Falſe as in the Former; for the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph immediately fore-going, to which this has reference, ſpeaks thus, <hi>He is pleaſed to allow us, at leaſt, a great many of us to be Honeſt-Hearted, &amp;c.</hi> If this takes in the <hi>Quakers in General,</hi> or if any ſuch word as <hi>Quakers in General</hi> be mentioned, or by me made to be the Conſequence of his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33614:3"/>
words, and not rather <hi>ſome of them,</hi> I will confeſs to have wronged him: In the mean time, he has kept to his old wont of moſt Ungodly Defamations, and faſtening upon Mens Writings Plain Untruths, but of his own making. God the Righteous Judge will Reward him.</p>
               <p>Pag. 9. §. 8. Laſtly, But he tells us again, that in Sect. 8. which is Page 13. of my Spirit of Truth Vindicated, I ſay, <hi>I will not give him the Lye, and that in</hi> Page 92. <hi>I tell him, he has broke his Word with us, which in plainer Engliſh is, He has told a Lye,</hi> and would therefore fix the Lye on me; ſaying, I am <hi>Unchriſtian and Uncivil.</hi> But if this be an Anſwer to my Juſt Objection againſt his Twice Breach of Promiſe with us, <hi>not to Reflect, yet immediately to do it, not to uſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Reaſon, counting us Unworthy,</hi> yet endeavour at both; <hi>let's forever give off Writing.</hi> What? tell me I Lye, becauſe more then Seventy Pages of the Former Paſſage, in quite another caſe, I ſay, that breaking a Man's word, <hi>is, in Plainer Engliſh, telling a Lyar:</hi> If I did forbear it at firſt, it was meer Curteſie. The Author's Countenance in Lyes, might well juſtifie my ſaying what I did; <hi>however, Lye and Contradict he did, and he denies it not,</hi> whatever I did: but it ſeems his Proud Spirit can't abide to be ſpoken plainly to; and to tell Truth of him, or reprove his Lyes, muſt coſt a Man as much Implacable Scurrility, as may be expected in caſe of Real Wrong, from the moſt Diſſolute of Men. This is H. H. with his Grim <hi>Socinian Cavils</hi> burſon'd with <hi>Folly and Revenge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my <hi>Non-ſence,</hi> or <hi>Ignorance in my Mother-Tongue,</hi> we will venture that with the World; but the Preſs has injur'd me not a little. I deny that ever Non-ſence went to it, whatever came from it. However, <hi>H. Hedworth</hi> is not my Judge.</p>

F</hi>'s Doctrine. Next, They who are not Infallible, as to the Things of God, they Teach, <hi>are not taught of God, nor of his Spirit of Grace, which gives Certain Unerring Underſtanding,</hi> and ſo Deluders. But <hi>G. F.</hi> never ſaid, That every one that is not Infallible, is a Deluder in all things; for a Man may be Fallible or Miſtaken in ſome Matters wherein he is not a Deluder: But the Drift of <hi>G. F</hi>'s words is this, <hi>That ſuch Preachers who deny the Spirit's Teachings, and Infallible Knowledge, as neceſſary to a Qualification of a Goſpel Miniſtry, are Deluders;</hi> and in this Sence, who pretend to Teach, and know not the Certainty, <hi>but the Incertainty rather of what they Teach, ſuch are Deluders;</hi> and by this will I ſtand, againſt this Vain <hi>Syllogizer,</hi> in Defence of that Defamed, yet Worthy Man, <hi>G.

               </p>
               <p>What! Is this any more then <hi>Bumbaſt Repetition?</hi> It was time for <hi>Controverſie to End</hi> indeed. I ſay, that <hi>G. F.</hi> had to do with ſuch as believed every <hi>Particle,</hi> yea <hi>the very</hi> Hebrew <hi>Points themſelves to be part of the Scriptures, divinely given forth, as an unalterable and only Rule.</hi> He denies it, but aſſerts the Spirit of Truth that gave them forth to be the Rule, eſpecially ſince Chriſt's Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation in the Fleſh. <hi>The Prieſts therefore are Perverters and Corrupters if they leave out one Jot or Tittle;</hi> but <hi>G. F.</hi> not ſo: for if the Senſe be rendred, God never tyed People to the expreſs words, ſays he; therefore G. F. his not oblieging himſelf to that exactneſs, <hi>makes him no Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, unleſs he ſhould be judg'd by the untrue Notion, other men have of a Rule that he ſubmits not to,</hi> which were Injuſtice it ſelf. This ſhows then how unwarrantably our Adverſary uſeth my words againſt <hi>G. F.</hi> which are only due to himſelf; and the Prieſts he defends, unleſs he could make their Caſe one, which he can never do: and therefore what I ſay to them, cannot be aſcrib'd to <hi>G. F.</hi> but with manifeſt wrong. For the Doctrinal Miſtakes, they ſhall be conſidered anon; only thus far <hi>G. F.</hi> is no <hi>Perverter</hi> or <hi>Corrupter,</hi> and conſequently no <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> if he put <hi>With</hi> for

               <p>Pag. 17. §. 3. But <hi>Sol. Eccles's Teſtimony makes G. F, little other then a God, therefore G.

               <p>That <hi>John Stubs</hi> did ſo, <hi>calling</hi> M.
