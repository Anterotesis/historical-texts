            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WIth unexpreſſible Joy I received yours of June the 22 by which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the good effect of our Endeavors which we have ſo Long been Labouring in: and am glad to hear the work is ſo well managed and done, you following the adviſe we gave as well by divers Letters as word of mouth from our <hi>Ambaſſador Barillon</hi> now at <hi>whitehall.</hi> And as ſoon as I had received the news I went to the <hi>King my Maſter</hi> and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him that there was one of the <hi>Holy babes</hi> of your owne getting brought to the <hi>queen</hi> and that both the <hi>King</hi> and she did owne it for their owne ſon and <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> and under that notion it was shewd and published to the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then I acquainted the <hi>Fathers of our Society</hi> who had with ſacred Inſtruments for the purpoſe Calculated the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Long before: and shewed their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant zeal in this weighty affair: they alſo were Extreamly Joyful when they heard it, and it is impoſſible. To expreſs the mirth and Jollyty of all our friends in this Country who have heard of this weighty Concern, for now it ſeems as if heaven it ſelf did Contribute to our

               </gap> give the Holy Church greater Dominion, and render our Enemies the longer the weaker. For in our Country the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are very near quite deſtroyed: in <hi>Piemont</hi> and <hi>Savby</hi> they are Reduced to a ſmall weak number, in <hi>Himgary</hi> they shall no Longer Continue then till the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and the <hi>Turk</hi> have made peace, for it is the opinion of our Society that the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi> doth not ſtand in need of the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Proteſtant Electors, nor need he fear them when that War is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Then shall we perſwade him not only to deſtroy them in all <hi>his Territorys</hi> but alſo to make war upon the <hi>Netherlands</hi> &amp; ſo root out all the Hereticks from the face of the Earth; and indeed the Hereticks in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are not far from their Ruine, as for the <hi>Palatinate</hi> it will be Eaſily done there becauſe we have got a <hi>Popish Elector</hi> Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and for the <hi>King of Denmark</hi> we doubt not but to make him in his Country fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Example of the great Monark in ours either to make them turn or Run, and tho the freindship between that <hi>Crowne</hi> and ours ſeems weake yet it is not ſo much decayed as ſome people wish and pretend. And if I pleaſe I can quickly make him zealous, and a perfect ſervant to our King and that he shall aſſiſt in the <hi>Romish Cauſe</hi> as faithfully as the beſt <hi>Catholik</hi> as euer was born, for in his Country the sheep yeild him but a ſmall fleece, and let our King but ſend him a good preſent of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols</hi> and he shall do all that we deſire him tho it were to ſubſcribe to the <hi>Alchoran</hi> and turn <hi>Mahometan.</hi>

               </gap> in <hi>Holland,</hi> which reſolution I will Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly put him in mind off as often as I give him abſolution.</p>
            <p>When I Conſider of theſe things it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth me to think how zealous his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of England</hi> is to perfect his deſignes, which are to us of great Cencerns, to which purpoſe he hath the aſſiſtance of our troupes. And <hi>Cardinal Furſtenberg</hi> [when he shall be made <hi>Elector of Collen]</hi> Can bring <hi>Holland</hi> under his obedience, haveing firſt made himſelf maſter of his owne people and brought them in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his abſolute power: I ſay when I Conſider and think of theſe things they do ſo rejoyce me that I am almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmd there with; nay it is ſo great that I am not able to write it, and indeed it is the greateſt pleaſure I have in this world, and I muſt ſay that ſince the laſt Letter I received from you things have been ſo forwarded that I muſt now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaryly Conclude we are not far from the higheſt ſtep: and nothing can be ſaid to be perfect now, till I can demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſee ſuch ſignes that will teſtify the work is compleat.</p>
            <p>And as Concerning that Letter of yours which gave us that Incomparable ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and joy, the principle things therein are theſe following: <hi>firſt,</hi> you did very wiſely not to follow the Litteral direction that we had laid downe, but to uſe ſuch endeavors and devices as the then acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and preſent affaires did require, and indeed they were ſuch as did much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the perfection of our buſſines: namely, the ſending the <hi>Bishops to the Tower:</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Denmark</hi> to the <hi>Bath,</hi> and divers <hi>Heretick Gentlemen</hi> to <hi>Windſor</hi> where they Expected the <hi>Queen</hi> should lye in: in which inventions you shewed your admirable skill and Judgment: for they without doubt would have been preſent and you ſay the Laws of <hi>England</hi> do ſo require it. Therefore it was your wiſdom to adviſe the King to impoſe ſome
<pb facs="tcp:48397:3"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 line">

               </gap> not in honor do, and ſo find occaſion to ſend them to the <hi>Tower</hi> and there keep them till the great worke was done.</p>
            <p>Neither was the other part of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention les to be admired, when you perſwaded the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> that it was a month or ſix weeks before the <hi>Queen</hi> could be delivered and they might eaſily return ſooner, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you had not taken this courſe they would have waited and have been prying into the buſſines, and the other is alſo as praiſe worthy as any, for you could not have trickt thoſe Heretick fops better then to ſend them like <hi>fools</hi> to <hi>windſor</hi> with a Commiſſion to ſet up a <hi>bed,</hi> provide a <hi>Cradle</hi> and a <hi>Nurs</hi> and divers other things neceſſary for her lying in, and alſo to wait there till she came, which you never intended she should, and likewiſe it was a good project of yours to give out that the Queen altered her mind often about the place she would be delivered at, for when you had given out ſeven or eight ſeveral times it was reſolved to be <hi>windſor, Hampton court, Richmond,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi>'s, &amp;c. they did not at laſt beleeve when you Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in earneſt, by which means you catcht the fools neatly: all which were neatly Laid and contrived, for which we thank you wishing all ſucces to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and Endeavors toward the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting this mighty work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> That you keep both their Majeſtys to their former Reſolution in declareing this child to be really theire owne, and alſo by publick proclamation for a day of Thanks giveing to tell the whole Nation he was their ſon, and Heir to the Crowne: in ſpight of all the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teing Inquiſitive <hi>Hereticks</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> who have got ſome kind of ſent of the work and deſigne now in hand, but I can tell them, they think they know more then really they do, how ever they have En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored by diſperſing of various papers to render his Majeſty ſuſpected, and I aſſure <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 line">
                  <desc>〈1 line〉</desc>
               </gap> that your King would have fell of and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from his pious Reſolution, for we well know that he is but a weak man, and you know ſuch kind of people are eaſyly led away: when they have nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon but what lyeth in other mens heads.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> That there is ſuch great care taken for the young Prince, and alſo in caſe of the <hi>Kings</hi> death to declare his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort <hi>Queen Regent,</hi> and to appoint your ſelf, the <hi>Lord Chancelor</hi> with ſome other <hi>good men</hi> to govern while the <hi>Prince</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der age. And by the ſame manner we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended our <hi>King,</hi> his [reputed] Father ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing appointed <hi>Cardinal Mazarine</hi> for his Tutor and Governer till by force of Arms he was able to make his way to the Crowne, and if any are ſo Inquiſitive as to ask if this Prince shall be brought to the Crowne by the ſame manner, let ſuch know that it may be eaſily done for our King hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that if there is occaſion he will ſtand by him with his whole fore and power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> That which adminiſters great Joy to me and all the Fathers of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, is, that the <hi>King</hi> of great <hi>Brittain</hi> is reſolved and hath alſo promiſed you that in caſe this Child should dye, there shall be another ready to put into the crad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le in his place, but if that should prove difficult and that there should not be a Child readily found to carry on the show with ſome reputation, you muſt take the ſame courſe as before and ſend the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>St. Winifreds</hi> well to wash that <hi>little</hi> he hath, let the <hi>Queen</hi> wear a <hi>Cushion upon her belly</hi> for nine months and that will certainly produce another <hi>Prince of Wals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> That his Majeſty hath given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to all the prieſts to write to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Colledges and deſire them to in treat the <hi>English Scotch</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> and all other outlandish <hi>Catholicks,</hi> that are well inclind to advance and further the Kings pious deſignes: and to encourage every one that can with all ſpeed to come over
<pb facs="tcp:48397:4"/>
into England: with promise that they shall all be advanced according to their ſeveral quallifications, which will be of great uſe for the carrying on this bleſſed work, defending the <hi>young Prince</hi> againſt his Conſpireing Enemies, and to root out all the Hereticks. In which work I do promiſe not to be negligent, but ro ſend over as many as I can poſſibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade.</p>
            <p>And now as theſe things are truely Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in themſelves, ſo have they in me and all the Fathers of our Society created an un expreſſible Joy. If I should tell you how I was affected when I heard this news, I could ſay no more but this, that my ſoul was ſeparated from my body, and tranſported with Joy and gladnes into the paradis of the moſt high, which no man can conceive; as <hi>St. Paul</hi> writes of himſelf when he was taken up into the third heaven.</p>
            <p>Now Concerning the queſtion you have put to me, that is what is the beſt cours to be taken to root out all the <hi>Hereticks?</hi> to which I anſwer, there are divers ways to do that, but-we muſt conſider which is the beſt to make uſe off in <hi>England,</hi> I am ſure you are not Ignorant how many thouſand <hi>Hereticks</hi> we have in france by the <hi>power of our Dragons</hi> converted in the ſpace of one year: and by the Doctrin of thoſe <hi>booted Apoſtles</hi> turnd more in one Month then <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> by their preaching could in ten year: this is a moſt Excellent method and far excells thoſe of the <hi>great preachers</hi> and <hi>teachers</hi> that have lived ſince <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his time.

            <p>But at laſt I got him on the hip: for he had <hi>Lay</hi> with his <hi>daughter in Law</hi> for which I would by no means give him <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution</hi> till he had given me an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> under his owne hand and Seal to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> all the <hi>Hereticks</hi> in one day: Now as ſoon as I had my <hi>deſired Commiſſion</hi> I appointed the day when this should be done, and in the mean time made ready ſome thouſands of Letters to be ſent into all parts of <hi>France</hi> in one poſt night, I was never better pleaſed then at that time, but the <hi>King</hi> was a affected with ſome Compaſſion for the <hi>Hugonets</hi> becauſe they had been a means to bring him to his Crowne and Throne: and the longer he was under it the more ſorrowful he was, often complaining and deſireing me to give him his Commiſſion

But I was no ſooner come into the houſe but he gave his ſervants order to ſecure the door: and ſaid confidently to me: <hi>You muſt by order from the King give me the Comiſſion which you have, forced from him;</hi> I told him I had it not about me: but I would go and fetch it: thinking to get from him and ſo go out of towne and ſend the contents of thoſe Letters another time, but he ſaid: <hi>You muſt give it me, and if you have it not about you, ſend ſome body to fetch it or els never Expect to go alive out of my hands, for I have an order from the King either to bring it or break your neck: and I am Reſolved either to carry back that to him in my hand, or your hearts blood on the point of my ſword:</hi> I would have made my Eſcape but he ſet his ſword to my breaſt and ſaid <hi>you muſt give it me or Dye, therefore deliver

            </p>
            <p>So when I ſaw nothing els would do I put my hand in my pocket and gave it him, which he carried immediately to the <hi>King</hi> and gave him that and all my Letters which they burnt: and being all done the <hi>King</hi> ſaid that now his heart was at Eaſe, now how he should be Eaſed by the <hi>devil,</hi> or ſo well ſatisfied with a fals Joy I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, but this I know that it was a very wicked and ungodly action as well in his <hi>Majeſty</hi> as the <hi>Prince of Conty:</hi> and did not a Little increaſe the burden and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his Majeſtys ſins: I ſoon gave an account of this affair to ſeveral <hi>Fathers of our Society,</hi> who promiſed to doe their beſt to prevent the foreſaid <hi>Prince</hi> doeing ſuch another act, which was accordingly done: for with in the ſpace of ſix days after the damned action he was <hi>Poiſoned and well he deſerved it.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> alſo did ſuffer to, but in another fashion, for diſcloſeing the deſigne to the <hi>Prince</hi> and hearkning to his Council: and many a time ſince when I have had him at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion I have shook hell about his Ears, and made him ſigh fear and tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would give him abſolution; nay more then that I have made him beg for it upon his knees before I would conſent to abſolve him, by this I ſaw that he had ſtill an Inclination to me and was willing to be under my government: ſo I ſet the baſenes of the action before him by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the whole Story and how wicked it was: and that it could not be forgiven till he had done ſome good action to balance that and Expiate the crime, whereupon he at laſt asked me what he muſt doe? I told him that he muſt root out all the Hereticks from his Kingdom, ſo when he ſee there was no reſt for him without doeing it, he did againe give them all into the power of me and our Clergy: under this Condition <hi>that we should not murder them;</hi> as he had before given orders; but that we should by fair means or force convert them to the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> to which End he gave us his <hi>Dragoons</hi> to be at our devotion and ſervice that we might uſe them as we ſaw Convenient to convert them to the true Religion, now when we had got the Comiſſion we preſently put it in practiſe, and what the Iſſue of it hath been you very well know.</p>
            <p>But now in <hi>England</hi> the work cannot be done after this manner: as you may perceive by what I have ſaid to you, if you have carefully obſerved what hath been delivered, ſo that I can not give you better Council then to take that courſe in hand wherein we were ſo unhappily prevented, and I doubt not but it will have better ſucces with you then with us, and the rather becauſe your <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Son</hi> are under the government of our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> and are to obey the orders of our Generall, and doe all that can be contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the deſtroying the Hereticks, I would not be here underſtood as if I thought the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to proſecute and promote our orders and directions for the good of our holy mother the Church: and you muſt always keep him perfectly poſſeſt of that: for I know well that he of himſelf is Zealous enof, for that Excellent Example in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> that was done by his father <hi>[that is the murdring 200000 Proteſtants]</hi> is ſtill ſo deeply printed in his ſoul that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe it to day then wait till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, if he ſaw an advantagions oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and I mention this ſtory of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land that you may preſs it upon him and by that incourage him how eaſy a thing it is to do.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why I am ſo long in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teing this matter: is to let you know how we had at firſt laid our deſigne and alſo what obſtructions there came in the way: yet at laſt we arrived at the thing we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, ſo you muſt not be disheartened when you meet with oppoſition but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the thing, doe your duty and leave the ſucces to time and fate.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>King</hi> is at preſent very ſickly and

we can have no account what he ails, for ſome times the <hi>Doctors</hi> ſay he hath an <hi>Ague,</hi> a while after they ſay tis the <hi>Gout</hi> and then <hi>Melancholy</hi> or ſome ſuch thing, now whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her the ſlow progres of the great deſigne in the Hague to get the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> into his Intereſt; <hi>or to murder him;</hi> doth ſo weaken and impair him, I know not. But this I can aſſure you of: that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſick when he received the news of that provokeing anſwer that the Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naris <hi>Fagel</hi> gave to his Ambaſador <hi>D'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux:</hi> and was after published in very Scornful terms; and therefore there was but little hope left to accomplish the firſt: and Indeed leſs to perform the ſecond, ſeeing the Prince hath ſmelt out our Kings deſigne, and for all thoſe that have intermedled in the affaires of our Amba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador concerning what he hath done for his maſter; let them look to themſelves, poſſibly he may fear that their <hi>Majeſtys</hi> of great <hi>Brittain</hi> may alter their opinions about the young prince that we have been ſo long contriveing for, and at laſt diſowne him, and ſo deſtroy the deſigne, and from thence may his ſicknes proceed, for he is conſiderable better ſince he hath heard of its good ſucces and the probabillity of its good concluſion. And this is the more poſſible becauſe his <hi>Majeſty</hi> takes all his Meaſures from the Conſtitution of the affaires in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; undertakes nothing of any great importance till he conſiders how it ſtands with that <hi>King,</hi> [and you well know that we in the late troubles forbore to perſecute the <hi>Hugnoets</hi> till we heard of his <hi>Majeſtys</hi> conqueſt and the defeat and death of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and then we began againe very ſmartly] ſo hath he now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe don, as ſoon as he heard this news gave preſent orders that all thoſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> who were not converted to the Catholick Religion by ſuch a day should be offered up as a Sacrifice to the <hi>young Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I would Intreat you againſt you write to me againe to Inquire and let me know of what <hi>Lady, Nun,</hi> or other <hi>Holy Virgin</hi> the <hi>young Prince</hi> was born: that I may remember her in my prayers who hath brought this hopefull babe into the world that is like to be the pillar of our Religion, and alſo ſend me word how old he was when he was <hi>brought to the Queen</hi> or as the Common cant is when he was born: for there is a Father of our Society that is very skilful in <hi>Aſtrology</hi> and would Calculate his Nativity.</p>
            <p>I have Received a Letter out of the Hague by which I am told that in <hi>Holland</hi> they uſe very unreverend Expreſſions of the <hi>young Prince:</hi> one ſays that among all the Children you got for this deſigne there was not one found fit to be uſed, either they were <hi>ſickly, deformed</hi> or born with ſome other <hi>ill accident:</hi> ſo that they ſay this is a <hi>Millers Son:</hi> others ſay it was a <hi>Carpenttrs Son in Holborn</hi> thereby intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teing a ſacred miracle parallel to the holy Joſeph who was of the ſame trade, others ſay the <hi>young Prince</hi> was a month old when he was born, and that he could preſently eat pap with a ſpoon, and there are others who ſay he had ſix teeth in his mouth and immediately began to bite like a <hi>young De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> which was the onely cauſe why they would not let him ſuck, but ſome others ſay that he ſuckt long enof before he was born, and should they now let him ſuck againe he would goe nere to prove a <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonger;</hi> yet there are ſome that are more Rude and uncivil and report him to be the ſonn of a <hi>Plowman,</hi> and ſay it is no wonder that he is ſo fat, big boned, and ſtrong made; being deſigned by nature for the <hi>flaile</hi> and not for the <hi>Throne.</hi> Nay there be ſome here in <hi>France</hi> that tell us they have heard in the <hi>Taverns</hi> and <hi>Coffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes</hi> nay and a long the ſtreets alſo in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don as bad language as there and therefore you muſt as much as poſſible, endeavor to ſuppres theſe things, by giveing orders to <hi>the Marq: d'Albeville</hi> your <hi>Kings</hi> Envoy at the <hi>Hague</hi> to complaine of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

            <p>I am alſo informed that few or none of all the <hi>Heretick Bishops</hi> and <hi>miniſters</hi> in the three Kingdoms will pray for the <hi>young Prince</hi> in their Churches, which if true is of ill conſequence, and therefore you muſt endeavor to have it done: and all thoſe Rebellious Hereticks that will not obey his Majeſtys abſolute power in this and other caſes muſt be turned out, and dealt with as I have in this Letter before shewed.</p>
            <p>I would write to you of many other things but that I fear what is here already done doth detaine you to long, and I alſo well know that you have a weighty affair on your shoulders: and therefore your time is precious, ſo that you ſtand in need of the Grace of God and the prayers of all good men to aſſiſt you in it; wherefore I will conclude, and for you and all good Catholicks show my will to the beſt of my power praying for you to God, to Mary the H.

The ſubtilty they have uſed to have the Queen delivered in the eight month, and that with ſo much ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as if she had not time to call any or give notice to thoſe who ought to have been there, they Judging that the world will think from hence that she was cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched at unawares. But alas this is ſo far from takeing off the ſuſpicion that it doth much Increaſe it, for from thence all men muſt Judge that they made Choice of this opportunity to do it in a private corner in the Dark: it being not fit for the light, for ſuch works and workers hate that, and you need not doubt but they were affraid that ſome <hi>perſons of qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Bishops,</hi> and) others would have come [had they knowne of it] that they could not have hindred; and tho it was the cuſtom yet they did not deſire their Company on that occaſion. Secondly, we muſt neceſſaryly, conclude it is a cheat; becauſe all men know that a Child born in the eighth month can not be ſo perfect luſty and vigorous as one of nine months is; and all that have ſeen this Child ſay it is biger and luſtyer then even this Queen had any when she went full nine months, and indeed biger then any new born Child uſually is. Thirdly; we have great reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it is a cheat, becauſe all <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>Phyloſophers</hi> do affirm that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a Child born in the eighth month to live, but we need not go to thoſe, for Common Experience tels us it is true. Therefore the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> who have undertaken to cheat the whole world, should have laid this deſigne better and have let the Queen been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the ſeventh month, becauſe a Child of the ſeventh month may and often times doth live, ſo that this would have been far more probable to have hid the villany ſeeing it lay in their power to let her be brought to bed when they pleaſed, but they did not think upon it, for their wiſdom zeal and power hath cheated them, and the mighty <hi>providence of god</hi> hath <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

we walk by a more entering ſpirit thou thoſe who doat upon that <hi>dead Letter,</hi> and make a noiſe about that man that was crucified at Jeruſalem, I need not tell thee how uſeles the <hi>dead Letter</hi> is eſpecially where there is the <hi>light</hi> within and <hi>miracles</hi> without; nor how foolish it is to beleeve <hi>three perſons</hi> in the trinity; not how ignorant them people are that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him they call <hi>Chriſt</hi> for their ſalvation, thou knoweſt these thing well and therefore they are to thee the leſs uſeful and indeed ſince I have ſo much to ſay to thee about other more weighty affaires I muſt omit theſe.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding our various diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poinments which we dayly meet with on every ſide, we keep as cloſe to the Rule and method preſcribed as any men in this great affair can do that muſt ingage with ſuch oppoſition; the great point at preſent is that of our young Prince: which me thought would have done far better them of doth, for the Noblem<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

By our laſt Letters from <hi>Holland</hi> we have, Received account that on July the 9th the <hi>M. d'Albeville</hi> our Envoy at the Hague made a great Entertainment there [for Joy of the <hi>young Prince</hi>'s birth] but it unluckily proved but a ſmall one; for he made proviſion for about three hundred perſons and there did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear above twenty: and by the account I have I queſtion whither there had been any there [Except the French and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal Ambaſſadors] had not ſome very honeſt Loyal Gentlemen been then in the Hague who were Intending for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Among theſe three hundred he Expected one hundred of them to be women; but the number fell short and unhappily proved to be but ſeven or eight; of which four of them were very honeſt women of their bodys haveing onely a whisk with their talles. As for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of quallity at that court there was none of them preſent at this Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And should I but tell thee <hi>how Contemptibly</hi> they looked upon the whole matter, and the <hi>Ambaſador</hi> alſo for doeing it, thou woulds Conclude that they had but a very <hi>Indifferent opinion</hi> of the <hi>young Prince,</hi> and what is more, the <hi>young Prince</hi>'s health was not drunk at the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick table; which shews either a great weakneſs in our <hi>Envoy</hi> or Els the gueſts were more in love with the wine, then the cauſe and occaſion of their Meeting: and beſides I hear he is forbid to be prayed for there in the number of the Royal family which makes me think they do miſtruſt or have heard ſomething of the matter; and therefore by the next I deſive a word or two ofthy opinion and what is beſt to be done in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.</p>
            <p>But that which is more conſiderable and abuſive to the Child was at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam the thurſday following being July the 12th. O. S. where there was an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt fellow a Creature of ours that made an Entertainment with a ſupper wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, and fire works: which drew a great concourſe of people to the place beſides the Gueſts invited? the people were grumbling all the Evening and ſaid <hi>[what muſt us have all this ſtir ſor a Baſtard,</hi> and ſuch Expreſſions; but after ſupper they within the houſe offered ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to the people, [the Mob, or Jan Hagel as they there callem] upon which the Mutiny began and the firſt attach was made by ſtones in at the windows, ſwearing they would pull the houſe downe for Joy the <hi>baſtard</hi> was born: this put the Gueſts upon shifting for their lives, ſome crept into the Empty bottles, others got to the next houſes and being night were taken for thieves, the good Catholicks puld out theire beads the three Kings of collen &amp;c. and began to pray: the <hi>women</hi> went through holes

with their feet foremoſt and ſo ſlipt their skins as a ſnake doth at Midſummer to the great aſtonishment of the beholders, and many of them were ſo ingenious that they crept through places where a cat could not go through: but that which is moſt pleaſant of all: B. our old Conſul who I am Informd began the Riot crept into a four Gallon Cask to ſave his life, thus you ſee what reputation our young Prince hath in other Countrys bot the beſt ont is they are all Hereticks.</p>
            <p>And for England, people of all ſorts ſhere are moſt ſcandalouſly abuſive by undecent Expreſſions: ſome ſay he is a millers ſon: ſome, a Gardiners ſon, and others a Carpenters ſon, but all conclude <hi>he is a ſon of a whore,</hi> they alſo ſay that as the Queen was goeing to Maſs news was brought to her that the Child was come and therefore she moſt he brought to bed preſently, others tell it for a poſitive truth that there was a Coachman ſwearing in <hi>St. James</hi>'s court a bout nine of the Clock in the morning and being asked what was the matter with him: he ſwore dam him he had brought two <hi>old Bardes</hi> with a <hi>Baſtard</hi> in a basket and they were gon and had given him but a shilling and he had almoſt kild his horſes to make haſt. And they alſo talk of the Queens Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying plaiſters and takeing medecines to ſtop—but you know en of of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, Theſe and abundance more of ſuch reports is the Common talk and beleef both of City and Country, and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the worſe, and yet <hi>Brother Lob, Brother Alſop, Brother Cox</hi> and many of our friends the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> take a great deal of Pains in their pulpits to pray for him, and preach up the great bleſſing that god in him hath beſtowed upon the nation; and yet poor Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen they are by the people counted <hi>Rogues</hi> for their pains which is very hard.</p>
            <p>It is the adviſe and Council of moſt of our Catholick peers and other well wishers to the cauſe not to make to much haſt, but <hi>Father Peters</hi> ſays it muſt be haſtened for we do not know how little time we have to work and when the King dyes [which we fear] the work is at an End: Therefore it is Reſolved to Cite the Bishops before the Ecleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Comiſſioners againe and to proceed againſt them with all the force poſſible, and alſo to turn out the greateſt part of the Clergy for diſobedience and in their Roms to put in Non Conformiſt, and if they do not anſwer our Ends, or as ſoon as we ſee occaſion we will turn out them and put in Roman Catholick prieſts, it was debated whither we should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the advice or not: to cut them all of at once, but upon Examining our <hi>Army and fleet,</hi> we do not think our ſelves ſtrong enof nor the work yet fit for that Iſſue.
