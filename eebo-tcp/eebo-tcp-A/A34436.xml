            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IF thou art <hi>moderate,</hi> Reading may do thee good, and inform thy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and if thou wilt be <hi>juſt,</hi> thou oughteſt to Read our Defence as well as Charge, and ſeriouſly conſider both: But if thou art <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid,</hi> perhaps thou may'ſt do with Replies or Anſwers to thy Champion's Attempts, as <hi>Goliah</hi> did by <hi>David,</hi> Curſe it, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it, but never give it an Impartial Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal; the Common way our Adverſaries have taken with our Anſwers. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this Preface, is chiefly to let the Reader know what ſort of Adverſary I have to deal with; a Perſon, that is ſaid, by them that know him, to have been Mad
<pb facs="tcp:46683:3"/>
through Pride and Conceitedneſs, for which he hath been under the Doctors Hands: So deeply had Love-Melancholly ſeized him before his Marriage, that as he ſaid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>'Twas impoſſible for him to look upon a Woman, but he muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity Luſt to be Naught with her;</hi> but how it is with him ſince, I will not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. He was one while for exerciſing the Office of a Curate, in the Pariſh of <hi>Burſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town</hi> near <hi>Briſtol;</hi> but ſmelling ſo ſtrong of Presbytery, he could not hold it there long: So that his Reſidence has been moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the Presbyterians ſince, and how he hath Improved his Gift of Preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, they can tell better than I: But his Demands for Preaching have been ſo high (as I am inform'd) as to make ſome of them uneaſie under him. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have had of his Converſation in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, is ſuch, that I dare ſay no moderate Presbyterian (as ſome ſuch I know there are) deſires to hear more of it. That he
<pb facs="tcp:46683:3"/>
has a little Learning, he need not be told of it, for no Ape can be prouder of a Top-knot, than he is of it. A little Rambling Wit he alſo has, but that, with a Spirit of Pride, has undone him, ſince it has eat out all Charity, and fill'd up the vacancy with Prejudice and Envy, even to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that is not common. An inſtance of this thou haſt in his Book, <hi>Page 71.</hi> where he ſaith thus, <hi>Did they</hi> (the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) know by the Spirit of Diſcerning all the Prieſts and Jeſuites that came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, whom they almoſt Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?—.</hi> inſinuating, <hi>That there were amongſt the</hi> Quakers, <hi>both Prieſts and Jeſuites;</hi> which is as falſe and ſly an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation, as if it came directly out of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from the Reformers there, or with the laſt Ship from <hi>Boſton.</hi> But he goes on, Bedloe <hi>told my Brother how often</hi> Whitebread <hi>and he, as well as other</hi> Papiſts, <hi>had been at</hi> Quakers <hi>Meetings; that</hi> Whitebread <hi>Executed was a Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:46683:4"/>
Behold this Impoſtor in his Colours! Who that reads this, and knew neither him that ſaith it, nor the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but would believe that <hi>Whitebread</hi> the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for the Popiſh Plot in <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Reign, was a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and a Preacher among them, which is ſo great a Lie, that it's not poſſible for him to out-do it. But if you ask him, Whether he meant ſo? And Charge it upon him, he may have a way (according to the <hi>Cameronian</hi> Cant) to creep out, by ſaying, I ſaid, that he and other <hi>Papiſts</hi> did go to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (which perhaps may be true enough, as well as many Presbyterians) and that he was a Speaker is true, for ſo he was, unl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſs Dumb; but he did not ſay, that he was a Preacher amongſt the <hi>Quakers.</hi> I muſt confeſs when I ſaw that paſſage, I thought him too great an Impoſtor to be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with a Confutation, (to uſe his own words) and had it not been for that his Books is handed about, and ſold, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd
<pb facs="tcp:46683:4"/>
by many of that Fraternity in the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> I ſhould have left him to Triumph in his Imaginary Victory, as <hi>G.

            <p>I have not replied to every particular Paragraph of his Book, ſince 'tis a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of it Tautological as well as Comical, not fit for a Sober Man to take notice of; and another part is Collections out of the <hi>Snake in the Graſs, &amp;c.</hi> which I have underſtood is Anſwering by another Hand, and to that I refer; uſing as much brevity as poſſible. Another part of it is Directions to his own Tribe; in which, though he has given me juſt occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him, for his Vain and Fooliſh pretences to Divinity; yet ſince 'tis to them, and not me, I ſhall take little notice of it,
<pb facs="tcp:46683:5"/>
(let them diſcover his Fooliſh Pretences if they pleaſe, and detect it too, or elſe the more will be their ſhame) but paſs it by in Silence; nor have I taken notice of all his Allegations againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſince many of them are both Fooliſh, Falſe, and Inſignificant, and too Apiſh for any Reply; but all his Capital Charges I think I have fairly Confuted, and proved him the Impoſtor, by Clearing the <hi>Quakers</hi> of his Charge againſt them.</p>

            <head>THE QUAKERS Cleared From Being <hi>Apoſtates.</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AS Madmen are to be known by the places they are committed to for Cure, more than by their Diſcourſe at ſome times; ſince the maddeſt of Men may have their lucid Intervals, and ſpeak intelligible; ſo, had the Author of the Book Intituled, William Penn <hi>and the</hi> Quakers <hi>either Impoſtors or Apoſtates,</hi> &amp;c. but put his Name to it, there had been little occaſion for an Anſwer, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in thoſe places where the Author is known. But ſince he conceals his Name, and inſtead thereof Subſcribes <hi>Trepidantium Malleus,</hi> and that being ſuch an <hi>Herculean</hi> Character, as if after this Club, Beetle or Hammer, the <hi>Quakers</hi> were no more to hold up their Heads, I think my ſelf obliged to Vindicate the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and their Chriſtian Principles, from the Abuſes of this Hammerer, whoſe Malicious Deſign ſeems to be no leſs than to ſet the Mob, (or his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meronian</hi> Brethren) to tear us (if it were in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46683:6"/>
his Power) to pieces. But if any ſhould think, that I am obliged to Anſwer it Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically, becauſe an Adverſaries Book, I muſt take the liberty to tell them, that, as it is next to an Impoſſibility to reduce a Mad-man's Work to method, ſo it cannot reaſonably be expected that I ſhould exactly trace all <hi>his</hi> wild ranges, or be very Methodical in a Reply to ſuch; for to attempt it would ſhew but little Diſcretion: Yet nevertheleſs, leſt any ſhould object, That a Mad-man may ſometimes ſpeak Truth, I ſhall therefore proceed to examine his Book.</p>
            <p>To paſs by his Humourſome Preface to his Humourſome Brethren, as he calls his Readers, I found a long and tedious Rattle, as full of Noiſe, Scoffing and Envy, as empty of Truth and common Sence, until I got to page 62. where he expreſſeth himſelf thus, <hi>Either what I have charged them with, is true or falſe; if it be falſe, let me be accounted the greateſt Defamer upon Earth, a Perſecutor, or what they pleaſe. If it be true, as I call Heaven and Earth to record it is, and can juſtifie before God and Man, I do ſay it upon mature Conſideration, and with great Compoſure of Mind, that</hi> Penn <hi>and the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>are Impoſtors or Apoſtates.</hi> This I took to be the moſt ſenſible (ſince it was, if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, the reſult of mature Conſideration, and great Compoſure of Mind, which the reſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46683:6"/>
wanted) and Rational though Malicious Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in all his whole Book, and that led me more ſeriouſly to conſider, Whether what he had Charged the <hi>Quakers</hi> with, was or could be proved againſt them; ſince if it could not, he ſo freely at one Caſt Condemned himſelf for the greateſt Defamer upon Earth, a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us therefore now take a view of his Charges, and ſee whether they be true or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 6. His firſt is againſt <hi>Lawrence Steel, for being lifted up with Pride, and falling into the Condemnation of the Devil.</hi> A great Charge! But wherein was his Pride, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> The Reaſon he aſſigns for it was, his ſaying, <hi>Not that I am perfect, would I were:</hi> As if to be ſenſible of Imperfection, and to wiſh to be freed from it, were to be lifted up with Pride. But to this I ſhall ſay more elſewhere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 7. His next is by way of Query, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> George Biſhop <hi>of the City of</hi> Briſtol, <hi>a Scholar, was not a moſt deceitful Writer? Anſ.</hi> He was not for any thing that he hath proved againſt him, but that he himſelf has cleared him from being ſo, is moſt evident, from his acknowledging that <hi>G. B. has given a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count out of theſe Authors,</hi> viz. Euſebius, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, &amp;c, <hi>and that</hi> Jerom, <hi>and others, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt taking Oaths,</hi> as well as the <hi>Quakers;</hi> to prove which, was one of the grand Deſigns of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46683:7"/>
that Book. And that the <hi>Quakers</hi> were like them for Suffering, he alſo grants: <hi>But ſo,</hi> ſays he, <hi>were the Proteſtants in Queen</hi> Mary<hi>'s Days.</hi> Now what is this, but to eclipſe, if poſſible, the Glory of thoſe Martyrs? But he adds, <hi>So were the Papiſts in Queen</hi> Elizabeth<hi>'s Days, and the Nonconformiſts in King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second's.</hi> That the Proteſtants ſuffered in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days, is true; and that they were Crowned with Martyrdom, is equally true: As alſo it is, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> were the Objects of <hi>his</hi> Brethrens hatred, who when they had the Power in their Hands, exerciſed ſo much Cruelty, that it coſt many of them their Lives; as alſo that they were expoſed (after <hi>their Joſhua</hi> was turned out, and King <hi>Charles</hi> came in) to very great and terrible Perſecutions, as Impriſonments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that any of the Nonconformiſts ſuffered at that time, was rare; I will not ſay none did, but it was very few, for they found the <hi>ſame</hi> way for themſelves, that the Pope found for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which was, that though they did Conform to the Church of <hi>England</hi> in outward appearance, yet they ſhould keep their Hearts fixed on him, and the Catholick Church, which was the exact pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our Conforming Nonconformiſts: Thus Papiſts, and ſuch Noncons, agree upon one and the ſame way to diſſemble with God
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46683:7"/>
Almighty, and to Cheat the World, till the firſt could furniſh themſelves with Tools to Blow up the King and Parliament, and the latter to Murder their <hi>King; Remember</hi> Rye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe. But that he is ſo angry with <hi>Geo. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> I do not wonder, ſeeing he has ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally laid open the Horrid Barbarity and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committed by thoſe beloved Brethren in <hi>New-England,</hi> upon the Perſons of many of the People called <hi>Quakers.</hi>

and his Party, by reflecting on the Inſtruments of that Work, that he may have the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſee them upon all Occaſions ſtand Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: Againſt whom, as well as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he already hath not omitted to throw ſome of his envious Darts, but in this he is not like to be gratified, nor is it in any wiſe needful, ſeeing their Sufferings are too freſh in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of moſt ſtaid Perſons, to require the Trouble to enumerate them, or any proofs to perſwade their Truth: And beſides, that to recount but a ſmall proportion of what they underwent for their conſtant maintaining, and openly owning, in the hotteſt Rage of Perſecution, what they were called to profeſs, (far contrary to what he would falſly ſuggeſt) would ſwell this piece too much beyond its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Bulk. Or another Reaſon that might induce him to urge ſo unjuſt a Charge againſt us, might be a deſire to alleviate that juſt one brought againſt themſelves, of being Deſerters of their Cauſe in Times of Danger, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Quakers</hi> (a People well known to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed others for ſtedfaſtneſs in ſuch Caſes) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the level for Cowardice with himſelf and Brethren, and ſo render them as fearful, and from thence as guilty as they, whoſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and avowed Practice has been to ſhift from Corner to Corner in Woods, remote and obſcure Places, or any where, to ſave their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46683:8"/>
ſuppoſing themſelves not to be called to Suffer, though to Believe; ſo that this Charge of omitting open Duties for many Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſeems to have aimed at us, but direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hits at the Heads of his own Fraternity, for it touches not the <hi>Quakers,</hi> notwithſtanding his unheard of Impudence in bringing it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and that for ſeveral Years too, though when and what Years, there's not one word, nor in what particular place neither, but generally all <hi>England</hi> over, it ſeems, which is ſo very falſe, that almoſt every Pariſh where any <hi>Quakers</hi> lived, can give him the Lie.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the place he ſo often with Indignation mentions, it is Notorious, that when the Men and Women that conſtituted the Meetings, were taken up, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Priſon, the very Children, by their conſtant Attendance at the uſual times and place, kept up the Meeting, till <hi>they</hi> alſo were ſent away with the reſt, until the very Floors of the Priſon, Tables and Hammocks were ſo full, that it was ſcarce poſſible to croud in any more, unleſs they ſhould ſtow them one upon another: At which time there was ſcarce a Presbyterian to be found, that had Religion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to think it worth Suffering for: Nay, ſo far were they from it, that they were frighted out of the very Profeſſion, into a Conformity to that, which they eſteemed lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46683:9"/>
better, ſome time before, than <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and in that Converted State they continued till K. <hi>James</hi> his Toleration awakened them; for which Favour, by their Addreſſes to him, they Mortgaged their Lives and Fortunes. Nay, ſo ſtedfaſt were the <hi>Quakers</hi> to what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that when by the great Heat and Fury that poſſeſt ſome Men, (who ſince, I hope, have ſeen the Evil of ſuch violent practices) there were Diſtreſſes of great Value made on them, and had their Meeting-houſe rifled and ſhut up againſt them, they continued their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual gathering at the Door, and from thence were haled away to Priſon, till <hi>Bridewell,</hi> as well as <hi>Newgate,</hi> was fill'd with them, and yet even then they deſiſted not from their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Service for the Worſhip of God, though by the violence of the Keepers, they often ſuffered great Abuſes for it. Let him therefore prove that, inſtead of omitting pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Duties for many Years together, there was Omiſſion in any part of <hi>England,</hi> when their Perſons were at liberty from Priſon to meet; and till he does this, he muſt ſtand Charged as an Impoſtor himſelf, and by his own free Election aſſumes the Titles of the <hi>Greateſt Defamer upon Earth, a Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor. or what we pleaſe.</hi> But if he ſhould find two or three, or a few Particular Perſons, prof<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

part of Chriſtian Policy, as his Brethren did both practiſe and adviſe to, they therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined from their Principles, and from the <hi>Quakers</hi> general Practice: But this neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, nor their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples at all; but thanks be to God, there is no one thing they could have more belied us in: For as the Lord by his Grace called us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſo alſo were we enabled to ſuffer for his Name and the Goſpels ſake, and of our Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs herein, we have (by the Goodneſs of God who hath helped us) given ſufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration.</p>
            <p>But the Devil commonly deſtroys his own Work at laſt, by ſome Folly or Lies, he plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges his Vaſſals into, as is evident in the envious but falſe Information, this Man gives of <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Steel</hi>'s deſerting the Publick Worſhip of God, after his Releaſment from Priſon, which though true in a Senſe, yet is notoriouſly falſe and wicked in him, for this reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That though he never frequented Meetings after; yet it was not either through Fear or Policy, but only becauſe of his great Indiſpoſition and Inability of Body (through a Complication of Diſeaſes) that attended him ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Releaſment out of Priſon, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards continued and encreaſed upon him to the terminating of his Days: So that it was not want of Will, but Ability of Body, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46683:10"/>
kept him from it. And as for <hi>E. S.</hi> who he ſaith, <hi>With one more, were the only Perſons that held out,</hi> is as falſe as the former, <hi>E. S.</hi> not being reſident in <hi>Briſtol</hi> (but was ſeveral Miles from it) nor in any wiſe belonging to it, but rather a Stranger in that reſpect. And <hi>that none but ſhe and</hi> D.

V.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the deviation of the <hi>Quakers</hi> from their Principles, <hi>R. V.</hi> ſhould tell him, <hi>That they had now changed their Minds,</hi> which <hi>R.

            <p>But if any were ſo weak and feeble, as not to be able to ſtand Suffering for the Faith of Chriſt, it may be partly owing to the Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they had with Neighbours of his Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe wheedles went a great way with too many: For when the Fury of the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors was vented upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> (the others being fled) it was common with them to come creeping, <hi>Ah Neighbours, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you, and keep you; we pray for you that you may ſtand, but we are not able, we hope we ſhall all be brought nearer together by theſe Storms; we have all but one Head, our Miniſters have left us,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>But to proceed, page 12. he tells us a Story of <hi>Lawrence Steel,</hi> that <hi>for refuſing to Swear, he was committed to Priſon, and after that never went to Meeting more;</hi> and why pray? <hi>But becauſe</hi> he <hi>Died.</hi> Is not that a great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his and the <hi>Quakers</hi> Apoſtacy? <hi>R.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46683:11"/>
of the 35th of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church; and being by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and Writ of Error, removed from <hi>Newgate</hi> in <hi>Briſtol</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> at the <hi>King's Bench-Bar,</hi> he was legally Diſcharged, but three Days after his return Home, his Father dying, and by his Will, the place (where he Deceaſed, at <hi>Chew</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire)</hi> falling to <hi>R.

            </p>
            <p>But <hi>all the reſt,</hi> he ſays, <hi>did the like, except</hi> E. S. <hi>and</hi> D.

But <hi>all the reſt, ſave theſe two, declined meeting, from the time that</hi> Lawrence Steel <hi>was put out of Priſon.</hi> If this be true, then the <hi>Beetle</hi> has not belied them; but that he has, almoſt every intelligent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> at that time knows, and can give him the Lie: This is the Man that ſays, <hi>If what I have Charged them with be not true, let me be accounted the greateſt Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer upon Earth,</hi> &amp;c. which according to his own Imprecation, he has drawn upon his Head.</p>

            <p>His alledging the <hi>Quakers</hi> left Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their Learning, and yet followed <hi>Penn</hi> becauſe of his, ſhews his Ignorance, as well as Baſeneſs, being falſe in every part of it: For the <hi>Quakers</hi> never left any Miniſters for their Learning, but becauſe they were Unlearned, <hi>viz.</hi> in the School of Chriſt: Nor did the <hi>Quakers</hi> follow <hi>W.

Of <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Man in their common Practice, after they have ſo often decried it,</hi> is altogether unjuſt; for though there may be ſome profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Quakers,</hi> that Humour this Practice too much: Yet as it is neither allow'd of at all, nor practiced in general, 'tis unfair in him to

            <p>He asks, <hi>Page</hi> 19. Whether it were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of Diſſimulation, to tell <hi>O. C.

allow the preference where it is due, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fix it upon the Author of the <hi>Snake in the Graſs,</hi> for more <hi>Wit</hi> (I will not ſay more <hi>Honeſty)</hi> than to avouch as this Hammerer does, p. 62. all he ſaith againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> with ſuch an Imprecation; for as he without doubt knew it to be a Bundle of Lies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo for his Diverſion he thought he might make bold to ſport himſelf with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as other Comical Blades uſe to do. But, if it be his hard Fate too, to have his <hi>Zipporah,</hi> which by <hi>Anonymus</hi>'s telling is too common to Men of his Coat, I am induced to believe he might have another deſign in it, <hi>viz.</hi> to get ſome ſupplies for his Pocket unknown to her, and out of her reach, to make Merry with among his Companions.</p>

Yet to detect him in his Folly and Falſhood, and the better to inſtruct others, I ſhall briefly expreſs our Sence therein, which is, That in both Prayer and Thankſgiving, as well as Preaching, they are partly <hi>Paſſive,</hi> and partly <hi>Active:</hi> Paſſive, in that they ſubmit to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power and Spirit of God, to impreſs upon <hi>their</hi> Spirits a grateful Senſe of the Favours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for which their Hearts are filled with Thankfulneſs: And <hi>Active,</hi> in expreſſing ſuch Thoughts as the Spirit ſhall ſuggeſt to their Underſtanding, as ſuitable to the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Thus for Thankſgiving, and for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it is the ſame thing; for ſince it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that quickens, how can a Man pray with a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46683:14"/>
true Sence without it? For till that quickens him to it, his Prayer is dead, dry, and formal, which God will not hear; ſince 'tis his own, and not another Spirit, he will hear. And in Preaching the Goſpel, it is the Spirit that opens the Underſtanding, and makes it fruitful in the Knowledge of God, and <hi>incites</hi> Men, ſo qualified, to impreſs the ſame Image on others, which cannot be without being <hi>Active</hi> as well as <hi>Paſſive.</hi>

            <p>Upon all Occaſions he is bringing in his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculing Stories and Reflections, in Deriſion of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> moſt of which are either falſe or fooliſh; and among the reſt he brings this, page 30. <hi>What ſaith the Scripture,</hi> ſaid one to me, <hi>Every Tub muſt ſtand upon his own bottom:</hi> Now whether this is true or not, I will not Diſpute; for 'tis poſſible ſuch a miſtake might be committed, by taking a common Maxim for Scripture, but what is this to Religion? I can tell him of as great a miſtake in one of his Fraternity, (whom I could name if I pleaſed) that told me, That Chriſt foretold Deceivers ſhould come in the laſt Days; and that he ſaid, By this ſhall they be known, they ſhall come fore,

But that he ſhould go about to Ape and Ridicule the <hi>Church-men</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> way of Preaching; and know that there is ſuch a Book as the <hi>Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence</hi> in the World, ſhews his Impudence, and is Aſtoniſhing, if the Man were not known. However, I would adviſe him to ſpend ſome time on that Book, and then let him tell me, Whether it would not be more becoming him, to endeavour to clear his own Fraternity from what they ſtand there charged with; and if he cannot, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour their Reformation, before he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to Ridicule others, with what his Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſuggeſts to him they are guilty of, though upon enquiry nothing more falſe.</p>
            <p>What he ſays of <hi>J. M.</hi> is true, for he did Apoſtatize, and yielded to the Temptation of the Devil; but I hope that <hi>he</hi> will not ſay

much of ſuch a Sin as that, nor throw many Stones at him about it, for <hi>his</hi> own ſake, as well as for his Brothers, who (when the King's Guards came to apprehend him) was ſafe in Bed, (with I need not ſay who) the Story is well known, and he may not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it, I ſuppoſe.</p>

But he adds, G.

He ought
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46683:18"/>
to have fixt it in the Front of his Book for a Sign, and Specimen in groſs of his whole Work (if it may be call'd ſo) and to have told his Readers in plain terms, This is the part that I am acting; if you expect any ſolid Senſe or Reaſon, or any thing elſe, but much ſuch as this; pray be pleaſed to enquire elſewhere, for I am not furniſhed; it's true, I have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in page 62. For if this were not the Poor Man's Caſe, can any one think he would have here ſaid, G.

If a Man in his Senſes affirm that <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Gray</hi> are two diſtinct Colours, this bawling unintelligible Obſtinate will never be perſwaded to it, but muſt have his word for it, like another <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> paſs for Goſpel Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for to purſue urging it, may bring him into a Condition that will require half a Dozen Men to rule him: So though flying and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may not be all one with our Hammerer,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46683:18"/>
yet ſtanding is flying; or elſe <hi>G. W.</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be proved guilty of flying. This is too Notorious in the City of <hi>London,</hi> as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, to be denied: And for <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s part, if I ſhould ſay any thing to clear him, it would be as uſeleſs, as <hi>his</hi> Charge is falſe, and will fail of Credit, ſeeing all that know there is ſuch a place as the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and a <hi>Newgate,</hi> and concerned themſelves at that time with the enquiry into ſuch Matters, may ſufficiently know what a ſhare he had (though unjuſtly) in both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for no other Cauſe than for being a <hi>Quaker;</hi> ſo that this is a Lie in Fact, that he will never be able to prove, no more than he hath done it here.</p>
            <p>The next place where he mentions <hi>G. W.</hi> (and if any where it muſt be here) is in page 20. where he ſays, he heard <hi>G. W.</hi> Expound <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 1, 4. which is, <hi>Wiſdom hath built her a houſe—ſhe crieth, Whoſo is ſimple, let him turn in hither, and for him that is void of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.

W.</hi> did thus Expound the Text, which ſeems to me to be this Hammerers part to prove, as well as ſay, for <hi>G. W.</hi> denies it as a groſs Perverſion; and they that know <hi>G.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46683:19"/>
he underſtands the Scriptures better than thus to abuſe them; and for my part, ſeeing that in none of his Writings, any ſuch incongruity is to be found, nor in all his Preaching that ever I heard, which I have often done both in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> and elſewhere, never was there any ſuch incoherent Expreſſion uſed by him: And for his Knowledge of Scriptures, and Soundneſs of Doctrine, he is too far out of the reach of any Impeachment, by ſuch a vain trifling Adverſary, to be wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Malice.—And now, after ſo many Falſhoods and Forgeries detected in him, with what Face can he think of his 62 page? I need but quote it, 'tis his Doom. Oh horrid hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and preſumption, for a Man to call Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth to Record to the Truth of what he knows to be apparently Falſe!</p>
            <p>In his next Page he ſaith, <hi>Know, Reader,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I have made no uſe of Books, nor Men, to help me in this Work,</hi> and yet from p. 64, to 73. is little elſe but Quotations out of the <hi>Snake in the Graſs,</hi> and <hi>Pennyman</hi>'s Papers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Confeſſion: And from page 63. backwards, no leſs than between 50 and 60 times has he told his Reader, what ſuch an one told him, or what he hath heard or read concerning the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and yet after all this, hath the Impudence to tell his Reader, <hi>That he hath made no uſe of Books nor</hi>

               <hi>Men in this Work.</hi> What can be ſaid of ſo grand an <hi>Impoſtor?</hi> Oh heighth of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Falſhood!

And though Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy I am apt to think he was never guilty of, becauſe 'tis reaſonable to believe he was ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever good for any thing; yet <hi>Impoſtor</hi> is his Character, and that in the higheſt degree, and with that I would leave him, were it not for a few paſſages more, that I will proceed to take notice of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 73. He queries thus, <hi>Are not the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>more Sober than once they were?</hi> He An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers himſelf in the Affirmative: Well, ſince we are amending, 'tis to be hoped we ſhall be mended at laſt; I am glad we are growing better and better: But for his part, if he be ſure of any one thing in Religion, notwithſtanding our mending, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 60.</note> we ſhall never be ſaved, no, not one of us: Such Charity is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Page</hi> 71.</note> to his Principles. He queries again, <hi>Are they not temperate above others?</hi> To this he Anſwers, Let every Man ſpeak as they find; but a <hi>Quakers</hi> Wife next Door to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46683:20"/>
him at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> confeſs'd to him, that her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was a Notorious Secret Drunkard. I will not deſcant on his <hi>Notorious Secrecy,</hi> ſince he pretends to be a Scholar; but when he is in his <hi>Tantarums,</hi> I ſuppoſe, publick and private, open and ſecret are all one with him. But ſince he allows every Man to ſpeak as he finds; and ſeeing that is the eaſieſt way to make up the Accompt, will e'en leave it there: But then he ſhould not ſpeak contrary to what he had found, which I dare ſay he did, not only in this, but in the Caſe of the Strong-water-ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; or elſe to be ſure his Charity would not conceal their Names, if publiſhing them might Reproach the <hi>Quakers;</hi> for 'tis apparent he neither ſticks at Perſons nor Things, that he thinks will diſcredit the <hi>Quakers:</hi> Nay, if he cannot find matter to aſperſe them with here, he will fetch it from the other ſide of the Globe, but he'll have it: Beſides, any Man ſhall ſtraight have the Title of a <hi>Quaker</hi> thrown on him, that acts Ridiculouſly, if from thence there may any Scandal ariſe, or it can yield a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to Reproach the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as witneſs the <hi>Cullompton</hi> Prophet mentioned before. But <hi>wet and dry</hi> Quakers <hi>are a diſtinction,</hi> ſays he, <hi>in other places beſides</hi> Briſtol. And what of all that? Suppoſe there were ſuch, that uſe his, or his Brethrens, or others Company, till they demerit the Name of a <hi>Wet Quaker,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46683:20"/>
they frequent the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meetings: Doth that Intitle the <hi>Quakers</hi> to their Misbehavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? Let him at this Day, or Days paſt, prove, that any Perſon ſo Chargeable, was not dealt with, and followed by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> till they had diſowned him: Nay, though it were ſuch an one, as after many Years, like the Sow turn'd to the Mire again. This is too Notorious in <hi>Briſtol</hi> to be denied, and it would be well for his Brethren, if they did as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do in ſuch Caſes, the Reproaches that are caſt on Religion, would in a great degree be taken off.</p>
            <p>But beſides, I admire he ſhould bring this as a Charge againſt the <hi>Quakers;</hi> for certainly in my Judgment, it makes more for their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit than the contrary; for that none of them can deviate from the ſtrictneſs of the Rules they profeſs, but they ſhall have preſently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, a diſtinguiſhing Character fixt on them, is a great Argument of the Peoples Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Regularity in general, above other Profeſſors, among whom no ſuch thing is to be found; though the worſt of theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> are ſeldom ſo Bad as Thouſands of others of moſt Profeſſions, that nevertheleſs are ſuffered to paſs in the throng.</p>
            <p>But he queries again, <hi>Are they not very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſons?</hi> His Anſwer is Negatively firſt, and then Poſitively, That <hi>they are more Proud</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:46683:21"/>
               <hi>of their Plainneſs than others of their Bravery.</hi> All to me is, how <hi>Anonymous</hi> came to know this, ſince Inſpiration with him is Hereſie? And to be ſure, the <hi>Quakers never told him ſo:</hi> But this is like the reſt, a Birth of his own Fancy; and as ſuch, I return it to him. He queries once more, and that is, Whether the <hi>Quakers</hi> are not <hi>more juſt in their Dealings than others, and careful not to tell a Lie?</hi> To this he aſſents, though very unwillingly; but to make it as bad as he can, (for this you know is but dry Morality: he yoaks us <hi>up with the</hi> Turks <hi>in it:</hi> While he that is of the Election of Grace, is pleading for Lying as no unlawful thing.—But to prove <hi>G.

Yet I wonder how he came to add, <hi>That ſome of them were put to Death too.</hi> But that his Brethren, that thought Hanging, and cutting off Ears, too good for the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Ignorance of their being ſo Whipt, when one had his Fleſh beaten to a Jelly, and many others Whipt for Miles together at the Carts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46683:21"/>
for no other Reaſon, but becauſe they were <hi>Quakers,</hi> is a ſtrange degree of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>But before I go farther, I muſt ſtep back to page 51. where he ſaith theſe words, <hi>And now</hi> William Penn, <hi>I once more declare to thee, and all the World, that I am ready to meet with thee at an open Diſputation, when thou wilt, to Debate the Queſtion before us, or the main Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which is, Whether your flying in time of Perſecution, doth not prove you either Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Impoſtors or Apoſtates?</hi> I have been the more large in this Quotation, that his Shapes may be ſeen the better; for how great a Fool was he to pawn his Soul with ſuch an Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as in page 62. for the Truth of what he Charges the <hi>Quakers</hi> with; and yet in page 51. of the ſame Book, which he Intitles, William Penn <hi>and the</hi> Quakers <hi>proved Impoſtors or Apoſtates;</hi> I ſay, in page 51. of his Book, Challengeth <hi>W.

both, or either, as long as the <hi>Quakers</hi> have done, they will find another Character for them, than Honeſt and Ingenious.</p>
            <p>Where he ſays, That <hi>ſome are for counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing a Lie now and then for Friends,</hi> 'tis ſtill of a piece with the reſt; and what he is ſo far from being able to prove, that I believe he ſcarce ever thought of it: But 'tis ſo much out of Faſhion now with him, to give us any thing of Truth in his Charges, that it is ſcarce reaſonable to expect it, or any ſort of Proof for what he ſays: For, more than wild Rambles and Forgeries, he is reſolved we ſhall have but little. But in that Addreſs of his to William <hi>King of</hi> Penſylvania, <hi>page</hi> 83. where he begins, <hi>May it pleaſe your Majeſty,</hi> &amp;c. he appears ſo very much himſelf, that he leaves little room for wonder at any thing he has writ beſides. Nor is it any more ſtrange, that a Man poſſeſt with what <hi>he</hi> hath been too deeply Tinctured with, ſhould Create <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of other Men at pleaſure; than it is for them to fancy themſelves ſo, and enjoy all the Imaginary Bliſs too, that ſuch a ſtate can afford, as he ſeems to do, of his fancy'd Victory over the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſomething of which he expreſſes in his next words; where, <hi>Now Friends,</hi> ſays he, <hi>how will you Anſwer me? I am ſure no Sober nor Rational Anſwer can be given.</hi> 'Tis pity there ſhou'd, for ſure it would be loſt,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46683:22"/>
if he means to ſuch Harangues as this, where his wild Fancy can ſtart up Kings at ſuch a rate. What thanks he may have from Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for this, I will not conclude, but this is our Man of <hi>mature Conſideration, and great Compoſure of Mind.</hi> But one thing in his paſt Harangue, we muſt take notice of, which is, his adviſing King <hi>William</hi> to keep his Subjects from Drunkenneſs, Whoredom, <hi>&amp;c. leſt the Prophecy of</hi> Jo. Owen <hi>ſhould be verified againſt Friends.</hi> Strange Contradictions! <hi>Revelation</hi> and Divine <hi>Inſpiration</hi> is ceaſed, yet <hi>Jo.

he ſo often exclaims againſt? But what can we expect different from this, from a Man that ſeems to be made up of Malice, Forgeries and Lies, as he appears to be through his Book.</p>
            <p>But as for his Account of <hi>Hugh</hi>'s of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> I wonder his Friends would ſuffer him to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale it in Print, unleſs the reviving of that Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry would take off the Imputation, which can never be, unleſs there were better Vouchers for it than this Hammerer; no, nor then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but with ſuch as knew not the Man.</p>
            <p>But being at length fully recovered from his Doctrinal Part, he falls in p. 123. into an angry Humour with <hi>Miniſters Wives for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome</hi> Quakers <hi>an account of the ill Conditions of their Husbands:</hi> I take this to be the Story; and if ſo, I ſay, it was not well done of the Women, to expoſe their Husbands Infirmities, unleſs it were a Caſe of Conſcience: Though many a Poor Woman pays dear enough at Home, for being led abroad once a Week in her Topknot; but what their Lot is, they muſt ſubmit to, and wade through it, as they can. Yet if the Women will Goſſip, and tell of the Cheats of their Husbands, why ſhould not they be believed, as well as the <hi>Quaker</hi>'s Wife he told of in p. 74. When it becomes his own Caſe, he is not for hearing any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Complaints againſt their Husbands; but then, he not only (if you will believe him)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46683:24"/>
heard it, but hath alſo printed it; though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the truer for that.</p>
            <p>He ſays he knew a Famous Miniſter, whoſe Wife broke his Heart; he adviſes Miniſters to keep their Ground; for if they do not rule, their Wives will: He quotes many Preſidents for being Henpeckt, which would make one ſuſpect, that he himſelf was too deeply affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that way: But on enquiry, I find his Wife hath the hardeſt ſide of it by far; and ſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Proverb, The worſt Spoak cracks firſt. But to come to an end (for 'tis time nor had I been here, but to clear the Truth, and its Profeſſors, and expoſe his Folly; that, if poſſible, he may be aſhamed of it, and of himſelf for its ſake) with a Parcel of Verſes, (though none of his) very well adapted to a Chiding Woman, and a few Scoffs and Jeers upon She Friends, as he calls them, together with another Ramble of unheard of Lies, which he pretends to deliver as the Sence of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he ends his Work, and lays down his Hammer, but not without a falſe ſtroke to the very laſt, (leſt it ſhould any where fail of being all of a Thread) which is thus; <hi>This Barclay,</hi> ſays he, <hi>tells us, if Infallibility be not in his Enthuſiaſms, 'tis not lodged in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but we muſt go for it to the Chair of</hi> Rome. Here I cannot find a ſofter Expreſſion than this, The Lake is for the Liar, and the Liar for

the Lake, and that's the Portion of all ſuch, unleſs they Repent; for <hi>R. B.</hi> no where in his Printed Books, ſays ſo, though this Lying Adverſary of ours has the Impudence to aſſert it; but the beſt of it is, 'tis with the ſame Credit with the reſt. But he goes on thus, <hi>Every thing,</hi> Poor Robin, <hi>to its Centre; thy Doctrine came from</hi> Rome, <hi>tends to</hi> Rome; <hi>and many that knew thee, believe that thou were't not to be reckoned in the number of Proteſtants.</hi> But why thus, <hi>Poor Robin?</hi> And once before, <hi>away Poor Robin,</hi> what ſhould induce him to call over his Name at this rate? I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whether it was from his great Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with <hi>Poor Robin</hi>'s <hi>Almanacks,</hi> as part of his Study, or with a deſign to leſſen the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>R.

IT is not becauſe I Love Controverſie, or affect popularity, that I have undertook to write the foregoing Reply, but becauſe I would take off thoſe Bear-skins, this lurking Adverſary has endeavoured to wrap us in; nor indeed had I undertook it, if many, or moſt of our Friends that are qualified for ſuch Services, had not declined it as a Scurrilous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, not worth their notice, partly from the Matter it ſelf, as being Falſe, Idle, Comical and Vain, and partly from the Knowledge they had of the Author, ſince he is ſo well known to be out of his right Mind: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he may not be generally known to be ſo where his Book may come; and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Book is handed about from one to another of the Brotherhood, and entertained with great Applauſe, as an unanſwerable Piece, I found my ſelf concerned to Vindicate the Truth, againſt his Malicious Slanders. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it's not his Caſe only, but many more of that Complection for many Years paſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in peaceable Times, to be throwing their Squibs at the <hi>Quakers,</hi> although in Times of Perſecution they generally are more quiet.</p>
            <p>If they had any reaſonable or juſt Cauſe to Reproach us for holding any Erroneous or Hurtful Principles, it were ſomething: But when we are Condemned for Hereticks, it is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46683:26"/>
by <hi>their</hi> Forgeries, Lies and Perverſions, which they would inſinuate was <hi>our</hi> Belief: One while we are <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> although we Challenge any of them to go as far as they dare, in any of the Negative Doctrines of the Reformation. Another while we deny the Humanity of Chriſt, by and by his Divinity. One while we cannot Pray without the Spirit, by and by we expect to Merit Salvation by our own Works. One while we are for turning the whole Scripture into Allegories, by and by Perſecuted, becauſe we keep to Scripture words.</p>
            <p>Their great News about our not Confeſſing our Sins, is as falſe as the reſt, though perhaps grounded upon our not doing it in the ſame Cuſtomary way and manner that our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries uſe: But what then, doth it therefore follow, as he wickedly inſinuates, (page firſt) <hi>That we think our ſelves too good, and too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to ask a Holy God forgiveneſs for any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, in Thought, Word or Astion,</hi> by no means? Nay, ſee how Contradictory he is; he chargeth L. S. <hi>for Pride, and falling into the Condemnation of the Devil, becauſe he wiſht for being in a perfect Eſtate, but acknowledged he was not ſo.</hi> But in another place (if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him) he tells you, <hi>We don't think of any Imperfection in us, or deſire of Forgiveneſs,</hi> or to that effect: But now <hi>L. S.</hi> don't pretend to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46683:26"/>
it, but wiſht he was ſo: Who will Credit ſuch a Sayer and Unſayer? But as we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to Confeſs our Faults one to another, and not to hide our Sins, for then we ſhall not proſper, but confeſs and forſake, and we ſhall find Mercy; ſo the <hi>Quakers</hi> believe, and alſo practice: And if he is Ignorant hereof, it's his Fault, and not ours. In ſhort, Confeſſion we <hi>own,</hi> and know it to be our Indiſpenſible Duty, To God, for every Sin againſt him, either in Thought, Word or Action: To Man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have Treſpaſſed againſt him: To the Church, wherein we have offended her. And when the Lord is pleaſed by his Spirit, to draw forth any of his Servants and Miniſters, into either an Acknowledgment of Sins paſt, or Deſire of Forgiveneſs, or both, in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Gifts amongſt the People they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, and on whoſe Behalf their Petitions are put up; we are ſo far from diſapproving hereof, or thinking our ſelves <hi>above</hi> it, that it is exceeding Comfortable and Edifying to us. But this we ſhall never deny, that thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Pangs of a Penitent Soul, thoſe Sighs and Groans, as well as Words, that ariſe from a wounded Spirit, are more acceptable to God, than ſuch a Cuſtomary, Formal crying out, <hi>Lord, the beſt of our Performances are Sin, yea, our Holy Duties are Sin; but do thou be merciful to us, miſerable Sinners; and ſo go, and ſo come,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:46683:27"/>
               <hi>from Year to Year</hi> as if after ſuch a Confeſſion, God Almighty was obliged to forgive; not conſidering, that 'tis thoſe only that Confeſs and Forſake, that ſhall find Mercy.</p>
            <p>Then again, <hi>How often are we ſcofft and mockt at, and compared to the Pope, becauſe we aſſert, That Men ought to be Infallibly aſſured of their Duty to God, and that the Spirit of God, a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of which is given to every Man to profit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, is Infallible, and if minded, will ſo Infallibly aſſure them, that they ſhall be beyond doubt, which is a toſſed (but not Comfortable) Eſtate?</hi> From this, 'tis common with our Adverſaries to ſay, That <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>pretend to Infallibility, and when once turn'd</hi> Quakers, <hi>are Infallible.</hi> Now that we pretend to Infallibility is true, but 'tis as before expreſſed; not placing it in Perſons or Opinion, but the Spirit of God, which they themſelves can't deny to be Infallible: And as Man is governed by that Spirit, he will <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> be led out of all that which is Fallible and Erroneous, both in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Life:</hi> Yea, they themſelves will (I hope) allow the Scripture to be <hi>an Infallible Rule,</hi> and if ſo, the Spirit of God muſt be yet much more ſo, ſince from it the Scripture came, <hi>For Holy Men of Old, ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But for my part, I would not give a Ruſh for that Religion, that is only <hi>Certain</hi> in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty,</hi> which is the ſtate of all that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46683:27"/>
hath not an Infallible Rule to walk by.</p>
            <p>Again, about the Holy Scriptures, how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominably have our Adverſaries abuſed us, particularly this Hammerer, ſaying, <hi>'Tis no Rule to us; and that we have Curſed more than a Thouſand times, thoſe that call the Scriptures the Word of God.</hi> This needs no Confutation from me, ſince every Body that know the <hi>Quakers,</hi> know alſo that they uſe <hi>Curſing</hi> no more than <hi>Swearing;</hi> yet this is the Man, that if he don't ſpeak Truth of us, <hi>Deſires to be Eſteemed a Perſecutor, or the greateſt Defamer on Earth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now although we do not commonly call the Scriptures the Word of God, becauſe we <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> between them and Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who is</hi> called in Scripture <hi>the Word of God;</hi> yet it is not in the leaſt to derogate from the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Dignity that is due thereto, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an Attribute <hi>peculiar</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt the Word, although as they declare the Mind of God, with reſpect to us, and are his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to us, they may in that reſpect be called the Word or Command of God; and ſo the <hi>Quakers Own</hi> and <hi>Eſteem</hi> them, and <hi>Rejoice</hi> in them, ſince they afford ſuch a Comfortable Hiſtory of the Dealings of the Lord with his People through many Generations, and of the Coming of his Son, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his Birth, Works, Doctrine, Miracles, Sufferings,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46683:28"/>
Death, Reſurrection, Aſcention, Glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preſent Mediation, and of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the End of the World to Judge both Quick and Dead, of the Reſurrection of the Juſt and Unjuſt, with many more Precious and Comfortable Doctrines, all which are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Holy Scripture, and Writ for our Learning, that <hi>by Faith</hi> in Chriſt, the Man of God, through them, may be thoroughly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht to every good Word and Work.</p>
            <p>And to that end we may have the true and right uſe of them, it is requiſite Men apply themſelves to the Spirit of God in the reading thereof, which never Contradicts its own Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony in the Scripture, but Corroborates it, and makes it much more Effectual for Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Comfort; as ſaid the Prophet, <note n="a" place="bottom">Ezek. 36. 27.</note> 
               <hi>I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and keep my judgments,</hi> &amp;c. and to this end we have direc<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Spirit of God within them: For without the Aſſiſtance thereof, the Reader hath not the true Comfort of them; and therefore it's falſe in Fact, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny the Holy Scriptures, and eſteem them but Dirt, Serpents Meat, Death, and Dead Letter, as this Hammerer, the <hi>Snake in the Graſs, Criſp, Bugg,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith: For we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46683:28"/>
believe the Scripture in it ſelf is very good and <hi>profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteouſneſs: That the Man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good Works.</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="bottom">2 Tim. 3. 16, 17.</note> But the Beſt Inſtruments in the World put into the Hands of a Fool, or one of no Capacity, is no more to him than thoſe which are worſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to do Miſchief with; but in the Hand of an Artiſt, the Work is excellently done. <note n="c" place="bottom">2 Pet. 3. 16.</note> Even ſo the Capacity for the right uſe of the Scripture, is the Qualification of the Spirit, without which the Scripture is not of that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, though otherways very excellent in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Now as ſome part of the Scripture is Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically to be underſtood, as well as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Literally, and ſome both, as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries confeſs, ſo to turn that to an Allegory, which is to be underſtood Literally, is equally Fooliſh with taking that Literally, that is to be underſtood Allegorically: For the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hereof, can there be any better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod propoſed, than for Men to have recourſe to that Spirit from whence it did at firſt flow? And in that Gift of the Spirit, to wait with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience until the Matter is clearly opened to them, and not be haſty to conclude, either
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46683:29"/>
with or againſt the Reſolves of Councils and Synods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but being truly exerciſed in the Gift of the Spirit, in Waiting, and Attention on it, as well as Prayer and Supplication, it's moſt certain the Matter will be cleared up, and the Doubts reſolved, as it ſhall conduce to their Spiritual Advantage.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, it's not ſo much about <hi>plain</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Authority we differ, but about the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of thoſe Councils, Synods, and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of Divines (ſo called) that have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to Expound Scriptures, and Decree Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith. For all our Confeſſions of Faith, and Acknowledgment to the Truth of Chriſtianity, in <hi>plain Scripture Terms,</hi> is little with them, but Cant, unleſs it be in the Terms of the ſeveral Councils, or <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet they are the People that cry up the Scripture for their Rule, though they make it a meer Noſe of Wax to turn to every thing, that either Humour or Intereſt trumps up: Thus one Council hath Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted what the other hath Determined.</p>
            <p>And another thing, in which 'tis common for theſe People to Abuſe and Belie us in, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſaith, (page 80.) <hi>That he was the Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God, and when Dead, his Body turned to Duſt, and that afterwards the ſame Anointings were in others.</hi> But who or when any <hi>Quaker</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:46683:29"/>
ſaid ſo, he mentions not a word; and in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, I ſay, he would have as truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Presbyterians, as he hath done tho <hi>Quakers:</hi> If he ſaid of them that they held U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Grace, and that there was never any ſuch thing in the World as the Solemn League and Covenant, and no ſuch Man as the Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Murthered, or that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt cut off his own Head, or that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Hanged Men only for being <hi>Quakers,</hi> or that their Brethren in <hi>Scotland</hi> were for Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Liberty, notwithſtanding their Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Epiſcopal Clergy, and their Deſign to Excommunicate, the laſt Year, all Perſons that ſhould Buy or Sell with, or Entertain a <hi>Quaker,</hi> which had took effect, had not the Clemency of the King interpoſed to break their Miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Deſigns.

            <p>Now although I poſitively deny what <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus</hi> affirms, and put him upon the proof, which I am ſure he can never do; yet for the ſakes of others that may be deceived by this Lying Spirit, I ſhall freely expreſs our Faith herein, ſince that is the part which affords me

the greateſt Satisfaction in this Undertaking: But if I ſhould not do it in the Terms of the Schools, though in never ſo plain Scripture Terms, perhaps it will find but little Credit with our Adverſaries, notwithſtanding the great Talk and Boaſt they make about the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>But however, let them do as they pleaſe, I hope we ſhall not receed from the Teſtimony of Holy Scripture. As to the Hereſies of the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Sabelleans,</hi> which he endeavours to fix on the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſince ſo much has been ſaid already in Confutation thereof, ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume the Argument, and give it a freſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, would ſwell this beyond my Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but beſides, many others that has done it, I ſhall refer to one, that in this Author's Eſteem is both <hi>Honeſt</hi> and <hi>Ingenuous,</hi> whoſe word I hope then he will not queſtion, and that is <hi>G.

of that. In ſhort, beſides <hi>G.

            <p>Now though we chuſe rather to expreſs our Faith in plain Scripture Terms, than in the Terms of any Council whatever; yet where Matters of Faith are laid down in plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Terms by them, we never were ſo croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grained to refuſe an Aſſent, becauſe it was the

            <p>His <hi>Scoffs at Perfection, and Freedom from Sin,</hi> I ſhall next take notice of, and anſwer as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46683:33"/>
follows: That by Perfection, the <hi>Quakers</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended to any other than a being freed from Sinning, and of a growth from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Grace to another, to the perfecting of Holineſs; <note n="a" place="bottom">Eph. 4. 13.</note> but a Perfection of the fulneſs of Knowledge, or of Glory, is what is not to be expected in this World, nor did we ever pretend to it; but if a being delivered from ſinning, is not attainable, the <hi>Quakers</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Fools to pretend to it, and our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are in the right to reflect on us for it; but if it be, who is Fool then? And that it is, is moſt clear from <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 48. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 40. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. or elſe we muſt Charge an Abſurdity on the Holy Ghoſt, for injoining what was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be attained to; and where will that Centre?</p>
            <p>And whereas he often reflects and abuſeth the <hi>Quakers</hi> for denying Prayer, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, Page 78. <hi>They muſt wait for the Spirit's Call to Prayer,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>then asks how they and the Spirit came to be ſuch Strangers, that it calls not to them all the Day, Week, Month, or Year long, to pray alone, or in their Families:</hi> This alſo is like the reſt, and what that is, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made appear; for 'tis a hard matter for him to ſpeak Truth in any one thing, unleſs it be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46683:34"/>
where he can ſtrike us in the Teeth with a <hi>Demas</hi> or <hi>Judas,</hi> an <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Hymeneus,</hi> or <hi>Philetu,</hi> or a <hi>Nicholas,</hi> &amp;c. which that we ſhould be without, is more than can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince the firſt Planters of Chriſtianity were not; yet that neither rendred the Chriſtians <hi>Impostors</hi> or <hi>Apoſtates,</hi> nor their Religion the Sink of Hereſie, though our Hammerers Elder Brethren thought <hi>it</hi> and <hi>them</hi> ſo, and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them accordingly, as their Rabbies did their Lord and Maſter.</p>
            <p>Now as to Prayer in Families, and alone, as well as in publick Meetings, this is the known practice of the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> but becauſe they have not <hi>ſet hours</hi> for it any more than ſome of his Brethren has <hi>ſet forms,</hi> he infers, though very unjuſtly, that <hi>the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>decline it.</hi> We do ſay, if Men pray, they ought to pray with the Spirit, and with an Underſtanding alſo, and therefore we ſay, all are to attend the Spirits time, in order to help them in the production of what it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and 'tis certain, that they who are intent hereon, ſhall not find themſelves at a loſs for want of the Spirit to enable them, when the Circumſtance of Time and Place calls for it; yet at all times Men are to have their Hearts ſet on God, and to meditate on his Law; but they are not <hi>always</hi> obliged to a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prayer, nor doth God expect it, though
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46683:34"/>
               <hi>ſometimes</hi> he do, that they may ſanctifie his Name by a Vocal Prayer, as well in a private Family as a publick Meeting, and this the <hi>Quakers</hi> own and practice, therefore he is a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famer, Perſecutor,</hi> and <hi>Impoſtor</hi> for inſinuating the contrary.</p>
            <p>In Page 51. Our Adverſary is very Abuſive, touching our belief of a Chriſt within (which he falſly puts) in oppoſition to a Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, ſaying, <hi>This Word outward is in great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt with them;</hi> but how this word Outward is ſo contemptible with them, he has not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned: That we are Contemners of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Scripture, is falſe from what is ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: That we are Contemners of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> he <hi>that was Crucified,</hi> is as falſe; for we are well aſſured, that by the Offering up of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the Croſs, he became a Propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of the whole World, and by vertue of his Blood comes Remiſſion of Sins; and yet this Remiſſion is no otherwiſe to be Experienced than by Mens Repentance, and Belief of the Truth, and a Faithful walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Holineſs of Life, with which, as an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Author</hi> ſaid, <hi>we may, but without which, we never ſhall be ſaved, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt Died for us: The Deſign of whoſe Death was not to make a good Life unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but to render it efficacious and available; not to procure a Priviledge of being Saved
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46683:35"/>
without it (as ſome fancy) but that we might be Saved with it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>After he has told his Reader, <hi>That Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper were Outward Ordinances with them,</hi> he queries, <hi>But why does not theſe Men contemn outward Meats, and Drinks, and Outward Cloathing too? If they did, the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie would ſoon be at an end:</hi> But for all his Scoffs he is miſtaken, though by ending the Controverſie, he means we ſhould be out of his way; I muſt confeſs, I believe, it would be a joyful Day to him, and ſuch as he. But pray let me Expoſtulate with theſe People a little; Are not you for an inward Vertue from Chriſt the Fountain, to Revive your Spirits, and Comfort your Souls under any Affliction, as well as to Encourage you to Perſeverance? Are not you for the Marrow of the Scripture, as well as the Words and Sentences therein contained? Are not you for ſitting down in an Heavenly Place in Chriſt? Are not you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of receiving the Subſtance of what Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Supper is, but the Sign of? If you ſay Yea, may not I, if I would act the part of this Hammerer, return it upon you, that you are (ſince you cry up the outward) all for the outward, but not at all for the inward? Which I can with as much Juſtice and Truth do, as he has Charg'd the <hi>Quakers</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning all the outward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:46683:35"/>
But what a poor Flurt was it to bring in <hi>outward Meats, and Drinks, and Cloaths too, and then the Controverſie,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>will ſoon be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> But that's not true, for we are againſt outward Meats, and Drinks, and Cloathing too, and yet the Controverſie is not ended; and if he had not been blinded with Folly, as well as Envy, he might have eſcaped ſuch a Blunder: For where Meats and Drinks are offered, either Superſtitiouſly or Profanely, the <hi>Quakers</hi> are againſt it, and refuſe it: But what a compariſon he has made! Here is Chriſt without, the Scriptures without, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without, Baptiſm without, the Lord's Supper without, with outward Meats, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Drings, and outward Cloating; and what weight there is in <hi>that,</hi> pray read <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. and then let him tell me, according to his own Compariſon, what real ground there is for him, or any elſe, to blame the <hi>Quakers</hi> for diſuſing the Two Great Ordinances, as they call them, ſince according to his Compariſon, they are <hi>but a ſhadow;</hi> and if People have ſeen, and enjoy the Subſtance, and will follow it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Shadow, are they to be blamed for it, or called Hereticks? But till the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is known, thoſe Shadows may have their Service, and we are not for preſſing any to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it, till their own Convictions do: For I agree with the Apoſtles, who ſaid, <hi>Let every</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:46683:36"/>
               <hi>Man be fully perſwaded in his own Mind:</hi> There has been many Books writ upon this Subject of Baptiſm, I ſhall therefore ſay the leſs; the greateſt Argument I have ever heard brought for the Continuation of Water-Baptiſm, was from <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 48. which ſtands thus, <hi>Can any Man forbid Water that thoſe ſhould not be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we;</hi> from which they argue, that if Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was not a ſtanding Ordinance ſince theſe had received the Holy Ghoſt, why was it here practiced? I Anſwer, firſt of all, there was no mention of Water in the Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. yet to teach Baptizing was; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſince <hi>John's</hi> Baptiſm was diſtinguiſht from Chriſt's by Water, as that was from <hi>John</hi>'s by the Holy Ghoſt, nothing can be more plain, than that Chriſt intended his, and not <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>And if the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was not behind (as he ſaith he was not) any of the Apoſtles, yet 'tis evident he did not underſtand <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. in the ſence our Adverſaries do; for if Baptizing with Water was a part of the Commiſſion there mentioned, he never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his Commiſſion, if he had, he would not have <hi>thanked God that he Baptized ſo few as he did,</hi> and poſitively declared, that he <hi>was not ſent to Baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel;</hi> but that he did ſome, and <hi>Peter</hi> more, is true;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46683:36"/>
but this neither proves it a ſtanding Ordinance, nor yet that it was by Command from God to be a ſtanding Ordinance; but as in the Caſe of Circumciſion, Anointing the Sick, and divers other things practiced by the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was greatly Ceremonious, as the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> was Idolatrous; the Diſciples of Jeſus condeſcended, as in the caſe of Circumciſion,, that by becoming all to all, they might gain ſome; for to take them off all at once, was not likely to be received by them, ſince by a long Cuſtom they had uſed themſelves to ſuch outward things.</p>
            <p>But beſides, <hi>John</hi> himſelf had before decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he muſt <hi>decreaſe,</hi> and that Chriſt muſt <hi>increaſe,</hi> which plainly implied the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his Miniſtry and Baptiſm, not all at once, but gradually, as it did the increaſe of Chriſt's Miniſtry and Baptiſm; for as the <hi>one decreaſed,</hi> the <hi>other increaſed,</hi> as the Sun's light <hi>ſwallows</hi> up the Moon's; for as the Moon has its time of ſervice, in which Mankind is much benefited by its Light, although it be a borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one from the Sun. even ſo was <hi>John</hi>'s Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of great Benefit when he preach'd Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the People, and Baptized them in <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> as they confeſs'd their Sins, being the Preparer of the Way of Chriſt; for though he was a burning and ſhining Light in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, yet he was <hi>but</hi> a Witneſs to bear witneſs
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46683:37"/>
of the Light, that all Men through him might believe, who <hi>was the true Light which lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> John 1. 7, 8, 9. This is the Son of Righteouſneſs, this is the Lamb of God, this is the Baptizer with Holy Ghoſt and Fire, who when he comes (the Leſſer, the Witneſs, the Forerunner) the Baptizer with Water muſt give place too. As when the Sun appears in our Horizon, the Moon's light is ſo overcome, that we have no Advantage by it, by reaſon of the more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Light of the Sun; ſo that it's very evident, <hi>John</hi> and Chriſt's Miniſtry and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms were as much two diſtinct Miniſtrations, as <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> were two diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or the Sun and Moon are two great, yet diſtinct Lights; for the Moon is not the ſame Light that the Sun is, though ſhe has her Light from the Sun; nor is <hi>John the Baptist</hi>'s Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration the ſame with Chriſt's, though he came from God, and had obtained ſuch Credit amongſt the People for his time, that it was ſaid, <hi>All Men muſed in their Hearts of</hi> John, <hi>whether he were the Chriſt or no,</hi> Mat. 3. 15.</p>
            <p>Nay, they were by <hi>John</hi> himſelf declared to be two diſtinct Baptiſms, as the Text de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares he ſhall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mine with Water, his with the Holy Ghoſt: See the
<pb facs="tcp:46683:37"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:46683:38"/>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:46683:38"/>
Text, <hi>(Mat.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 8. <hi>John</hi> 1. 15, to 34. and make the Application.</p>
            <p>But how prepoſterous is it to think, that Chriſt ſhould ſend his Diſciples in <hi>John</hi>'s Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand or Service, who was but the Forerunner; for ſo to do, was to ſet his Diſciples to run counter; and therefore, though the Diſciples for the ſake of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and new Converted <hi>Gentiles</hi> did do it, it's plain they did it upon the foot of Diſcretion, and not by Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and when theſe Men of the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as well as the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> had received the Holy Ghoſt by the Apoſtles Miniſtry, ſince Baptizing with Water was practiced amongſt them from <hi>John</hi>'s Example, the Apoſtle did ſay, <hi>Who can forbid Water, &amp;c.</hi> but that this proves the Baptiſm of the Holy Ghoſt, and Baptiſm of Water to be but <hi>one</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> as I do alſo that this Practice proves it to be of Divine Inſtitution, notwithſtanding it was not then forbidden, but they went into the Water, and were Baptized.</p>
            <p>Again, there is a vaſt difference between <hi>receiving</hi> the Gift of the Spirit by the Miniſtry of the Diſciples, and a being <hi>Baptized</hi> by the ſame Spirit; for by the Gift received, they came unto a Convinc'd Eſtate, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement was wrought by the Holy Ghoſt, through the Apoſtles Miniſtry, and was to them the Glad-tydings of Salvation, if from
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46683:39"/>
that ſtate of Convincement they preſt on to a thorough Converſion: So that the receiving of the Holy Ghoſt mentioned in that Text, may be very aptly compared to the Leaven in the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 33. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 20, 21. which as it is ſubjected to, leavens the whole Lump, and Plunges or Baptizeth the Soul, with all its Faculties, into its own Nature; and this is the Baptiſm we own, it being that of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>But to winde up the whole matter, if <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. was a Commiſſion to the Diſciples to Baptize with Water, then they were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to perform it in the <hi>Terms</hi> of that Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>But they never performed it in the Terms of that Communion;</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the <hi>Terms</hi> of that Commiſſion, was to Baptize in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</p>
            <p>But the Diſciples Baptized none with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt;</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo I end this part, and ſhall only <hi>add,</hi> with reſpect to breaking Bread and drinking Wine in a Sacramental way, (as they call it) that we have <hi>diſuſed</hi> it, becauſe we do certainly know, that <hi>to</hi> us the Subſtance is come, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46683:39"/>
Bread and Wine of the Kingdom, to our great Joy and Refreſhment, which are the Principal <hi>Memento</hi>'s to us of the breaking of Chriſt's Body, and ſhedding his moſt Precious Blood for us: And as often as we are made Partakers hereof, we ſhew forth his Death, and bear in our Bodies the Marks of the Dying of the Lord Jeſus; which Marks are a Death to Sin, and a New Life to Holineſs, (for <hi>he was Crucified for our Sins, and Roſe again for our Juſtification)</hi> as well as a perfect Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Will of God: For though our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries have <hi>ſet</hi> times for the Receiving of what they call the Lord's Supper; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt ſuch <hi>ſet</hi> times are to them the moſt Religious and Sacred part of their Devotion, and we have <hi>not</hi> yet let it be known. to them, that there are certain Times and Seaſons that are more than in the <hi>common</hi> or ordinary way Sacred to us, but theſe Times and Seaſons are in the Father's Hands, and not ours, and for them we wait in all our Religious Meetings; and though we do not always Enjoy what we wait for, yet we meet with ſo much Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, as to continue our Waiting and Attention, until He we wait for, who is the Bread of Life indeed, is pleaſed to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known to us, by a Spiritual breaking of Bread, and therefore <hi>what</hi> need is there for <hi>ſuch</hi> to uſe the Outward and Viſible Sign,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46683:40"/>
when the Inward and Spiritual Subſtance is come? But for all thoſe that are not come to this Subſtance, but are Religiouſly and Devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Travelling after it, and hope to get it with the Viſible Sign; we are not for being Cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious upon them, knowing that the Light of a Candle, Moon or Stars, are ſerviceable, till the Suns light break forth and overcome it all.</p>
            <p>I have but one Point more to ſpeak to, and then I ſhall end, and that is about the <hi>Light within,</hi> which our Adverſary ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 78. <hi>we commonly underſtand by it Conſcience;</hi> now that this Man ſhould ſo affirm, when in page 79. he pretends to have read <hi>R. B.</hi> upon it, ſhews his wilful Blindneſs, Ignorance and Envy, for he that has read <hi>R. B</hi>'s Apology, and ſhall yet ſay, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> underſtand by the Light, <hi>Conſcience,</hi> muſt be Mad, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious or Fooliſh, but if <hi>he</hi> were not all three, think you he would in page 78. ſay, <hi>They underſtand by the Light, Conſcience,</hi> and in page 79. ſay, <hi>Some Friends makes it God, but</hi> R. B. <hi>a Subſtance, and calls it</hi> Vehiculum Dei; this is the Man that will not Belie or Abuſe the <hi>Quakers,</hi> if he do, let him be accounted the greateſt Defamer upon Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But that they, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> do not underſtand it to be <hi>Conſcience,</hi> he himſelf has proved, quoting <hi>Ro. Barclay,</hi> calling it <hi>Vehiculum Dei,</hi> whoſe Book
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46683:40"/>
is approved by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and contains their Faith and Doctrine in the Points Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and thither I refer the Ingenious Reader for a more <hi>full</hi> and ample ſatisfaction, but ſince that Book is large, and this being part of our preſent Controverſie in purſuing this Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merer, I ſhall freely declare, firſt Negatively, That by the Light we never underſtood it to be <hi>Conſcience,</hi> ſince <hi>Conſcience</hi> is liable to be corrupted and hardened, as ſaid the Apoſtle; but this Principle of Divine Light is not obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to any alteration or change from its own pure and holy Nature, to any degree of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption whatſoever; nor is it natural Reaſon, for there is an apparent depravity come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. But ſecondly, I declare Poſitively, That by the Light, we underſtand a glorious Beam or Ray proceeding from Chriſt the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Light, diſplaying it ſelf into our Souls for the enlightning of our Underſtandings, and to put us in a Capacity to diſtinguiſh between Object and Object; for as a Blind Man cannot diſcern the difference in Colours for want of his ſight, ſo all Men in their natural Eſtate, are in as great a degree of Spiritual Blindneſs, until by this Light they are in a degree enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; hence it is that all are called Children of Wrath, and that there is none that doth good, no not one; nor can it be otherwiſe, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Cuſtom and Tradition may influence
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46683:41"/>
Men to do what they think they ought to do, and deter them from what they have been taught to avoid, yet till by a degree more or leſs of this Light, they are enlightned, it's a Blind Zeal and Will-worſhip, which is not at all acceptable to God, but is Iniquity, as is the Plowing of the Wicked, though otherwiſe in it ſelf an inoffenſive Exerciſe; ſo that the <hi>ſight</hi> and knowledge of what makes for Man's Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs, <hi>depends</hi> upon this Divine Light, for without it we have no ſight, and conſequently no Spiritual Knowledge, ſince Man's Natural Reaſon is ſo depraved, that he can no more ſearch into, and behold the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things that relates to the Kingdom of God, and his Immortal State, they being too Sublime for him, than 'tis poſſible for a Man to look into, and ſearch out the Matter and Nature of the Sun with his Bodily Eyes, which if he attempts, is ſoon Convinced of his Folly, by being blinded by the inacceſſible tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory and Light thereof; ſo that as the Apoſtle ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>For what Man knoweth the things of a Man, ſave the Spirit of a Man that is in him? even ſo the things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> And in Verſe 14. <hi>But the natural Man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> I ſay then, ſince
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46683:41"/>
Man in his Natural Eſtate is not able to know the things of God, it is moſt certain, that he muſt, if ever he know them, come to it by the help, not of a Natural but Divine Light, and ſuch a Divine Light, God, who is in Chriſt, Reconciling the World to himſelf; the Father of Lights has ſent his Son, the Light of the World, to bleſs the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that by believing in him, Men may come out of Darkneſs, and be turned, every one of them, from the Evil of their Ways. It's true, he was a glorious Light in his Life, Miniſtry, Miracles, Sufferings, Death and Reſurrection, and as ſuch there is no Diſpute, but we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to believe in him, and then we ſhall not abide in that Darkneſs and Unbelief the <hi>Jews, &amp;c.</hi> are now in; but that it ſhould be reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to that, we deny, ſince himſelf promiſed to come again, and to be in his, and with his, to the end of the World, to lead them into all Truth, to Comfort as well as Convince them, and in fine, to dwell with them, and in them, according to <hi>Jo.</hi> 14. 16, 17, 18, 21, 23. and 15. 26. and 16. 7. with many more in the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> ſo that notwithſtanding a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Chriſt's Coming in the Fleſh, and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and therein becoming a moſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Sacrifice for Remiſſion of the Sins of the whole World; Men may live and die in an unreconcileable State, and fall ſhort of that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46683:42"/>
Salvation Jeſus Chriſt has by his Blood purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for them; for a <hi>bare</hi> Belief and Conſent to the Truth hereof, doth not Entitle any Man to the Salvation therein offered, unleſs he lives conform to the Will of God, <hi>viz.</hi> Repent of his former Life and Vanity; Believes, <hi>viz.</hi> has Faith in God and Chriſt; and that holy Spirit ſent forth to purif<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e his Heart, and ſubmits to the Work of it, and leads a Life of Godlineſs and Honeſty for time to come; theſe are terms upon which Chriſt the Saviour is offered to every Man, and they that perform theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, have the Benefit of the Sacrifice of Chriſt, and for his ſake God will look on them as if they had never ſinned at all: Now ſince to come to this Qualification, where the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt is <hi>truly</hi> to be <hi>imputed,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a real and effectual Change from <hi>Nature</hi> to <hi>Grace,</hi> from <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi> how is it poſſible that this Change can be effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſteady adhering to this Divine Light, which as it is obeyed in all its Manifeſtations, leads out of all Darkneſs and Death, into the Marvelous Light of Life; nor doth this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Light that manifeſt whatſoever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 13. to that end it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed, contradict the Light in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for the Commands of the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture, are made by this Light much more Effectual and Obligatory upon us; for we do
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46683:42"/>
not place the Authority of Scripture only, from its being eſteemed Canonical, but alſo from the Teſtimony of the Divine Light in our own Hearts, which would have obliged the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers therein, to have believed the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Sacred, and of Divine Authority, if no ſuch Canons had paſt to put a Sanction on them: How Unjuſt, Uncharitable and Wicked then are our Adverſaries, that ſtick not to ſay, We debaſe the Scripture to ſet up our own Light.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, by the Light within we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not Conſcience, nor Natural Reaſon, but that Light which from the Son of Righteouſneſs Jeſus Chriſt; the Light of the World, ſhines into the Hearts of the Sons of Men, to give them the Knowledge of the Glory of God, or that Spirit of Truth, that was promiſed ſhould Convince the World of Sin, and lead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Truth, or that Word nigh in the Heart and Mouth, to be heard and obeyed, or that ſtill ſmall Voice, that ſaith, This is the Way, walk in it, when turning to the Right Hand, or to the Left, or that Grace that brings Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and in order to it, it teaches to deny Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſt, and to live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly in this preſent World; or laſtly, We mean by it, that Great Myſtery reſerved for the <hi>Gentiles, which is Chriſt</hi> within, <hi>the Hope of Glory, Col.</hi> 1, 26, 27. yet not in oppoſition to his being glorified in the Heavens, as he is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:46683:43"/>
the Man Chriſt, or Heavenly Man, or Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, Interceſſor and Mediator with God for us; this is what we underſtand by that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the Light within. And whoever thinks to get Heaven or Happineſs another way, I wiſh them Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life, being aſſured, that there is not another Name or Power whereby Men can be ſaved, beſides the Name of Jeſus, who is the true Light, that enlightens every Man that comes into the World. And though many there be that do not own him, as he is believed in, and confeſſed to by us, yet nevertheleſs are by him in ſome degree enlightned, in whom, if they believe and live up to what they know to be their Duty to God, and their Neighbour, the Lord will, without doubt, accept of their Sincerity, though they are labouring under the Prejudice of Tradition and Education.</p>
            <p>And now, Reader, if I have not defended the <hi>Quakers</hi> from this Hammerers Charge, and proved him the Impoſtor, I muſt confeſs I have neither underſtood him, nor my ſelf neither, as well as I have done my endeavour to remove thoſe Prejudices, many People have entertained againſt us, which they have received one from another, not knowing us as we are; nor will they give themſelves the opportunity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from our ſelves, but without hearing or examining, if Mr. ſuch a one, or ſuch a one,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46683:43"/>
the Miniſter, ſay ſo, or ſo, we are at once Condemned for Hereticks, and then upon pain of Excommunication, or ſomething elſe, the People muſt not ſo much as Diſcourſe with us; For is there among any ſort of profeſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (ſave the Prieſts, Friars, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> a greater degree of Dominion and Rule over the Souls and Conſciences, as well as Purſes of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than is now reigning among our Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians? And yet who but they for exclaiming againſt the Hierarchy of the Biſhops.</p>
            <p>But to avoid Reflections as much as may be, I ſhall conclude with true deſires for his, and all the reſt of our Cauſleſs Enemies, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to Amendment of Life, that the Mercy and Favour of God, to the Remiſſion of their Sins, they may all Witneſs, through Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And for this Adverſary, I ſhall deſire him, if he thinks fit to write any Reply to this, that he will do it under the Umbrage of ſome intelligent Perſon or other, (if he can get any) that we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to for Satisfaction for his Abuſes; or elſe let him conclude, that if he be not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to again, its not becauſe his Arguments are thought unanſwerable, or that we decline it from any Conſciouſneſs of the Weakneſs of our Cauſe; but becauſe its not worth while to detect him, ſince the Rhetorick of <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and his <hi>Welſh Letter,</hi> with a deal more, as from

the Multitude againſt Thouſands of Innocent People, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that know no more of it than the Child unborn; yet 73. was the time this <hi>Narrative</hi> Commenced; all which, with what is yet behind, ſhews the Malice, Envy and Rage of our Adverſaries, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think us fit to have a Being in the Land of the Living. What ſhould be the Reaſon of their Intolerable Rage at this time of Day, when we have for ſo many Years given ſuch undeniable proofs of our Peaceable and Inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Converſation, I cannot think, unleſs this, <hi>viz.</hi> ſince it hath pleaſed the Lord to favour us with Eaſe and Relief, from thoſe Long and Cruel Perſecutions and Sufferings, that did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend us for our Conſciencious Diſſent, by the Particular and Extraordinary Indulgence the Government has extended to us; for all which, as we are highly ſenſible of the great Love and Favour of God to us therein, ſo are we truly and humbly Thankful to the Government for the ſame, and Hope, Believe and Pray, that in all things we may walk worthy of it, and by no means abuſe ſo great Mercy: But this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Controverſie, has extreamly enraged our Adverſaries, who, like <hi>Cain,</hi> are Angry at our Acceptance: But my deſire is, that none of theſe things may move any of us, no, not ſo much as to the <hi>Deſire</hi> of Revenge; yet <hi>Juſtice</hi> to our ſelves as <hi>Christians,</hi> as well as Men, will

not admit of Silence; I ſhall therefore examine this preſent Adverſary. Whether the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> be true or falſe, I will not determine, without doubt it may be partly both; for I have heard of ſuch a Story, that Two Women did pretend they had a Dream or Viſion, that this <hi>H. W.</hi> had Committed ſuch an Act; but what of all this? Did he ever hear that the <hi>Quakers</hi> Embarqued their Cauſe upon ſuch a bottom? Or that they owned or eſpouſed the Imaginations of theſe Women? Yes, ſaith he, page 23. <hi>Many Friends was Concerned in it, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified and Vindicated it at</hi> Carlile <hi>Aſſizes.</hi> Oh heighth of Impudence and Falſhood! What did they Teſtifie and Vindicate? Was it that theſe Women were in the right, and that the Spirit <hi>they, viz.</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> profeſt, (which was the Holy-Spirit) was the very Spirit that Acted theſe Women in their Impeaching <hi>H.

But to do him Juſtice, he has, though Ignorantly, cleared, by his own Acknowledgment, all the <hi>Quakers</hi> in the World, and that is in page 24. where he ſaith, <hi>I freely declare, if any of you ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely value Scripture Light and Rule, and do not adhere to the Guidance of this Mad Spirit; this Story,</hi> (meaning the <hi>Narrative) intends no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Now I ſay then, that all the <hi>Quakers</hi> in the World, that are own'd as ſuch, and Members of that Community, are ſincere Valuers of Scripture Light and Rule, and as much deteſt adhering to the Guidance of this Mad Spirit, as the Author, or any People in the World, and therefore we are, by his own Confeſſion, Cleared; ſo that the Man has only a <hi>Chimera</hi> in Charging it againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and is Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with he knows not what; but I have juſt Cauſe to queſtion his Sincerity in this free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, ſince he is ſo liberal to beſtow more ſuch Stories upon the <hi>Quakers;</hi> but before I come to Examine them, I take notice of his ſaying, <hi>The Devil it ſeems owed them a ſpight, by managing thoſe Perſons to the ſhame of the Sect:</hi> That the Devil is ſpightful towards us, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is very true, though they ſay he is kind to his own Children, the which, I am apt to think, this Adverſary may be qualified to give us an account of in his next; but of his ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to us, we have had large Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not only by ſeducing ſome that have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be of us, to follow the Imaginations of their own Whimſical Brains, or Melancholy Fancies, under the Apprehenſions of the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit of God, but alſo by filling ſuch as this Adverſary with Malice and Envy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, to Reproach the Holy Spirit of God, through the Deluſions of ſome few Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:46683:46"/>
I ſhall now take notice of ſome more of his Stories, and that is in page 26. of one <hi>Peregrine Dalſton</hi> endeavouring to ſwallow his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheet, and Choaking himſelf; <hi>and of another at</hi> Durham, <hi>that pretended he came to</hi> Hobſon<hi>'s Houſe by Revelation, &amp;c.</hi> And page 27. of a <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that Renounced her Husband, and call'd him Dog, Devil,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that ſhe pretended to be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a Second Saviour.</hi> How unjuſt is this Libeller to upbraid Senſible Men with Actions of Mad People? But whether ever there were any ſuch Perſons in the World, as theſe he here mentions, is a queſtion; and 'tis another, if ever any ſuch thing was either done or ſaid? And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, Whether theſe People (if the two firſt be granted) were reputed <hi>Quakers?</hi> For his ſaying ſo, will go but a little way with the Impartial, ſince Lying and Abuſing is his Practice, as I ſhall ſhew in its place; but ſuppoſing all this to be true, when or where did he ever hear the <hi>Quakers</hi> give any Credit, or ſhew Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to ſuch things? He <hi>cannot</hi> be Ignorant of the <hi>Quakers</hi> equally diſliking any ſuch practices with any Profeſſors of Chriſtianity whatever: He may well ſay, page 29. <hi>Friends Memories are not always perfect,</hi> for they never will, nor his neither, be ſo perfect as to remember what never was done. But all theſe confirms what he ſaid before, That <hi>the Devil ow'd us a ſpight,</hi> and to ſhew it, has made uſe of this Libeller,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46683:47"/>
with many others who hath joined iſſue with the Devil in Spightfulneſs, to Reproach, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and Abuſe an Innocent People, becauſe ſome that has profeſt the ſame Way, has been Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, Melancholy, Imaginary, or Mad. But his Profane, Atheiſtical, Blaſphemous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentson theſe Stories, I ſhall not now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to Reply to, for indeed I do not think it worth while, ſince it looks ſo much like <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedantium Malleus,</hi> rather than the production of a Compoſed Brain.</p>
            <p>He tells Two Stories of <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Briſtol, The firſt going Naked with a Rope about him into the Church, but when turn'd out, another went ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord, Let the Man have his Rope again.</hi> If this be not a Lie of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, yet it is of his venting, for the <hi>Quakers</hi> of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who are moſt like of any to know, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, that is, that no <hi>Quaker</hi> did ſo.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Quakers</hi> in the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> yet A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, do remember, (but ſurely the Infernal Powers are at work in this Scribling Age, to fill this part of the World with Lies, as it did another lately with Witches) that about For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years ago, there was one <hi>John Jones, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> (as the <hi>Beetle</hi> called <hi>ſuch as he) Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, viz.</hi> one that like <hi>G. K. F. B. T. C.</hi> and <hi>J. P.</hi> had left the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſet up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which ſaid <hi>Jones</hi> went Naked, (ſave only a Rope about him) and if <hi>this</hi> be not the Story,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46683:47"/>
there is nothing of Truth in it; but if this <hi>is the Story,</hi> then Judge Reader, what an ungodly Man is he to lay that to the Charge of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> which they as much <hi>diſowned</hi> as himſelf. That another ſhould ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Let the Man have his Rope again,</hi> is a further Proof of the baſeneſs of this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; for tho' there were ſuch Expreſſions uſed by a Boy or Portar, yet it was <hi>only to Ridicule</hi> the Immaginary Naked Man; and both of them no more <hi>Quakers</hi> than <hi>S. Y.</hi> or this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller.</p>
            <p>But who that Great <hi>Propheteſs</hi> is in <hi>Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet-ſhire,</hi> that ſhould ſay, <hi>I'll tell thee from the Lord,</hi> Monmouth <hi>is as ſurely alive, as any of us,</hi> I know not, but certain it is, if the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> did pretend to ſuch <hi>Revelations,</hi> as theſe he have told of, and <hi>this,</hi> ſuch a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs, as he would Inſinuate, we muſt needs know her, tho' he takes care we ſhall not from him, but as an Effect of his lying Spirit, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it on him.</p>
            <p>But he comes now to a particular Caſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That in the Year 1694. at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> (for his Story of 86. I take it to be the Fruit of his Scoffing, Lying Spirit, rather than any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Truth) he ſaith, a Prophet pronounced, that in a few Months <hi>that City ſhould become a Pool of Water, except it did Repent. This was declared amongst a Croud of you, Publiſht in the Streets,</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:46683:48"/>
               <hi>owned before the Mayor, whoſe Courteſie to the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wretch others of you Congratulated, Careſſed the Man, Honoured his Propheſie above the Bible, Copied and hung it up in your Houſes,</hi> &amp;c. Now this falling within the Compaſs of my certain Knowledge, made me the more willing to ſpend an Hour or two in peruſing (and for his Abuſes) reflecting on this Libeller, for this I know to be a Lie in Fact, as it is laid down by him: Let our Memories be as bad as they will, he will find them too good to let his Lies paſs undetected; but ſuch as <hi>he,</hi> had need of better than he ſeems to have; but ſomething he has got by the end as he thinks will Reproach the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and out it goes without Fear or Wit, Two Stories jumbled together with great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and downright Falſhoods; and were it not for that, I ſhould gratifie him too much, I would relate the Truth of that Matter, that he hath ſo confuſed himſelf about, that in Eight Lines has told <hi>ſo</hi> many Lies, but perhaps ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may ſee his <hi>Reply</hi> to this, (for if he have any Regard to his Credit, he is obliged to it, ſince I poſitively Charge him for a Malicious Publiſher of Notorious Falſhoods) and then it will be time enough; in mean time I obſerve his Directions, (like ſuch another Doctor as <hi>S. Y.)</hi> a true Repreſentation of the Author, <hi>viz.</hi> a Rambling Confuſed Adverſary; ſee it, page 46. <hi>Grieve not the Holy Spirit of</hi>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:46683:48"/>
               <hi>Truth. Ah! where wilt thou run when he ceaſes to lead thee?</hi> This in a <hi>Quaker</hi> had been rank He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refie enough, to have had him write a Book to lay open the Danger of it, but in him Orthodox. In the next Paragraph, and firſt Sentence of it, he ſaith, <hi>Dread the Methods whereby others are inveigled,</hi> viz. <hi>a Pretence to all inward Spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Religion.</hi> You may ſee what a Religion he is for, <hi>nothing</hi> of Spirit, but <hi>all</hi> Fleſh. But to fix the aforeſaid Character upon him, read his next words, <hi>A Form of Godlineſs, without Life and Spirit, God abhors,</hi> ſaith he; 'twas well in one reſpect, he did not ſet his Name to his Book, for if he ſhould be known to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of any Society at all, we might, if we would, act like him, Accuſe them for Madneſs or Folly, ſince this Member has ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo in this Caſe; for till he can reconcile the aforeſaid Directions, <hi>viz. Dread Inward Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality in Religion, (viz.</hi> Beware of it; don't pretend by any means to ſuch a thing) yet <hi>don't grieve the Spirit of God, for a Form, without the Spirit, God abhors;</hi> I ſay, until he can reconcile theſe two oppoſite Directions, I ſhall not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear thinking him a Mad-man, or worſe; but this is no more a wonder to me, than his Envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Quakers,</hi> both for the ſake of their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as for their Temporal Enjoyments, ſince believing the <hi>Saving Grace of God in all Men, is with him an Intoxicating Notion,</hi> one
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46683:49"/>
would think he was no better acquainted with the Holy Scriptures, than he ſeems to be with the Principles of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> for had he not been intoxicated himſelf, and a Stranger to both, how could he have belied the one, or contradicted the other, as he hath done? And until he is better informed of both, I intend to leave him, or at leaſt for the preſent; ſince he is ſo foul and abuſive from End to End, that hardly one Paragraph is to be found free from Lying, Detraction and Perverſion.</p>
            <p>It ſhall ſuffice me, that all Men in their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and that are of a good underſtanding, will agree with me in this; that this Adverſary has moſt notoriouſly abuſed the <hi>Quakers,</hi> by Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuling them to the Mad and Fooliſh Freaks that ſome ſilly People has run into. For who would think it juſt, to charge the Church of <hi>England</hi> for Libertiniſm, becauſe ſome Men, Profeſſors of that Communion, has been Convicted for Theft and Murther, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Or that the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> Doctrine is Damnable, becauſe ſome of their Members have Hanged or Stabb'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Or that the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> Religion is Lunacy, becauſe ſome of their Members has Drowned themſelves? A very unjuſt and uncharitable Concluſion. So let the ſober Reader judge, whether ſuppoſing (but not granting) many ſuch like Idle and Fooliſh Stories to be true, concerning here and there one, amongſt many
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46683:49"/>
Thouſands of a regular People, is our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Communion and Society anſwerable for it? And our Principles Deſtructive, and we Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks becauſe of it? The Anſwer, I hope; is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, we know there has been much In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry us'd, and what Wit and Malice, as well as Madneſs could rake up, has been thrown at us, to Reproach our Chriſtian Profeſſion, and render its Profeſſors obnoxious to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that our Liberties might be, by a Legal Power, ſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
