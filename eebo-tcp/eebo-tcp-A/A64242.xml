            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Prov. XXI. 30, 31.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor
counsel against the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The Horse is prepared against the day of Battel,
but safety is of the Lord.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN these words the Wise Man gives a brief, but true,
and compleat account, of the weakness and insufficiency
of all humane indeavours, when imployed against the
purposes of Divine Providence, or destitute of the Interest,
and Assistance of Heaven. He declares that the best laid
Projects, and Contrivances, the deepest reaches of the Wisest
Politicians, when directed against the Tendencies of the
Divine Will, are vain and insignificant; that they come to
nothing: <hi>There is no</hi> such thing as <hi>Wisdom, or Vnderstanding,
or Counsel against the Lord.</hi> And as the Wisdom of Man is
in this case no better than Folly, and Madness; so is his
Power the contemptible Effort of Impotence and Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.
<hi>The Horse is prepared against the day of Battel; but
safety is of the Lord.</hi> Those numerous Forces and hostile
Preparations, which Men conside in as their utmost security,
unless bless'd and reinforced with Power from on High, are
ineffectual to Victory, or Safety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is no King saved by the Multitude of an Host;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 33. 16, 17.</note>
               <hi>A mighty Man is not delivered by much Strength; An
Horse is a vain thing for safety; neither shall he deliver any by his
great Strength;</hi> says the Royal Psalmist, who had frequently
experienced Worldly strength, and confidence, to be an
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53462:3"/>
unequal match for the God of Hosts, the mighty God
of <hi>Israel.</hi> The sum and meaning therefore of the words
amounts to this; That there is a superintendant Providence,
which over-rules the Counsels and Powers of Men, as shall
be most suitable and serviceable to the Divine Counsels in the
Government of the World; which either succours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages,
or suspends and retards, or baffles and disappoints
natural causes, so as to determine the issues of War and Peace,
and of all humane Force and Policy, according to this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Agency and Direction. That the World is subject
to the Presidency, and conduct of such a Providence as this,
must be acknowledged by all, who profess to believe the
existence of a God. For the very notion of a Providence is
inseparably involved in the Idea of an infinitely Wise, Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and Beneficent Being; nothing seeming more absurd,
than that He who is All-wise should not know how, He
that is Almighty should not be able, and He that is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendantly
Good should not be willing to take care of his
own Creation. And therefore <hi>Epicurus</hi> was deservedly charged
with Hypocrisy and Collusion, and look'd upon by the rest
of the Philosophers as a disguised Atheist, who in words
profess'd a Deity, but in reality and effect, disown'd Him,
when he denyed he had any interest in the Government of
the World. A Man need but open his Eyes and contemplate
those common changes, and vicissitudes of things, which
daily happen round about him, to be fully convinc'd of this
truth, that the Lord is King, and that he rules unto the ends of
the Earth. That I may not therefore take up your Time and
Thoughts with an unnecessary proof of a Providence, which
all Religions in the World suppose, and which the Christian
has plainly implyed, or demonstrated in every page of the
Gospel: I rather chuse to lead your Minds at present to an
attentive Reflexion on the various methods of its dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which is no less useful, yet a more uncommon and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53462:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
difficult consideration. For though the directive hand of a
supernatural Providence be so very visible and palpable in its
effects, it seems quite otherwise in the manner of its
Operation. We often feel, and enjoy the Influence of the
Divine Government, whilest we are insensible by what kind
of Ministration it is conveyed to us. The Counsels of God
are for the most part Mysterious and Impenetrable:
<hi>He maketh Darkness his secret Place,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 11.</note> 
               <hi>his Pavilion round
about him:</hi> says holy David. <hi>He doth great things,
and unsearchable, marvellous things without number:</hi> saies
<hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 5. 9.</note> speaking of his providential administration.
'Tis indeed impossible to trace the footsteps of the Almighty,
in his whole management of humane affairs; but yet those
many Characters and Impresses of his Hand, which are
legible in the wonderful events of things, are sufficient to
justify such an humble enquiry into the manner of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure,
as may serve to remove all prophane objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Providence, and to encourage our Faith, Hope,
and Confidence in Him. Wherefore, my present business
shall be to consider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Some of those ways, and methods which God
makes use of to govern, or over-rule the Counsels and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of Men, so as to accomplish his own wise purposes
thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The reason and intention of his interposing
his Providence in the Government of Humane Affairs and
Actions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I shall apply these considerations to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Providence and Mercy of God which is the occasion of
this present solemnity: by which it will at last evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear;
that <hi>There is neither Wisdom, nor Vnderstanding, nor
Counsel against the Lord; that though the Horse be prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the day of Battel, yet safety is of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53462:4"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> Then to consider some of those Methods, which
God makes use of, to govern, or over-rule the Counsels, and
endeavours of Men, so as to accomplish his own wise pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
thereby.</p>
            <p>If God govern'd the World at present as he did heretofore
the Nation of the Jews, by a visible Authority, and vouchsafed
it such repeated Prophecies, and evident Miracles, and
manifestations of his Power, in his Mercies, and Judgments
to Mankind; the manner of his Providence might be easier ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for, in those great turns of affairs, he bring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> about
in the Kingdoms of the Earth. For that People were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
so miraculously Bless'd, or Afflicted, that they could no
more doubt of the <hi>Manner,</hi> than they could question the
<hi>truth</hi> of the Deliverance, or Punishment it self which they
actually enjoyed, or suffer'd. If an <hi>Israelite</hi> were ask'd,
how he escaped the Host of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and how he was sustained
in a barren Wilderness forty Years, it were ready for him to
answer to the Former, That God divided the red Sea, and
made the surrounding waves Bullworks of safety, against
the Enemy; and to the latter, That the same God opened
the Rock of Stone, and made the Waters flow, and rained Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
and Quails from Heaven, for his daily provision, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
For thus God found it necessary to deal with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous,
and sluggish people, who would ever have been
revolting back towards <hi>Aegypt,</hi> if he had not submitted his
Providence, and Care over them, to the Test of their very
Senses, and caused them constantly to tast and feel how
gracious he was to them. But he no longer transacts with
mankind by such obvious, and condescending instances of his
Power: Though he has an equal regard to his People at this
day, yet he deals with them in a way, more suitable to the
exercise of their Reason, and their Faith, and becoming his
own Wisdom: He raises and depresses Nations by such easie
steps, and cadencies, that it is extreamly difficult to discover
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53462:4"/>
any break or interruption in the whole series of second causes,
whereby to give birth to his designs in the Prodigious Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the World. The great Opera of his Providence is
carried on in so uninterrupted a Tenor, and all its Machines
are acted with that facility, and evenness, that nothing but
uniform Nature presents its self to the Vulgar Spectators eye;
whilest the more inquisitive Christian, and Philosopher carry
their researches up to that invisible hand, which directs the
innumerable resorts, and movements: and which teaches
them all to conspire in the finishing those wonderful events
propos'd by Divine Wisdom in the government of Mankind.
Now amongst the various ways, and methods which his
Counsel may imploy to his end, the more easily accounted
for are these following: <hi>First,</hi> He influences the Thoughts,
Desires, and Passions of man's Mind, in such a Manner as is
most proper to facilitate, and carry on the Work he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</p>
            <p>If we consider God as an Infinite and Almighty Spirit, in
whom we live, and move and exist, we cannot avoid concluding
that he is immediately present to every Soul which he has
created; and is as capable of ruling, and directing them, as
they are of actuating and moving those Bodies to which they
are united. They intirely depend upon him for their Being,
and capacities: So that 'tis inconceivable how they should be
invested with a Power of Willing, unless <hi>God gave them both to
Will, and do:</hi> Or whence they could derive their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
did not the <hi>Father of Lights enlighten every one that he
sent into the World.</hi> And if these two principal Powers of the
Mind, are so absolutely dependent on him; 'tis no wonder
that he frequently determines their particular operations;
That he inspires them with a new train of Thoughts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;
That here presents to them very moving Ideas; That
he Caresses their Desires, with grateful, and inviting Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
That he quickens their Hopes, or hightens their Fears,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53462:5"/>
or excites such other Passions, as have a Natural tendency
towards promoting his designs for the wellfare and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the World. Nor doth the Liberty he has indowed
them with, in the least exempt them from his Jurisdiction,
any more than the privileges of Subjects discharge them
from their subjection to the Authority of their Soveraign.
Indeed the consequences of such extraordinary suggestions
are not of alike importance in all, but vary according to
Mens Publick or private capacities, and Relations in the
World; For as a King is worth ten thousands of the people
(as the <hi>Israelites</hi> told <hi>David</hi>) so are the purposes of his Heart,
proportionably of greater moment, towards the well or ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
of Mankind. A King's word is accompanied with
power, and the affairs of Men are vastly the better or the
worse, according as this power is imploy'd. If like <hi>Titus</hi>'s,
it be exercised only for the Publick Good, and
<hi>that the day be reckoned lost to a Prince,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amici, di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

has not been beneficial to some or other: Both
himself and his Fortune, are the <hi>Joy and delight of
Humane Nature.</hi> But if like <hi>Nero</hi>'s the same Power please it
self in Ruine and Devastation, 'tis a publick Scourge and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
and one of the greatest Curses that God can send into
the World. And now considering how much Humane Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
or Misery, depend upon the Wisdom or Folly, the
Righteousness or Wickedness of Governours; how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
is it, <hi>that the Hearts of Kings should be in the
hand of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 21. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and that like the Rivers of Waters
he should turn them whither soever he will:</hi> How would
the World run to confusion, and become one great Den of
wild Beasts, or more ravenous Men, if great Oppressors
could effect their unweildy projects, and God <hi>did not carry the
counsels of the Froward headlong?</hi> And unless he likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
the madness of the multitude and struck them with an
Awe and Reverence of Majesty, though in a Person in many
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53462:5"/>
respects not unlike themselves. How could good Princes
establish their Government in Righteousness, and prove such
Universal Blessings as we find them? Indeed he frequently
serves himself of the insatiable ambition of unmerciful Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
no less than of the generous and beneficent designs of
the best, and kindest Governours, and that by way of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on a wicked Generation; when that end is obtain'd,
he degrades their aspiring thoughts, as he once did <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>'s,
from believing themselves the Gods, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
themselves the Beasts of the Earth.</p>
            <p>The Scripture presents us with variety of instances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the supreme Lord of the World has made the actings of
an Humane Mind, instrumental to the effecting the Work
of his Providence. How did <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s incredulity, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
to pursue the <hi>Israelites</hi> into the Red-Sea administer an
occasion to God to exalt his Power, in the destin'd destruction
of him and his whole Host? How did he raise the Siege of
<hi>Samaria,</hi> when reduced to the utmost extremity by Famine,
by causing suddain fears and fancies to put to flight the <hi>Syrian</hi>
Army? How did he preserve <hi>David</hi> and his handful of Men
from the destructive issues of <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s Counsel, by deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the People to prefer that of <hi>Hushai</hi> before it? For by
this choice it must be, that <hi>the Lord</hi> (as the text
tells us) <hi>had appointed to defeat the good Counsel of
Achitophel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 17. 14.</note> I will mention but one example more,
and that's of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who ascending his Throne with as great
Ambition and Glory, and as little affection to the Jewish
Nation as any of his Predecessors, could not resist the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
God made upon his Mind, to restore the Captive
People, and to rebuild the Temple: <hi>The Lord stirr'd up the
Spirit of</hi> Cyrus <hi>King of</hi> Persia, Saies the sacred Historian,
<hi>Ezra</hi> 1. 1. 'Twere needless to spend time in proving That
God influences the Mind of Man, in bringing to pass the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of his own Counsel, were not they apt to over-look the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53462:6"/>
Divine Efficacy, and to ascribe the success or disappointment
of the most important actions, to Time or Chance, to Fate
or Fortune, or any thing rather than to the Finger of God:
Whereas did they impartially observe how inconsiderable
Moments turned the Scale in the weightiest Concerns; how
some unexpected accident, surprize, or inadvertency fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
determin'd the Fate of a Battel, and gave rise to the
most Glorious and Heroical Actions, beyond the intrinsick
Vertue, and Efficacy of their causes: How the Peace and
Prosperity of a Nation, depended on the nice and critical
Conjuncture of some lucky hits of Counsel and Action;
they would quickly perceive that the train of consequences
was laid by a Divine Artist; and that it was God, who, by
some secret Energy, touch'd the Hearts of Men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
put all the Wheels of his Providence in Motion. And
here I cannot but Anticipate my Method, in mentioning that
Memorable act of Providence, manifested but the other day,
in the Person of our Royal Soveraign: For what less than a
Divine Impulse could have forc'd him upon that seeming im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable
Attempt, of rescuing the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of a Country
from immediate Ruine and Desolation, which obliged him
to break through the impending dangers of twice as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
an Enemy, the difficulties of a precipitate March, and
the discouragements of his Army? An attempt more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than the compleatest Victory, as was plain by the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
which was speedily followed with an Happy Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of a General Peace, and the Security of <hi>Europe.</hi> But
this Method of God's influencing the Minds of Men in his
Government of the World, will be more conspicuous when
illustrated with a second Consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That He imploys the General Efficacy and
Power of Natural Causes, and makes them subservient to
the ends and purposes of his Providence.</p>
            <p>The fixt and standing Laws of Nature, are nothing else
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53462:6"/>
but the General Will of an All-wise and Universal Being,
who holds the Reins of the Universe in his Hands, and turns
them which way he pleases. There is nothing in this World
except Man, that he hath made the Arbiter of its own actions.
All other things do not so properly act, as suffer his Agency
upon them. Bodies are continually moved by those impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
which he has given them. <hi>As he spake the word, and
they were made, he commanded and they were created,</hi> so the same
Power which created them, still governs, and determines
them. <hi>Fire and Hail, Snow and Vapour, Wind and Storm full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
his word.</hi> He makes the Winds his Ministers, and Flames
of Fire his Messengers. Life and Death, Health and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Riches and Poverty, Plenty and Famine, and the
whole Retinue of Nature, are all the Attendants of his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and the Instruments of his Power: And if so, what an
infinite scope is here, for the compassing his designs in the
free Government of a rational World, by the Ministry of
natural and necessary Causes? For what is there in the whole
Circle of humane actions, and sublunary Occurrences, but
falls under the influence of some of these? So that it seems
had it so pleas'd God, he might have brought about the
whole course of his greater Providential Dispensations, from
the beginning of the World to the end of it, without making
one irregular or unequal step, or departing out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
road of Nature. If the Sins of a degenerate Race of
Men, are ripen'd into an Harvest for Divine Vengeance,
there is no need that the Almighty should create Thunder
bolts to execute his wrath; He can quickly draw an Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
out of the Stores of Nature, sufficient to overthrow a
Lustful City, or a Lewd and Vicious World. For even that
Exemplary Judgment on Mankind, in an Universal Deluge,
which seems to abound with Miracle, and which <hi>Moses</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
by the rupture of the Abyss, and the descending Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts
of Heaven, is lookt upon by most thinking Persons, to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53462:7"/>
have been effected by a Providential use of second Causes, and
that it will very well bear a Natural Explication. And it is
not improbable, but that other destruction which the Earth
still waits by Fire, will be wrought by the concurrence of
Natural Principles, and Powers in subservience to the Will
of God, when he shall think sit to permit that raging Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to accomplish the great and fatal Revolution. Nor
doth this at all derogate from the Divine Wisdom, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
and vindicate it, in that it is not like a Mortal Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
at a pause, what extraordinary course to take in the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
of affairs, but still makes its Providence keep pace
with Nature, and leisurely produce those signal Changes and
Alterations which are subjects for Wonder and Admiration
to all Ages: But to place this Pourtraicture of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in a clearer light, let us only consider, that these
two Instruments of it, <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> are in the hand of
God; and observe how the interests of the World, in a great
measure, turn upon these two Hinges. For Example, how
does a Nation thrive, and prosper under the gentle Life, and
Government of a Wise, a Pious, and a Valiant Prince. He
is the Soul that animates the Body Politick, that gives it
Health and Vigour, and succors every Member with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
warmth, and activity: Under such a Reign how
thankfully will the People enjoy the Blessings of Peace, or
strenuously Prosecute a lawful War for their mutual Defence
and Vindication? Their Reputation will improve their
Commerce, and their Industry make Plenty flow in their
Streets. Their Church and Religion will erect its Head,
and by returning the joyful Offerings of Praise and Gratitude
for all the Mercies it receives, engage the Favour of Heaven
still on in its support and preservation. And now if it please
God to continue these Blessings to them, he need but lengthen
the days of such a Governour, as he did <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s, and then
the designs of Providence, will be answer'd by the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53462:7"/>
of Nature, without recurrence to Miracles, or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prodigies on the Stage. But oh! then the Death of this
great and good Man is as tragically lamented, as his Life
was admired, and doated on: and unless the same kind Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
has otherwise design'd it, strange changes, and decays
must likely happen both in Church, and State. Just the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
of this, both as to Mercy and Judgment, God intends
the World, in the Life and Death of a Wicked, a Foolish,
a Tyrannical, and degenerous Prince. For as he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the love of his own People, he consequently will not
be able to procure the fear of his Neighbours. Either he
will suffer himself, and his Subjects to dissolve in Sloth, and
Luxury; or he will dispirit them with Violence and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
or betray them by his Cowardice and Folly. A
People will droop, as if under the Reign and Guidance of
some Malignant Planet, having neither Courage to oppose
their Enemies, nor Spirit to Enrich and Advance themselves.
'Tis only the <hi>Exit</hi> to such an Inglorious Life and Reign,
can reinstate them in the possession of their Hopes, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate
them for the Enjoyment of those Mercies, which
Heaven may design them. I might produce innumerable
instances of this sort, to confirm what I am proving: <hi>viz.</hi>
That God serves his Providence of the Efficacy and Powers
of Natural Causes, in his Presidency over the World. But
I hasten to another consideration: <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That he suspends or alters the settled course of
Natural Laws, when they happen to obstruct, or at least do
not forward the purposes and ends of his Government.</p>
            <p>Though nothing can be wiser or better order'd, than the
settled course of second Causes, in the constant and regular
Production of their Effects; yet the laws of them, like the
laws of Nations, being of great simplicity, and constituted
for the general good of the Universe, can not always bend
and comply to those particular Moral Exigencies, which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53462:8"/>
Men may create by the perverse use of their Liberty; and
therefore God has reserved to himself a transcendant Right
(as it were a Court of Equity) of suspending, or post-poning
their Execution, to mitigate that rigorous procedure, and
redress those unequal Judgments, which might otherwise
reflect upon his Wisdom or his Justice. For why should it
be suppos'd that God who is the freest Agent, should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
himself such Fatal and unalterable Laws, as might
any ways controul the exercise of his Power, or tie the hands
of his Providence, in his merciful and bounteous designs to
his Creatures? He that made those Laws for the good order
of the Natural World, may well be allowed to suspend, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke,
or alter them to serve an higher end, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations
of his Grace, and the benefit of his Church and
People. All the miracles which have ever been wrought,
are so many demonstrations of this Soveraign and free Power,
which he has imploy'd for the manifestation of himself, and
the service of his Worshippers:<note place="margin">Wisd. 19. 20, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>As when the Fire
had power in the Water, forgetting its own Vertue, and
the Water forgat its own quenching Nature, and
when the Flames wasted not the Flesh of corruptible living
things;</hi> in all which, and the like instances, <hi>God magnified
his People and glorifyed them, and assisted them in every Time
and Place.</hi> If it be said, that the age of Miracles is past,
and that the Lord no longer deals by such extraordinary
Methods with Mankind; we own that the sign and the
wonder, the ostentatious part of Miracles is ceas'd. The
Sun does not stand still in <hi>Gibeon,</hi> nor the Moon in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of <hi>Ajalon.</hi> God does not work Prodigies, to amaze and
confound his Enemies, or to convince his own People of the
truth of his Revelations, which have already been so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
attested by those powerful Credentials. But whoever
from hence will conclude, that he never supersedes the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
course of things, that he does not sometimes withhold,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53462:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or promote, or stop, and revolt the Wheels of Nature in
their Roats, for the relief of the Good and Righteous, or the
punishment of Atheistical and Wicked Men; must be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to this Conclusion, that the Church of <hi>Christ</hi> is less dear
to him than that of <hi>Moses,</hi> and that a Christian has not equal
pretensions to the care of Providence, with a Jew: But if
this were so, what imaginable encouragement could be left
to our Prayers, in our Difficulties or Distresses, which yet
God has commanded us to make, and has promised to hear
and grant? When our Blood boils within us, and a Raging
Fever drinks up our Spirits, to what purpose shall we have
recourse to God for help, if the Disease must equally spend its
force, and the Remedies be as ineffectual, as if instead of
Praying we had Blasphemed? They <hi>that go down to the Sea
in Ships</hi> (says the Psalmist) <hi>and do business in great
Waters,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 107. 23, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>These see the Works of the Lord, and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in the deep. For he commandeth, and raiseth the
stormy Wind which lifteth up the Waves thereof. They mount up
to the Heaven, they go down to the depths: Their Soul is melted
because of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Man, and are at their wits end:</hi> as he Elegantly describes
their condition in a Tempest. <hi>Then they cry unto the Lord in
their trouble, and he brings them out of their distresses.</hi> But to
little purpose it would be for the Mariners to cry unto the
Lord in hopes of Deliverance, if he suffer'd the Winds and
Waves to take their full swinge in wrecking their fury upon
the defenceless Vessel, and he vouchsafed not <hi>to rebuke the
Winds, and to say unto the Sea, Peace, be still.</hi> Such Miracles
as these we make no doubt but God works every day for the
benefit of those, who in their troubles heartily and devoutly
call upon him. Yet if any shall still contend, as some have
done, That it is below the dignity and nature of an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
and Immutable Being, to deviate from his general Will,
in these particular exceptions, and contradictions to it; these
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53462:9"/>
may be also satisfied, without receeding from what has been
said, by considering</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That God interesses his Angels in affairs here
below, and makes them Minister to the necessities and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of Mankind.</p>
            <p>In the Infancy, and uninlightned ages of the World, if
God had any special Message to reveal, or Business to transact
with the Sons of Men, his Angels were his Ambassadors,
Commission'd to perform it in his Name; and as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
appear'd with a visible Pomp, and Authority, so they
discharged their Office in the Face of the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
asserted the Truth of the Revelation, and the Soveraign
Power of the Revealer. But since those Ministers have
withdrawn themselves from that manifest commerce, we
are more in the dark concerning the extent of their Province,
and the actual exercise of their Power: Nevertheless since
in Scripture we read of Kingdoms committed to the care of
Angels, and hear of <hi>the Princes of</hi> Persia, <hi>and of</hi>
Greece,<note place="margin">Dan. 10. 20. 12. 1.</note> 
               <hi>and of</hi> Michael <hi>the Prince that Protected
Israel.</hi> Since we are assured that <hi>they are all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
Spirits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>sent forth to Minister for them, who
shall be Heirs of Salvation:</hi> We cannot doubt but
they still mingle themselves with humane Interests, and by
the appointment of their Almighty Lord, ingage their Power
in influencing both the publick Policies, and private
Transactions of the World: We are apt enough to believe
there are evil and lying Spirits, which diligently wait to
betray us into Sin and Misery; and why should we so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Mercy and Goodness of God, as to think he has
not counterpoiz'd those evil designs with the auspicious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of more Charitable, and Benevolent Natures; which
being so, we need not nicely dispute how far God himself
may Personally operate in the suspension or application of
his general Laws, to our particular necessities, there being
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53462:9"/>
the same Mercy of Providence on God's part, and the same
obligation to gratitude, and adoration on ours, whether he
in Person takes this immediate care of us, or in subservience
to his Will has appointed Deputies to this purpose, and given
his Angels charge over us, to keep us in all our
ways.<note place="margin">Ps. 91. 11.</note> I shall add but one consideration more, of
the manner of God's Providential Proceeding, and that is</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> That he mannages the whole result of all sorts
of Powers, and Motions, both in the Natural, and Moral
World, so as to make all things however repugnant to his
Will, or inconsistent with one another, harmoniously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
in the producing those effects, which his Wisdom has
pre-determin'd; which consideration I do not mention as
distinct from the rest, but as the summ and comprehension
of them all. This is the great Mastery and perfection of the
Divine Policy, to act upon such thorough views as infallibly
to attain its ends, though by ways that seem never so contrary
to, or incompetible with them. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the mysterious depths of the Divine Providence, in the
reciprocal Dispensations of Mercy, to the Jews and Gentiles;
in that the unbelief of the Jews should administer to the
Faith of the Gentiles; and the bringing in the Fullness of
the Gentiles, at length turn to the Salvation of the Jews;
breaks out into an ecstasie of Admiration. <hi>Oh! the depth of
the Riches, both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God; how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
are his Judgments, and his ways past finding
out?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 33</note> Doubtless this is an Abyss, that no created
understanding can fathom. 'Tis that infinite mind alone,
which at one steady, and unchangeable view, takes in the
whole Eternal round of Causes and Effects, which can either
sufficiently admire, or comprehend the reaches of its own Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
But notwithstanding our inability to see far into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Councels; we are confident that nothing falls out but by
the Appointment of an Heavenly Father, who is so intimately
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53462:10"/>
conscious to our minutest concerns: that, to express it, <hi>the
very Hairs of our head</hi> are said to <hi>be numbred by him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 30.</note>
And 'tis the foundation of the greatest hope, and
security to us Christians, to <hi>know that all things shall work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for Good to them that love God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> Even the
Sin and Evil, and Folly and Rashness of Men,
things most repugnant to his Nature, and Will, shall one
way or other tend to illustrate the wonderful extent of his
Wisdom, who from the Darkness and Confusion of a Chaos,
could raise the August Fabrick of a World; and from the
more horrid distractions of Sin and Madness, can strike out
the most beautiful, and uniform designs for the Happiness
and Encouragement of his Servants: How otherwise could
<hi>Joseph</hi> have risen to little less than Royal Dignity, by means
that, humanely speaking, tended only to Misery and Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Could the purposes of Revenge, and Hatred in his
Brethren to destroy him; of Covetousness in Merchants to
sell, and inslave him; of disappointed Lust in an inraged
Woman, to Imprison him; have ever been conceived to be
gradual steps to his saving both <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Aegypt?</hi> Yet these
and a number of other as unlikely presages to Advancement,
were ordain'd by God the necessary preparations for it. But
'tis more amazing to follow the Clue of God's wonderful Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy
in all those perplex'd Labyrinths through which he
deduced his great purpose, of raising the Posterity of fallen
Man by the Seed of the Woman, the Messiah of the World.
<hi>The Kings of the Earth stood up, and the Rulers took Counsel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
against the Lord, and against his Anointed.</hi> All Earthly
Powers conspired to destroy him in the Root, in his Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
or to cut off the Righteous branch of <hi>Jesse:</hi> But how
vain were their imaginations, and rash and foolish their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
when God had determin'd to <hi>set his King upon his
Holy Hill of Sion? Ps.</hi> 2. Our short-sighted knowledge can
comprehend but a few, and those the most obvious Links in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53462:10"/>
this wonderful Chain of Providence, but yet enow to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
us in our own thoughts, and to teach us <hi>that there is no
Wisdom, nor Vnderstanding, nor Counsel against the Lord.</hi>
Which point being sufficiently clear'd, I come to the second
general, to discover briefly</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Intention, or Ends, and Reasons of
God's thus interposing his Providence in the Government of
humane affairs and actions; and these in general are two.
First, The Temporal Prosperity and Security of his Church
and People. Secondly, The exercising those Vertues and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in them, which are necessary to their Eternal Happiness.
First, The Temporal Prosperity and Security of his Church
and People. There are two great Evils which in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
disorder'd state of the World, violently break in upon
the Wellfare and Happiness of Mankind, and are very great
Reasons to induce an Omnipotent God to inspect and govern
humane affairs: these are the destructive use of the Liberty
of their own Minds: and the irresistible violence of external
Bodies: one great share of Mens infelicity happening to them
by the design'd wickedness of their Neighbours; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
portion of misery accruing, by the unpremeditate inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of outward accidents, which no foresight could prevent
or remedy. So that these necessities seem to have superindu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a peculiar Order of Providence, which an unsinning state
did not stand in need of: For as it was a state of Innocence,
there was no moral evils to disturb the quiet and felicity of
Man; and being a state of Happiness, we may be certain too,
natural evils grew out of exteriour Bodies to afflict and grieve
a Righteous Soul. The course of Nature was then subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the order of Grace, till Sin and Evil entring, broke and
confounded the happy Connexion, and obliged <hi>God to lay to
his hand when Man had destroyed his Law.</hi> We know then
that the present state of the World is such as justly calls for
an over-ruling Providence, both to still the Raging of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53462:11"/>
Sea, and to controul the other Elements, and also to restrain
the Madness and Wickedness of the People: that so neither
the design'd Malice of the one, nor the blind and insensate
Fury of the other, may pass the bounds which the Almighty
sets them. Were it not for such an unconfin'd Soveraignty
of God, his Worshippers would be the most wretched and
forsaken People living. They would lie at the Mercy of a
wicked and desperate Race, and be subject to the Outrage
and Violence of every other Creature; and that without
Refuge, and without Hopes. Nay how can we conceive
but that the Face of a Visible Church, had long since disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
had it not been for the assurance of a Divine Presence,
and assistance to the End of the World? The Impious Rage,
and Enmity of Earthy Powers, had e're this effac'd the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of it; and excluded the belief of a Deity, no less than
of a Providence; from the Minds of Men; especially, if that
Brood of Evils, which Nature teems with, were permitted
to take part with the Wickedness of Man, in disheartning
Religion and Piety towards God: What destructions might
Deluges, Earthquakes, and Conflagrations e'er this, have
brought upon the Earth, had they constantly been suffer'd to
exert their natural, and unbroken strength? and if Thunder,
and Lightning, Storm and Tempest, Heat and Cold, Poisons
and Pestilences, were discharged from the Regions of the air
we breath in, in their genuine and native Force, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
interpos'd not to prevent their effects, or over-rule
them to an excellent end; the best of Men would labour
under a worse fate than <hi>Cain;</hi> and imagine not only that
every Man, but that every part of Nature was arm'd against
them to destroy them. But all these fears and despondencies
are removed, by the assurance God has given of his constant
Care and Vigilance over his Church and People.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The second end and reason of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
in the Government of the World, is the exercising
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53462:11"/>
those our Vertues and Graces, which support it and depend
upon it, and are necessary qualifications for Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
What would become of our Christian Faith and Hope,
of our Confidence and Patience, of our Peace and Joy in the
Holy Ghost, if we were not assured there was a good God
who prevented our Sufferings and Afflictions, or supported
us under them, or rewarded us for them. If he were uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
at the Successes, or Misfortunes of our present Life,
of what use would be a great part of our Services and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
Why should we pray unto him for temporal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
or return thanks for Benefits received? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
were our present Solemnity of pouring out our hearts
in Praise and Thanksgiving to God, for restoring Peace to
our Nation, and Blessing his Majesty's Councels, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
in promoting it; if there were nothing in the whole
event, but what was owing to humane Strength and Policy,
and the natural course of things? And therefore as the sense
of Providence begets in the Wise, and Good, Pious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Affections; invigorates their Vertues and Graces, and
the ends of Religion are served by the belief of it: So God
will magnify himself in the disappointments of the wicked:
and by overthrowing their infidel purposes, and resisting
their indeavours make them at last confess, that it is he alone
that Rules in the Kingdoms of Men. Lest the humble and
meek should despair and faint, and the proud boysterous
Sinners triumph in their power; he makes the success of
things unequal to their Causes, <hi>so that the race is not to the swift,
nor the Battel to the strong.</hi> For which reason our Church
devoutly acknowledging the Poverty and Weakness of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Forces, unless in dependance on the Favour and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of Almighty God; ever accompanies the efforts of
our Fleets, and Armies, with her Prayers; and returns the
Praise and Honour of all Success to God, in those dutiful
Resentments and Thanksgivings which she offers. Which
leads me to the third thing propos'd.</p>

Thirdly, To apply these Considerations to that particular
Providence, and Mercy of God which we now commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
A Mercy so extraordinary and surprizing, that our
Joys will hardly give leave to our Thoughts to represent it;
A Mercy which this Nation has long hoped for, and long
prayed for; and in the pursuit of it has expended a great
deal of Blood and Treasure; but has at length obtain'd, under
the Glorious Conduct of our Great Soveraign, concurring
with Almighty Providence, in the birth of a Happy and
Honourable Peace, of which he has so long travail'd: How
great a Blessing Peace is after the long toils and expences of
War every People is sufficiently sensible; but setting aside
the common advantages, that which renders it inestimable
to these Kingdoms, is that hereby they are establish'd upon
a firm and unshaken foundation; a work which being hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
retarded, and undermin'd, was reserv'd for the Reign
of Him, who seems destin'd by Providence, for the redress
of oppress'd Nations, and the safety and deliverance of <hi>Europe</hi>
I shall not be thought to detract from his Courage, or his
Wisdom, when I say he has been made the great instrument
of Providence, in healing the Wounds of divided Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
and unravelling those great events, which have lain
for Ages wrapt up in the dark folds of Time. He must be
obstinately blind who will not at least perceive a Divine Hand
in the whole Scene of his Actions, and confess that so large
a Field of Glory, was appointed for his Heroick Vertues to
expatiate in. Indeed his Life in the many great turns of it,
seems to be wholly Miraculous; and all those vast difficulties
which constantly encountred his aspiring Honour, design'd
by Heaven to Illustrate the Greatness of his Merit, and to
make his Vertues unparallel'd, and Triumphant. If we
view him more particularly, and nearer home, in the late
wonderful Revolutions, what less then a Divine Power could
have so happily establish'd him on his Throne; What else
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53462:12"/>
could have turn'd the Hearts of a great People, as of one
Man: and have broken all those measures, which were
laid for the ruine of our Liberties and Religion? what else
could have encouraged him to undertake the Cause of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress'd
<hi>Europe,</hi> against the over-grown Power of an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Nation; or have enabled him to humble her in the
heighth of her Victories and Successes, so as to make her
stoop to the modest requests of Peace, and narrower Limits
of Dominion? who but such a Prince, and under a Divine
Direction, could have retrieved the Ancient Spirit, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
together with the high Reputation of these Realms;
and thereby extinguisht a flaming War, that depopulated
and laid wast the best cultivated part of the Earth? He that
will ascribe such Effects as these to meer Naval Preparations,
and Field Forces, under the sole guidance of a Cabinet
Council; must be obliged to own his disbelief of a God, or
at least that he has any interest in the Government of the
World. For if Humane Wisdom could have prevail'd,
where were there more refined Policies than in a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Court? If Humane Force, where were there such
mighty Preparations against the day of Battel? Insomuch, that
I know not in what instance the adorable Wisdom of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is more conspicuous, than in causing a Nation, which
hardly any Foreign Force could shake, to sink under the
weight of her own grandeur, and grow less by her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests:
Those toils which she spread to a vast extent for
the Captivating other Kingdoms, have providentially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
her own Bowels, and left the decaying Bulk of
Power to be recruited by the gentler Methods of Peace and
Tranquility; and in the disappointment of all her lofty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and gigantick Undertakings, we have an undoubted
Testimony afforded to this truth, <hi>That there is no Wisdom,
nor Vnderstanding, nor Counsel against the Lord; that the Horse
is prepared against the day of Battel, but safety is of the Lord.</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:53462:13"/>
To the Lord therefore we ascribe our Peace and Safety:
The Safety of our Persons, and our Properties, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the Safety of our Church: and here I beg leave to
remind you of your Duties to Thankfullness and Gratitude
upon this occasion; in that there is not any Church on
Earth, that has had more Signal Providences, to approve
it the immediate Care and Concern of Heaven, than
this we are Members of. How often has it been ready
to be swallowed up, as if it were to magnify the goodness
of God in its Preservation! What Method of a Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Providence, has been wanting to Confirm its Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment?
Open Violence and Secret Conspiracies to
destroy and undermine it, have still been over-rul'd by that
Almighty Arm which protects it to its greater Glory
and Security: Witness an <hi>Invincible Armado,</hi> threatning our
Kingdom with perpetual Slavery of Soul and Body, dispers'd
and ruin'd by the irresistable Power of God, <hi>who
makes the Creature his Weapon for the Revenge of his
Enemies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wisd. 5. 17, 22.</note> 
               <hi>and causes a mighty Wind to stand up against
them, and blow them away.</hi> Witness the dark designs of Hell,
to destroy our Laws and Law-makers, our Church and State
at one blow, betrayed and confounded by a kind of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
and prophetical impression on the Spirit of our Prince:
Nay that which is more amazing, the Blood of our Royal
Martyr, wherewith the Life and Soul of our Religion seem'd
to expire; how has it by the wonderful appointment of
Heaven proved the seed of the Church? The <hi>Wrath of Man</hi>
in that desperate and unheard of Wickedness <hi>has turn'd to the
praise of God;</hi> in that the blessings which this Church and
Nation at this day enjoy, under the happy Protection of our
present Soveraign, have a visible dependance and connexion
with the fatal Event. Who can chuse but admire and adore
the goodness of God, who has not suffer'd our Wickedness
to make us miserable as we have deserved; but whenever
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53462:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his threatnings or his judgments have wrought in us a deep
sense of our Sins, and Sorrow for them, has still manifested
his mercy in our Deliverance! If he has formerly suffer'd
the Lustre of our Church to be eclyps'd, 'tis probably that
it might at least shine with a brighter vigour, under his
gracious Patronage, whom he has made the Author of our
Peace, and the Defender of our Faith. For who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
but to this end God has raised him up, and Cover'd
his head so often in the day of Battel; that to this end his
Angels have taken care, that whilst Thousands fell on his
right hand, and on his left, the Arrows of Death have not
come nigh him? May the same good Providence persevere
to Protect and Defend Him, who has, at the Hazard of his
Life, so often Defended us: and may our Thankfulness to
God, and grateful Obedience to his Vicegerent, deserve that
he may long Reign over us, and late exchange a Temporal
for an Eternal Crown.</p>
            <p>All the Application I shall make shall be taken from the
words of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> upon the like occasion. <hi>I will
hear what God the Lord will speak:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 85. 8.</note> 
               <hi>for he will speak
Peace unto his People, and to his Saints, but let them not turn
again to folly.</hi> 'Tis the provoking Folly of our Sins that has
induced God to Unsheath the Sword upon us, as the severest
of National Punishments. But our Repentance or Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have at last atton'd his Anger, in causing him to put
an end to War, and <hi>speak Peace again unto his People:</hi> and 'tis
now at our own extream Peril, if we return to those Sins and
Follies for which we have already suffer'd. God has given
us Peace, and with it, has put into our hands all those
Blessings which are the Materials of our Temporal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
so that nothing seems to be required on our parts,
but to prepare and qualify our hearts for the Enjoyment.
If we shall inlarge our Souls with Joy and Gratitude, in
proportion to these Mercies, we may reasonably expect,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53462:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Continuance and Succession of them: But if we prove
such insensible Wretches, as no bounds can satisfy: If we
are Impatient and Querulous, and deal with God and our
Prince, as did the murmuring <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Desart, we
may justly apprehend that these our Follies, will recal those
Judgments, which are now so happily past over us; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
our Church and Nation to a more irrevocable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>Now we are made whole, let us go and Sin no more, left a
worse thing come unto us.</p>
