            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO The honourable Houſes of PARLIAMENT. THE HVMBLE PETITION OF THE Inhabitants of the Cityes of London and VVeſtminſter, And the Borough of <hi>Southwarke,</hi> in the behalfe of themſelves, and of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in this Kingdome diſtreſſed in point of Conſcience.</head>
            <p>WHereas your Petitioners having formerly contributed, freely and liberally to the King and Parliament in conjunction, doe now refuſe further to contribute or pay, conceiving them in oppoſition; as by reaſon His Majeſties perſon was invaded in battell at <hi>Keinton</hi> (contrary to the many Declarations of taking up Armes for the ſafety of His Majeſties perſon) ſo in regard there is no expreſſe care of His perſon and honour in your late Ordinance, for the aſſeſſing the Twentieth part in <hi>London,</hi> nor in your Declaration for leavying of money in the Countyes.</p>
            <p>And whereas this their refuſall is meerely out of Conſcience, according to that information they have Concerning the Divine Conſtitution of particular Kings in their ſeverall Kingdomes, and of Subjection to them both Active and Paſſive, and of the Damnableneſſe of Reſiſting; from</p>
            <p>Firſt, The word of God: <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 17. &amp; 25. 32. where thrice in one Chapter it is ſaid, That the Kingdomes be Gods, and he gives them to whom he will. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 9. Who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lords Anoynted and be Guiltleſſe. And the ſame bleſſed ſpirit which calls <hi>David</hi> the Lords Anoynted, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 89. 20. doth call <hi>Cyrus</hi> a Heathen Prince the Lords Anoynted alſo. <hi>Eſa. 45. 1. Rom.</hi> 13. Let every ſoule be ſubject to the higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God; The Powers that be are ordained of God, whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to themſelves damnation. (yea wee acknowledge in our Booke of Common Prayer, that King CHARLES is Gods Miniſter, and that he hath Gods Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſo fighting againſt him, wee fight againſt God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>Fifthly, From the Lawes of the Land, which declare it to be Treaſon to Leavy Warre againſt the King in this Kingdome, and to encounter in fight, and kill ſuch as are aſſiſting to the King, or come to helpe him, or to aid in thoſe caſes.</p>
            <p>And the Action of the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was adjudged Treaſon, though he pretended nothing but removing evill Counſellors from the Queene. Now that which is evill in its owne nature cannot be the ſubject of any Command, nor induce any obligation upon any man by any Authority whatſoever. Remonſtrance, <hi>May</hi> 19. And wee may not doe evill that good may come of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Alſo in regard of the late Proteſtation, relating to the ſaid Doctrines, and to His Majeſty reſpectively, which Proteſtation, you have bound your ſelves to maintaine, and all thoſe that doe any thing in purſuance of it.</p>
            <p>You would at leaſt be pleaſed in your preſent undertakings for Religion, and for the Law of the Land and the Liberty and Property of the Subjects, to proceed in the way of Religion without violence to the Conſcience, in a caſe that concerns no leſſe then Salvation or Damnation (As you profeſſe your tenderneſſe of the Conſcience even in matters of Indifferency) And that firſt your Authenticall Divines (D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
