            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Christian Reader.</head>
            <p>I <hi>Know well that this is a very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Subject about which I am now writing. For,</hi>
            </p>

               <l>—The Ancients made</l>

            <p>
               <hi>There are two sorts of Persons which err about the Judgments of God: The one of such who will not take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, be they never so plain and conspicuous. Of such the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,</hi> Esay 26. 11. Lord, when thy
<pb facs="tcp:60924:3"/>
Hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see. <hi>These are stupid, and blockish Persons: For (saith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, verse</hi> 9.) When thy Judgments are in the Earth, the Inhabitants of the World <hi>will (or at least should)</hi> learn Righteousness. <hi>The other sort are of such as are too</hi> Critical, <hi>and censorious in judging of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Dispensations, as if they were punishments for sin, when God hath other excellent ends in them: This was the fault of Christ's Disciples,</hi> John 9. 2. <hi>When they saw a man that was blind from his Birth:</hi> Master (<hi>say they</hi>) Who did sin? This Man, or his Parents, that he was born blind? <hi>To whom our Saviour answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> Neither hath this Man sinned, nor his Parents: But that the Works of God should be made manifest in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But notwithstanding these Errors, both on the Right and Left Hand, there must be an humble, sober, and prudent</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60924:3"/>
               <hi>taking notice of God's Judgments that we may make a right construction of them. The Apostle St.</hi> Paul, <hi>having recorded the dreadful Examples of God's wrath upon the sinful</hi> Israelites <hi>in the Wilderness</hi> (1 Cor. 10. 5. &amp;c.) <hi>concludes</hi> (<hi>verse</hi> 11.) Now all these things happened unto them for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samples: And they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the World are come. <hi>God himself also hath appointed the record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and observation of such Judgments,</hi> That all Israel may hear, and fear, and do no more any such wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But do we not often see, that great and violent Persecutors live long, and prosper in the World, as if they rather merited a reward, than procured God's wrath against them for it?</p>
            <p>Ans. <hi>It's true.</hi> 1. <hi>God's Judgments upon many Persecutors are more spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and so less conspicuous, and visible</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60924:4"/>
               <hi>to the eye of the World: As when God gives them up to blindness of mind, hardness of heart, a cauterized consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a reprobate sence, which of all other Judgments are the most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> Hos. 4. 17.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>All the while they escape with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, they are but</hi> treasuring up wrath against the Day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>For</hi> it's a righteous thing with God to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence tribulation to them that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>and persecute his People,</hi> 2 Thes. 1. 6. <hi>Hence,</hi> Job 31. 3. Is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to the wicked? And a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity? <hi>God doth record and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister such wicked mens sins against the Day of Judgment. He writes them in a Book with</hi> a Pen of Iron, and the Point of a Diamond, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>He</hi> seals them up in a Bag, <hi>Job</hi> 14. 17. <hi>As a Clerk of the Assizes seals up the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments, and at the Assizes opens his</hi>

               <hi>Bag, and produceth them,</hi> Deut. 32. 34.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet God in all Ages hath taken some of these Persecutors, and hung them up in Chains, as Spectacles of his wrath, for a warning unto others. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever such, by reason of God's pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and forbearance, may dream of impunity; yet let them know that Judgments are never nearer than when they are least feared. A great Càlm is many times the fore-runner of a Storm, when men cry</hi> Peace, Peace, <hi>then comes sudden and swift destruction,</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 3. <hi>When</hi> Agag <hi>said in his Heart,</hi> Surely the bitterness of Death is past<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>then came</hi> Samuel <hi>and hewed him in pieces. When the</hi> Old World <hi>was eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drinking, buying, building, Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, and snorting in security; then came the</hi> Flood, <hi>and destroyed them: When men be at</hi> case in Sion, <hi>there is a</hi> Wo <hi>denounced against them,</hi> Amos 6. 1. <hi>to the</hi> 8. <hi>When men look at Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as a far off, then God will defer no longer,</hi> Ezek. 12. 27. 28. <hi>When the</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60924:5"/>
Philistins <hi>met together to be merry and to sport themselves with</hi> Sampson, (<hi>whose eyes they had put out) he brought the House upon their Heads, and slew them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now God executes Judgments upon some wicked Persecutors; but these are but</hi> Praeludia futuri Judicii, <hi>Tokens and fore-runners of that Great and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Judgment. Some are now puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed (saith one) as the</hi> Old World, Sodom, Egypt, Jerusalem, &amp;c. <hi>that we may know that there is a Providence taking notice of all: Yet all are not punished, that we may know there is a Judgment to come, to which the wicked are reserved,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 10. <hi>Here God's way is in the Clouds, we see not the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of many things, but then his Justice and Righteousness shall be gloriously ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to all the World,</hi> Rev. 2. 5. <hi>Here they live longest, many times, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve not to live at all,</hi> Job 21. 7. <hi>The</hi> Israelites <hi>are oppressed whilst the</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians <hi>live at ease. Good</hi> David <hi>is</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60924:5"/>
               <hi>in want, and persecuted, whilst wicked</hi> Nabal <hi>abounds.</hi> Sion <hi>is oft Captive to</hi> Babylon: <hi>But there is another Day, and another reckoning, when all shall be set to Rights: When the</hi> Righteous shall rejoyce, and the wicked shall mourn, <hi>Esay</hi> 65. 13, 14. <hi>God will not alwayes suffer his</hi> Jewels <hi>to be tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Dirt under the feet of Pride and Malice; but he will vindicate the injuries that are now done unto them,</hi> Luke 18. 7. <hi>Now men curse, but Christ will then receive such, with a</hi> Come ye Blessed of my Father, &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 34.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O how singularly foolish than are you, that seek to root out, and to rid the Saints out of the World, as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperors did. These resemble the Stag in the</hi> Emblem, <hi>that fed upon the Leaves, which hid him from the Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And</hi> Sampson-<hi>like, by pulling down the Pillars, they bring the House upon their own Heads.</hi>

               <hi>(through God's Blessing) this little Book may prove useful to the deterring of wicked and malevolent spirits from all kinds of Persecution, though but in Words and Gestures,</hi> Esay 57. 3, 4. <hi>and to the encouraging of the Godly Persecuted, to bear their sufferings meekly, referring their cause wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, who saith,</hi> Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 19. <hi>I have mine end,</hi>

But at last being told that it was Gods just revenging hand upon him for persecuting his people, he seemed to relent, and commanded the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution to cease: and God was pleased in some measure to ease him of his grievous torments.

               <p n="63">63. Two years after, the Bishops by their importunity prevailed with the King to use sharp remedies against those growing

evils, as they called them: whereupon an <hi>Edict</hi> was drawn up, that all the <hi>Piccards</hi> in the Kingdom, without distinction of Age, Sex, or Quality should be slain. This was brought to the Assembly of States, then met at <hi>Prague,</hi> to be confirmed by them. Many of the Nobles opposed it; but by the subtilty of the Chancellor, and his Associats, it was at last agreed upon by the major part: and the Chancellour as he returned homeward from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, visited a Nobleman of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and told him with much joy, what they had resolved upon. The Nobleman had a Servant standing by, who was a great favourer of the Brethren, he asked him, how he liked this Decree?

hanged, burned, or beheaded by his hands' it pleased God that all these evils befell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: For, being exceedingly in debt, for very vexation, he hanged himself: And when his friends had buried him privately, the common people, hearing of it, dig'd up his carcass, and threw it away, which, by the Magistrates command, was ordered to be burnt: But when the Wood was consumed. and the Body only scorched, his head was by one stricken off.</p>

               <p n="82">82. After him succeeded in his Office one <hi>Bartholomew Cassinaeus,</hi> who proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a pestilent Persecutor, whom the Lord struck with a fearful and sudden Death.</p>
               <p n="83">83. <hi>Johannes de Roma,</hi> a <hi>Monk</hi> was a bloody and implacable Persecutor of the <hi>Waldenses.</hi> His manner was to fill Boots with boiling Oil and put their Legs into them, tying them backward over a Form, their Legs hanging down over a soft fire, and afterwards cruelly to put them to Death, and seized upon their Goods.

whom he condemned) for falling into extreme terrors of Conscience, he betook himself to his bed, sighing and sob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without intermission, and breathing forth murmurings against God; yea, his horrors were so violent that he shaked the Bed under him, as if a young man with all his Strength had done it. And a certain Cardinal coming to visit him, he could not endure his sight, crying out, that it was that Cardinal that had brought him to Damnation. He continued long under these dreadful torments, and dyed at last in despairing fear and anguish.</p>
               <p n="92">92. <hi>Poncher,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Tours,</hi> who condemned many godly persons to the Fire, was himself seized upon with a fire from God; which, beginning at his heel, could by no means be cured, till one Member after another being cut off, he dyed in much misery.</p>

sped no better. For a while after the Marshal <hi>Vielle Ville,</hi> coming to <hi>Roan</hi> about publick Affairs, invited <hi>Villebon</hi> to dinner, and in discourse, lamenting the miseries of that City, he exhorted him to reform many abuses, seeing he was the Kings Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant there. <hi>Villebon</hi> took this so ill, that he said, <hi>If any man dare tax me for not behaving my self as I ought in my place, I would tell him to his face that he lyed.</hi> These words he repeated over so often, that the Marshal being much urged, struck at him with his Sword, with such violence, that, had he not received the blow with his Arm, his head had been clest to the Teeth.

                  <hi>Oxford,</hi> (though some great Peers came to dine with him that day, yet) would not sit down to dinner, till one of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants about four a Clock in the Afternoon, coming Post from <hi>Oxford,</hi> brought word that Execution was done upon them. Then did he hast to Dinner, and was very merry, but ere he had eaten many bits, a sudden stroke of Gods hand fell upon him, so that he was carried immediately to his Bed, in which he continued for fifteen days in intollerable anguish and torments, rotting above ground, during all which time he could void nothing that he received, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Stool, nor Urine, his Tongue also hung out of his mouth swoln, and black, and so he languished and pined away in great anguish and misery.</p>
               <p n="135">135. King <hi>James</hi> the Fifth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the instigation of the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy, was a great Persecutor of the Truth that then brake forth in that Kingdom: and for that end he gave Commission to Sir <hi>James Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> natural Brother to the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> who was his Treasurer, to call, and convent all that were suspected of <hi>Heresie,</hi> and to inflict upon them the punishment, which, after tryal, they should be found to deserve: In Execution of which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missiion
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60924:41"/>
he was most fierce and cruel, not sparing some that were of his near Kindred. But when he was in his greatest heighth, and made it his work to suppress the Gospel, one of his own Friends, whom he pursued upon the account of Religion, accused him of Treason, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the mediation of the <hi>Popish</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for him, as their greatest Patron, he was arraigned, condemned, executed, and quartered in the streets of <hi>Edenburg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This King <hi>James</hi> also was heard to say, that none of that way should expect any favour at his hands, nay, nor his own Sons if they should be found guilty. But shortly after, War breaking forth with <hi>England,</hi> he found his Nobility averse to those Incursions which he intended to make into <hi>England,</hi> which much vexed him. These thoughts, and some fearful Visions which he had by Night, terrified him exceedingly. For at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> on a night as he slept, it seemed to him that <hi>Thomas Scot,</hi> Justice Clerk, came unto him, with a company of Devils, crying, <hi>Wo worth the day that ever I knew thee, or thy Service: For serving thee against God and his Servants, I am now adjudged to Hell torments.</hi> Hereupon awaking, he called
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60924:41"/>
for Lights, and told his Servants what he had heard and seen. The next morrow, by the light of day, news was brought him of the death of the said Justice Clerk, which fell out just at the same time when the King had this Vision, and almost in the same manner: For he dyed in great horror, often reiterating those words, <hi>By the righteous Judgment of God, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi> And this manner of his death, answering so exactly to the Kings Dream made it the more terrible.</p>
               <p>The King also had another Dream in the same place a few nights after, which did more affright him. Whilest he lay sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he thought that Sir <hi>James Hamilton</hi> aforesaid, came unto him with a naked Sword in his Hand, and therewith cut off both his Arms; threatening to return within a short time, and to deprive him of his life. With this he awaked, and as he lay musing what this Dream should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, news was brought him of the death of his two Sons, <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>Arthur,</hi> the one dying at S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the other at <hi>Strivling,</hi> at one and the very same hour. The next year, which was 1542. being overwhelmed with grief, he dyed at <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the two and thirtieth year of his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60924:42"/>
Age. A little before he dyed, word was brought him that his Queen was delivered of a Daughter; whereupon he brake forth into a Passion, saying: <hi>It came with a Lass,</hi> (meaning the Crown) <hi>and will go with a Lass. Fie upon it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="136">136. One Friar <hi>Campbell</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> did bitterly rail upon that man of God, Mr. <hi>Patrick Hamilton</hi> whilest he was burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at S. <hi>Andrews:</hi> to whom Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> said with much earnestness: <hi>Thou wicked man, thou knowest the contrary, and hast sometime made a Profession of the truth: I appeal thee to answer it before the Judgment Seat of</hi> Christ: A few days after <hi>Campbel</hi> fell sick, and in great horror of Conscience dyed distracted.</p>
               <p n="137">137. <hi>Anno</hi> 1568. There was in <hi>Breda</hi> one <hi>Peter Coulogue,</hi> a godly man, who, by his <hi>Popish</hi> Adversaries was cast into Prison, and his Maid-servant daily carried him his Food, confirming and comforting him out of the word of God as well as she was able; for which they imprisoned her also. Not long after <hi>Peter</hi> was put to the torment of the Rack, which he endured patiently. After him the Maid was fetch'd to be rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereupon, she said; <hi>My Masters, wherefrre will ye put me to this torture, seeing</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:60924:42"/>
                  <hi>I have no way offended you? If it be for my Faith-sake, ye need not torment me: For, as I was never ashamed to make a Confession thereof, no more will I now be at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent before you; but will if you please freely shew you my mind therein.</hi> Yet for all this they would have her to the Rack: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon she again said, <hi>If I must needs suffer this pain, pray you give me leave to call upon my God first.</hi> This they assented to; and whilest she was fervently pouring out her Soul unto God by Prayer, one of the Commissioners was surprised with such fear and terror that he fell into a swoon, out of which he could never be recovered, by which means the poor Maid escaped rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="138">138. In the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of <hi>France,</hi> there was a godly Tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor condemned to be burnt for Religion, and some about the King would needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade him to be present, and to see the Execution himself: And God gave the Tailor such strength and conrage in the fire as astonished the King to behold it: And the poor Tailor, having espied the King in a window where he sate, fixed his Eyes so stedfastly upon him, as they were never off, and the King was thereby constrained to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60924:43"/>
leave the window, and to retire into his Chamber, and was so affected therewith, that he confessed the shadow of the Taylor followed him whither soever he went, and for many Nights after he was so terrified with the Apparitions of the Taylor, that he protested with an Oath, that he would never hear, nor see any more of those <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> burned.</p>
               <p n="139">139. In the late Rebellion, and Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Ireland, John Nicholson,</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi> his wife were received into the Protection of one <hi>Fitz-Patrick,</hi> who would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded them to change their Religion and to go to <hi>Mass:</hi> But they professed that before they would do that, they would dye upon the Swords point. Then he laboured to prevail with the woman to burn her Bible, but she said, that before she would do it, she would dye the death: whereupon the <hi>Sabbath</hi> morning following, they were both of them cruelly murthered: But he that acted that villany, was so tormented in Conscience: and dogged with their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions, that he pined away and dyed.</p>

And for that savage Blood-shed, gave them Blood to drink in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: For <hi>Mac-Guir Mac-Mahun,</hi> and Sir <hi>Philem Oneal,</hi> being taken Prisoners, were publickly executed. Most of the rest were consumed by the Sword, either in their own Countrey, or in Foreign parts, and their spirits were generally so debased, and their courage emasculated, that a few <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> or <hi>Scottish</hi> Soldiers would chase multitudes of them; and Gods Judgments did so eminently follow them, that within a few years most of that cruel Generation were rooted out.</p>

ruined the Princes of the <hi>Smalcaldick</hi> Union, to which himself had subscribed; and then (casting an ambitious eye upon the Empire it self:) broke his Faith with the Emperor that had raised him; and having patched up the defection by the help of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> King of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi> (afterwards Emperor) he lastly perished by a violent death in a pitch'd Battel fought against his Fellow-Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants.

forced to surrender the Empire to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who diverse years before had entred into a secret League with the Protestant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lived a few years in a despised, and disconsolate condition, he at last ended his life most ingloriously in a Monastery.</p>
               <p n="143">143. His Son <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the most inveterate Enemy of the Gospel that ever lived, did not only erect Shambles for Gods Saints in most of his large Dominions, by his bloody In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors, but still aided the Rebels in <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> against their lawful Sovereigns, and plotted to invade all other Protestant Dominions in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, so at last by one general Carriage of them all, he and his holy Father the <hi>Pope,</hi> might have shared the Christian World by a double Monarchy, of the Church and Empire between them. But did this bloody Prince prosper in these his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and cruel Designs? Nothing less. For what got he by his invading <hi>France</hi> by Land, and <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> by Sea, and by his large Pensions conferred upon the Traitors and secret Enemies of either States? Truly nothing. For having wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about thirty millions of Money upon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60924:45"/>
those fruitless Designs; and not gained a Foot of Land in any of those Realms, but the loss of a great part of the <hi>seventeen Provinces,</hi> with whom, having broken his Oath solemnly sworn to them in his Inauguration, they (by the Aid of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi>) freed themselves from his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Oppression and Tyranny.</p>
               <p>Neither did the Divine Justice suffer him so to escape, but raised a Fire in his own House. For whereas he had Issue by his first Wife <hi>Mary,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>John</hi> the Third, King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> one only Son, called <hi>Charles</hi> (a Prince of admirable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardliness) He (during the Life of our Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> his second Wife) treated a Marriage for his Son with <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the eldest Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, King of <hi>France;</hi> during which Treaty, our Queen <hi>Mary</hi> dying, he himself married her who was designed for his Son (a Lady of admirable Beauty and Parts:) They often in private, never forgetting their old af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, lamented their unhappy loss each of other. The Son also detested his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cruelty, and butchery by the merciless Inquisitors! This so enraged his jealous Father, that he imprison'd him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him over into the Inquisitors

Hands, by whom he was condemned, <hi>Anno Christi,</hi> 1568. and a few days after he sent to him to choose his own Death, who in a warm Bath caused his Veins to be opened, and so dyed. A while after (though she was great with child) he caused his Queen to drink a Cup of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which soon dispatched her.</p>
               <p n="144">144. King <hi>Philip</hi>'s fourth Wife was <hi>Anne,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Empress, his own natural Sister, by whom he had Issue <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>James<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p n="146">146. We need not look into ancient Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Gods Judgments upon Heathen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting Emperors: we may see the sad suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of the Princes of the house of <hi>Valois</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second of <hi>France</hi> was meanly married to <hi>Katherine de Medices</hi> (the Niece of <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the Seventh) during the Life of the <hi>Dolphin</hi> his elder Brother, who was afterwards poisoned. And <hi>Francis</hi> the first, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceasing, he succeeded, and swayd the <hi>French</hi> Scepter for diverse years, with much Tranquility and happiness, till (loathing the Coiture of his Queen, unfit indeed for a Princes bed) he grew highly enamoured on <hi>Piciavia</hi> of <hi>Valence,</hi> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of exquisite Beauty, and good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, with whom he long after lived in continual Adultery, and was by her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed to persecute and slay the Protestants, <hi>Anno Ghristi</hi> 1553. that so by the confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their Lands and Goods, she
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60924:46"/>
might enrich her self, and her Kindred. This Persecution put a Period to all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Victories, and the next year was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with the loss of the City of <hi>Seins</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> to the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> The Death of the old gallant General <hi>Leo Strozzi</hi> by a base hand, and the overthrow of his <hi>French</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by <hi>James de Medices.</hi>

               <p n="147">147. <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1556. The violence of persecution was again renewed against the Protestants, and the very next year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as before) God again gave up the <hi>French</hi> Army to the slaughter of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> at the Siege and Battel of S. <hi>Quintins,</hi> in which were above three thousand slain upon the place, and many of them men of note, and soon after the Town was taken by Storm: Also <hi>Annas</hi> Duke <hi>de Memorancy</hi> himself, the Constable of <hi>France:</hi> The Marshal of S. <hi>Andrew:</hi> the Duke of <hi>Longevile, Gaspar de Coligne,</hi> Earl of <hi>Castilion</hi> and Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> and a number others of the great Peers were all taken Prisoners. In sum, the loss and slaughter was so great, and fatal to the <hi>French,</hi> as it well-near equalled that Victory obtained by the Duke of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Pavia</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> against <hi>Francis</hi> the first, his Father. Yet <hi>Henry</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:60924:47"/>
the Second still shut his eyes against the cause of these losses, and having his heart cauterized by his Lusts, he not only caused the godly to be committed to the Flames, but himself would needs be a Spectator of their Torments as a pleasing sight, and had combined with <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> his new Son in Law, for the utter ruine and final subversion of <hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, but a few hours before his Death, <hi>Anno</hi> 1559. <hi>Lodovick Faber,</hi> and <hi>Annas Burgus,</hi> two Senators of <hi>Paris,</hi> because they had spoken a little freely in defence of the innocency and piety of the Protestants in the open Senate, were cast into Prison by his special Command, in the <hi>Bastile</hi> of the same City, by <hi>Gabriel</hi> Earl of <hi>Mongomery,</hi> one of the Captains of his Guard. And the persecution of all others of the same Profession grew so hot and furious: when the King <hi>June</hi> the nine and twentieth, the same year, running at Tilt with the very same Earl of <hi>Mongomery,</hi> and near the very <hi>Bastile</hi> where the said Senators were Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, was struck with a splinter of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery</hi>'s Spear, through the Eye into his Brain, and never had the happiness to speak one word after, though he survived the wound a few days; Nor to acknowledge
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60924:47"/>
his former Lust and Cruelty.</p>
               <p n="148">148. And if we farther look to Gods Hand that followed this Prince in his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, it will yet seem the greater miracle. For of five Sons that he had, all save one dyed without lawful Issue to survive them, ad three of them by violent Deaths, and in his Posterity ended the <hi>Valetian</hi> Line, the Crown thereupon devolving to the Royal Branch of <hi>Cleremont,</hi> commonly called <hi>Bourbon,</hi> whom his Sons had most bitterly hated and persecuted. And of all his five Daughters, three dyed issueless, and the eldest (the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) that had Issue was cut off by poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Nay, his very Bastard Son, <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Engolism,</hi> a great Actor in the <hi>Parisian</hi> Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre, perished also by the stab of <hi>Philip Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tovit,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> his old and mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1586. during the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, his Brother.</p>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60924:48"/>
and dyed less miserably. But he had scarce raigned two years in Peace and Plenty, when <hi>Katherine de Medices,</hi> his Mother (desiring to get the Regency into her own Hands by raising combustions in the Kingdom) perswaded this her Son to revive those Persecutions against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants which his Father had begun. She also reconciled Her self to <hi>Charles Lorainer,</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> whom a little before she had feared and hated, being a secret Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Lewis de Cleremont,</hi> Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.</hi> He and the Marshal of S. <hi>Andrew</hi> having gained <hi>Annas Momorancy,</hi> Constable of <hi>France</hi> to their party, they all conspired together for the ruine of the Truth. The Protestants in the mean time, seeing the King in his minority, held (as it were) captivated by this <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> took up Arms by the Queen-Mothers own insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, to maintain the Kings Edict of Pacification, which was published <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1561. commonly called, <hi>The Edict of January.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The year following, by the instigation of the said <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> not only the Queen-Mother, but <hi>Anthony de Cleremont,</hi> King of <hi>Navar</hi> also (who yet dyed a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant) was drawn on to assail those of the

Religion with open force, they in the mean time filling the Queen-Mothers ear with these vain Flatteries, that she should soon see the utter ruine of all the <hi>Hereticks</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> From which time that goodly, rich, peaceable, and flourishing Kingdom, for almost forty years together (some short pauses excepted) was filled with Cruelties, Ravages, Ravishments, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Battles, Fires, Slaughters, and all other calamities that attend a civil War: In the end of all which, the Protestants being increased in their strength and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, obtained a more firm and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious peace than ever they had before: whereas those three incendiaries who had been the Authors of all these miseries, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished within a few years after, by the just Judgment of God in the very act when they were pursuing the godly party. For the Marshal of S. <hi>Andrew</hi> was slain in the Battle of <hi>Dreux: Annas de Momorancy</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the very walls of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Francis Lorainer,</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> was pistoled by <hi>John Poltrot</hi> whilest he besieged <hi>Orleans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> seeing that by open force he could not eradicate and destroy the truth, nor root out the Professors of it, about two years before the hellish Massacre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun

at <hi>Paris,</hi> and prosecuted (to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual infamy of <hi>France</hi>) in diverse other Cities, held a secret Council in the Castle of <hi>Blois,</hi> with <hi>Katherine de Medices,</hi> his Mother, <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Hercules</hi> (called also <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi>) his Brothers, and <hi>Henry Lorainer,</hi> Heir to the said Duke <hi>Francis</hi> aforementioned, by what means they might best draw the Protestants into their toil to murther and destroy them.

               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> himself never saw good day after this bloody Massacre, though the <hi>Court-Sycophants</hi> had promised him that it should prove the first happy day of his absolute Monarchy. For though he had been long drenched in Lust (a sin sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom separated from a Persecutor) by his ordinary Adultery with a mean Wench of <hi>Orleance,</hi> of whom he begat <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golism,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Auvern:</hi> And though he had been trained up by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to see the slaughter of Beasts; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in his Chases had been accustomed to bath his hands in the Blood of the slain Game (which might have served to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie his Conscience, as they did inflame his fierce and cruel nature, yet) a very stinging remorse in his Conscience, did ever pursue and haunt him after that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless slaughter, brought about, chiefly by his own swearing and forswearing, (by which the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Coligni</hi> were deceived) His eyes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rolled up and down uncertainly in the Day-time with fear and suspition, and his sleep was usually interrupted in the night with dismal Dreams and Apparitions (like
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60924:50"/>
our King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third of <hi>England</hi> after he had murthered his two Nephews in the Tower) Nay, though he survived that Massacre not fully two years, yet had he in that time plotted the death of the said <hi>Henry,</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> and the removal of the Queen-Mother, and her Instruments from the Helm of State: But as he, a little before the Massacre had poisoned that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Princess for Learning and Piety, <hi>Joan,</hi> Queen of <hi>Navar:</hi> So did his Mother, or the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> (by way of prevention, or anticipation) minister to him his fatal sharp <hi>Phisick,</hi> of which (after many and grievous torments) he deceased upon <hi>Whitsunday, Anno Christi</hi> 1574. being not full twenty five years old.</p>

The Queen-Mother, the Kings two Brethren, the Cardinal, and the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> that had not only joined with him in his Persecution, but encouraged him to it, they still survived, and for ought men saw, were firmly setled in Peace and Prosperity: Though <hi>Guise</hi> might have taken warning by the Death of <hi>Claude,</hi> Duke of <hi>Aumal,</hi> his Brother, slain with a Musket-Bullet from the walls of <hi>Rochel,</hi>

But his Mother advised him by all means to root out the Professors of the truth by Fire and Sword. And others there were of loose and <hi>Atheistical</hi> Lives, as <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Guise; Lewis</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Guise; Renalt Villoclare</hi> (A man, saith the incomparable Monsieur <hi>de Thou,</hi> fatally preferr'd to be an attendant upon this King by his Mother) and diverse others, who perswaded the King to break the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60924:51"/>
Edicts for Pacification, and never to sheath his Sword till he had utterly ruined all the Protestants in <hi>France:</hi> And the King, being of a weak, and degenerate Spirit, the House of <hi>Guise</hi> (being the Arch-ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Gospel) became at length so potent, and triumphed so notoriously over the impotency of the King, that at last they forced him to seek to those very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants for support, against whom he had taken a Solemn Oath for their utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>Infinite almost were the Treasures which he spent upon his Minions and Pleasures (His expenses upon his Dogs only, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in those times to twenty thousand pounds yearly at the least) but most was exhausted in the prosecution of his Wars against the Protestants.</p>
               <p n="152">152. <hi>Guise,</hi> and his Faction now grown strong, and assured of support from King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain,</hi> after he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled his King out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and heaped a world of other insolent affronts upon him, was drawn by him, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 1588. to the Assembly then held at <hi>Blois.</hi> He came thither with his Brother <hi>Lewis Lorainer,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> Prince of <hi>Ionvile,</hi> his Son, upon the same Royal As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60924:51"/>
of safety, with which <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, had (by his advise) deceived the Protestants before the abhorred Massacre in the year 1572. But during this Assembly this Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> was slain, against the <hi>Publick Faith</hi> given him, not only within the Castle of <hi>Blois,</hi> but in that very room, wherein sixteen years before he had advised the bloody Massacre of <hi>Paris</hi> to be executed. Two circumstances also do add much hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to the punishment it self: One was that he was but newly risen from the bed of his adulterate Lust, having not been able before this night, to conquer the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity of a Gentlewoman that waited on the Queen-Mother: and therefore was so eager in reaping the fruits of his long Siege, that he came not to the Council Chamber, till he was oft sent for, and even then scarcely ready: The other was in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his first wound, which was given him in his Throat, and immediately caused the Blood so abundantly to stream out of his Mouth, as he never had time so much as to call upon God for mercy or forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but spent his last minute in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to revenge himself upon his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</p>
               <p n="153">153. A while after the Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi>

his Brother (who had been a great Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster at Cards and Dice; perished also in the same Castle of <hi>Blois</hi> by a violent Death. <hi>Katherine de Medices,</hi> the Queen-Mother, who had been the chief cause for thirty years together of the shedding of so much innocent Blood, being present at the same time in the said Castle, stormed secretly that so great an action should be entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and effected without her advice: And when she heard that <hi>Charles Lorainer,</hi> Duke of <hi>Main</hi> was escaped, (being the younger Brother to the murthered Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>) she presaged to the King her Son, the sad Issue of that rash attempt, which he (as it seems) interpreting to be rather the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of her wishes than her fears; and having by many woful experiences, seen the effects of her revengful <hi>Italian</hi> Spirit, took a course to pacify her wrath: For not long after, she there ended her unhappy Life, by poison (saith <hi>Elias Reusner</hi>) in the same Castle also, where she held the first secret and bloody Council for the execution of the aforesaid bloody Massacre. <hi>Francis</hi> her youngest Son dyed before her, <hi>June</hi> the tenth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1584. in the one and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of his Age, of a violent poison, probably ministred to him by some of the

                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:60924:53"/>This <hi>Assasination</hi> was promoted by <hi>Pope Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, by the seditious Sermons of <hi>Jesuits, Priests,</hi> and <hi>Friars,</hi> and by the persecution of <hi>Katherine Mary,</hi> Duchess of <hi>Mompensier,</hi> Sister of the slain Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who was so horribly transported with malice against the Protestants, and with desire of revenge upon the King, as she prostitued her Body to that <hi>Jesuited Goat,</hi> to encourage him the more to that horrid murther, and by that means to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pify and harden his Soul by his filthy Lust, that it might not startle at any other wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness whatsoever. Yet as this King some Months before his Death had altered his former bloody resolution against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants; so did the Divine Providence at his Death afford him some hours of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, after the bloody knife had been sheathed in his Belly; in which time he acknowledged his sin, and his error in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been so long miss-lead by his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and malicious Counsellors, and his sin in having persecuted his Protestant Subjects, and for having enforced the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of many to submit to <hi>Popery</hi> against the known Truth by threats and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

his Liege Lord, and Cousin German, pressed the new King (whose broken Title needed the supportments of his Prelates) to use his temporal Sword for the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Disciples of <hi>John Wickliff,</hi> whose numbers at that time were so encreased that they even filled the Kingdom: The King assented. and having by their cruel insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, shed the blood of many of Gods Saints, his Reign proved neither long nor prosperous.</p>

The Arch-Bishop thereupon renews his former Suit to the Son, as he had before successfully pressed upon the Father. In particular, he first aimed at the destruction of Sir <hi>John Old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle (See his Life in my second Volume of Lives)</hi> who had most affronted him. He, by reason of his great Alliances, and the favour of his King, who called him <hi>His Knight,</hi> might have expected exemption from their Tyranny: But they prevailed with the King (as saith Arch-Bishop <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>) <hi>Rex virum clarum, sibique familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rissimum, Episcoporum potestati, &amp; carnisioinae</hi>

                  <hi>permisit:</hi> The King gave up this famous man, and who was dear to himself, to the power, and destruction of the Bishops: And yet it pleased God that he outlived this persecuting Arch-Prelate two years at least. For the Arch-Bishop having mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered many godly Saints in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourths time, and being a great stickler in state affairs, having long before procured himself to be made Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> and lastly (in a <hi>Synod</hi> held by himself at <hi>Rochester</hi>) having forbidden the reading of the Scriptures in <hi>English,</hi> and limited Preachers, under an heavy censure, what they should treat of in the Pulpit, was soon cut off himself by the immediate hand of God, after he had condemned that warlike Kinght, Sir <hi>John Old-Castle,</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> before he could see him exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. For his Tongue was so swoln, and benummed that he could neither swallow, nor speak, some days before his Death: It being (saith one) the just Judgment of God upon him (and may be a warning to all other wicked <hi>Popish Prelates</hi>) that as he had muzled up the mouths of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and kept the Scriptures from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the people, being their spiritual food. So he should neither be able to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60924:56"/>
swallow nor speak, from that very minute that this Judgment fell upon him, and so he dyed within a few days after, in great torment, and extremity, by a languishing silence and famishment.</p>
               <p>A later Example we have in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable punishment of <hi>James Beton,</hi> Arch-Bishop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> who was also a member of the purpurated <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> He had for diverse years been an inveterate Enemy to the Gospel, and the Professors of it in that Kingdom under King <hi>James</hi> the Fifth: And after his Death, taking the advantage of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> the Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Queen of that Realm, he thought it a work worthy of himself, to double die his Purple Robes in the Blood of the Saints: And to make a full and clear way for that his sanguinary Project, he forged a <hi>Will</hi> of the deceased King, whereby he was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished the chief Regent there, during the young Ladies incapacity to Reign: From which yet, his false play being discovered, he was removed, and for a while impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned: Yet was he no sooner delivered, but he presently endeavoured to raise a new and a fatal war between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to root out the Professors of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60924:56"/>
the Truth by a violent and bloody Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution. And among others whom he cited, imprisoned, or exiled in the year 1545. he seized upon Mr. <hi>George Wiseheart</hi> (a very eloquent and learned Preacher) who by the <hi>Latin</hi> writers of that age is called <hi>Sophocardius,</hi> and contrary to their own <hi>Popish</hi> Canons, adjudged him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent death himself, which is never done, except by the hellish Inquisition of <hi>Spain,</hi> but by delivering the Martyrs into the power of the Civil-Magistrate; And in his Court before the Castle of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> caused that bloody Sentence to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the said Mr. <hi>Wiseheart</hi> being first strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and his Body afterwards burnt to Ashes; The Cardinal in the mean time had a Chamber prepared for him, with Carpets and Cushions in the Windows, out of which he was a Triumphant Spectator of this godly mans Martyrdom: From which window he departed, not more delighted, than (as himself thought) secured; and presently he began to fortify his Castle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Assaults.</p>
               <p>But Gods Judgment from Eternity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded against him, for this later, as well as former cruelties exercised upon his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants, slep'd not. For within a few

was afterwards executed at <hi>Clermont</hi> in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne:</hi> And if <hi>Mormieu</hi> escaped a shameful end, yet surely he deserved it as well as his Fellow Persecutor, having before (as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus</hi> confesseth) procured the murther of his own Father?</p>
               <p>At <hi>Tholous</hi> also, a few days after, a great slaughter of the godly was committed; not by the better sort of Citizens, or sober, or morally virtuous <hi>Papists;</hi> but by one <hi>Turry,</hi> and a number of other infamous, and lewd persons like himself, who joined themselves together for the effecting of that bloody execution.</p>
               <p>The like Villany was perpetrated and done at the great City of <hi>Roan</hi> in <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> by one <hi>Maronie,</hi> a most infamous Ruffian, and a great many of other base Varlets, who flocked to him as to their chief Ringleader.</p>
               <p n="168">168. But in none of them were these two hellish sins of Adultery and Blood more eminently coupled together than in <hi>Paygillard,</hi> the Master Butcher at <hi>Angiers,</hi> who having long continued in the sin of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, was at last enticed by his Harlot, to murther his own wife.</p>
               <p n="169">169. In <hi>France,</hi> after this barbarous and cruel Massacre, the eighth day of <hi>November</hi> following, there appeared a dreadful Comet,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60924:59"/>
concerning which, a Learned Protestant, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after published an elaborate <hi>Poem,</hi> wherein he presaged, that it was Gods He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald or Messenger to denounce his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment quickly to ensue upon that Kingdom for their late inhumane Butcheries. These Verses were scarcely come abroad, when there suddenly broke out in <hi>Poictou,</hi> a new, dreadful, and before unknown Disease, commonly called <hi>the PoictovinChollick,</hi> which miserably wasted that goodly Kingdom for above thirty years after. This Disease was accompanied with many extreme pains and torments, not only in the outward Parts of the Body, but also in the inward and Vitals, insomuch as it drew on diverse horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, and in many, blindness before it killed them. The strange Original, the hidden nature, and those unparallel'd tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which it produced, sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the very stabs, and gashes made with Swords, and Ponyards, gave all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial judgments just ground to conclude, that it was the finger of God himself in punishing the merciless Murthers of his Dear Saints.</p>
               <p n="170">170. But though the brutish, goatish <hi>Papists</hi> were so cruel and inhumane, yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there were of more moral and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

Princiciples, who in their very Souls abhorred and detested those barbarous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. Monsieur <hi>de Thou</hi> in his unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>History tells us, that himself was about nineteen years old when that horrible and Hellish Massacre was committed in <hi>Paris</hi> on S. <hi>Bartholomews Day,</hi> which fell out that year on the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> and did in his very soul abhor the cruelty and savageness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, when in his passage through the streets to <hi>Mattins</hi> that Morning, he met with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Villains, dragging along the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Hierom Grolet,</hi> late Governour of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance,</hi> all weltring with gastly wounds in his own Blood: At which sight his Heart relenting, and mourning inwardly, not daring to shed tears publickly, he hastened home to the House of <hi>Christopher de Thou,</hi> his Father, who at that time was the chief Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of the Parliament in <hi>Paris,</hi> there free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deplore that execrable Butchery; as did also the said <hi>Christopher,</hi> his Father.</p>
               <p n="171">171. <hi>Vidus Faber Pibratius, John Mervil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Belleureu,</hi> all eminent men, with all the judicious, and morally virtuous <hi>Papists</hi> in that City, did Christianly hide, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served many Protestants from a wretchless massacring.

               <p>At the City of <hi>Lions</hi> also, where the inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of the Murtherers almost equalled that of <hi>Paris, Mandelot</hi> the Governor there, did his best to have prevented it, and in his Heart (with many other grave and sober Gitizens of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion) utterly detested it. And when the slaughtered Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that were tumbled into the River of <hi>Rosne,</hi> were carried down with the stream to <hi>Tornou, Valence, Vienne,</hi> and <hi>Burg,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to the same River, the <hi>Papists</hi> there, generally detested the cruelty thereof: And at <hi>Arles,</hi> where for want of Springs, and Ponds they had most use of that River wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet they so much abhorred that Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, as they would neither drink thereof, nor yet eat any of the Fish taken therein, for diverse days after: And generally in all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> those of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion drew the mangled Bodies out of the water, and with great humanity interred them.</p>

that Persecution hath never been a way to suppress the Truth; and surely its against the Dictates of Charity and Christianity to enforce the conscience without a full and clear conviction.

in the same words did the Lord <hi>Brederode,</hi> and the other Protestants in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> alledge for their just excuse in their joint <hi>Apology,</hi> published in the year 1566, and farther added: That if the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> did conceive their Religion to be the Truth, they should instead of Blood, Fines, Imprisonings, and Banishments, take the good, and seasonable counsel of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and try a while, whether the Protestants separation from them, were of God or no.
