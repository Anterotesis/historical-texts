         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> if we grant the world had a beginning, then was God idle euer before, but that is abſurd, therefore it was not created, but was eternall. We may anſwer them firſt, that the rule which they harpe vpon in this argument, namely that <hi>Perfectiſsima cauſa non eſt otioſa</hi>: the moſt perfect cauſe is not idle, <hi>Non eſt vera dea gentibus voluntariis,</hi> is not true of ſuch things as worke by will, or willingly, as the moſt excellent Carpenter may forbeare his worke and action a time. If they thinke that God was alone, therein they ſhew themſelues carnall and ſpeake carnally. For how ſhould he be alone more then, then now, vnto whome all things are preſent, though they be future, and things that are not as if they were. <hi>Hierom</hi> vpon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on citeth that ſaying of <hi>Scipio. <hi>Nunquam minus ſolus qùam cum maxime ſolus.</hi>
               </hi> Neuer leſſe alone then when I am moſt alone. And cannot this be true much more of God, that he is not alone without theſe creatures which he made. Could he ſay it when his countrey was loſt, his wife and children, freends and louers, that yet all his good was with him, and cannot the Lord ſay it much more, that his good ſtandeth not in the preſence of creatures, but before euer they were, and now that they are, yet all his is with him without them? Chriſt ſayth, <hi>hee is not alone,</hi>

            <p>Secondly they reaſon thus. The moouer &amp; the thing mooued, be relatiues, and the one ſuppoſeth the other. But God the moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was euer, therefore the thing mooued, to wit the world. But we anſwer them to this alſo truly, that if there be a moouer actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, then there muſt needes alſo be a thing mooued. But God though he were from euerlaſting himſelfe, yet did he not actually mooue in reſpect of theſe outward creatures, which are without his eſſence, but onely was <hi>Mouens potentia.</hi> It is farre differing therefore to ſpeake of one as was ſaid before, that worketh by wil and freely, &amp; to ſpeake of a thing that worketh naturally, &amp; it is no abſurditie to ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the relation betwixt the firſt cauſe &amp; the world made, began in time, ſince the creation of the world is an outward action of God, &amp; voluntary. The very ſame anſwer may be made vnto the rule, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cauſe is, the effect is, the cauſe eternal, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the effect, to wit, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. For this holdeth in natural things alſo, that worke naturally &amp; neceſſarily, but not in things y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke freely &amp; willingly, as God did in creating. Otherwiſe euery houſe muſt be as ancient as the Carpenter that made it. No the relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe &amp; the effect, beginneth in time after, becauſe he is a voluntary cauſe, &amp; ſo is it with God. Silly then &amp; ſlack are theſe concluſions you euidently ſee, and far from demonſtrations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly they reaſon thus. That which hath no alteration, is not ſubiect to generation or corruption: The heauen hath no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations for thus many thouſand yeares none haue beene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued. Therefore it is not ſubiect to generation to be made, or corruption, to ceaſe to be. Therefore it is eternall. We aunſwer,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:922:8"/>
that all though it might be truly ſayde, that many partes of the world are ſubiect to alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as the aire, the water, the earth, &amp;c, and conſequently the whole not perpetuall, whoſe parts be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Yet with diuinitie we rather ſay, that <hi>Generatio phyſica,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall generation and creation be two things, and differ much: ſo do <hi>Corruptio phyſica,</hi> naturall corruption and violent deſtruction, which a renuing ſhal follow. Therefore although neither genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor corruption can be without alteration, yet things may be created that haue no alterations, as Angels, ſtars, ſoules. And by diuine power celeſtiall bodies may be deſtroyed, or at leaſt chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and renued according to the ſaying: Heauen and earth ſhall paſſe, and againe: They all ſhall waxe old as doth a garment, &amp;c. Behold I create a new heauen, and new earth, and with ſuch like. For the argument then it may be granted, that albeit the world was not <hi>Genitus,</hi> generated, as I may ſay, yet it was created by God of nothing, and ſo their purpoſe faileth for all this cauill alſo.</p>
            <p>Fourthly they ſay, Time is eternall, therefore <hi>motus,</hi> moouing: for time is the meaſure of moouing: &amp; if motion, then a thing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, to wit, the world, &amp;c. For anſwer wherevnto, firſt the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence may be denyed: for time is not onely taken as philoſophy taketh it, for meaſure of moouing, according to firſt and later. But ſometime it is put ſimply and abſolutely for the continuance of a thing, though it be not the meaſure of the motion of the ſame. So may we call eternitie, and that infinite continuance, that I may ſo ſpeake of God, who hath bin from euerlaſting. But this is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, for indeed the maner that hath taken place in ſchooles, is to call time the meaſure of mouing. Now <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> not able by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall wit, to ſee rightly what difference was betwixt time &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, or what maner of continuance eternitie was, iudged time to be eternall, becauſe he ſaw an eternitie of a moouer: which is not ſo, for there may be a mouer eternall, to wit, God, albeit no <hi>motus corporis mobilis</hi>: for God is not <hi>corpus mobile,</hi> as the parts of the world are, &amp; as philoſophie meaneth. Now <hi>Tempus eſt menſura motus corporis mobilis non dei,</hi> according to Philoſophy. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touching the antecedent, that time is eternall, it may truly alſo be denyed. And for that which is vſually brought to prooue it, that it began with the firſt moouer in ſome moment or poynte
<pb facs="tcp:922:9"/>
of time, which point being a coniunction of paſſed and future, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth a point paſſed, and ſo an other infinitely: it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that euery point of time is not a continuer &amp; ioiner of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and future, but it is alſo ſometime <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, amending of time, whether it be at the beginning or ending, for as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the point in the line is not euer a continuer of the ſame line, ioyning that which followeth after, to that which went before, but alſo a certaine thing both beginning and ending the line: So in time, there is <hi>Nunc initians,</hi> a beginning, and an inſtant, or a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that beginneth with the thing, as when the world tooke his beginning, then began alſo ſuch an inſtant or preſent, there is alſo <hi>Nunc continuans,</hi> a continuing pointe, which is properly called time, becauſe <hi>Tempus est fluxio à priori ad poſterius,</hi> a going from the firſt to the later, and at laſt there ſhall be <hi>Nunc terminans,</hi> an ending point, to wit, the end of the world now thus created, moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing. Nothing therefore helpeth this argument, to prooue an eternitie of the world, more then the reſt did. Many mo might be alleadged to this purpoſe, but no better then theſe, and I iudge neither theſe nor them very pleaſant to ſuch as I ſpecially labour to profit, becauſe they conceiue not ſuch conſequences. Wherefore I cut them off, and this onely I commend vnto you to be thought of. It is impoſſible euen by the Philoſophers owne rules that there ſhould be mo infinites then one. Now God is one infinite, therefore nothing els in heauen or earth beſide. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is elſe it had a beginning, and many things ſhall haue an ending alſo. The reſt by his power ſhall haue an eternitie giuen them to continue not of themſelues.</p>

This goodly argument is eaſely aunſwered, by ſaying, hee can and will not, and yet not enuiouſe therein, but good and carefull for man, that he might by ſight of contrary euill better diſcerne the good, and ſo profit thereby both in wiſedome and thankefulneſſe to the Lorde. <hi>Lactantius</hi> whoſe Chapter is very worthy reading.</p>

This the figure, that the fulfilling of it in truth, and hee remayning for euer <hi>a Prieſt after the order of this Melchiſedech,</hi> the truth of this figure, that is an vnbloudie Sacrifice, vnder the ſignes of bread and wyne, muſt alſo euer remayne, &amp;c. Wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere them firſt, that foraſmuch as the Apoſtle ſo fully diſcuſſing this compariſon betwixt Chriſt and <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> maketh no mention of any ſuch Sacrifice, it beeing yet as themſelues ſay, the chiefeſt poynt of the compariſon. Too much to blame are they, that they ſhame not to obtrude vnto the Apoſtle ſuch an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne Myſterie, and to ſupply of theyr owne what he directed by the ſpirit of God quite left out and neuer mencioned. If they denye this conſequence, to wit, from the Apoſtles ſilence or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the nullitie of the thing, wee tell them it is moſt ſtrong by vertue of a rule in diuinitie which they ſhall neuer improue whilſt they lyue.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>A rule touching types and figures.</hi>
               </note> The rule is this. Of types and figures of the olde Teſtament, ſo farre onely and neuer further may a doctrine be eſtabliſhed, as the ſame types and figures by expreſſe and plaine words of the Apoſtles ſhall be expounded and interpreted. For if euery man might expound them as he thought good, varietie of allegories moſt vncertaine and doubtfull ſhould ouerthrowe all truth amongſt vs. If therefore any reliefe for the Maſſe muſt be had from this fact of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> needes of neceſſitie they muſt bring ſome place of the new Teſtament where it is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded: otherwiſe they play but with allegories of their owne making, and their ſpeech may bee tearmed allegoricall, but not theologicall. For that fulneſſe of perſwaſion and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is in Diuinitie, ſtayeth not vpon allegoricall deuiſes, except they be warranted by God himſelfe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly where as they ſaye <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> offred heere bread and wyne to God, we vtterly deny it, and referre our ſelues to the words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> wherein is not any ſuch matter. The text is <hi>protulit,</hi> not <hi>obtulit, <hi>he brought forth bread and wyne</hi>,</hi> not he offred bread and wyne. Except to bring forth were to offer and ſacrifice, which it cannot be. And that knewe euen that olde Tranſlator whome they make ſuch accompt of, and thereupon tranſlated the Hebrue word to bring forth, not to offer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:922:58"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, if we ſhould graunt all they ſeeke, to wit, that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred bread and wine (as God forbid we ſhould ſo be-lye the texte) yet would it not folow what they deſire. For how hang theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was a figure of Chriſt, and <hi>offred bread &amp; wine</hi> to God. Therefore Chriſt in his holy Supper offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnbluddely to God the Father for vs, which alſo is done ſtill in the Maſſe. Conſider of it, is there any ſequele in the world in it? may we not aſwell conclude, that Chriſt ought to be offred dayly vnder the ſignes of Lambes, of turtle Doues, young Pigeons, Goates, and Calues, and many ſuch things, becauſe once theſe things were offered, as they, that hee muſt bee offred vnder bread and wine, becauſe bread and wine were offred by <hi>Melchiſedech?</hi> Surely thoſe burnt offrings of the law, did far far more liuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble and expreſſe the future ſacrifice of Chriſt, then the offring of any bread could: for in them was ſuffring, dying, ſhedding of bloud, and a being ſlaine and killed, which is not in bread, and therefore if anye ſhould remaine to ſuch an ende as the Papiſts would, rather they ſhould remaine then the ſignes of bread and Wine.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Againe, if this offring of <hi>Melchiſedechs</hi> were a figure of Chriſt, either Chriſt hath fulfilled it or not, if he haue not, then was
not all finiſhed as he ſayd, which God forbid, and if hee haue then being fulfilled, why ſhould it not ceaſe, as all other figures doo of the ould Teſtament: ſhall the figure and the truthe ſtand both at once? It is ſtraunge diuinitie: nay the contrary is true, and ſound diuinitie, to wit, that Chriſt hauing vpon the Croſſe, with his own oblation of himſelfe, ended and determined all figures, vſed to ſhow his comming, this alſo if as they take it, a figure of him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded likewiſe, and finiſhed, and taken away.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Yet further let theſe men conſider their abſurdities againſt themſelues: for if their Maſſe leane vpon this fact of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech,</hi> their tranſubſtantiation is quite gone, for that which <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> offred (if he offered as they ſay) was not any figure or bare ſhow and accidents of bread and wine, but bread indeed, and Wine indeede, the ſubſtance there aſwell as the accidents, and therefore if that was any figure of the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, then muſt that ſacrifice be bread and wine indeed, as that was. Againe
<pb facs="tcp:922:59"/>

               <hi>2</hi> Obſerue wee the oportunitie of this <hi>Viſion,</hi> when it was.

He was a ſtranger and they at home, hee but a few, they of great power, alyance, and kindred, howe ſhould it bee, but they would combine together to deſtroye him, and neuer put vp and digeſt what he had doone to them. This multiplied in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> minde, as all feare will, and gaue him many a ſecret gripe, that all the world felt not ſo well as hee. But behould a gracious God, a deare and tender father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that neuer ſlumbreth nor ſleepeth when his be in agonies and perplexities.

Let it euer then be one of our notes, in reading the word, how fitly, in reſpect of time and neede, God comforteth his, and let vs know, that he is one and the ſame, for euer, to all that put their truſt in him.

Therefore needes it muſt be, that the wicked eate the body and drinke the bloud of Chriſt. which they coulde not doe except they were there really, for by faith they can not eate that are voyde of faith. Therefore there is a reall preſence by tranſubſtantiation. When all this in very deede prooueth no more then euidently we ſee in this place, namely, that God attributeth the abuſe of the ſigne to the thing ſignified, ſaying, <hi rend="margQuotes">that becauſe the wicked come vnreuerently and vnpreparedly to thoſe holy ſignes, and receyue them vngolilie wythout fayth, therefore they ſhall bee guiltie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of the body and blood it ſelfe,</hi> that is, euen as guiltie by abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſigne, as if they had abuſed the thing ſignified it ſelfe: for the contempt of the one redoundeth vnto the other.

No more proouing hereby that the ſignes are chaunged and become really the thing it ſelfe, than here it is to bee prooued that circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was really the couenaunt it ſelfe, becauſe it is ſayde, hee that omitteth the one, breaketh the other.

By which wee may firſt note the neede of comfort in reſpect of weakeneſſe that the beſt men haue ſometime, for God did not thus cheere vp <hi>Iacob</hi> for no cauſe.

There is male and female of it: that is, two ſorts, differing in greatneſſe both of roote, leafe, and fruite, which commonly men call after this ſort. The fruite of the female as is written, in qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie like a Cheſnut or Wallnut. The Aple of the male, as great as an Egge: the roote forked as man is: the ſmell of it very paſſing pleaſant: for the force of it to worke loue, I leaue it to others to iuſtifie, that ſo write of it. For the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of it, eyther of roote or apple, in helping barrennes in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which ſeemeth to be aſcribed to it by theſe ſiſters here, (they contending ſo about it) happily it is not generall. For the Hearbe being very could, cannot haue that effect in all bodyes, but rather the contrarie in ſome, namely in cold. But in hote countreys, as in Affrike, Spaine, Italy, Egipt, and ſuch like, where the bodies are commonly of extraordinary heate, this may be vſed to bring them to ſome good temperature, and conſequently, if God will, to more fruitefulneſſe, immoderate heate being an enemie to conception, aſwell as immoderate cold is. But as I ſaye, I leaue theſe things to Phiſitions.

God forbid: and this is all that God doth heere. If you ſay, O but the meanes ſeemeth cunning. I pray you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether man be to apoynt Gods meanes or no, ſaying thus ſhalt thou effect thy will, &amp; not otherwiſe. If not, then both leaue Gods bleſſing for the cattell, and liking of the meanes free to his owne wiſedome, and take euer his will to be a rule moſt ſure of all right. Then is it a queſtion whether this was miraculous, or naturall, or mixt, partly miraculous, and partly by nature, and it is concluded that it was mixt, it being nothing preiudiciall to the power of God to vſe a meanes, although euer hee doth not, but ſometime with, &amp; ſometimes without. Without meanes the Lord wrought when he gaue Manna to the Iſraelites, when he deuided <hi>Iordan,</hi> when he made <hi>Aarons</hi> rod to bud, and ſuch like. So hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſt many other by the power of his word, without any meanes.

This was euer alowed of Philoſophers, Phiſitions, and all learned, and examples many related in authors of the ſame. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> telleth an experience of a woman that had a moſt faire childe, neither her ſelf nor huſband being ſo.

            <p n="20">
               <hi>20</hi> There is another queſtion in this place yet, and that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time when <hi>Iacob</hi> layde the rods in. And ſome haue ſaide he obſerued a time of the day, namely the morning, and not the euening, others a time of the yeare, as about September, that they might Lambe about Marche, and not at Marche, that they might bring forth about September. The latter is better., and more agreeable to the text: yet they that houlde the firſt, would ſeeme to relye much vpon the benefit of ſleepe, which hath gone before. As if by reaſon thereof, the morning ſhould be better both for a ſtronger conception, and alſo for a more quicke affectation of the power imaginatiue. What is true we may thinke of, if we will, and that is this: The moſt kinde of creatures (that bee for mans vſe) ſleepe in the night, and feede and labour in the daye, Therfore the morning generation is after ſleepe and before meat, the euening, after meate and before ſleepe. Wherefore in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſeede is better concocted, and the braine wherein the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is more quick, free, and cleere. For ſleepe eſpecially fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth concoction, riddeth away the vapors of the braine, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vigor and ſtrength, to ſenſe and motion. Therefore the ſeede by reaſon of better concoction, is more fruitefull, and the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue vertue by means of the late refection of the ſpirits by ſleep, and clearing of the braine, more forcible and effectuall. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, at night the meate lying vnconcocted, the head is charged with thicke vapours from the ſtomack, and the imagination wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed with long watching. And ſo conſequently, the ſeed neither ſo fruitefull and ſtrong, neither the imagination ſo effectually moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and ſmitten as in the morning. But as I ſayd, it is better to referre <hi>Iacobs</hi> deed, to the ſtronger and better parts of the yeare, which he carefully obſeruing, to laye or not laye the roddes before the ſheepe, hee had both moe and more ſtrong, <hi>Laban</hi> fewer and weaker. And this I hope may ſuffice, both for this place and this Chapter.</p>

               <hi>wraſtled</hi> with him, &amp; did not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpect the ſecond meanes.

Fiftly, it is ſaid, that <hi>God ſaw how he could not preuaile againſt Iacob,</hi> which noteth not ſo much ſtrength in <hi>Iacob</hi> as mercy in God euer kinde and full of mercy.

               </note> is his wil not, for loue that he hath vnto his children, and liking to be euen ouercome by their faith. Sixtly, he touched the holow of <hi>Iacobs</hi> thigh and it was looſed, ſo that <hi>Iacob</hi> haulted. Whereby we may ſee how the godly wreſtle with temptations in this life and ouercome, ſurely <hi>ſic vincunt vt vulnerentur,</hi> ſo they ouercome, that yet now and then they get rappes, and wipes. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was a notable wreſtler, yet ſinful fleſh gaue him a foule venye or two, though he roſe againe like a good wreſtler by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and had the victorie againſt that fall. So all the godly by one imperfection or other, we ſee they get wipes, though in the end all is well by the ſtrength of him that gat no rappe vnto ſinne, Chriſt our dear ſauiour &amp; true ouercommer. Seuenthly, that the Lord ſaith to <hi>Iacob Let me go,</hi> it wonderfully commendeth <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> tollerance of the Lords wreſtlings, till himſelfe gaue euer and would depart: and to vs it giueth this doctrine, that when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

vppon vs then hee will make vs able to beare: but giue the iſſue with the temptation in due time to his glory and our good. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hee will not let him go except he bleſſe him:</hi> It teacheth vs to be ſtrong in the Lord when ſoeuer we are tried, and euen ſo hartie and comfortable, that wee as it were compell the Lord to bleſſe vs ere hee go, that is, by his mercifull ſweetnes to comfort our hearts, and to make vs more and more confirmed in all vertue and obedience towardes him, yelding vs our praier as farre as it may any way ſtand with the ſame, with force and violence as it were offered on our partes to the Lord, he highly eſteemeth and richly rewardeth euermore.

The daungers of wife, children and friendes, and now our ſafetie and deliuerance from all our feares, our qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſitting vnder our owne Vines, without noyſe of Drumme, ſound of Trumpet, neying of Horſes, roaring of Canon, clat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of Armour, cries of the ſlaine by day and by night. For this hath the Lord done for vs, and whatſoeuer it is in our eyes, ſurely it is wonderfull euen through the world. All nations ſee our happines, the wicked gnaſh their teeth at it, the godly haue ſent vs their gratulations, and they bleſſe GOD for vs. But where now are our Aultars? That is, where are our thankes and moſt gratefull ſonges of our deliuerance?

Build God an Aultar, not in earth with lime and ſtone, but in your heart of moſt kinde and thankfull remembrance for all his mercies to the land, to our dread ſoueraigne, to our ſelues, our ſoules and bodies, to our wiues and children, to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors and friendes, and infinite wayes that wee cannot name. Bleſſe his Maieſtie for them, and let not the remembrance die, till you dye your ſelfe. A thankfull heart is all that the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:922:135"/>
ſeeketh, and it is all that in deed we can doe to him. The childe vnborne hath cauſe to thanke him, and much more we that enioy his mercy at this preſent houre. The Lord touch our harts that they may feele, that Lord looſe our tongues that they may ſpeake, and the Lord inable both heart and tongue to continue praiſes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his maieſtie, not for a day or tws, but whileſt breath goeth through our noſtrelles, and we remaine. O our God of mercie, bleſſed be thou, bleſſed to day and bleſſed for euer: bleſſed with heart, and bleſſed with ſoule: yea bleſſed with the ſoule of our ſoules: for we were dead &amp; now liue, yea as ſheepe appointed to the ſlaughter after ſtrange tortures and torments before, ſo were wee: but the ſnare is broken and we are deliuered: we releaſed, and our enemies crawling in the bottome of the ſea.

Yea let vs growe by theſe examples to a Chriſtian ſtrength againſt worldly ſcandals and offences, not moued by them to wauer vp and downe as ſome doe, condemning truth, and iudging perſons by faults and offences that do happen. As if one ſhould ſay ſee the religion of theſe men, can it be true, can it bee good, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it haue ſuch ſpottes? <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui</hi> cruell bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhedders, <hi>Dinah</hi> wanton and wantonly defiled, and now <hi>Ruben</hi> an inceſtuous perſon defiling his owne fathers bed. How ſhoulde the religion of theſe men be good? Surely the idolatrous igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ignoraunt idolatrie of the Gentiles, of the Cananites, Periſites, Iebuſites, or ſuch like, was the good religion, and not the way that <hi>Iacob</hi> ſerued God by. Were this to reaſon well, or rather for the fals &amp; faults of men to condemne the truth of God, &amp; to cenſure men by their imperfections not to be what they are in deed and truth, though thus defiled? Yet this is the common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of the world, and thus dayly ſome ſtumble at mens offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But let vs bee wiſe, and learne by this to take a ſurer courſe to iudge both of men and of religion. <hi>Iacob</hi> and his family had the true religion, though thus ſinfull fleſh offended ſometimes. All were not euil in ſuch degrees, though ſome offended too much. Bewayle the falles wee may of thoſe that profeſſe the trueth, nay bewayle them we ought with a ſighing hart, but forſake truth for them, or condemne truth to be no truth, we may not, we dare not, we ought not. Let God be true, &amp; all men lyars. Let truth be truth &amp; all men ſinfull, yea ſuch great Patriarks as theſe were not euer free. Though his iudgement ſhall be great that giueth the offence yet they ſhal not be excuſed that ſo far take the offence, as for it to forſake the way that is right. Then hauing thus profited, let vs marke againe in this example of <hi>Ruben</hi> the ſafetie of ſinners, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſinne, that truely repent and forſake theyr ſinne. <hi>Ruben</hi> was not a caſtaway for euer from God hauing thus of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, but ſorrowing and ſighing (as no doubt hee did) for this

A thing likewiſe lawfull, that parents may attire one childe better then an other, yet ſtil wiſedome and diſcretion muſt moderate affection, for feare of ſuch hart burning amongſt children, as here we ſee.</p>

And a ſweete comfort to all that either haue no parents of abilitie to enrich them, or if they haue, yet vniuſtlie are throwen off, and by ſiniſter practiſes depriued of their portion, which in nature and equitie is to bee giuen them of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.

He furthermore wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, that charrets be taken out of Egypt for their children and wiues, and that they ſhould not paſſe for their ſtuffe, for he would prouide for them. See therefore the power of GOD, not to prouide ſmall thinges for his Children, but euen thus farre to mooue the Kinge, that he thinketh of the very beſt of the Lande for them. And ſee in the King a moſt Princelie minde, beeing (where hee is good) moſt bountifullie good.

Thus ended <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſeruant of God, the faithful ſeruant of his Lord and maiſter, and the nourcing father of all his kindred, with him endes this booke, and with it my labour, which to the Lord of mercy I moſt humbly now commend, that it may finde a bleſſing with him, to the glory of his name, to the comfort of his people, and to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of others: whoſe leiſure is greater, &amp; whoſe gifts be better to conſider what wanteth to a multitude in this land, and to relieue them according to their reaches. Praying thee alſo good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an reader, to whom there may be any vſe of this my poore labor to goe forward with thy holy exerciſe of reading the ſcriptures, to take thy bible into thy hands anew, and euer when thou haſt read a Chapter, to read theſe notes ouer vpon the ſame, and to conferre them with the text. And if thus both thy feeling and comfort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, to bleſſe God the authour of all mercies, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this, and to pray for him truly who loueth thee hartely, and ſhall ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
