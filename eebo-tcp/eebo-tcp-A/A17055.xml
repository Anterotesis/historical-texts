         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The filmes of the braine are very much troubled with this paine, which by reaſon of their tenderneſſe, euen the leaſt paines are ſharpe and irkſome to them. But the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the braine is ſomewhat groſſer, ſo that the paine that doth ſeaze thereon, is farre duller, and more loading. This paine when it doth trouble the braine, hath a double cauſe, the firſt from it ſelfe, and then the paine is of longer continuance, the ſecond proceeds from the lower parts, from which light humors doe aſcend, and are eaſily enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the braine. Moſt commonly the cauſe proceedes from the ſtomacke, by reaſon of the ſixe couple of ſinews neere adioyning thereto, and then the paine is not ſo du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but doth rather goe away and returne againe, hauing giuen ouer for a time: and euen as the ſtomacke doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with ill humors, ſo the braine doth likewiſe abound therewith. This paine is ſomewhat mitigated after the patient hath eaten, and exaſperated by too much faſting: for the ſtomacke being empty, raw and ſharpe humors are therein reſident, which come from the neighbouring parts, and the braine doth partake of theſe vapours: oftentimes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6264:5"/>
the fault is in the womb, and then the paine is chiefly in the hinder part of the head, for then the paine is conueyed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thorow the marrow of the backe-bone. Sometimes it ſpreads it ſelfe ouer the whole head, which is cauſed by the corruption of the ſeede, and ſuppreſſion of the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tearmes. If the paine doe proceed from any other cauſe, it may be diſcerned by his proper ſignes. Vſually the braine being corrupted by other parts, at the length the cauſe of its paine may bee ſayd to come from the eſſence of the braine; and it ſo happens, that the braine being weakened by the long continuance of paine, that it will with eaſe admit of the ſuperfluities of the other parts; hence is it that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are diſſolued, the digeſtiue faculty, weakened, and the temperature of the whole body changed, which is the cauſe that ſo many excrements are generated in the braine.

but ſharpe and piercing, vehemently beating, and gnawing, chiefly on the right ſide of the head; bitterneſſe in the mouth; want of ſleepe, and extreme heate of the head doe accompany the former ſymptomes: another while it is cauſed by the ſuperfluity of ſpirits, or by too much windy matter, which will pierce thorow the narroweſt paſſages, and will wind it ſelfe by degrees, thorow the veines, the fylmes, arteries, and ſinews, and ſometimes within the fylmes and bones, that ſo by diſpercing it ſelfe thorow all parts, it may make a ſeparation betweene thoſe that are moſt vnited, and then the paine doth runne ouer the whole head without any dulneſſe, but with a certaine ringing in the eares, which at certaine houres of the day, returnes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its cauernes. This may bee ſayd to come by the conſent of the other parts. Otherwiſe this paine of the head is cauſed by ſome great diſtemper, eyther hot or cold, and yet they are not ſo durable that onely come by a diſtemper; onely plenty of humors are thereby gathered; and this doth happen, if the paine laſt long, and the body bee full, or ill iuyced. The paine that comes by a hot diſtemper, is more vehement then that which comes by a cold diſtemper: A great burning in the head, and redneſſe about the eyes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company this paine, which is eaſed by the applying of moyſt things. On the contrary, the paine that is cauſed by a cold diſtemper, is ſtrong and doth laſt longer then the former. Paines cauſed by too much drineſſe that diſtemper the body, are not ſo ſtrong, becauſe they come not ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but as it is ſlow in comming, ſo it is very ſlow in leauing them; heere heate doth not much trouble the head, but the skinne of the head is ſomewhat dry. Moyſt medicines eaſe this paine; and dry, very much increaſe it: moyſtneſſe cannot properly bee ſayd to bee the cauſe of paine in the head, becauſe it cannot make a violent and ſudden change in the ſimilar parts, nor breake the cloſeneſſe of theſe parts, vnleſſe plenty of humors doe concurre.</p>

                  <p>An old paine, cauſed by a cold matter, is hardly to bee cured; eſpecially in old men: but a Head-ache continually vexing, and depriuing the patient of reſt, is not without danger; for it is the forerunner of madneſſe, eſpecially if his vomit appeare ſomewhat ruſty. Likewiſe a head-ache, if it pinch ſore, and by curing doth not mend, but rather is augmented, doth preſage Deafeneſſe, Phrenſie, Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumes, Conuulſion; if the head be greatly pained, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the ſinews ſtretched, great danger is at hand: if a head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache doe ſuddenly ſurprize a man, and hee become mute therewith, and ſnort in his ſleepe, he cannot outliue ſeuen dayes, except a feauer in the meane ſpace take hold of him. When the headakes in any part, or the whole head bee paind, if ſnot, water, or blood, come out of the noſe, mouth, or eare of the patient, the danger is then paſt: the headache alſo that was not from the beginning, is a ſure token of a future <hi>Criſis</hi> eyther by vomiting, or bleeding at the noſe, and no cure muſt be attempted for that paine, leſt we ſtop the bleeding which is by natures forecaſt intended, and it will eyther quite free them from the diſeaſe, or at the leaſt eaſe them.</p>

               </head>
               <p>A Palſey is a depriuing of ſence and motion, not of the whole body, as in an Apoplexy, but when one ſide or all parts of the body vnder the head, or any other limbe is depriued of ſence and motion, as Iaw, Tongue, Eye, Foote, Hand, Arme, Lippe. It alſo fals out that ſome part is depriued of the ſenſitiue faculty, the motiue faculty not being hurt; and contrarywiſe the motion dies, when as the ſenſitiue faculty remaines ſound. Sometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that neyther ſenſe nor motion is quite taken away,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6264:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but onely waxeth dull, and is numbd. Phyſicians call this an imperfect Palſey, and the harbenger of a Palſey. And ſeeing that motion and ſenſe is diuided but by one ſinew, it doth ſo chance, that the motion is taken away, when as the ſence remaines: becauſe hard ſinews are grafted in the limbes, which if they ſuffer but a ſmall paine, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently feele it; becauſe to the perfection of ſenſe, a ſmall portion of the ſenſitiue faculty is ſufficient; for the ſenſe of feeling doth rather ſeeme to ſuffer, then to bee an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. But to the perfection of motion, great ſtore of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall faculty is required, whereby ſmall hurt will ſooner deſtroy the motion, then the ſenſe. But why the ſenſe doth ſometime periſh, and motion abids, this happens, becauſe ſome parts doe participate of a twofold kinde of ſinews. This miſchiefe hath great affinity with the Apoplexy, and ſometime is cauſed by a weake Apoplexy; and then it is called <hi>Paraplexia</hi>; and herein they differ; the Apoplexy ſeizeth vpon all parts of the body, depriuing them both of ſenſe and motion; the Palſey ſeldome or neuer leaues the head without motion and ſenſe, but the other parts of the body looſe both motion and ſenſe, and after a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner: for if the beginning of the marrow of the backe-bone bee affected, all parts vnder the face doe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize with it: if but one halfe of the backe-bone be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all parts hauing relation to that ſide, ſuffer in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But if the before mentioned parts are not hurt, but ſome particular ſinew of ſome part of the body is looſed, that part whereof this nerue is ioyned, ſhall likewiſe looſe ſenſe and motion.</p>

                  <p>The beginning of the marrow of the backe-bone, which is the originall of all other ſinews, is more grieuouſly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyd then the braine; and then the face being vnhurt, all parts vnder the head are hurt: ſometime it doth take hold on the left, or right ſide of the marrow of the backe-bone,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6264:11"/>
whereby the right or left ſide of the body is deſtitute of motion and ſenſe, becauſe the marrow of the backe-bone, euen as the braine, is deuided into two parts through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole length of the backe-bone, whereby the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes on the right ſide, are ſeparated from thoſe of the left by a certaine filme, though very obſcure, and ſo thereafter as the ſtopping of the ſinews is in the right ſide or left, or both, the Palſey in like manner will ſeaze on the right, or left ſide, or the whole body. Sometime the braine is affected, but not the whole ſubſtance of the brain, for then an apoplexy would be cauſed, but the right or left ſide of the braine, and then that part of the face as alſo that ſide of the body, whether right or left, doth ſuffer with the braine, and when as any part of the face is bereft of ſenſe and motion, the riſing of the ſinews, from the third coniugation of the braine, are affected. Sometime one part of the body is voyd of ſenſe and motion; which is cauſed by the reſolution of a ſinew comming from the braine, or from ſome part of the marrow of the backe-bone, from which, the part affected doth take ſenſe and motion. Wherefore we ought to take paines in the Anatomy, that wee may know where this miſchiefe keepes its firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, as alſo the diſtributions of the ſinews, and from what part of the marrow of the backe-bone, euery part hath its ſinews. For this is an affect, belonging to the offended action of the animall faculties, ſenſitiue, and motiue.</p>

But if any part, by reaſon of great abundance of thinne humors doe ſwell very much, then will follow a conuulſion in that part. It is alſo as often cauſed by groſſe humors, which being driuen vpon the ſinews, doe cauſe obſtructions, and oftentimes ſuch, that the paſſage of the animall Spirits is ſtopped: which is the reaſon of the ſinews withering and falling.

                  <p>The part affected is the braine, which is hereby knowne: becauſe ſome principall facultie of the braine is hurt; for from the braine, all the ſoules principall faculties do ſpring: and it ſo chances, that the braine in this diſeaſe is tainted, becauſe it is a ſimilar part; for the whole temper of the braine is changed into cold and dry by the melancholy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; and herein it appeares, becauſe it neyther ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly comes, neyther is the party ſuddenly ridde of it. The whole eſſence of the braine is ſometime hurt, and then it cannot appeare that the ſides vnder the ſhort ribs, or the ſtomacke, or any other part is annoyed. But ſometimes the ſymptomes of melancholike men are more apparent, becauſe they be more increaſed, and then a leaden hiew doth appeare in the face: ſometime it is hurt by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the ſtomacke and <hi>Mirach.</hi> Sometime through the corruption of the whole body; and then the face is of a blackiſh colour.

The habit of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is leane, hairy, and inclining to blackneſſe, and the veines are larger then they ſhould be. By this that is ſayd, wee may vnderſtand this effect to bee nothing elſe, then a deprauing of the function of the principall faculty; and therefore wee may rather call it a ſymptome, then a diſeaſe. The imaginary faculty is offended, but the memory and thoughts are free. In concluſion, wee will ſay that melancholy is a ſymptome ſeeking the ruine of the principall faculties action, viz. ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginatiue.</p>

                  <p>The cauſe of this, is the cold and dry diſtemper of the braine, whether it doth happen by nature, or accidentally by a melancholy humour, and ill vapors generated in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, or of old time left there: from hence it is, that blacke and dreggiſh vapours doe creepe into the ſeate of the mind, wherby the braine is darkned.

too much heate in the head, ſo that the blood is burnt vp, and from thence come melancholy vapours, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time is obſerued in feauers. A continuation of ſadneſſe, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous watchings, ſolitarynes, and the ſtaying of monthly tearmes and piles, brings this diſeaſe; for maligne vapour carried vp by the corrupt blood, doth vitiate the minde. Againe, the vſe of ſuch things that doe not nouriſh well, eſpecially if they bee not well digeſted, oftentimes cauſe this diſeaſe; to widdows, and ſuch as are deepely in loue, this doth commonly happen; becauſe the minde is ſpent with care and griefe; ſometime the liuer is in fault, when by reaſon of ſome great diſtemper, it doth beget ſtore of blacke blood. Sometime it is cauſed by the ſpleene, when as it doth draw great ſtore of that blood, and doth not expell it; for hereby in time the whole body is bedew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with melancholy blood.</p>

By the ſelfe ſame cauſe, as in a ſuffuſion, the ſymptomes of that miſchiefe are ſtirred vp by ſharpe, and ſmoky vapours, proceeding from the lower parts: for it ſo happens, that the temperature of the braine is altered by darke and foggy vapors ariſing from the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, liuer, meſentary, or from ſome other adiacent part neere vnto them; whereby the imagination is hurt, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and cogitation remayning perfect. The matter of this diſeaſe, viz. a melancholly humor, partly is derived from the liuer, partly from the ſpleene, but moſt commonly from the liuer; and when the ſpleene doth not draw this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6264:21"/>
humor vnto it by reaſon of ſome fault in that bowell, then this humor doth ſtay in the miſeraicall veines.</p>

                  <p>The part affected is the braine, and that eyther by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the ſtomacke; or the griſtles of the ſhort ribs; for in theſe places, as it were in an inflamed part, the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly blood is gathered together: ſometime it is ſent from other parts neere vnto the ſtomacke being ouerheated, for hereby the neyghbouring blood waxeth hot, and is turned into melancholy; at length it ſo happens, that the braine doth ſympathize with theſe parts.</p>

                  <p>Beſides the ordinary ſignes of melancholyans, by the exceſſiue heate of the humors, the parts about the heart are inflamed, and ſeeme to be ſomewhat mitigated by cold meates: oftentimes the patient doth feele paine in his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and ſhort ribs, after he hath eaten ſuch meates that are not eaſie of digeſtion, for from hence much crudity is cauſed, whereof the more plenty there is, by ſo much the more doth this miſchiefe rage. They doe eate much, but in the meane while they haue their bellies bound: they breake winde often, and belch very much, which is cauſed by raw and melancholly humors contayned in the aforeſayd places. In thoſe places are very frequent rumblings, &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs heard; and this is an eſpeciall ſigne of this diſeaſe. Sometimes they haue paines in their ſhoulder, the Midrife is drawne vpwards, the arteries beate ſtrongly, and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly; Ringing in the eares, and inflamations of veines and eyes, are cauſed by vapours which are carried vp thither. Their ſleepe is ſhort and troubleſome. They are troubled with a dizzines, and palpitation. Vomit of crude phlegme is cauſed, wherewith choller is ſometime mixed. They are eaſed of their paine, after they haue digeſted that which they haue eaten, after ſtooles, vomits, and belchings.</p>

                  <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                  <p>It is cauſed by the default of the ſpleene, when it doth not draw away the melancholy blood made by the liuers diſtemper. Sometimes it doth happen, that the blood, which is in the veines of the ſtomacke, meſentery, ſpleene, bowels, guts, and adiacent parts, is burnt vp by too much heate, cauſed by ſome obſtruction, or ſome other cauſe; and then the blood doth degenerate into blacke iuyce which runnes ouer the meſentery, ſpleene, and other parts thereto adioyning, whereof followeth a great heate of the bowels, and from thence vapours are conueyed to the braine, from whence theſe Symptomes breake out.</p>

               <head>A method ſeruing for the knowledge of the <hi>FALLING-SICKNES.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Falling-ſickneſſe is a conuulſion of all the parts of the body, not continuall, but that which commeth by diſtances of time, the minde and ſences being thereby hurt. It doth take its name from the great affect which doth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the patient. There bee three differences of Falling-ſicknes. For it doth eyther happen, when the braine hath the cauſe of the diſeaſe in it ſelfe, which is vſuall, when the diſeaſe hath its beginning from thence. Sometime it is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the euill affect of the mouth of the ſtomacke, or ſome other part vnderneath, from whence venomous in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection creepeth into the brayne thorow ſecret paſſages. For ſome ſay that they ſhall bee ſicke before the fitte doth come vpon them; becauſe they feele the cauſe of the diſeaſe, like a vapour of cold winde, to bee carried to the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6264:32"/>
braine by the continuity of the other parts, from that part of the body wherein the diſeaſe is chiefely ſeated: and the cauſe of this miſchiefe is for the moſt part a venomous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, carried vp from ſome lower part of the body into the braine, and then the patient doth ſuddenly fall with a Conuulſion. When the braine is firſt affected, the eyes are darkened, the head doth ake, and withall is heauy; their mind and ſenſes are dull, their dreames are troubleſome, and their fitte ſudden. If the miſchiefes cauſe taketh its beginning from the mouth of the ſtomacke, the patients, for the moſt part, are worſe; a ſharpe aſſault of the fitte will ſooner come vpon the patîent, if hee bee faſting; and before this fitte commeth, they feele a quey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It doth differ from all ſorts of conuulſions, becauſe herein the conuulſion is not perpetuall. In concluſion the ſenſitiue and principall operations are hurt in the falling ſickneſſe: in conuulſions, the principall functions are not hurt at all. There is likewiſe a gentler kinde of falling ſickneſſe, which doth not much differ from Giddineſſe.</p>
               <div type="affected_parts">
                  <head>The part affected.</head>
                  <p>The part affected is the braine, which doth appeare by thoſe functions which are hurt; for all the faculties ſuffer alike, and are alike hurt. The braine is affected eyther by it ſelfe, or by conſent of the ſtomacke or ſome other parts: the ſignes of the affected part appeare by that which was ſayd before. When the fitte commeth ſuddenly, the braine as an inſtrumentall part, euen as the ventricle, but chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly the middle ventricle is affected. For it is not affected as a ſimilar part, becauſe that cannot bee without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper: but the Falling ſickneſſe is a diſeaſe which hinders the action of the animall faculties: for ſence, motion, and all
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6264:33"/>
the principall faculties are as yet after a different manner, the motiue faculty is depraued, and they are depriued of the other faculties.</p>

                  <head>The Signes.</head>
                  <p>The fitt oftentimes comes ſuddenly with much fome, and fome is a peculiar and eſpeciall note of this diſeaſe, which, becauſe it is ſlimy, may bee drawne out at length, yet in a gentler falling ſicknes this doth not appeare; and then, when hee is depriued of ſenſes, hee falls to the ground with a violent ſhaking of his body, his face is wreſted, his eyes turned vpwards, his chinne is ſometime driuen to his ſhoulders, and oftentimes he voydeth ſeed, ordure, vrine againſt his will, his muskles are looſned: all theſe are ſignes of a ſtrong fitte. Moreouer, they do often ſhort, and cry out in their ſleepe, and their voyces are faint, like vnto the voyces of ſuch as are almoſt ſtrangled. They oftentimes thruſt out their toungs, and it is to bee feared, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they bite them with their teeth. Sometime their teeth are ſo faſt cloſed together, that they are in danger of ſtifling: this fitte in ſome laſteth not long, and then they come to themſelues againe, and riſe of their owne accord. Very often, before the comming of this fitte, they breathe with difficulty: ſome feele a cold vapour aſcend from the nape of the necke, vnto the crowne of the head; in ſome, windines doth trouble the belly and heart. Palenes of the face, inordinate motion of the tongue, paine and heauines of the head, forgetfulnes, ſadnes, ficklenes of mind, troubleſome dreames are vſhers to this diſeaſe, then are they taken with a giddines: ſometime darknes, and diuers dimme gliſterings appeare before their eyes.</p>

                  <head>The cauſe.</head>
                  <p>It is moſt commonly cauſed by the abundance of phlegmy humors, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence corrupt, venemous, and ſtinking va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors break out, whereby obſtructions are cauſed in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the brain, &amp; the paſſages of the ſpirits are hereby hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; by this means the braine, and the roots of the ſinews

                  <p>This diſeaſe for the moſt part doth frequent children, becauſe they are of a moyſter braine then yong men; next vnto theſe, men of full growth, and old men leaſt of all. This diſeaſe is more incident to men then women, and vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it doth ſticke cloſe to the patient, vnleſſe it bee taken away by medicines in its minority, or at the leaſt ripening age, or the firſt comming downe of monethly tearmes. For ſeeing there is an alteration in childrens bodies, when the haires begin to grow; if it be not then cured, it will not one a ſudden depart from the patient. An old falling ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is incurable, euen as that which we bring into the world, with vs. And euen as in the ſpring time it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly doth frequent the patient, ſo is it at that time moſt dangerous. Againe, when the whole body is affected, and it doth ſo ſuddenly creepe vpon the patient, that hee doth not perceiue any ſenſe of it in ſome part of the body ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the head: this is likewiſe incurable: if this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be vehement, and the fits come often vpon the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and the ſymptomes bee dangerous, hee will in ſhort time be freed of the diſeaſe by death: but if a quartane ague, or any other longer feauer ſurprize him, it portends health.</p>

               </head>
               <p>SPaſmus is a Conuulſion, or a ſhrinking of the ſinewes, and is an effect which doth force the ſinews, and muskles vnwillingly, to that ſame diſpoſition of body, which they did enioy by the benefit of the animall faculty, when they were in perfect health: this I ſay is an vnuoluntary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the part which vſually did moue of its owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Sometime the whole body is taken with a conuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which ſometime doth happen to ſuch as haue the falling ſicknes; in which accident, the Roots of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news are hurt, and the braine being ſhrunke together, doth ioyne all its force together, for the expelling of that which is hurtfull. The mind is vitiated as well as the ſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the braine is diſeaſed. This diſeaſe doth trouble the patient by fitts, not afflicting them continually, as it doth happen in other diſeaſes of like kind. Sometimes all parts of the body except the head, are ſhrunke together; but for the moſt part, this affect doth happen vnto ſome one part of the body, as the eye, the Roote of the tongue, the skin of the forehead, the Shoulders, Armes, Legs. But this depraued motion, which doth chance to moleſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulſed part, doth in this ſort differ from the naturall motion of the ſame part. The muskles and ſinews are drawne toward the Roots from whence they come, as in a naturall
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6264:37"/>
motion, only this is done not without much reluctation and paine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for naturall motion is voluntary, not compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and hath its ſeate by the Roote of the ſinews in the braine, from whence the beginning of motion is beſtowed on the chiefe ſinews, and by their means on the muſcles, and ſo are the muſcles both ſtretched, and drawne backe to their owne Roote, drawing likewiſe that part of the body with them, wherein they are planted. There is a kind of conuulſion much ſlighter then the former, which is cauſed by groſſe winds, winding themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſubſtance of the ſinews; and theſe cauſe a ſtrong paine, but ſomewhat ſhorter which of its owne accord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts; howſoeuer by much frication the patient is freed of it. This kind of conuulſion ſeldome laſteth longer then the ſpace of an houre, and wee may perceiue this kind of crampe in our Legs, Fingers ends, and Toes, and in ſome the Legs, Armes, and hands are ſo ſhrunke together, that maugre the ſtrength of many men, they cannot bee ſtretched out, vntill the fitte be ended.</p>

                  <p>Sometime the braine is heere affected firſt, and chiefly, and then the face with the whole body is ſhrunke vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, no change of the body happening before. But for the moſt part, a conuulſion doth light vpon the muſcles in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate parts, whereby the part affected plainly ſheweth that the muskles are grieued. For the affection muſt euer bee referred to that muskle or ſinew, which doth moue thoſe parts that are hurt. For the muſcle is the proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of motion, which if it bee forcibly drawne vp to its Roote, may very well be ſayd to be hurt; euen as in a conuulſion of the eye, which is called ſquinting, the muſcles which moue the eye, are plucked together; and in like manner is it with the other parts; for in al ſuch diſeaſes, always on muſcle, ſometimes more are drawne backward, and they draw the part with them wherin they are ſet, and depriues them of motion, inſomuch that either they

                  <p>With all ſtretchings of the ſinews, a vehement paine for the moſt part is ioyned, which if it remaine very long with the patient, doth exceedingly waſte the ſtrength. The part affected is ſo drawne toward his Root, by meanes of ſinews and muskles (and that againſt their will) that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee reduced to his former habit, and while all parts vnder the head are conuulſed, the body can either by no means be bowed, or elſe it is ſo bowed forward, that the chinne is faſtned vnto the breſt, or elſe the head is ſo wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed backward, that the head is, as it were faſtned to the ſhoulder-blades. The face is ouerſpred with rednes, and is troubled with paine. Teares guſh out of their eyes, which are alſo wreſted. The mouth can hardly be opened: the Back, Iaws, Hands, Armes, and Legs are ſtiffe. And when the diſeaſe is encreaſed, the patient is afflicted with ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of paine, that he ſtarteth out of his bed, and claſping his thumbe in his fiſt, cries out aloud, and like vnto a mad man talketh idlely, and ſometime caſteth out drinke at his noſtrils.</p>

Emptines or dryneſſe of a ſinew, is oft the cauſe of a Conuulſion, and then it doth take more deliberation in growing vpon the patient. There went before it immoderate labour and wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, a burning ague, hunger, ſolitarineſſe, violent ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, vomit and a looſeneſſe of the belly; as alſo too much bleeding, exceſſiue Venery, inflamations and great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, heate of ſinewy parts: for by theſe cauſes the body and ſinews are much dried, the radicall moyſture of the ſinews is quite waſted, and they drie and ſhrinke like vnto skins neere the fire.</p>

               <head>A method ſeruing for the knowledge of the <hi>APOPLEXY.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AN Apoplexy is a depriuing of ſenſe and motion in the whole body, as alſo the principall animall functions; this name is giuen to this diſeaſe, by reaſon of the great paſſion which is common to it; this diſeaſe doth amaze both mind and body, and is ſo dangerous, that very few recouer, yet if any bee cured hereof, a Palſey will haunt them. Compare the danger of this diſeaſe with the loſſe of breath, which is the very life of man. For in an apoplexy, and ſuch like diſeaſes, although the patient bee depriued of ſence and motion, yet ſtill breath may remaine in his body; for this cauſe we ſay that the Apoplexy is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and the fault is in the braine: if we cannot perceiue the apoplecticke to breathe, in this he is not much vnlike a dead man; yet whether he do liue or die, we may trie and proue after this manner: Fill ſome ſmall veſſell with water, and ſet it vpon the patients breſt, and if the water moue, it is a ſure ſigne of breath, and by conſequence, of life. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we may proue the ſame by wooll finely carded, or by a cleare glaſſe, or a waxe candle. Put this very neere the mouth of the patient, and if he liue, the flame will ſtirre, the wooll will moue, and the glaſſe will bee couered with a miſt: but if his breath dorh ſurceaſe for a while, or if he doth breathe with great difficulty, hee is certainly ſicke of a ſtrong, and ſore apoplexy; but they that breathe not ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently as the former, though it bee done vnequally, yet are they not ſo ſore ſicke, but the diſeaſe doth deale more fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably with them: and in this latter there is ſometime ſence, ſometime motion though much amazed, whereby a Palſey in ſome one part doth remaine. This diſeaſe doth not much differ from the ſtrangling of the wombe, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the patients drawing of his breath; yet herein they differ, becauſe in an apoplexy they breathe with difficulty,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6264:43"/>
but in the other diſeaſe their breathing is eaſy, and free e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <div type="affected_parts">
                  <head>The Part affected.</head>
                  <p>It is perſpicuous that the braine, which is the Roote of the ſinews, is affected; becauſe beſide the motiue, and ſenſible faculties of the mind, the chiefe &amp; principall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are offended: &amp; theſe all are deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the brain; but the impediments are rather in the chiefe ventricle of the braine, then in the ſubſtance of the braine; becauſe the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof is ſodainly generated. But an apoplexy is ſuch an affect, that doth offend all the faculties, when as ſence, motion, and other principall faculties are not only dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but quite taken away, and it is handmaid to this diſeaſe, viz. the ſtuffing, binding, or ſtopping of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles of the braine.</p>

                  <head>Signes.</head>
                  <p>In a weake Apoplexy, there is a ſodaine fall vnto the earth with outcries; and immediately doth follow ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of breathing, that a man cannot diſcerne any life in the patient, but hee doth lie ſtill like vnto one that is ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled, the breſt being in ſuch ſort as though it were tied with a bond, and could not bee rayſed vp. The animall actions are taken away, and hee is depriued both of ſenſe and motion; inſomuch that the reaſonable ſoule ſeemes to be quite extinct; their eyes are ſhut as though they were ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and they differ from dead men onely in this, that they breathe, which is alſo done with great difficulty. A head-ache commeth ſodainly, giddines, and coldnes of the extreme parts goe before an apoplexy; yet a ſtrong and violent apoplexy taketh one ſodainly, and none of theſe ſignes goe before.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="causes">
                  <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                  <p>An apoplexy for the moſt part is cauſed by ſlymy, groſſe, and cold phlegme; for the ventricles of the braine, and the arteries, through which, Spirits are conueyed
<pb facs="tcp:6264:43"/>
from the heart into the braine, are fild, by which meanes, the Spirits and animall faculties are hindered, from giuing any reliefe to the inſtruments of ſenſe and motion, whereby man is robd both of ſenſe and motion. In like manner this diſeaſe is ſtirred vp by crudities, drunkenneſſe, too much ſtrong wine, cold aire, and cold diet. Againe, a fall, a blow vpon the head, doth haſten the Fluxe of the humors of the braine, which if they fill the principall ventricles of the braine, they cauſe an Apoplexy: in ſome, the ſtore of theſe humors is too ſmall to ſtirre vp a ſtrong Apoplexy. And ſome, after the manner of Apoplectickes, fall vpon a ſlight obſtruction, which is likewiſe cauſed by groſſe vapors, or ſome few humors driuen into the braines ventricles.</p>

                  <p>Such as are much addicted to ſurfettings, eſpecially old men, are ſubiect to the apoplexy: alſo they, who are often taken with a heauy ſlumber, or with great lazines of body, and ſuch, whoſe eyes are dimme, and who haue a ſhort and narrow necke. This apoplexy, if it bee great, is ſcarce to bee cured: therefore it is needleſſe to attempt the cure thereof by medicines; becauſe of its owne nature it is mortall. And a weake apoplexy is with great difficulty cured. For although few eſcape death that haue this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe about them, yet they that do eſcape the danger of death, fall into a longer diſeaſe, viz. into a palſey of ſome part, or of the whole body, or elſe loſe their memory, and eſpecially old men, if they be phlegmy by temper, and haue vſed ſuch diet as are moſt apt to cauſe this diſeaſe. And very few eſcape, becauſe of the violence of this diſeaſe, and the vnweildineſſe of their age. While cold and nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping winds blow in winter, and thicke clouds beſet the skie, this diſeaſe is moſt buſy: the patient muſt haue a care of taking ſuch medicines as may cauſe ſneezing, becauſe it is mortall.</p>

               <p>LEthargy is ſuch a neceſſity of ſleeping, that cannot by any means be with ſtood. Or, it is an obliuious diſeaſe cauſed by a cold Impoſtume of the braine.

The Lethargy doth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre from a phrensy herein; theſe ſleepe very little, or not at all, and the contatry happens in the Lethargy. It doth alſo differ from the Apoplexy herein, (for in both, the ſenſe and motion and function of the mind alike do periſh) in the diſeaſe <hi>Caros</hi> breath is not taken away, for herein, they doe breathe, &amp; that eaſly. In the Apoplexy with much difficulty; and by degrees the patients breath is diminiſhed, oppreſt, and thereby he is at the length ſtifled.</p>

                  <p>The ſubſtance of the braine is heere affected, and chiefly the hinder part, but not the Ventricles, as may appeare by the offended functions of the braine. Experience tells vs, that the patient is depriued both of reaſon and memory, which are the principall functions of the braine. In a word it is ſuch a diſeaſe, whereby reaſon, memory, the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the other ſenſes are annoyed.</p>

                  <p>An vrgent neceſſity of ſleeping with obliuion doth poſſeſſe the patient, a lingring and continuall Feauer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth withall, neuertheleſſe the Feauer is ſcarce perceiued ſeeing the phlegme eaſly rots. They anſwer ſlowly, though prouoked thereto: they lie with their eyes ſhut, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they open them, if they bee called vpon with a lowd voyce; and then cloſing them againe, fall faſt aſleepe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the patient doth not feele that paine which hee doth ſuffer by being plucked by the haire. Theſe things happen, when as the ſubſtance of the braine is vitiated by an Impoſtume. In which cauſe, the eyes ſticke farther out then vſually they were wont. Likewiſe they moue with paine and difficulty; alſo the tongue is white, they are as forgetfull as madde men; for if they aske for a vrinall to piſſe in, they immediately forget for what end they did call for it. By this it may eaſily bee gueſſed, that reaſon and memory are baniſhed, and that there is a defect in the imagination: they yawne often, and the pulſes beat ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faintly, euen as the Feauer comes vpon them very ſlowly, thereby making them faint: the bodies of ſome are looſe, of others bound; in like manner is it in their making water, and their vrines are not vnlike the ſtale of beaſts; and doe ſignifie a great diſquietnes of ſpirits within the veines. In ſome ſweat and trembling meete together; they breathe very much, though weakly. The whole body is lazy, and dull, but chiefly the head. Although ſuch as ſtand by, turne the patient on the one ſide, yet of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord he doth turne vpon his backe againe.</p>

In Concluſion, that the blood bee not too hot (for it doth ſoone turne into choler) a cooling ſirupe ſhall bee giuen, and alſo it ſhall bee ſo mixed, that it may cauſe the patient to ſleepe.

This humour is conueyed thither from the braine by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke nerue, and oftentimes ſo ſlowly, that it cannot bee perceiued at the firſt.

Some imagine cobwebs, others thinke woollen threads are before their eyes. Sometimes round circles appeare about Candles, and ſuch other vnaccuſtomed ſights preſent themſelues to their eyes. Their ſight by degees waxeth dull euen as the thin vapour, or humor doth thicken, or congeale; and then there is as it were a clowd before their eyes. Laſt of all, by greater congealation it is turned into a skinne or Panicle, and then the <hi>Pupilla</hi> doth appeare muddy, and darkſome; in proceſſe of time the eye doth appeare as if it were of the ſame colur with the ſea; at the length this miſchiefe is ſo far extended, that the patient is depriued of ſight, which then is, when all the holes of the <hi>Pupilla</hi> are ſtopped; And yet the patient doth then ſee light, though but very little. If that humour be ſpred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Pupilla,</hi> and the parts round about it do remaine pure, the obiect of ſight doth ſeeme to bee full of holes.

                  <p>There commeth withall a tumor of the eye, rednes, and a loading paine; and it oftentimes ſo ſwelleth, that the tunicle, and the parts neere adioyning are ſore ſtretched; ſometime the eye is ſwollen, to the cheekes, and ſtore of teares fall from them cauſed by vehement paine, and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the eye, which doth ſometime accompany this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Such thinne humours do demonſtrate from whence this diſeaſe did take its beginning, then doth follow filth, which doth ſticke in the corner of the eye; and when this filth by degrees growes ſo thicke, that it doth as it were glew the eyes together, then is not only the diſeaſe increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but alſo it is at full height. In this diſeaſe alſo the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries about the eye do beat ſtrongly; and the ſmall veines which before did lurke in the white of the eye, are now ſwollen, and eaſy to be ſeene, and that part which was wont to be white, is now red; the affect is anſwerable to the ſignes all manner of wayes.</p>

                  <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                  <p>There be three cauſes of this diſeaſe: the firſt by fulnes &amp; great ſtore of bloud, wherewith the membrane growing cloſe vnto the eye, is filled and ſtretched. Then the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples beate much, and extreme paine is about the eye. The veines ſeeme broad, the face and tunicle next vnto the eye looke red, and the eye-lids are very often cloſed. Teares guſh out of the eyes, which are neither ſharpe, nor biting. Age, diet, temperature, the ſeaſon of the yeere, the region hot and moyſt may cauſe this diſeaſe. All the parts about the eye, as well as the tumicle are red. If it be cauſed by phlegmy bloud, theſe parts are not ſo ſtretched. And as it is often cauſed by bloud, ſo is it often cauſed by thinne and ſharpe choler running from the temples and corner veines, ſecretly into the eyes veines, and then ſuch hote and biting teares guſh out of the eyes, that the next parts ſeeme alſo burnt, and are ſometime exulcerate. Dry and rough excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:6264:68"/>
are gathered about the corners of the eyes. Age, ſeaſon of the yeere, chollericke temperament are ſufficient witneſſes of theſe humours, the patients former diet did breed ſharpe humours. Sometimes, though but ſeldome, it is cauſed by flatuous ſpirits, and ventoſities, and then the next tunicle is ſo ſtretched, that it oft ſeems to burſt, whereby it remains in great paine; and then only ſmall teares run out of the eye; neither is there ſuch a heauines of the eye, or heate, or gnawing, although rednes doe appeare.</p>

When we haue effected this, we wil purge the body of them, and if they be ſo ſharpe that they threaten to eate into the eye, without the vſe of preparing medicines, we will empty the body of them, at the length with fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Clyſters, and lotions we will turne backe the humor running vnto the eye. The fift day we will mixe ſuch, as may reſolue the humours, with ſuch medicines as driue them backe from the eye, for then the diſeaſe doth begin to increaſe, but firſt waſh away al the ſcurfe from the eye with Roſe-water, and then wee may proceed vnto ſuch as do digeſt the humours: all which may be effected by theſe, and the former medicines, ſo that vniuerſals and particulars be rightly applyed. If the former medicines can nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle, runne a ſilke thread twiſted thorow the fleſh in the hinder part of the head, ſo that it may ſometime bee drawne vp and downe. If inflammation be cauſed by the paine in the head, firſt this paine muſt be taken away, for this paine doth ſtirre vp the humour, and thereby cauſe the diſeaſe. If inflammation be cauſed by a blow, waſh it ouer with Roſe-water, and the white of an Egge.

                  <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                  <p>Oftentimes it is cauſed by a cold diſtemper of the braine, or inſtrument of hearing: oftentimes it is cauſed by groſſe and cold humours thruſt into the eares, and there faſtned; for ſuch humours do amaze the ſenſes, with their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the dulnes of the head, and of the part affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed do plainly demonſtrate; alſo the other ſences haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by beene hindered: alſo cholericke bloud aſcending vpward, doth ſtop the paſſage of hearing, becauſe great ſtore thereof falleth vpon the chiefe inſtrument of hearing, which doth often happen in the time of <hi>Criſis</hi> in ſharpe Feauers.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:6264:72"/>
It is alſo cauſed by the filth in the corners of the eare, <hi>Schirrho,</hi> thicke skin about the place, and a fleſhy bunch, by an vlcer, impoſtume, &amp; ſome other outward cauſes. Alſo hote vapors in great plenty get vp to the head and eares, from the bowels, and ſtomacke, whereby though the ſence of hearing remaine perfect, yet the patient doth not heare very well: this is incident vnto many, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vnto ſuch who haue a foule body, &amp; euen as in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion cauſed by ſuperfluity of excrements in the lower parts, the patients ſee not very well: ſo is it with hearing: the windy ſpirits do cauſe great paine by ſtretching the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes to get out.

                  <p>Oftentimes bleeding at the noſe is cauſed by nature, which doth by this meanes expell the excrements, and that which is troubleſome to the body. This happens often in ſharpe diſeaſes, when as there is a great quantity of corrupt matter, and when it doth boyle vp like new wine hauing no vent. Sometime it is cauſed by the euil affection of the veines wherein the bloud is contained; and the bloud runnes out of the veins, firſt becauſe the veines are open, which is cauſed by ſuch a plenty of bloud, that the veines cannot containe it, and then ruſhing violently to the mouth of the veines, make a paſſage; ſometimes, becauſe the bloud hath ſome ſharpe quality in it, or elſe is ſome other way pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified, vexing the mouth of the veine, at the length it opens them. Sometimes the veines bleed, becauſe they are diuided either by a burſting, wound, or bruiſe. Againe, the veines bleed, becauſe ſome gnawing humour hath got thereinto, or elſe becauſe ſome ſtrong outward medicine hath beene applied to them; then may ſuch things bee applied as may cauſe an asker. Laſtly, they bleed, becauſe the bloud is too much fined by exerciſe, or ſome other cauſe and the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:6264:76"/>
veines tunicles are thinner, and rarer, and ſo they bleed by way of ſtrayning. Heere thoſe are good which do thicken the veines, and bloud, and do purge wateriſh humours.</p>

If in bleeding, either doting or conuulſion happen, this is a very bad ſigne: for a conuulſion by empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is deadly: if the noſe bleed in ſuppreſſion of tearmes, it may very well be permitted to bleed awhile, for nature being hindered, doth caſt them to the vpper parts, which otherwiſe would haue offended the lungs and liuer.

                  <p>Sometime the hote diſtemper of the braine is the cauſe, which diſſolueth, and fineth humours in the braine, &amp; doth draw more vapors from the lower parts, then it can concoct, and expell by breathing; that there is this diſtemper in the braine, Age, region, ſeaſon of the yeere, hot temperature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red noſe &amp; face, the parts of the head being hot, the temples and arteries beating very much, a ſharpe or thinne humor voyding at the mouth or the noſe, Feauer oft comming with it, and a loathing of meate, do all ſignifie as much. But the great weaknes of the braine is oftner the cauſe of rheume, ſo is its cold and moiſt diſtemper, for then nutriments conueyed to the braine, are not well digeſted, whereby many ſuper fluities are gathered, and ſtore of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are lodged in the braine. The ſignes of this conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions are age, the ſeaſon of the yeere, diet cold tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the auoyding of phlegmy and groſſe humours at the noſe, and of thoſe great plenty, alſo ſleeping, diſtention, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines of the head, and forehead, palenes of the face, loading obſtructions in the noſtrills.

into the lower parts. Surfet likewiſe, and too much fulneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially of wine, increaſe this euill. It is alſo cauſed by too much ſleepe; alſo by reaſon of the weaknes of the digeſtiue and expulſiue faculty of the braine, whether it were ſo from the patients birth, or by ſome long diſeaſe of the braine: for the nutriment brought thither, is left raw, and is in the body, becauſe of the weaknes of the expulſiue faculty.</p>

When the patient breathes, hee doth hold his face vpward, alſo there is a defect in his voyce. No ſigne of heate or ſwelling doth appeare eyther in mouth or throate, or necke, but great ſtraightneſſe is felt in the throate, they doe breathe with their mouthes open, and are refreſhed with cold ayre. Sometime they thruſt out their tongues, their eyes are red, and ſticke out of their head; the drinke that they take, runnes out at their Noſes, in briefe, they are ſundry wayes diſquieted. Sometimes the outward muſcles of the throate are affected, and this of all other is the milder kinde of Squinancy: for then the payne about the throate is not ſo great, neyther doth the patient breathe with ſuch difficulty. But if the throate and the place where the Wind-pipes, and Gullets extreme

Then his mouth is very moyſt and ſlymy, the Feauer eyther comes not at all, or elſe it is very gentle, the paine is leſſe, the ſwelling not ſo hard, neyther is his face and other parts very red; thoſe things went before, that did breed phlegmy bloud.

               <p>A Cough is a violent breathing out, whereby plenty of breath ſpeedily breaking forth, endeauours by its force to diſcharge ſharpe excrements, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> doe moleſt the lungs, and hinder the paſſages, or which doe any other way offend the body. This motion is cauſed by nature, which doth force the inſtruments of breathing by ſome violent courſe, from whence the Cough is cauſed, and yet ſo gentle, that although a man doe cough often, yet may it bee ſtopped from comming out. It is often cured by heate, which is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp in the inſtruments of breath, by holding of the breath which runnes thorow the narrow paſſages. The beginning of the Cough comes for the moſt part from the lungs, whereby the muskles of the breſt are ſtirred vp, and the cheſt is cruſhed; by which meanes all things that are in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:6264:90"/>
the way, are expelled, whenas the breath breaks out ſo ſtrongly. The lungs haue this paſſion following it, euen as ſneezing follows cold in the braine; and to bring this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into act, firſt the lungs become wider, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine they are ſhrunke; the midriffe alſo is an helpe to this motion.</p>

                  <p>The lungs are affected; and the cauſe of this is eyther, in and from it ſelfe, ſometime the cauſe is in ſome other part, as midriffe or ſtomacke, ſometime the liuer. For when the lungs feele the other parts to bee offended, preſently they do beſtirre themſelues for the expelling of that which was noxious and hurtful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> it is a ſufficient argument to proue that the lungs are affected, when as the breathing is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The cough is an accident appertaining to the hurt of the lungs: for neither the breſt in the pleuriſy, nor the liuer can any ways beget a cough, vnleſſe alſo the lungs by their meanes are hurt. Sometimes a cough follows the ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the paſſages through which breath is moued.</p>

                  <p>The ſignes of this diſeaſe are manifeſt: for this cough is ſo ſtrong, that maugre mans force he cannot forbeare cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and it happens ſometimes that there is a paine in the cheſt. This is the beſt way to purge the body of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by reaſon of the ſeats of thoſe parts which ſerue for breathing. Oftentimes there is a kind of tickling in the inward part of the mouth.</p>

                  <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                  <p>It is oft cauſed by humour which falls from the head in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the windpipe and lungs, which if it do runne abundantly and with great force, the patient doth breathe with great difficulty. There is a kind of loading paine in the breſt, and backe, whereto the lungs are faſtned by fylmes, but theſe ſymptomes will bee light, when as the excrements that flow from the braine are few. If the diſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ation bee freſh, both the ſides of the pallate are tickled, and the throate is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:6264:90"/>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſt vp, and that little is thinne. But if theſe humours be thinne, and often runne vp and downe, then they do delude nature, which is forced to ſtirre vp a cough, &amp; though the patient cough ſtrongly, yet doth he uoyd very little by ſpetting. Thoſe men are deceiued, that thinke the cough to bee then cauſed, rather by a dry diſtemper then humours, becauſe that by often coughing they auoyd nothing, ſuppoſing that there is no ſurcharging matter but this, as it doth happen when the matter is very thinne. In like manner it is when the matter is ſlymy, and glutinous, ſo that it cannot bee auoyded. Wherefore we ſhall ſtand in need of ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as are refining, when the matter is groſſe and ſlymy, which is in the breſt and lungs; otherwiſe we ſhall haue need of ſuch medicines as will thicken the humours. In both cauſes the ſurcharging matter deludes nature, by his thicknes &amp; thinneſſ whereby there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth great feeblenes of ſtrength: for weake ſtrength takes great paines in auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the matter that is within, that the breath may haue a paſſage to and from the heart, and at the length they cannot preuayle. Sometime the humours are mixed, which come thither from the head, or are detayned in thoſe places, which is very frequent in plewriſies, conſumption and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the lungs and the cough is the ſymptome of theſe aforeſayd diſeaſes, as may be perceiued by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignes. Sometime it is cauſed by wormes, hurting the ſtomacke, or by a cold and dry diſtemper of the ayre, and then the cough is ſmall, and very little is auoyded by ſpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Sometime this is a ſymptome of the liuer, ſtomacke or ſpleene, to wit inflamation or hardnes of thoſe parts, whereof ariſeth a dry cough, whereby nothing is auoyded.</p>

               <head>A method ſeruing for the knowledge of <hi>ASTHMA,</hi> or ſhortneſſe of breathing.</head>
               <p>ASthma is a thicke or faſt breathing without a feauer, ſuch as is common vnto them that runne. There bee three kinds of ſhortneſſe of breath, for when it doth trouble vs ſo mildly, that there is no noyſe of panting, and is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Feauer, it is called <hi>Diſpnaea,</hi> Purſineſſe. But when the patient cannot breathe without a noyſe and panting, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Aſthma.</hi> But if it ſo diſtreſſeth the patient, that he cannot breathe vnleſſe hee hold his necke ſtraight vp, it is called <hi>Orthopnaea,</hi> or ſtraightneſſe of breathing. The patient is as it were choaked by this latter, if hee doe lye downe. For the paſſages of breath in the Lungs, the Windpipe, and all the inner parts become ſtraighter, and narrower then when they ſit vpright, becauſe the whole breſt ſinks as it were to the backe-bone. Theſe three kinds are all contained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a thicke and quicke breathing, which is cauſed by groſſe and tough humors ſtuft within the lappets of the lungs. We do not heere ſpeake of that difficulty of brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is cauſed by weaknes of body, and ſtrength, for though all the breſts muſcles do then moue, yet it is done very ſoftly, for if the ſtrength be deficient, the patient ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther breathes thicke, neither is there great widenes, and the breath doth rather goe and come thorow the noſe. And this is a manifeſt ſigne whereby we may know that the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:6264:94"/>
ſtrength is decayed, when the griſtles of the noſe are ſhrunke by drawing breath. Neyther do we heere treate of that ſhortneſſe of breathing which is cauſed by the great heate of heart and lungs, although the breath be neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hote, great, frequent, and ſwift. So in a pluriſy, or ſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy there is both thicke and quicke breathing, and all theſe kinds, as they do require a different manner of cure, ſo they cannot bee brought vnder <hi>Aſthma,</hi> euen as that ſhortnes of breathing which is cauſed by the greatnes of the ſpleene, or by plenty of water contayned in the belly, and the reaſon why by theſe ſhortnes of breath is cauſed, is this, becauſe the midriffe is cruſht.</p>

This ſhortnes of breath which wee do heere treate of, is an accident which doth follow the offended action of a voluntary faculty, viz. breathing, which is weake, and depraued. This accident fallowes a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe incident to the paſſages of breathing, viz. ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſtopping of the paſſages thorow which aire is drawne.</p>

                  <p>There is a pricking paine very troubleſome which doth ſpread it ſelfe ouer the ſides and breſt; for this dilatation by cruſhing, ſtretching, and violently mouing the breſt, doth augment the paine. Somtime the paine ſpreads it ſelfe euen vnto the ſhort ribs, ſomtimes to the channell bone of the throate, neceſſity doth compell him to breathe ſhort and thicke, yet it is ſmall in regard of that paine which doth hinder the inſtruments of breathing to bee lift vp, and yet this is necſſary by reaſon of great inflamation, whereby he is forced to double his breath, that by this meanes that heate might be refreſhed, which before was ouerheated. Alſo there is a continual Feauer, becauſe the inflamation doth border vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heart. The pulſe is thick, not too great, hard and vnequall, and by that meanes rough and like vnto a ſaw. A cough alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth withall, at the firſt day, and then nothing is voyded at the length ſpittle comes vp co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured according to the nature of the excrements, and it is alſo moiſter. Then he begins to voyd greater ſtore, and ſometimes it is red, and bloody, ſometime yellow, at the length when the impoſtume is ripe, the ſpettle is martry: the patient finds greater eaſe when he lies on the ſicke ſide, then on the other. But the patient muſt rather lye on his backe, then on that ſide, for if he lye on that ſide, the paine is increaſed; becauſe the matter is more ſpred abroad by reaſon of their cruſhing: but if he turne himſelfe vpon his ſound ſide, the filme affected is more ſtretched, and the humours bend towards the ſound part. This paine for the moſt part is moſt irkſome toward night. Sometime this diſeaſe is at an end, if the matter by ſweating fall vpon the lungs, for then it will bee driuen out with a cough, which is moſt to be deſired. Sometimes it gets thorow the pores, but this is but ſeldome. Sometimes the matter is ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and turned into corrupt blood, &amp; when the impoſtume
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:6264:100"/>
is opened, vnleſſe it bee auoyded by cough, the patient within 40. dayes doth ſpet corrupt blood: but when the matter doth begin to bee corrupted, paine and feauers are increaſed, he breathes more hardly, he auoyds little or nothing by cough, a great rednes breaks out in his cheeke, watchfulnes and thirſt do much oppreſſe him; when the matter is ripe, paine and Feauers are ſlackned, he coughs more, and doth caſt vp little. But when the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume is ready to breake, paine and Feauer againe increaſe, he breathes with more difficulty, his ſtrength fayles, and he quakes and trembles with cold: but if at that time the patient is not weake, and his ſpettle is good, the beſt is to be hoped, and the greater that the Feauer paine and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of breathing is, then the impoſtume will ſooner breake, if theſe ſymptomes be milder, the longer it will be before it doth breake. We ſay that it is but the beginning of the diſeaſe, when he ſpets little, and that is vndigeſted: but if it doth appeare reddiſh, then is the diſeaſe paſt the beginning: when it is changed from rednes to white or leaden colour, and is voyded in great ſtore, and the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes increaſe, the miſchiefe doth then increaſe, but ſpettle equally white, and the ſymptomes ſlackned, ſignifie that the ſtate is come.

Sometime it is cauſed by phlegmy blood, and then the diſeaſe is of longer continuance, and the ſpettle is frothy, and white. The ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the yeere which is Autumne, the cold conſtitution, and region of the aire, do ſignifie this, as alſo diet genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting phlegmy blood; ſometimes cold doth draw the blood out of the veines, or too much heate will do as much, too much drinking of cold water, a fall, the ouer-loading with a burden, ſodaine cold after a ſweat; ſometime the blood is cholericke, and then a ſharper diſeaſe is cauſed.

                  <p>The Pluriſy is dangerous vnto old men, women with child, and ſuch as haue beene ſicke twice or thrice of it. It doth vexe the patient more in the night then day.

Spettle bloody and yellow is bad; but much bloody at the firſt is not dangerous; for all ſpettle, the more humours are mixed with it, the greater the danger is.

               <p>SPetting of blood is any voyding of the blood at the mouth: this affect is oftentimes the cauſe of moſt euill and long diſeaſes. Blood is voyded from many places of the body, as ſhall appeare by that which follows; and here care ought to bee had in obſeruing whether the patient was wont to bleed at the noſe or no, for from thence it doth fall into the ſtomake and throate, and ſometime into the lungs, but for the moſt part it doth turne and harden into a clod: if then one ſpet blood, and yet did not bleed at the noſe formerly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it doth come from ſome inferiour part, which ſhall bee knowne by peculiar ſignes.</p>

                  <p>Blood is oft voyded from the gummes, and mouth it ſelfe, and then the ſpittle is of a bloody colour, and very little is voyded out, and that without cough; if it doe come from the throate, or weazell-pipe, then it is voyded by hemming, not by cough, and the continuated parts of thoſe places doe appeare looſened if the tongue be thruſt downe. But if it did come from the head, a paine of the head with heauineſſe went before, and a noyſe in the eares, the forehead veines riſe, they haue a kinde of ſence of heat and blood in the mouth, and a tickling is felt in the pallate: if it doth runne into the throate from whence by often hemming it is caſt out, oftentimes, the patient hath a deſire to cough and cannot. But if the blood doth come from the lungs, then is the blood foamy, and then it is voyded by frequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is often cauſed by fulnes, and by a great quantity of bloud which doth offend the body, and ſome peculiar parts of the body more particulary; for heereby the veſſels mouthes are opend; the ſignes of this is a good habit of body, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vſe of hote nutriments, and wine, ſuppreſſion of tearmes, and then there is no paine, but rather a lightſomnes of the body, which before was dull; and then alſo there is but a ſmal quantity hereof, and it is not very foamy or red. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men without any danger of conſumption haue beene eaſed by this ſhedding of blood in the ſuppreſſion of their tearmes. Oftentimes a veine in the lungs is burſt by a fall, or labour, or ſome lowd outcries, from hence blood iſſueth out: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it doth happen by corroſion of the veſſels, and the blood is then voyded by little quantities, &amp; at ſundry times; a ſharpe rheume went before this.

                  <p>If the lungs be vlcerated, there is danger, for then there is danger of ſuppuration, and of a conſumption; for by the reaſon of continuall motion, the lungs cannot bee hardned: alſo in ſpongy ſubſtances blood will ſooner ſticke, and will with great difficulty bee caſt out, whereby a greater ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is cauſed, which doth exulcerate the lungs, alſo hereby the breathing is hindred, the heate in the body is increaſed, and the body conſumed. When a veine in the lungs is opend or burſt, yet there is ſome hope, if the ſubſtance of the lungs be ſound: yet a conſumption ſignifies danger, if the blood

which comes out of the rupture of a veine falling vpon the lungs, be there detained, by which meanes the lungs are inflamed and putrified; for at the length the ſubſtance of the lungs will bee corupted, and exulcerated.

               <p>SYncope is a ſudden failing of the ſtrength, and it comes neere vnto death, becauſe it is the beginning of natures diſſolution; faintneſſe of heart goes before ſwounding, which is called in Latine <hi>Lypothymia,</hi> with which faintneſſe there is no ſweate, but the extreme parts of the body waxe cold with a ſudden fayling of ſtrength; and then eyther the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are diſſolued, or by ſome other meanes hurt, but the vitall ſpirit is not altogether diſſolued. But beſide the animall faculties, ſometimes the heart, and the vitall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are hurt, the heart cannot bee primarily ſayd to bee hurt, although the other forces and faculties of the body

It is an accident belonging to the action of al the faculties hurt, and chiefly the vital faculties. The heart ſometimes is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it ſelfe, when as no other affect went before, nor any ſigne of any other affected part could be diſcerned; which doth happen eyther in regard of the grear diſtemper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or elſe by reaſon of ſome venemous humours; ſometime by an inflamation or tumour raiſed by ſome humour, and then for the moſt part they die ſuddenly therewith; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it is cauſed by the conſent of ſome other part, as the ſtomacke; and then it is called the ſtomacks ſwounding: the like may be ſayd of all the other parts.</p>

                  <p>The patients face looks as though he were dead, becauſe the blood flyes inward: the extreme parts of the body, by reaſon of faintnes, and looſnes of the body, doe wax cold; their ſweate is ill ſauoured by reaſon of the diſſolution of the ſolid parts. Anxiety of mind ſuddenly ariſes and diſturbs them; and then the heart fayles them, inſomuch that the body being faſt aſleepe, is depriued both of ſence and motion, and not one part hath ſo much force, as to performe any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Viſions appeare before their eyes, when the fit doth ſeize on them: they are ſuddenly ſpeechleſſe, and their breath is almoſt ſtopped their eylids fall, their pulſe is thinne, obſcure, and almoſt extinct.</p>

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:6264:114"/>
Too much emptines of the body by faſting, ſweating, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vomiting, emptying the belly by ſtools, or ſudden eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of water in a dropſy; for hereby immoderate eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations, and reſolutions of the ſpirits are cauſed, by which means the heart cannot but be greatly ouerthrowne. Alſo it is cauſed by plenty of groſſe, raw, putrified, ſharpe and biting humours; the latter of theſe do pinch and bite the ſtomacks mouth; and the former doth ſtop the ſpirits wayes, ſo that their paſſage is intercepted. Neither may it ſeeme ſtrange that the ſpirits can bee intercepted; for great plenty of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours is contayned in the lungs pipes, ſo that the patient cannot draw breath. Sometimes it is cauſed by the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ayre without vs, and venemous humours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in vs; alſo inflamation, or many things which may corrupt and alter the temperature of the heart, ſtomacke, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and by that meanes cauſe a ſwounding, becauſe the whole life, and ſtrength of the body doth conſiſt in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conſtitution of thoſe parts. The ſpirits being after the former manner hurt, do hurt likewiſe the other principall parts, and all appertaining thereto, and by that meanes vitiate a good and wholſome temper, whereby a ſwound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very dangerous, and ſometime mortall, followes, and that for the moſt part with great ſweate. And this accident doth as it were inwrapt the beſt of the parts a dying. Alſo thoſe forces do ſuddenly faile, which had dependance on the ſpirits, and ſolid parts temper. In concluſion, eyther the want of ſpirits, or their alteration and corruption, or the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſolid parts temper, alſo long and ſharpe diſeaſes, do cauſe ſwounding.</p>

               <p>IF ſwounding be cauſed by humors ſtopping the paſſages, a gentle Clyſter ſhall be firſt giuen, and the humors ſhall be then made obedient vnto nature, when the ſtrength is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reſtored; and then they ſhall bee brought forth by a gentle purge, but ſuch purging medicines as doe reſolue the vitall ſpirits, ſhall not bee adminiſtred. Then auerting medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines ſhall bee vſed, and in the meane time the heart ſhall bee ſtrengthned by inward and outward medicines. If ſwounding be cauſed by too much euacuation of blood, let him reſt in his bed, and in the time of the fitte ſome Roſewater, or elſe riuer water ſhalbe caſt in his face, by which meanes he may be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp: alſo in the fitte the fingers ſhall bee wrung, to cauſe paine, and ſneezing medicines be giuen for the ſame purpoſe. His mouth and noſe muſt be ſtopped, that the breath may be kept in, for finding no way out, they doe returne in againe, and ſo ſtirre vp the vitall ſpirits. If it be cauſed by a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, becauſe the ſpirits are conſumed, things that nouriſh much, ſhall bee giuen; if from venomous vapors generated in the body, the great conſerue of our deſcription is good: for this helps all ſuch diſeaſes that are cauſed by ill vapors bred in the body: alſo it is an excellent antidote againſt al Feauers intermittent and rouing, againſt worms, or conuulſions. For this doth deſtroy the feminaries of this diſeaſe, and doth preſerue the vitall ſpirits, and radicall moiſtnes, or the lifes ſubiect: alſo it is accounted for a very good remedy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent diſeaſes. If the ſtomacke, too much oppreſſed by ſharpe humours, ſhall cauſe ſwounding, an oyntment ſhalbe made for the ſtomacke, of the Oyle of Roſes, Quinces, Myrtle. If after a purging medicine, a ſwounding happens, giue to the patient of new Triacle ℈iiij, if the Triacle bee old, adde

            <div type="disease">
               <head>A method ſeruing for the knowledge of <hi>CHOLERA,</hi> or Choler.</head>
               <p>CHoler is an immoderate perturbation of the ſtomacke and bowels, wherein maligne humors breake forth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and downeward: this diſeaſe is often ſo vehement, that it doth depriue a man of life within the ſpace of a day or two, euen without a Feauer; or elſe in few days the ſubſtance of the body being conſumed by vomits, and ſtooles; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements ofentimes come downe with ſuch force, that the ſpirits are alſo expelled with the humours: from whence thirſt, faintings of the heart, and a languiſhing of the ſtrength, at the length ſweating, and death ſucceeds. This name is giuen to the diſeaſe, from the matter and efficient cauſe hereof.</p>
               <div type="affected_parts">
                  <head>The part affected.</head>
                  <p>The vpper and lower part of the ſtomacke is affected primarily; for the bowels are affected by the ſtomacks diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdening it ſelfe through them. The ſignes which make knowne that theſe parts are affected, are vomit and eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, paine in the bowels, a great wringing in the mouth of the ſtomacke, and a diſtention cauſed by windines. It is an accident that appertaines vnto the hurt of the action of the expulſiue faculty.</p>

At the firſt this diſeaſe is ſlight enough, but at the laſt, a paine and ſtraightnes is felt in the ſtomacke, and vpper bowels, with a troubleſome ſweate ouer the whole body, whereby the patient is faint, his pulſe is thicke, quicke, and little, and at the laſt falls quite away. When the diſeaſe doth increaſe, the muſcles of the Legs, Hands, and Armes, are conuulſed, and it is an accident, moſt proper vnto this diſeaſe, and the rather if that the diſeaſe doth increaſe.

                  <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                  <p>It is cauſed for the moſt part by choller, whereof great ſtore is gathered together in all the body, or in the galls blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or in the liuer, meſentary, or bowels, or in ſome part of the whole body, which in time is ſtayned with ſome maligne and venemous humour, which, if it bee caſt vpon the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke by the ſurcharged part, by reaſon of the abundance thereof, is very offenſiue vnto nature, and againe, the maligne quality, and the fretting of the mouth of the ſtomacke is troubleſome vnto nature, wherefore it is driuen to and fro in the body, and at the length is voyded as was before ſpecified. This diſeaſe is likewiſe cauſed by naughty and corrupt nutriments, or other humours putrified with choller in the body.</p>

This is a dangerous diſeaſe vnto old men, though it doth but ſeldome ſeize on them; then is the danger greateſt, when the patient doth ſweate, and vomit, or when hee is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſwounding, and that which is vomited forth, hath

Sometime by too much empitnes, and drynes, as it doth happen in great heats, and long feauers, which do pine away the body. It is alſo cauſed by too frequent going to ſtoole. It is alſo cauſed by too much emptines of blood, as happens in the immoderate flux of monethly termes, as alſo in the bloody flix, or by great wounds or immoderate vomitings, or long faſting.

               <p>THe paine of the ſtomacke is a painefull ſence of the mouth of the ſtomake cauſed by a biting matter. This diſeaſe hath affinity with the diſeaſe called <hi>Cardiaca paſſio,</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:6264:126"/>
which is in like manner a diſeaſe of the mouth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, cauſed by corrupt humors, and ſuch as are biting and virulent, which eyther came from ſome other place, or elſe were therein generated, and gathered together; from whence comes languiſhing; and faintnes of the body, and a reſolution of the ſtrength by ſweate, and ſometimes they fall into a ſwound, and the outward parts of the body are cold, whenas the Face, Breſt, Head, and Necke, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with ſweate. <hi>Cardiaca paſſio</hi> herein doth differ from this diſeaſe, becauſe this is cauſed by biting humours, but that is cauſed, as was ſayd, by virulent humors, and alſo venemous and ſo maligne, that a Feauer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth withall, and that very hote and ſharpe. Theſe affections of the ſtomacke ought with great care &amp; circumſpection to be looked after, becauſe the mouth of the ſtomacke hath relation to many other parts of the body, firſt with the heart, becauſe of its neerues; with the braine, becauſe of the nerues that are implanted there, and ſo goe from the one vnto the other, by whoſe vertue, the mouth of the ſtomacke hath a quicke ſence. Seeing therefore that theſe parts of the body haue ſo great affinity with the ſtomacke, and it is its proper office to hunger after meate, euen as the hollownes of the ſtomacke doth concoct it: this diſeaſe therefore ought to be ſpeedily remedied. This diſeaſe hath borrowed the name from the affect, and part affected, for in former times the phyſicians did cal the mouth of the ſtomacke <hi>Cardia,</hi> which is the heart, becauſe when as the mouth of the ſtomacke is affected, ſuch hainous accidents do follow, as if the heart it ſelfe where hurt.</p>

                  <p>The ſtomacke of ſuch as haue recouered of a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, is weake, and ſometimes ſo weake, that it neyther is able to receiue nouriſhment, and yet if it doth receiue any, cannot well digeſt it. The reliques of the diſeaſe left behind, may be the cauſe of this, which may hinder the attractiue power that the ſtomake eyther hath, or ought to haue: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it hath this attractiue power, the body being very leane, and for this only cauſe deſires nurtiment, and cannot concoct it, by reaſon of the weaknes thereof. Sometimes they that are in perfect health (as moſt men may thinke) haue a weake ſtomacke, by reaſon of a hote or cold, dry, or moiſt diſtemper, which peraduenture may chance to come ſingle, but it cannot long hold out, vnleſſe other offending humors ioyne therewith. For the digeſtiue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the ſtomacke being weakned, raw humours muſt
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:6264:130"/>
needs bee gathered together eyther hot or cold, or elſe diſturbing the ſtomacke by ſome outward quality, and then follows a loathing of meate, a loading of the ſtomacke, belchings and vomitings; and this is often cauſed by phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and putrified humors; and then the relliſh which is communicated vnto the pallate, is ſweet, or watriſh, and much ſpettle is voyded without coughing or hemming; his belch is ſowre, his concoction is hindered, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke is puffed vp, and ſtretched ſome houres after meate, great gripings, and paines are ſtirred vp therein, whereof the dropſy, collicke, <hi>Iliaca paſſio,</hi> are cauſed. Sometimes it is cauſed by choler, and a gnawing of the ſtomacke is felt, eſpecially by faſting, a bitter humour is caſt vp by vomit, whereby the mouth becomes bitter; and ſometimes this diſeaſe is turned into the former, namely <hi>Cardialgia,</hi> or paine in the ſtomacke. If it be cauſed by a melancholy iuyce, a ſowre taſte is bred in the mouth. He is ſad, fearefull, and diſquieted with dreams, a panting is felt on the left ſide, the appetite for a time doth increaſe, and ſo it doth become an hypocondriall melancholy, or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſicknes, the muſcles alſo of the calues are ſhrunke. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there happens a crudity of the ſtomacke when the faculty is not hurt, but is hindred by ſome externall error, as too much waking, exerciſes preſently after meate, more ſtore of food taken in then can be well digeſted, or elſe ſome bad quality of theſe meats. Sometimes it is cauſed by vicious humours, ſent vnto the ſtomacke from ſome other parts, as will happen by the ſuppreſſion of moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tearmes, and hemroides. Likewiſe in diſeaſes of the ioynts, the matter is oft conueyed vnto the ſtomake, which is wont to be deriued vnto other parts.</p>

Alwaies a care ought to be had that nothing bee receiued into the ſtomacke, before the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer be well digeſted, for this is good not onely for the cure of this diſeaſe, but alſo for preſeruing health.

               <p>THe ayre muſt bee hote and cleare, his diet ſuch as may heate and ridde ſtopping; alſo thoſe that do generate groſſe blood, muſt be auoyded. In his broths, the roots of Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, Parſly, Sperage with their ſeeds, the leaues of Hyſſop, Succhory, Peny-royall, Endiue, Leeks, muſt be boyled. He muſt auoyd variety of meats; neither may he eate any thing, vntill that bee digeſted which was formerly receiued; and then alſo he muſt eate but ſparingly. His drinke muſt be ptiſan, thinne and ancient wine. Exerciſe preſently after meate is vnwholſome, but eſpecially bathings, but an houre or two after, exerciſe with moderation may be allowed. Sleeping in the day time, eſpecially long ſleeping is not good, and his ſleepe in the night time may be the ſpace of ſeuen houres. His belly muſt be kept looſe. Accidents of the mind muſt be auoyded, chiefly anger, care and ſadnes, and all meanes muſt be vſed that may delight him.</p>

               <p>THe weakneſſe of the liuer commeth by diſtemper, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manifeſt euill in that bowell: the proper and principall faculty of the liuer is the blood, which doth come to it by a property of its owne ſubſtance, and cannot bee weakened on a ſudden by any diſtemper; for the diſtemper muſt needes take deepe roote, before it can hurt the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the liuer, or diſſolue the ſtrength thereof; but by what diſtemper ſoeuer this is cauſed, the liuer doth not performe its proper duty, vnleſſe it bee by halfes; for the excrements that are auoyded, doe reſemble water, wherein fleſh newly killed hath beene waſhed, and ſo long as the proper action, or ſubſtance of the liuer is not weakened, the action hereof will bee ſomewhat corrupted, but not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, ſo that we cannot ſay that the action of the liuer is hurt by euery diſtemper, but onely by that which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time hath weakened the ſubſtance of the liuer: and the reaſon why theſe excrements are voyded by ſtoole, rather then by any other way, is this, becauſe it doth vſually expell the iuyce being imperfectly changed by the liuer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its weakeneſſe through the bowels, becauſe it is a neerer way then by the paſſages of the vrine, thorow which
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:6264:138"/>
ſometimes theſe ſuperfluities, which do reſemble the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein fleſh newly killed hath beene waſht, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed; and ſuch men are ſometimes deceiued, that alwayes ſay the fault of this is in the ſtone. Sometimes cleare blood is voided by ſtoole, eyther without the bloudy flux, or any diſtemper of the liuer; and this doth chiefly happen. when as ſome veine is broken appertaining to the liuer. Sometimes blackiſh blood is voyded by ſtoole, which doth reſemble blacke choller, and yet it doth differ from it, becauſe the clothes that are dipped therein will be of a blacke colour: this is cauſed, when as ſome veine in the vpper parts is burſt. Oftentimes alſo blood is voyded at the ſtoole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome accuſtomed euacuation is ſtayed, or becauſe ſome member is maimed, and as then it is ſuddenly auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in great plenty, ſo it doth ſuddenly ceaſe, comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at its proper ſeaſons. Sometimes alſo it is voyded that way by the hemroides, and ſometimes by an impoſtume of the liuer, or elſe ſome vlcer therein bredde. All which ſhall be ſpoken of in their peculiar chapters, for here we do not treate of ſuch voydings, becauſe they do not come through the onely default of the liuer. Therefore among all theſe excretions of blood, that alone, wherein the ſtoole doth reſemble the water, wherein fleſh hath beene waſhed, is heere to bee treated of, and ſhewes that the liuer is hurt in its owne eſſence, without any manifeſt hurt in the bowell.</p>

                  <p>By what diſtemper ſoeuer weaknes of the liuer doth come, it is ſo rooted, that it doth ſcatter the ſpirits natiue heate, and diſſolue the ſtrength and actions of the liuer, inſomuch that it doth ſend forth wateriſh blood, and halfe concocted without paine, and in great abundance.

                  <p>A cold diſtemper is the cauſe of the liuers weaknes: and if the diſtemper bee but ſlight; the colour of the face is white; that which is voyded, ſtinks a little, ſmall ſtore of excrements are voyded, the body waxeth cold, and ſwels, vnleſſe the heate of the heart doe amend the cold diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the liuer; the patients vrine is thinne, and there is neyther Feauer nor thirſt. Sometimes it is cauſed by a hote diſtemper, &amp; if it be but flight, the excrements are ſtinking, and are mixed with thicke choler, and are of diuers colours, the vrine is redde, thirſt, and alſo a Feauer enſueth: the tongue is rough, a yellow colour doth breake out in his face, all his body is too hote, eſpecially the palmes of his hands, and ſoales of his feete, ſharpe vapors are often felt to go ouer the skinne, and cholericke humours are voyded by vomit: their bellyes for the moſt part are bound, and the heate is the cauſe hereof. But as often as a cold diſtemper hath altered the ſubſtance of the liuer, hee ſeldome doth thirſt, but rather moiſtnes is felt in his mouth; his ſtoole is great, watry and thin. The contraries of theſe do happen in a dry diſtemper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the body is become drier and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and at the length the ſtrength of the liuer is diſſolued, and the face hereby is ſtayned with a ſea palenes; his ſtoole at the firſt is liquid like creame, &amp; beſides other accidents, the flux of the liuer doth concurre, wherein, as was ſayd before,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:6264:139"/>
the excrements are wateriſh, and like vnto that water wherein raw fleſh hath beene waſhed. And theſe excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſo often changed, as the diſtemper of the liuer is changed.</p>

                  <p>A tumour and loading paine is felt in the ſpleens region, by reaſon of the plenty of matter. Sometimes this tumour is hard, ſometime looſe, which ſometimes fills the whole ſide, and part of the matter is ſometime ſpred abroad into the kell or cawle wherein the bowels are lapt; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is incloſed in the ſpleenes roomes. If the patient doth runne much, or elſe exerciſe himſelfe but moderately, he doth breathe with diffiulty; the like alſo happens, if he do rather lye on his right ſide then left; becauſe this bowell hangs not ſo much, neyther is the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the bignes of the bowell. They who are troubled with this diſeaſe, do not well concoct their meate, and yet they haue good ſtomacks: great ſtore of ſpettle, and many windineſſes are generated: the latter of theſe doe cauſe rumbling, and wauing in the left ſide; their bellies are ſtiffe; alſo layzines doth cocurre; their dreams are trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and their heads heauy. From hence feare, and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of liuing longer doth enſue. Their bellies for the moſt
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:6264:142"/>
part are bound, but when the matter is more corrupted, and doth begin to rage, as it were in the body, then all the aforeſayd ſigns are more manifeſt. The colour of the face is vitiated, and the whole body is corrupted by them; whereby the mouth ſtinks, the gummes are eaten, and do part from the teeth, the place vnderneath the eylid ſwels, blood breaks forth, but chefly at the noſe, the feeet ſwell, a little before night; many blacke ſpots, and euill vlcers ſcarce to be cured, do appeare vpon the Hands, and Legs; eſpecially if blood hath not beene voyded at the noſe: at the length he doth ſleepe very diſquietly, and the patient doth draw his breath with great trouble, and in the night time hee ſnorts much, eſpecially at the forepart of the night.</p>

                  <p>It is cauſed for the moſt part by melancholy humours, which are the dregs of blood, and are caught into the ſpleene from the veines of the body, and there remaine for a long time. Or elſe it is cauſed, becauſe all the veines of the body doe flow with ſuch melancholy blood; for this bowell by nature is appointed to receiue it; or it is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſpleene in ſo great abundance, that the paſſages are ſtopped, thorow which this excrement is thruſt out of the ſpleene into the ſtomacke, or belly. Sometimes ſuch ſtore hereof is gathered in the ſpleene, that it doth ſtretch the whole ſubſtance thereof: So that when ſuch plenty is therein gathered, firſt a looſe tumor is bredde, and then remaining long in the bowell, becauſe of the weaknes of the expulſiue faculty, or elſe for ſome other cauſe, in time by force of heate it doth grow thicke and hard, whereby great abſtruction of the veines and paſſages are cauſed, thorow which the ſpleene was wont to be purged: in time alſo this matter doth grow hard, and hereof is cauſed the <hi>Schirrhus</hi> of the ſpleene. This alſo happens in the infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſpleene, whenas ſuch medicines are applied, that are aſtringent aboue meaſure, or elſe diſſolue the

                  <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                  <p>Sometimes it comes by increaſe of choller, through the liuers too hot diſtemper; for hereby ſuch ſtore of choller is generated, that the gall cannot containe it, and then a boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling heate is felt about the ſeat of the liuer in the left ſide: the excrements are ſtayned with choller, the vrine is thicke, &amp; like to Saffron, alſo lazines, and difficulty of breathing doth concurre, and then eſpecially the latter two may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, whenas the patient doth exerciſe himſelfe. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it is cauſed, becauſe the liuer, or the paſſages that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:6264:147"/>
goe from the liuer into the galls bladder, or from thence into the bowels, are ſtopt; for then the liuer cannot auoyd cholericke humours by thoſe places which are deſtined by nature for that purpoſe, by which meanes, the blood muſt needs be impure: and the cholericke humor flying backe into the veines, is mixed with blood, and then doth ſpread it ſelfe ouer the whole body: a heauines is felt on the right ſide, and the excrements are white. Sometime this diſeaſe is cauſed by the default of the whole body when as the naturall heate in euery part of the body is made ſharpe and biting, becauſe of the parts too hot diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; for then the humours do rather turne into gall, and ſometimes into ſo great abundance, that the gall is mixed with blood encloſed in the veines, by which meanes the whole body is ſtayned with gall, and died with a golden colour; alſo a great itch breaks forth, and a dulnes of mind and ſenſes, feeblenes and lazines doe concurre. Sometimes it is cauſed by cholericke Feauers, becauſe the offending matter is thruſt out of the body by the naturall force, into the vttermoſt parts of the body, and ſo leaues an impreſſion in thoſe parts thorow which it did paſſe, and the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are then naturall: alſo the vrine retains the perfect colour, and hereby the patient may be ridde of his ague. The yellow Iaundiſe cauſed after this ſort, doth ariſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly. Sometimes it is cauſed by inflamation of the liuer, in which caſe the whole body is ſtained with gally excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by reaſon of the great heate of the blood; and then the excrements and vrine are died with a very yellow colour; alſo a vehement ague concurs, the colour of the face is changed, the patient doth thirſt much, and doth feele a loathing paine in the region of the liuer.

                  <p>If the yellow Iaundiſe continue long, it doth threaten danger of a dropſy; eſpecially if the vrine be long time watry: for then a great obſtruction is cauſed by the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els coldnes. It is alſo dangerous, if the liuer waxeth hard; alſo it is an ill ſigne if the patients haue no appetite, if they be troubled with waking and doting, or if they ſpeake with difficulty. If this diſeaſe be cauſed by default of the ſpleene, it doth laſt longer then if it were cauſed by the diſtemper of the liuer. And as the yellow Iaundiſe, ſo ſometime the blacke choler is cauſed by the liuer, but the ſpleene ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer cauſeth the yellow choler. It is dangerous if an ague follow the yellow Iaundiſe. But if it doth come vpon one in ſharpe diſeaſes, as the euill is doubtfull, ſo it is hardly to be ſhaked off. Yet if it be cauſed on the Criticall day, and good ſignes of concoction do appeare, and no hardnes doth ariſe in the Liuer, it is a good ſigne; for this ſhews that the expulſiue faculty hath got the victory; but if it be cauſed before the Criticall day, it is an euill ſigne. It is good that the hemroids runne in this diſeaſe.

Gall cannot deſcend, which ſhould ſtirre vp the bowels for the auoyding of the excrements. After this, the groſſe humors ſhall bee made obedient vnto nature, with cutting, fining and opening medicines, and after they are concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ſhall bee thruſt out of the body: then the bowels ſhall be ſtrengthned, and the paſſages opened. If it be cauſed by inflamation of the liuer, that muſt firſt be cured.

               <head>A method ſeruing for the knowledge of the diſeaſe of the <hi>WORMES.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT is euident that Wormes may breed in many parts of the body: for they breed in rotten vlcers, in teeth, in eares, and kidneys. Yet in this chapter onely mention is made of thoſe Wormes alone which do breed in the bowels; which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lumbrici.</hi> Some of theſe are long and round, &amp; breed oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:6264:151"/>
then the reſt, and are like the worms that do breed in the earth; ſome are long and broad in the likenes of gourd ſeeds, and theſe are ſpred ſometimes ouer all the bowels; for they haue beene ſeene of incredible length. There are ſome alſo that are very little, if they be compared with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which in Latine are called <hi>Aſcarides,</hi> and are like mites breeding in rotten cheeſe.</p>
               <div type="affected_parts">
                  <head>The part affected.</head>
                  <p>The guts are heere affected, for in them all ſorts of wormes are bredde whereof we ſpeake, and the ſtraight guts are troubled with <hi>Aſcarides,</hi> or mites. Long round wormes breed in the vpper guts, from whence ſometimes they fall into the belly, and they are ſometime voyded at the mouth, ſometimes at the noſe. But broad wormes which are farre longer, and thinner then the reſt, are ſpred ouer all the guts: for by reaſon of their length, they do as well touch the thinne guts, as the thicke.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="signs">
                  <head>Signes.</head>
                  <p>They that are troubled with mites, haue an extreme itch in the fundament, and narrow guts, and they haue a deſire to go to ſtoole often. And ſometimes the right gut ſlides out of the body, but after they haue voyded ſomewhat, they are not ſo much troubled, becauſe they are voyded for the moſt part with the excrement. But long and round wormes do ſticke intangled in the guts paſſages, and then grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous accidents do enſue. For through want of meate, they do often aſcend vp into the ſtomacke, and diſtreſſeth it by biting, and doe alſo ſtirre vp ſuch biting panyes, that diſſolution, choking, alſo trembling of the body, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times faintnes of the heart doth follow; and then great panting of the heart, and a cold ſweate enſues: oftentimes a deſire to vomit, and ſometime they vomit: a yexing and dry cough is alſo ſtirred vp, and the face looks red, and they are caſt into a ſudden heate, yet it doth not laſt long.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:6264:151"/>
Hence is it that ſome ſtart out of their ſleeps and do cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, peraduenture they do leape out of their beds. Some doe grynd their teeth, and toſſe their bodies after ſundry ſort; yet they are more troubleſome in the day time then in the night: when they bee waking, their noſe is troubled with an itch; in the night their mouth is hot with ſpettle, their belly ſwels, &amp; is as hard as if they were troubled with the dropſy; alſo the belly is very much wrung. Sometime a flux likewiſe enſueth, and a paleneſſe of the face. For the moſt part the body is waſted, when as there are ſuch ſtore of wormes, that the nouriſhment that the patient doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, is ſcarce ſufficient to feed them, and if they do want this nouriſhment, preſently they get vp to the ſtomacke, and there afflict the patient with continuall gripings; they cauſe the patient to haue a good appetite, and ſometime a doggiſh and rauenous greedines, yet for the moſt part they are leane; they do often thirſt; and inordinate Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, ſomewhat like quotidians, are cauſed, which bring horror with them. And as the appetite is ſometime great, ſo ſometime it is very ſmall. All theſe accidents muſt not bee expected in all men; the broad worme, when it doth trouble the patient, as it hath many ſignes in common with thoſe that are round, ſo alſo a leanneſſe of body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs; much food is deſired, which being digeſted, is ſoone voyded, whereby he is forced to take freſh meate; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there wilbe a gnawing of the guts. There is alſo a ſure ſigne of this broad worme noted in the ſtoole: for little bodies are mingled withall, like vnto Gourd and Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber-ſeeds, and it is the proper excrement of theſe ſorts of wormes.</p>

               <div type="causes">
                  <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                  <p>The cauſe of wormes in common is rottennes, or groſſe, phlegmy, and ſlymy matter, ſuch as is apt to corrupt; alſo a putrifying heate accompanies all theſe, which doth prepare this matter, and then it is wrought vp by the perfuſion of naturall heate, which doth giue life to the wormes. By
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:6264:152"/>
ſalt, ſharpe, or bitter humours, wormes are neuer genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but rather are deſtroyed by them. In concluſion, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and ſweet fruits which are ſoone rotted, do breed wormes.</p>

               <div type="prognosis">
                  <head>Prognoſtiques.</head>
                  <p>Many men haue made a ſlight matter of being troubled with round worms, but in the end haue proued, that the danger of being moleſted with them, is not ſmall: for they do eate vp many, and they do ſo fret the guts of others, that they bring them in danger of death: the greater worms are more dangerous then the leſſer, many then few, red then white, liuing then dead; but ſuch as are diuerſly coloured are worſe then all the reſt; for they are a ſigne of a far greater putrifaction. <hi>Aſcarides</hi> are leaſt dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be little and ſlender; and becauſe they do breed in a place moſt remote from the principall parts of the body, namely, in the ſtreight gut. Oftentimes grieuous diſeaſes are cauſed by them, and ſometime they procure ſudden death; ſometimes they do caſt one into a ſwound; ſometimes they do bring the falling ſicknes, and a rauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appetite, ſometime the collicke, or an inordinate Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which doth afflict the patient twice or thrice with cold and hot fits in the ſpace of 24 houres; for the moſt part they annoy children, and ſuch as are come to ripenes of yeers. Wormes voyded in the beginning of a Feauer, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no good. For by them may be perceiued, that there is great ſtore of rotten and pernitions matter in the body, if they be voyded ſymptomatically in the ſtate and heighth of a Feauer: but if they be voyded in the declination of a Feauer, there is ſome hope of health.</p>

When it may be diſcerned by the ſignes, that Wormes are in the body, preſently ſuch medicines muſt be giuen as may kill them. But when medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for this purpoſe are receiued in at the mouth, then alſo a playſter muſt bee layd vnto the belly; but before ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines bee giuen that may kill the Wormes, the patient muſt drink new Cowes milke for the ſpace of 4. or 5. dayes, and the medicine preſcribed for the killing of wormes, may be diſſolued in Cow milke, or elſe they may bee adminiſtred with Hony and Sugar. If children bee vnwilling to receiue bitter things, they muſt be forced thereto; eyther they may bee put into a ſirenge, and by that meanes conueyed into their mouthes, &amp; body, or by a clyſter pipe; afterward ſuch ſhall bee adminiſtred as will expell them: Sowre, bitter, ſharpe, and ſalt things, not onely hinder the breeding of

               <head>A method ſeruing for the knowledge of <hi>DYSENTERIA,</hi> or <hi>FLVX</hi> of the Belly.</head>
               <p>A Dyſentery ſo properly called, is a flux of the belly with exulceration, and excoriation, whereto great paine with gripings is ioyned. Chiefly fat corpulent bodies are galled by ſharpe humours, and ſometimes the filmes of the inner tunicle of the bowels are voyded by ſtoole; this happens when the diſeaſe hath taken deepe roote in the guts ſometime blood is voyded, and it is a ſigne of ſome filthy vlcer, if great ſtore of blood be voyded without paine: if it doth ſtinke much, then the vlcer is putrified; euen as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menbdable matter is a ſigne of a cleane vlcer. Sometimes the lood is voyded without a flux, firſt, in regard of the weaknes of the liuer, and then the excrements doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the water where in raw fleſh hath beene waſhed. Secondly, in regard of the obſtruction of the higher veſſels, &amp; then that which is voyded downward, is cleere: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are ſuppreſſed for the ſpace of 3 or 4 days and there, worſe excrements are voyded then the firſt, and after,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:6264:155"/>
thinne bloody matter, a groſſe humour not much vnlike wine-lees is voyded; ſometime without any vlcer of the bowels or obſtruction of the vpper veines, or weaknes of the liuer, red and liquid blood is voyded in great plenty, and at certaine diſtances of times.</p>
               <div type="affected_parts">
                  <head>The parts affected.</head>
                  <p>The inward parts are affected; and thoſe things that are voyded, do teſtifie as much; the excrements are thicke, and ſome fat or bloody drops are mixed therewith, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times foamy, which is voyded with wind; this blood for the moſt part as it were, ſwims vpon the excrements, if the vlcer be faſtened on the inward bowels. But if the paine reſt about the nauell, or ſomewhat higher, and that a quantity of blood is mixed and drowned with the ſtoole, and if it doth ſtinke, and be cholericke, and haue diuers colours, and if great gripings and pains are ſtirred vp, and if it doth cauſe ſwounding and faintnes of the heart, the diſeaſe is in the ſmaller guts, and then fat geere is ſeldomer auoyded. whenas the gut called <hi>Ieiunum inteſtinum</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, the paine is aboue the nauell, and a great quey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines of ſtomacke, and propenſion to vomit ariſeth, and oftentimes vomiting doth follow, alſo thirſt, and loathing of meate is ſometimes cauſed; the excrements are raw, and blackiſh blood is mixed therewith. In this caſe a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Feauer follows, inſomuch that the ſtrength is almoſt diſſolued, and the patient is almoſt at deaths doore.

                  <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                  <p>The flux is cauſed by ſharpe humours, and ſuch as are biting, and very much putrified, whether they be bredde in the bowels, or elſe come from ſome other parts of the body, as from the greater veines of the liuer, ſpleene, and other adioyning parts, but eſpecially if theſe humours do ſticke in the winding of the guts. It is alſo cauſed by briniſh phlegmy yellow choler, alſo by burnt and blacke choler, which are cauſed by continuall crudities of ſharpe and naughty meates, euill fruits, venemous and excoriating medicines, and by extreme cold or heate. Sometimes a dyſſentery is cauſed by inflamation, but that wilbe knowne by the ſignes of an inflamation.</p>

                     </gap>eſh and pieces of the guts be voyded, as alſo if the patient be weake, the flux is mortall, becauſe the fleſh cannot grow together, nor the vlcer be made hard. A loathing of meate, eſpecially if the patient haue an ague, is dangerous in long fluxes. Thoſe fluxes are worſt, when the excrements do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the colour of a Leeke, and when they be blackiſh, and do ſtinke very much a dyſſentery comming vpon ſuch as are troubled with the tumour of the ſpleene, is good; for hereby melancholy humours which were in the ſpleene
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:6264:156"/>
are euacuated. A diſſentery which is in the ſmall guts, is hardly cured, but it wilbe cured with more eaſe, if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentery be in the greater guts. If it be cauſed by blacke cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, the diſſentery is hardly cured, becauſe a canker doth come withall. Theſe frettings are with great paine: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do depend vpon a deepe and old vlcer, and if there be a great failing of ſtrength, there is hope of life. Then the excrements do ſtinke very much, and are light, and of a blackiſh colour. If the diſſentery be turned into a flux of the ſtomacke, there is great danger: a vehement collicke ſometimes followes the flux of the belly, becauſe the thinne is expelled, and the thicke is left. All fluxes of the belly that do cauſe a dropſy, are mortall, becauſe the cure of the dropſy muſt be by the flux of the belly.</p>

The paines of the collicke do afflict the belly, vnleſſe it be cauſed by thinne phlegme, for then it is ſtedfaſt; alſo the paines of the Collicke doe chiefly moleſt the right ſide, &amp; from thence is carried to the leſt; alſo it leaues ſome impreſſion neere vnto the reines and backe: and it is a more certaine token of the Collicke, if the paine bee felt in the places aboue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the kidneys: their bellies ſometimes are ſo bound, that nothing is voyded, not ſo much as winde. In the paine of the reines little ſandy bodies, ſometime aſtone, or bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy geare may bee perceiued when the vrine is ſettled, and when the ſtone is voyded, they are freede immediately of their paine; but none of theſe are voyded with the vrine in the Collicke, onely a thicke &amp; phlegmy choler is mixed with the vrine. Sometime vomit, oftner a propenſion to vomit is cauſed in the Collicke, and theſe be more troubleſome and continuall, then in the paine of the kidneys. The appetite and concoction is weakened, and by reaſon of great paines the vrine is gally, and ſcalding hot, and doth falſely repreſent a cholericke nature: and this happens, becauſe choler is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed to the kidneys, by reaſon the paſſages of the bowels, thorow which the gall is vſually voyded, are ſtopped, that

                  <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                  <p>There be many cauſes of the collicke, becauſe diuers matters do runne to the guts by reaſon of their widenes. But there be foure chiefe cauſes of this diſeaſe; eyther firſt it is cauſed by inflamation of the ſame part, and then the paine is more ſettled and bitter, heate, thirſt, an inclination to vomit, loathing of meate, &amp; ſometimes vomiting of choler doth enſue; they are bound, and retaine their vrine long; alſo there is an inward heate, and ague ready to moleſt them: or ſecondly it is cauſed by a ſharpe biting humor, and then the heate and thirſt, alſo the Feauer is not ſo great as if it were cauſed by an inflamation; coolers do not a little eaſe the patient; the excrements that are voyded, are mixed with choler, and in the voyding of the vrine, a ſharpe paine is felt: or elſe thirdly it is cauſed by ſlymy and groſſe humors, and by thinne phlegme that is in the filme of the <hi>Colon,</hi> and then the paine is more ſtedfaſt, and hardly to be cured, vnleſſe the matter be euacuated; and the inner gut is as it were bored thorow with an anger; they do vomit phlegmy humors, and a propenſion to vomit oftener with belchings doth concurre; the belly is ſo bound, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can paſſe thorow it, and if the patient doth belch, very ſmall eaſe doth enſue. Hot things do eaſe the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: and becauſe that <hi>Colon</hi> is the receptacle of winds, the collicke is often cauſed by them, whenas great plenty of them is gathered together in thoſe places. Theſe are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſhut vp in the <hi>Colons</hi> filmes by dregs too much hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; forthly, it is cauſed by ſlymy and groſſe phlegme, ſticking in the common paſſages: and ſometimes from a tumor remayning in the inner bowels, whereby the guts are ſo ſtrongly preſſed, hat the wind can ſcarce get foth, and then extreme pains are cauſed: the patient doth feele great gripings and rumblings in the belly, but when the ſtopping is ſo great, that the excrements can haue no way forth, <hi>Iliaca paſſio</hi> is cauſed.</p>

               <p>IF the paine be immoderate, firſt that ſhall be aſſwaged, and the cauſe alſo by degrees muſt bee taken away, the paine ſhall be eaſed by lenitiue medicines, and if theſe will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, ſtupifying medicines muſt be then vſed: theſe may be vſed alſo at the firſt, for in delay there is danger; and yet they muſt not be vſed, except the caſe be deſperate, for if the cauſe be firſt taken away, the paine will be mitigated. This diſeaſe for the moſt part is cauſed by windes and phlegmy matter, and then the paine will alſo be mitigated, if the cauſe bee taken away, (which is the matter that doth cauſe the Collicke) by a gentle Clyſter, and this is better then that which is taken in at the mouth: but in the <hi>Iliaca paſſio,</hi> medicines giuen at the mouth are beſt. Yet becauſe the Collicke and <hi>Iliaca paſſio</hi> haue one, and the ſame cauſe, one and the ſame way of curing ſhall bee vſed, onely here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they doe ſomewhat differ, becauſe <hi>Iliaca paſſio</hi> is cauſed by an obſtruction in the thinne bowels: the Collicke is cauſed by obſtructions in the thicke and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er bowels. Wherefore at the firſt a purging medicine is good, and within one houre after, a Clyſter will bee good. Amongſt all medicines that are vſed, diſcuſſors of the wind, and aſſwagers of the paine ſhall be mixed, and then ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines ſhalbe preſcribed that doe ſtrengthen the bowels, and amend the diſtemper. For this purpoſe a clyſter made of Hyppocras is beſt. If part of the matter be voyded by cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters from the inward parts, and if the reſidue doe fall from ſome other parts into the belly, then the whole body ſhall be purged; whenas preparing medicines haue bin duly vſed. In ſtrong obſtructions ℥ v. of common oyle with the broth of Chickens, wherein the flowers of Cammomile haue bin boyled, may be taken; and then for the ſpace of 4. houres

nothing elſe ſhalbe admitted. The patient muſt not drinke water. And alſo ſtrong purging medicines muſt be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, eſpecially in the beginning of the diſeaſe; leſt the matter that is at a ſtand, ſhould fall downe into the belly, and ſo the diſeaſe wilbe made worſe then it was.

               <p>THe dropſy is ſuch a paſſion, that it is not without plenty of watery humors, becauſe the blood-breeding faculty is vitiated; it is a long diſeaſe, and for the moſt part cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by coldnes of the liuer. There be 3 kinds of dropſy, <hi>Anaſarca, Aſcites, Tympanites,</hi> which are diſtinguiſhed both by their matter and place. <hi>Anaſarca</hi> is a ſcattering of phlegmy humors ouer the whole body. In this diſeaſe, the whole body increaſeth moſt vnnaturally, for it is all ouer ſwelled, and a humor mixed with phlegmy blood is ſpred ouer all the body, betweene the skinne and the fleſh, and the body doth ſucke it vp, euen as a ſponge ſucks vp water: and by reaſon of this, an euill colour appears all ouer. <hi>Aſcites</hi> is that, when great ſtore of winds, but greater of water, is gathered together in that place, which doth lie betweene the guts and <hi>Syphach.</hi> In this diſeaſe firſt the belly and <hi>Abdomen</hi> by little and little, then the thighes are ſwelled, and all the other parts of the body waxe leane. But when there is greater ſtore of wind then water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Abdomen</hi> is ſtretched beyond meaſure, then it is called <hi>Tympanites,</hi> and then rather a noyſe of wind then water, is perceiued; if the belly be ſtrooke, for there is the ſound of a taber, from whence this diſeaſe hath taken its name. Alſo the naturall colour of the face is nor altered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such a ſound as this is not heard in <hi>Aſcites,</hi> but when

                  <p>The common ſignes of a Dropſy are theſe. They are for the moſt part troubled with a feauer, and doe thirſt very much, eſpecially if they be troubled with <hi>Aſcites</hi>: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Salt and putrified humors, they loathe meate, the colour of their face is whitiſh, hardneſſe of breathing, and heauineſſe of the body concurs, alſo ſwelling of the feete, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the diſtances of the heart. In <hi>anaſarca,</hi> the whole body is weakened, doth faynt and ſwell equally, yet for the moſt part the ſwelling is in the ſhinnes and feete, ſo that the prints of ones finger being thruſt into the fleſh, will remaine a long time. The belly is not heere puffed vp as in <hi>Aſcites,</hi> yet being touched, it is felt to be thicker, and their fleſh like vnto thoſe that are dead, are ſtiffe, looſe, and pale: a lingring feauer concurres, their vrines are thinne and white, eſpecially after meate, they alwaies draw breath with great difficulty, but in the <hi>Aſcites,</hi> the belly is more ſwelled and the other parts of the body doe wither away; they do alſo breathe with difficulty, becauſe the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> is cruſhed by the tumor. And as the diſeaſe doth increaſe, ſo
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:6264:166"/>
the cods, thighs, and feet do by little and little ſwell: if the patient do ſtirre himſelfe from one ſide vnto the other, the belly wauers; and this is cauſed by watry huwors which remaine in the <hi>Abdomen</hi>: and no maruayle, for the inward parts do as it were ſwim in water. Alſo in the beginning of the diſeaſe, they do voyd much by vrine, and by little and little they do voyd leſſe, and doe waxe more red, and groſſe. The patient alſo is very thirſty, and alſo an ague doth feaze on him in <hi>Tympanites</hi> the face ſwerues not ſo much from its naturall colour, and a noyſe, like vnto the ſound of a taber, is heard, if the belly be ſomewhat beaten vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <head>The Cauſes.</head>
                  <p>A great cooling of the veines and liuer, is the cauſe of this moſt long and ſore diſeaſe, whereof a great abundance of humors are generated. This happens to the liuer, eyther by it ſelfe, or elſe by the coldnes of the ſpleene, guts, meſentery, kidneys, mydriffe, which ſometime becauſe of their obſtruction, ſometimes becauſe of their weaknes, draw not vnto them too much blood; alſo it is cauſed by to much bleeding at the noſe, or by immoderate running or ſtaying of moneths, or hemroids: for ſo the naturall heate is choaked by the loſſe of ſpirits with the blood. Sometime this diſeaſe is cauſed by the flux of the belly or ſtomacke, if they do laſt long: for the naturall ſpirits, and natiue heate are ſcattered. Alſo they who are ſicke of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aundiſe, or the ioynt gowte, as of the feet or hips, often fall into a dropſy. Alſo they who are ſpent with long agues, whereby naturall heate &amp; ſpirits are ſcattered: as alſo fayling of the liuer, too much drinking of cold water after heate or exerciſe of the body, is cauſe of it. In concluſion, whatſoeuer doth breake the force of the liuer, ſo that it cannot turne the iuyce into blood, doth alſo cauſe a Feauer but <hi>Aſcites</hi> doth ariſe not only of too much cooling, or crudity of the parts, as <hi>Anaſarca</hi> doth
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:6264:167"/>
but is often cauſed by too much breache of ſome bowels, or continuity of veſſels, wherein humors are contained. And for that reaſon, all things that doe dry the liuer, as burning feauers, too much vſe of ſtrong wins, and hot nutriments, doe often cauſe a Dropſie: becauſe the bowels, but oftener the liuer by too much dryneſſe, wither away; whereby the humors doe ſlide thorow ſome chinkes in the bowels cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by dryneſſe in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> by ſweating out, and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Oftentimes it is cauſed by a hard tumor of the liuer, ſpleene, or other parts, for ſo the bowels are cleft by too much dryneſſe, and want of moyſture, whereby in time, the filmes, going round about them, doe breake, and ſo by little and little, watriſh and wheyiſh excrements fall downe into the <hi>Abdomen.</hi>

They who are ſuppurated, or haue a Dropſie, when they be cut, or burnt, if that water or matter doth runne out, they dye preſently. Alſo if a cough doe ſeize on them that haue a Dropſie, or if the diſeaſe doth come againe after the patients are cut, they are in a deſperate caſe. Of all theſe dropſies, <hi>Tympanites</hi> is the worſt, next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, <hi>Aſcites,</hi> but <hi>Anaſarca</hi> is eaſier then all the reſt to be cured. For it is a ſigne that nature is not quite decayed, when that which is hurtfull, is ſpred ouer the whole body. All ancient Dropſies, and ſuch as haue corrupted the habits of the body, are very dangerous, and not very eaſily cured. If the Dropſy be cauſed by a hard tumour of the liuer, or ſpleene, the diſeaſe is incurable. They that are in a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the moſt part fall into a Dropſy, becauſe this euill is communicated vnto the liuer: for matter, and venomous filth, hauing found a way into the liuer, get in and ſticke faſt therein, and ſo doe corrput the ſubſtance of the liuer.</p>

The bignes of the ſtone is vncertaine, and as they haue diuers colours, and formes, ſo they are not alwayes of one bignes. For ſometimes ſmall ſtones are bred in the reines, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times great, which do varie much in forme, roughnes, and color.

Yet ſo long as the ſtone moues not, rather a loading then pricking paine is felt lying vpon the kidneys, which for the moſt part is ſettled, and ſtedfaſt, and which doth ſometime reach vnto the neereſt teſticle, ſometime to the hippe: the belly for the moſt part is bound, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the paine in the kidney is increaſed, becauſe the kidny is cruſhed by wind and abundance of excrements, a quei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines of ſtomacke and propenſion to vomit concurs: when the paine is increaſed, the patient hath a greater deſire to vomit; at the length they doe vomit phlegme and choler, and ſometimes greeniſh choler is voyded, whereby the paine is aſſwaged, for the reines are ioyned to the ſtomacke by <hi>Peritoneum.</hi> Alſo the paines doe increaſe by lying on the contrary ſide, and when the patient is full fedde: an

               <p>TWice in euery weeke the belly ſhall bee kept looſe by a Clyſter, and ſuch medicines ſhalbe mixed with it, as do diſcuſſe the winds in the body, and aſſwage the paine. But Clyſters that are too ſtrong, are prohibited, for hereby the humors would be drawne inwards, and by that meanes, the paſſage of the vrine hindred. If neceſſity require, a veine ſhall be opened, but the beſt way to mitigate the paine, is by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying inward and outward medicines, ſuch that by prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to ſleepe do take away the ſence of paine. After theſe, the humors, that are gathered together ſhalbe ſoftned, and the paſſages from the reines vnto the bladder ſhalbe made wider, and this may be effected by baths of fat broth, and the vſe of Cataplaſmes, and then the grauell and ſtones will with more eaſe be voyded. But before theſe be adminiſtred, the ſafeſt courſe would bee to purge all the body, if it can be perceiued that the body is full: otherwiſe not. After all this another Clyſter may be made with <hi>Hiera picra, Lithontri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, electu, eleſcopi, Benedicta laxatiua,</hi> oyle of Rew: and at the length ſomewhat ſhall bee taken at the mouth to expell the ſtone. And euen as the ſtone of the kidneys and bladder haue great affinity, becauſe they haue one &amp; the ſame cauſe, &amp; are a like generated; ſo they may be both cured after one manner;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:6264:175"/>
but the ſtone will require ſtronger medicines, becauſe it hath a harder ſubſtance; in this diſeaſe the ventricle ſhall be ſtrengthned with the Oyles of Mace, Mints, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Roſes. If the patient be pained with great heate in the reine, they ſhalbe anoynted with the Oyle of Violets: and Roſes, whereto ſome Vineger ſhalbe added. If the ſtone haue fallen once into the bladder, it cannot be expelled by medicines, becauſe of its greatnes, and therefore it muſt be cut out.</p>

                  <hi>DIabaetes</hi> is a default of the kidneys, and a ſwift paſſage of that which is drunke thorow the body, the drinke being nothing altered; alſo an vnmeaſurable thirſt followes, or elſe <hi>Diabaetes</hi> is a long continued affection reſting about the kidneyes, which doth cauſe great deſire to drinke, and drinke being receiued into the body, it is but as it were ſtrayned thorow the reines, and ſo voyded: for the beere is not much altered or changed.</p>

                  <p>Both the kidneys are affected, as appeares by the action that is hurt. For the reines do purge all the other veines fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their watery blood: but in this diſeaſe the reines ſnatch it away by force from the neighboring parts. The veines by theſe means being, dry they do draw moyſture fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the liuer, and by a continuation of order, from the ſtomake; this is the cauſe that a man doth deſire drinke, onely to ſatiſfie the reins. For this cauſe <hi>Diabates</hi> may properly be ſayd to be an affect of the reines: the diſeaſe of the reines, &amp; of the mouth of the ſtomacke are ſomewhat alike, when as the ſtomacke continually gapes for more. The attractiue faculty of the kidneys drawes immoderately, &amp; the retentiue faculty is ſo weake, that it cannot retaine the moiſture that is attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

Sometimes it is auoyded with ſuch force, that in ſtead of groſſe, blacke, &amp; melancholy blood, great ſtore of pure blood is voyded. Sometimes theſe veines are ſtretched and ſwelled, and yet no blood is voyded: and this is as much againſt nature, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and then is a man afflicted with great paine, and then they are called obſcure hemroids.

Heere blood is voyded with the excrements, but is not mixed with them, but rather doth lie aboue the excrements, no paine concurring, but in the flux of the belly the excrements and the blood are mixed together: nature helpes the diſeaſes of the reines and liuer by ſuch excretion, thorow the former branches: the latter branches nature vſeth, for to helpe the default of the ſpleene, the meſeraicke veines, and other adioyning parts, the part affected is formerly mentioned to be the veines in the Fundament.</p>

If the Hemroids be ſtayd againſt nature, then the backe, hips, kidneys, breſt, and fundament are pained; if blood from the Hemroids bee ſtayed in the ſtraight gut, it doth reſemble a clodde of red blood; if the blood come from a weake liuer, it is like vnto the water wherein raw fleſh newly killed hath beene waſhed; the meſentery veine ſheads a ſmall quantity hereof: If any veines of the vper parts be burſt, or eaten thorow, or too much opened, the blood which is ſhed by continuall boyling, doth reſemble pitch; for it lookes blacke and is as it were burnt. If blood be voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded becauſe of the fluxe of the belly, the ſignes hereof were formerly mentioned. By theſe ſignes may be diſcerned from whence the blood comes, becauſe the blood runs out at the fundament, from many parts of the body.

               <p>THat the liuer be not cooled by immoderate euacuation of blood, or that the ſtrength of the body be not caſt downe, the courſe of the blood flowing too faſt ſhall bee hindred. If ſharp and thin humors be mixed with the blood, firſt they ſhall be made obedient to nature, and then expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by purging medicines. After this a veine ſhalbe opened, (if the patients ſtrength will permit) partly that the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of the blood may be diminiſhed, partly that the force of the blood running another way, may be hindred. For this purpoſe Auerters are preſcribed. When all this is done, ſuch medicines ſhalbe preſcribed, as will cloze vp the veines, &amp; thicken the blood: and alſo the paine muſt bee mitigated: but if the Hemroids be not apparent, the belly ſhall be looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with fat fleſh broth, or extracted <hi>Caſſia,</hi> becauſe the paine is cauſed by ſharpe and hard dregges ſettled in thoſe parts. And when they firſt breake forth, the firſt and chiefe care ſhall be, that the paine bee aſſwaged, and afterwards that they be dried vp, becauſe this euacuation is vnnaturall: neyther may it be lawfull to prouoke the Hemroids, vnleſſe extreme paine or ſwelling forceth vs: or vnleſſe a man be in danger of death by their not flowing, then it ſhalbe lawfull to ſet bloodſuckers to the part affected, but firſt that part

they breake forth in the firſt moneth, when women be with child, and not againſt reaſon, becauſe the mouth of the wombe is not ſo faſt bound, as it is afterwards, when as the ſmalleſt body cannot get in. And ſometimes in women with childe, after that the mouth of the wombe is clozed vp eyther moneths, (as it doth ſometimes fall out in maids,) or ſomewhat like vnto the moneths is voyded through the branches of the hollow veines, which are faſtned to the necke and mouth of the wombe, in ſuch fort, as the Hemroids veines are terminated in the end of the right guts.</p>

This affect is an accident which appertaines vnto immoderate excretion, and it is not altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature, as it is in the bleeding of the noſe, or other bleedings, for herein only too great a quantity of the moneth is vnnaturall.</p>

                  <p>If the moneths flow immoderately, the appetite is taken away the digeſtion is hindered, and crudities are in all parts of the body. The whole body is weake, and a great feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſtrength followes, and this is a certaine ſigne that the moneths flow too faſt.

                  <p>Superfluity of moneths run out, firſt by reaſon of the heate of blood, thinneſſe, or abundance, more then is requiſite: or elſe be cauſe of the continuall motion thereof, for when theſe
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:6264:184"/>
concurre, nature is defeated. Sometimes there is ſuch ſtore of blood, that it doth not only open the veines, but doth breake them open by force, which ſometimes happens by too violent exerciſes. This doth chance to thoſe that are vntimely, deliuered &amp; alſo to thoſe that are deliuered with paine, whether it be by the infants croſſe comming out, or elſe by his bigneſſe: the hot ſeaſon of the yeere, the vſe of hot baths, and ſuch like do cauſe the opening of the veſſels. Sometimes this flux happens, becauſe ſome veines are open by a fretting exulceration, which happens in the necke of the wombe, by the ſharpnes of blood: and this is knowne by that which is voyded, becauſe mattry and virulent matter is voyded with the blood, and ſometimes it is ſtinking. Alſo a greater paine is felt about the wombe: Sometime ſtore of blood is voyded by the rupture of the greater veines, whereof many are terminated in the mouth of the wombe. The leſſer veines voyd but little, and that confuſedly. Againe this flux is cauſed by too frequent copulation, as alſo by the weaknes of the retentiue faculty; and in concluſion, venemous, putrified and biting humors cauſe this flux.</p>

If by vntimely birth, the danger is ſudden, and therefore the greater: If it be cauſed by fretting or an vlcer, it is hardly cured; becauſe of the euill complexion of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors which are gathered about the wombe, and becauſe many ſuperfluities are mixed with the blood, medicines are preſcribed in vaine. And as by the vtter ſtay of the moneths, there is danger of a dropſy; ſo alſo by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate flowing of the tearms, the ſame diſeaſe is alſo to be feared; eſpecially if the body be weakned, or the colour of the face changed, becauſe a woman is heereby brought vnto great coldnes, faintnes of the heart, ſwounding; and ſometimes death is like to enſue.</p>

               <p>WHen it ſhall bee perceiued that the body is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ouerflowing of the tearmes, then they ſhall be ſuppreſſed. If plenty of blood be the cauſe of it, a veine ſhall be opened, and a ſlender diet ſhall be preſcribed, and ſuch meats as doe generate blood, ſhall be auoyded: but if this diſeaſe bee cauſed by watery blood, or elſe the heate, ſharpeneſſe, or thinneſſe of the blood, firſt the offending humors ſhall bee digeſted, and then expelled by a purge. At the length Cupping-glaſſes ſhall bee vſed, that the courſe of the blood may bee turned another way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then the courſe of the blood may be ſtayed, the Orifices of the veines clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and the blood thickned, whereof ſome ſhall bee taken inward, and others outward; and becauſe in all fluxes the heart and liuer are weakened, therefore both thoſe bowels ſhall be corroborated. Iniections, and peſſaries of aſtringent things are herein of great force, becauſe they come ſooner to the part affected, then they that are taken in at the mouth. If this diſeaſe be cauſed by ſome eating vlcer in the wombe, it may be clenſed with water of Hony, and then healed with Frankincenſe, <hi>Aloes, Terra ſigillata,</hi> and other,

which were formerly mentioned. The ſame alſo may be vſed, if it be cauſed by a rupture. But they muſt be iniect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with red aſtringent wine, and if the body abound with ill humors, the body may bee firſt purged.

               <p>AS the ouerflowing is dangerous, ſo the retention on the contrary is as dangerous. The monethly tearmes are portions of blood deſtined by nature for generation, ouerflowing in the hollow veine, from whence it doth ſlide into the veines of the wombe, and by the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity the mouth of the veines are opened, and then drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out from thence, they runne out at the necke of the wombe once euery moneth. But the ſtaying of the moneths is altogether vnnaturall, if they bee of ripe age, vnleſſe they haue conceiued. This blood increaſeth in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men rather then in men, becauſe a woman is weaker, and of a colder conſtitution of body then man is, and therefore alſo cannot ſo well digeſt the nutriment, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they, by reaſon of their coldnes, concoct the nouriſhments in ſuch ſort as man can. Nature did order this for ſome ſpeciall cauſe, which is, that they ſhould giue plenty of food to their children when they are with child: &amp; as the moneths do begin at a ſet time, ſo they haue a time limi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed for their end. But if they be with child, as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſayd, then they doe not flow at all, leſt that a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage being open the nouriſhment which ſhould preſerue the child, might be auoyded with the ill humors the like
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:6264:188"/>
alſo happens to thoſe that giue ſucke, becauſe the blood is carried to the breſts, and there turned into Milke: in ſome the moneths runne at twelue yeeres, in other at foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene, or twenty; and they ceaſe about the 50 or 60 yeeres of a womans age: heere is only mention made of vnnaturall ſuppreſſion of monethly termes, which brings great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with it.</p>

                  <p>The wombe is chiefly affected in regard of the fatnes thereof, whereby the veines are cruſhed together, and ſo the flux is hindered. Sometimes fleſh growing in the wombe, or elſe ſcarres left after an vlcer, are in fault; ſometimes it is cauſed by the default of the other parts, and ſometime ſuperfluities are not conueyed to the wombe, as vſually they were.</p>

Sometimes they come not at their accuſtomed ſeaſon, becauſe they are conſumed by thinne diet, feare, too much thought, watchings, ſadnes, violent exerciſes, too

And in theſe cauſes it is not good to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the moneths: ſometimes it is cauſed by too hot or cold diſtemper of the whole body, or of the liuer, lungs, ſpleene, ſtomacke or wombe. For by a hot diſtemper the excrement is dried vp and conſumed: by a cold diſtemper it waxeth thicke and more tough, whereby the veſſels of the wombe are ſtopped.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>PRaefocatio vteri,</hi> or Mother, is a running backe of the wombe, or of maligne vapors bredde in the wombe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the higher parts, whereby the bowels, midriffe, and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, are ſometimes ſo cruſhed, that they cannot be wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by breathing: for it ſeemes in this diſeaſe, that the wombe is lifted vp ſo high, that it driues the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers aboue it, vnto the higher part; ſometimes alſo the wombe is drawne toward one ſide. This diſeaſe hath ſome affinity with the falling ſicknes, ſwounding, and apoplexy, becauſe the ſpeech is often taken away, and the party fals to the ground, or at the leaſt cannot indure to ſtand long: yet herein they differ, for in this diſeaſe there is no foaming at the mouth, neyther are the eyes turned, or the ſinewes ſtretched, which is neuer perceiued in the Mother. And as in this diſeaſe they haue the ſence of hearing, ſo they do in like manner vnderſtand, and feele the leaſt paine that doth touch them, though but very dully: yet in the falling ſicknes, they are deſtitute of all theſe. This diſeaſe alſo differs from the <hi>Sincope</hi> or ſwounding herein, becauſe the pulſe holds out, though it bee but little, thinne and faint; but in the <hi>Sincope</hi> the pulſe beates not, and beſides ſhe that is in a ſwound, looks paler then they do that are troubled with the Mother, &amp; a colder ſweate ouer-ſprreads their bodies.

it is affected by the conſent which the wombe hath with the principall parts of the body, as with the braine, by the films of the backe bone, and ſinewes: with the liuer by the means of the middle veines, but with the heart by means of the arteries, neyther may it ſeeme ſtrange that the whole body is ill affected, when as the principall parts are affected.</p>

                  <p>The cauſe of the Mother is menſtruous blood corrupted, and an euill vapor breaking out from the wombe, or elſe ſome impoſtume in the wombe. For the moſt part it is cauſed by the ſeed that is ſent to the wombe, and therein detayned and corrupted. Sometimes it is cauſed by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt humors which remaine there; for when theſe do putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in the wombe, they do breed a noyſome, and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous quality. And it happens that from whence life ariſeth, from thence alſo the deadlieſt bane of venome ſprings, and then is it an eaſy matter for venemous matter to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried not only by veines and arteries, but alſo by ſecret brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing holes into the vpper parts, and ſo diſturbe their functions.</p>

And beſides, they haue not that propenſion to Venery as they formerly had. This diſeaſe doth aſſault rather the naturall ſpirits then the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall or animall: and theſe being corrupted, the liuer muſt needs be corrupted.

Alſo this quality is communicated to the mouth and skinne by the clothes. And by how much the liuer is weaker, by ſo much is this diſeaſe more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereby it happens, that when as many do couple with an infected perſon, all are not for alike tainted, they that haue their naturall ſtrength perfect, are not ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly corrupted with this contagion. For euen as it is in the Plague, euery man ſucks in the infected ayre, yet all are not alike infected, becauſe the vitall ſpirits are ſtronger in ſome then in others.</p>

Sometimes the diſeaſe is cauſed outwardly by ſome cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and putrid exhalations, ſometimes by dead carcaſſes vnburied, or by ſtanding pooles, which ſtink aboue meaſure. Sometimes it is cauſed by the influence of the ſtarres, and then it is the immediate hand of God, and then it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called the peſtilence: when it is cauſed by outward cauſes, it is called a peſtilent feauer, or plague. Thoſe feauers which are cauſed by venome, are mortall, but not peſtilent, becauſe they are not infectious.</p>

                  <p>When theſe corrupt humors do diſturbe the patient, they do toſſe themſelues very vnquietly vp and downe, and will not abide long in one place: Their appetite is taken away, and the members are very dull and heauy: alſo the head akes, for the moſt part head and ſtomacke are both pained, and in breife their ſtrength failes them, and the ſpirits are decaied, eſpecially the vitall ſpirits. The extreme parts are cold, but the inward parts, namely the heart, ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and lungs are very hote; they are for the moſt part very dry, and watchfull; yet they haue a great inclination to ſleepe: they loathe all kindes of meate, and vomit vp cholericke, and diuers kinds of humors; their tongue is very foule, and their mouth bitter; their countenance is like theirs that are drunke, the vrine for the moſt part is thicke and ſmells not well; alſo a hicket doth diſturbe the patient, the pulſe doth beate ſwift and faint; madnes alſo and talking idlely with amazednes doth follow, and the forepart of the belly is ſtretched: but the moſt aſſured ſigne of the Plague is contagion, which becauſe it cannot at the firſt be perceiued, the other ſignes muſt be obſerued, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it wilbe worth the obſeruation whether there be any botches in the groine, behind the eares, or vnder the arme holes.

the heart by drawing of breath, is the cauſe of this diſeaſe. For the infected ayre doth not only weaken the humours and ſpirits of the body, but alſo the ſolid ſubſtance of the heart, becauſe wee are compelled to ſucke it in, and to entertaine it in the inward clozet of the heart; where firſt the ſpirits, then the humors, and laſtly, the ſolid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the heart, by the corruption of the venome is deſtroyed: and at the length the whole body. This corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ayre is alſo cauſed by the ſtench of dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes, or by the excrements of men and beaſts, or by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtinking pools, or ill vapors, which ariſe out of the earth. Sometimes the diſeaſe it ſelfe is cauſed by ſome venomous quality bred in vs, by corrupt, cholericke, melancholly, and phlegmy humors; and then the diſeaſe is ſomewhat like a tertian, or quartane, ſometimes a quotidian Feauer; and then beſide the corrupt humor of the body, they haue a venomous and peſtilentiall humor lurking in ſome parts of the body: &amp; this is the cauſe that ſome one man amongſt a thouſand, that liues in a cleere ayre, is not ſicke of the Plague.</p>

It is alſo as dangerous, if the puſhes hauing broke out, do runne in againe. This diſeaſe is conſummated and brought to its full ripenes in 24 houres, but is not ſo ſoone cured; if a cold ſweat ariſe on the body, and the face and eyes doe looke blacke, and the ſpirits are caſt downe, &amp; the patient vomits extraordinarily, and the excrements that are voyded be diuerſly coloured, it is a ſigne of death.
