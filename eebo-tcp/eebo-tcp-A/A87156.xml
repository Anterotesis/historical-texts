            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have been a very ſerious obſerver of the Parliaments and Armies pretences and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of late; And (notwithſtanding many clear Demonſtrations of their crooked proceedings) yet have ever declined either ſpeaking, writing, or acting any thing that might evidence the leaſt jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of their integrity and true zeal to the Freedom of the People, and Liberty of the Nation; ſuffering my judgement to be guided and overpowered by my ſtrong affection towards them ſo long, till I have been by many honeſt men thought to have either loſt my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or departed from my Principles: Wherefore I was at laſt enforced in my Spirit to bear this my witneſs againſt ſome preſent actings, beſeeching the Lord to make it as profitable to others, as it is ſatisfactory to my ſelf: However, my Record is on high, and (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men reſcent it) the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God and man, will be unto me a continual feaſt.</p>

            <p>THe great God of Heaven and Earth,<note place="margin">The Riſe and cauſes of right Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> created all things for the uſe and ſervice of <hi>Man,</hi> whom he made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his <hi>own Image,</hi> as the <hi>Maſter piece</hi> of the whole Workmanſhip of his <hi>hands;</hi> and being careful of all things, comprehending in himſelf the <hi>Beginning, Midſt</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of <hi>All,</hi> according to his good pleaſure, out of reſpect to the <hi>Common good</hi> and preſervation of <hi>Humane Society,</hi> hath from time to time diſtributed to ſundry perſons diſtinct and different gifts, that in the exerciſing of divers <hi>Eſtates, Charges, Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, Offices</hi> and <hi>Occupations,</hi> they might by CONSENT, through mutual ſuccor and interchangeable help, preſerve and maintain themſelves and one another: In which aſſertion is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered, the ſeveral cauſes of all right Government.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Efficient cauſe is, God</hi> the <hi>Creator,</hi> out of his care to mans weal and tranquillity, communicating his common gifts ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally for the benefit of <hi>All,</hi> both <hi>Governors</hi> and <hi>Governed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Material cauſe is,</hi> The increaſe and multiplying of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, the Original of all Societies, as, <hi>Families, Towns, Cities</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> or <hi>Commonwealths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Formal cauſe is,</hi> The mutual CONSENT of both parties, the one to <hi>Govern,</hi> the other to be <hi>Governed,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch <hi>Laws, Articles</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> as are agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Final cauſe is,</hi> The mutual <hi>Succor, Help, Commodity, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Peace, Security</hi> and <hi>Preſervation</hi> one of another.</p>
            <p>From all which, theſe profitable Propoſitions may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted,</p>
            <p>Firſt, That <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> is of Divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an Ordinance of GOD, and the calling of a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi> a lawful and honorable calling.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That men cannot live together, without a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one kinde or other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, All right Government is by CONSENT of parties.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That both parties are <hi>equally bound</hi> to conform and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:111645:3"/>
ſtand to the Laws and Articles agreed upon, as well the <hi>Governor</hi> as the <hi>Governed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Where <hi>Common commodity, Peace</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> is ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by <hi>Particular Intereſts,</hi> there is nothing but <hi>Tyranny, Slavery</hi> and <hi>Confuſion</hi> to be expected.</p>
            <p>Which Truths, when they ſhall be <hi>Cordially</hi> aſſented to, and <hi>Conſcienciouſly</hi> practiced by <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>People</hi> (then, and not till then) ſhall that Propheſie be fulfilled, laid down in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.4. <hi>They ſhall break their Swords into Plow-ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks; Nation ſhall not lift up Sword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But can the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> change his skin, or the <hi>Leopard</hi> his <hi>ſpots?</hi> then may the <hi>generality of Magiſtrates</hi> (who are accuſtomed <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> to uphold and advance the Intereſt of their <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Power</hi>) and the <hi>major part of the People</hi> (who account it their <hi>Glory</hi> to be <hi>Vaſſals</hi> and <hi>Slaves</hi> to <hi>great Titles</hi> and <hi>gay Clothes</hi>) own <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> as the onely Pillar of <hi>Lawful Authority,</hi> and prize that <hi>Liberty,</hi> wherewith <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Nature</hi> hath made them <hi>Free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that I may not be thought to proceed upon falſe grounds, I ſhall revive the aforementioned Propoſitions, and briefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their conſiſtency with the <hi>Ordinance of God</hi> and <hi>right Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt and ſecond, wherein the <hi>Divine Right</hi> and <hi>neceſſity of Government</hi> are aſſerted, all men of all parties are ready to ſubſcribe.</p>
            <p>Unto the laſt, wherein the <hi>end</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> is declared, moſt men agree.</p>
            <p>The third and fourth, viz. (<hi>That right Government is by the</hi> CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENT <hi>of Parties, and that both Parties are</hi> EQUALLY <hi>bound to ſtand to the</hi> AGREEMENT) are (by the Luciferian pride and covetouſneſs of <hi>great men</hi> in <hi>Authority,</hi> and ſlaviſh puſillanimity of the <hi>People</hi> under them) become diſputable.</p>
            <p>Nay, the contrary (till of late) accounted Fundamental truths, without believing whereof, the Clergy of thoſe ages would allow no man to be ſaved, viz. <hi>That abſolute Monarchy was of Divine right:</hi> (What then meant by abſolute Monarchy, appears by the other <hi>King-clawing Doctrines</hi> of thoſe <hi>Trenchard Chaplains,</hi>) viz. <hi>That the King was accomptable to none on Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:111645:3"/>That he had <hi>right</hi> to <hi>all his people enjoyed,</hi> and that they held it but as <hi>meer grace</hi> from <hi>him;</hi> That what <hi>ever</hi> he <hi>did,</hi> or <hi>cauſed</hi> to be <hi>done</hi> to them, they ought in <hi>no caſe</hi> to <hi>reſiſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With much more ſuch goodly ſtuff, which they put in to fill up their <hi>Court Sermons,</hi> which I paſs by, as being unwilling to rake further in this <hi>Augean ſtable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which recited <hi>State Hereſies,</hi> ſo deſperately deſtructive to to <hi>humane ſociety,</hi> I ſhall very briefly confute, and then paſs to the confirmation of the truths propoſed.</p>
            <p>The iniquity of thoſe Court Maxims is thus diſcovered:</p>
            <p>There are two <hi>Eſſentials</hi> in <hi>Magiſtracy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>protect</hi> the <hi>good,</hi> and to <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>puniſh evil doers:</hi> And this is immediately from <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Gods Ordinance in all ſociety</hi> of <hi>men</hi> what-ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>deſignation</hi> of <hi>Perſons</hi> to <hi>adminiſter,</hi> and the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> by which that <hi>adminiſtration</hi> is to be <hi>guided;</hi> and this is left to <hi>Men, God</hi> not uſing now immediately to impoſe particular <hi>Governors</hi> or <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> upon Societies of <hi>Men;</hi> or limit them to his <hi>judicial Laws,</hi> as was his dealing with the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Government <hi>Joſephus</hi> and other Authors acknowledge to be a <hi>Theocratia,</hi> or a Government <hi>immediately</hi> from <hi>God:</hi> They had their <hi>Magiſtrates, Judges,</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> by <hi>Gods imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate appointment;</hi> They could neither Enact <hi>Laws,</hi> appoint <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors,</hi> nor make <hi>War</hi> or <hi>Peace,</hi> but by <hi>expreſs</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> command from <hi>God: Paul</hi> calls <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>God; Peter</hi> ſtiles it an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>man;</hi> which ſeeming diſcrepancy is thus reconciled: All <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> to do Juſtice and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the Ordinance of <hi>God,</hi> and is not left to the <hi>will</hi> and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>men,</hi> to alter, vitiate, or contemn, without the incurring the diſpleaſure of <hi>God</hi> for the ſame: But the <hi>chooſing</hi> or <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officers,</hi> and the making of <hi>Laws,</hi> is left to <hi>men,</hi> and is the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of <hi>man,</hi> and can onely be called the Ordinance of <hi>God,</hi> in that (when men proceed righteouſly therein) it is owned and approved of by him.</p>
            <p>If this diſtinction be not admitted, but that every Superior power in both ſences is of <hi>Divine inſtitution,</hi> and ſo properly the Ordinance of <hi>God,</hi> theſe abſurdities will follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were not guided by the ſame Spirit, they writing things irreconcileable: That the Supreme Authority ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:111645:4"/>

               <note place="margin">The ſeveral kindes of Government.</note> and three of <hi>corrupt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt of right is <hi>Monarchy:</hi> when the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> is in <hi>one alone,</hi> who ſeeketh <hi>publique profit onely,</hi> and preferreth <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit</hi> before his <hi>own</hi> private <hi>will</hi> and <hi>particular Commodity;</hi> and when he endeavoreth to advance his <hi>own Intereſt,</hi> and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by his abſolute <hi>will,</hi> then he becomes a TYRANT, and the Government <hi>Tyranny,</hi> which is the firſt kinde of <hi>corrupt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond of right is <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> the power of the <hi>beſt men,</hi> viz. when a <hi>few approved</hi> and <hi>tryed</hi> men for <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> have the <hi>Soveraignty joyntly together,</hi> and make <hi>Laws</hi> for the reſt of the <hi>People,</hi> directing their thoughts at no other marks then <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Peace, Freedom, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tillity</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> as among the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> of old: But when theſe <hi>reject</hi> the <hi>poorer ſort,</hi> aym at nothing but their <hi>own advantage,</hi> without any care of <hi>publique Commodity,</hi> take part with their <hi>equals</hi> in <hi>riches</hi> and <hi>greatneſs,</hi> to the oppreſſion of their <hi>Inferiors,</hi> then the Government dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates into <hi>Oligarchy;</hi> the ſecond ſort of <hi>corrupt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The third of right is <hi>Democracy,</hi> the power of the <hi>People,</hi> when <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>indifferent men</hi> are by them choſen; neither of the <hi>richeſt,</hi> to avoid <hi>Tyranny,</hi> nor of the <hi>pooreſt,</hi> to avoid <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of which <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>That thoſe ſocieties which conſiſt of</hi> mean perſons in power, <hi>is very good,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths are well governed,</hi> wherein there are many of the <hi>middle ſort,</hi> who have <hi>more power</hi> then both the <hi>other parties,</hi> or at leaſt then any one of them; for where, ſaith he, <hi>many</hi> are very <hi>great,</hi> or <hi>many</hi> very <hi>mean,</hi> there followeth either an <hi>extream Oligarchy</hi> or <hi>Anarchy,</hi> a confuſed multitudinous <hi>hodge podge;</hi> which is the third ſort of <hi>corrupt Government.</hi>
