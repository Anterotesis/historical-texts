            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:52433:6"/>If for Religion we have fought all this while, when did the Church change her weapons? muſt prayers and tears be turned into pike and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket? did God refuſe to have his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple built by <hi>David</hi> a man after his own heart, becauſe only his hands were bloudy? and will he now be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have his Church repaired, and her breaches made up with skuls and carkaſſes? muſt bloud be tempered with morter that muſt bind the ſtones of his Temple in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity? or are the ſmitings of brethren, ſtrokes fit to polliſh her ſtones withall? Hath God refuſed the ſoft voice to remaine in thunder? or hath his ſpirit left the gentle posture of deſcending downe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Apoſtles, to the approaching of a mighty and ruſhing winde? To go about the reforming of a Church by humane ſtrength, is as quite oppoſite to the nature of Reformation, as is the going about the repairing of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle

wall with a needle and thred. He that looks for ſuch inestimable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe within Iron ſides, may as well looke to find a Pearle in a Lopſter. No, no, the Church must not be defended with Helmets, the riſiſters of blows, but with Miters which have received the cleft already; not by broken pates, but by cloven tongues: not by men clad in Buffe, but by Priests cloathed in righteouſneſſe: Decitions in matters of faith, muſt not be determined by armour of proof; nor did the ſword of the ſpirit ever make way to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by cutting through the fleſh. He therefore who takes up Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Soveraigne, with pretenſes of defending his Religion, doth but take ſuch courſes, as are condemned by the ſame Religion he would defend; and indeed he doth but make Religion his ſtalking-horſe, to blind him, whilſt he aimes at that, which he would have leaſt ſuſpect him, which when he

hath effected, he meanes to get up upon the horſe and ride him at his pleaſure: they pretend the good of the Church, when, you may be aſſured, they intend nothing more, then the goods thereof, and like diſſembling Lapwings, make a ſhew of being nearest the nest, when they are furthest of it.</p>
            <p>If we Fight for our Liberties, what Liberties are they that we Fight for? if for Liberty of Conſcience, what doe you meane thereby? if by Liberty of Conſcience you mean, that it ſhall be lawfull for every one to chuſe his owne Religion, or to be of his own opinion, thoſe are things which we ought not to have, much leſſe to Fight for; for then let us not blame every panim that bakes his cake to the Queen of heaven, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ignorant votary, who creeps to his own Image, or makes his own Idoll; for in this kind of Liberty, we do but ſacrifice unto the net wherein we ſee our ſelves caught, and burne

incenſe to the drag that hales us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Chriſtians are not to be at ſuch liberty, looſe Chriſtians are but loſt men; true Christians will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be bound up in the unity of the ſame ſpirit, and the bond of peace: if the bond be broken, the ſheaf of corn is but ſo many looſe eares, and no way fit to be carried into the Lords barne: if we be ſons and daughters, let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long all to one houſe, if we be ſervants, let us be all of one family, if we be live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtones, let us be all of one building, if we be ſeverall grapes, let us be all of one cluſter, if we be ſeverall cluſters, yet let us be all of one vine; if we be ſaints, let us have a communion, for this is it which is called the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints, this is it which is called Religion, which commeth of the word <hi>Religando,</hi> which ſignifieth to bind.

and to fight for this, is to fight for nothing: and if by Liberty of the Subject, you mean liberty from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, I know not any man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of any quality or condition what ſoever, that knows what belongs to any ſuch thing, except it be ſome few, who have liberty to do what they will with all the reſt.</p>
            <p>If we fight for the property of the Subject, I beleeve the Subjects have ſo altered the property of their goods, that had they but their old properties reſtored, they would not think it good ſighting for a new; their expectations being ſo much deceiv'd, that instead of fighting for the property of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they rather ſee themſelves ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jest to have all things in common.</p>
            <p>If we fought for the Laws of the Land, whoſe Laws are they? are they not the Kings? will he not maintaine the foundation of his houſe from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king? will he not maintaine his leggs
<pb facs="tcp:52433:9"/>
under him? are they not ſupporters of that body politick whereof he is the head? nay, doth he not maintaine himſelf when he maintaineth them? for the King and his Lawes may be compared to God and his word, both inſeperable: for as God is the word, and the word is God; ſo the King is the Law, as the life thereof, and the the Law is the King, as the body of that ſoule, wherefore there needed not any fighting againſt the King for this, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be by thoſe, who would be Kings themſelves.</p>
            <p>And for priviledges of Parliament, I remember to have read of <hi>Jack Cade,</hi> in the Reigne of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, who comming up as far as <hi>London-ſtone,</hi> and reſting himſelfe thereon, vowed that within three daies, there ſhould be no other Law, but what did proceed out of his mouth: now if it ſtand with the privilidges of Parliament to have a few <hi>Jack Cades,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52433:9"/>
relying on their <hi>London-ſtones,</hi> to tell them what they muſt doe, and they will have; if it ſtands with the priviledges of Parliament; to have Tumults to drive away their King, Armies to awe themſelves; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to ſend up their Inhabitants in multitudes with Petitions in their hats, cudgels in their hands, and threatnings in their mouths; ſo that the King was faine to ſlaſh the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens from <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and then the Parliament, the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> then they have fought to ſome purpoſe: but ſuppoſe that the Parliament did really Fight for all theſe particulars; ſo did the King too; ſo that the King may ſafely expoſtulate with His Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> did with the reſt of the Apoſtles, are ye fighters for the Proteſtant Religion? ſo am I: are you for the Liberties of the Subject? ſo am I: are you for the Laws of the Land? ſo am I: are you for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
<pb facs="tcp:52433:10"/>
of estates? ſo am I: are you for the priviledges of Parliament? ſo am I: <hi>and in all theſe things I have laboured more abundantly then you all</hi>; where lies the quarrell then? it muſt conſist then in nothing but this, that they do not believe one another, in that they both fight for one and the ſame thing, the meanes of reconciliation is taken away: for ſhould they differ in their grounds, the Law may be Judge between them, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be judge, the world may be judges: but <hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of having reaſon to fight, we do but fight againſt reaſon, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the ſame power, like the two women that contended for the ſame child: <hi>Solomon</hi> judg'd the child to belong to her who would rather part with it all, then have the child divided: Now the Parliament would have this powerfull child divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, half to the King, and half to themſelves: the King rather then ſo,
<pb facs="tcp:52433:10"/>
is contented to loſe all: in whom there is moſt affection and pitty, in him is the right of true parentage: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are no <hi>Solomons</hi> in this age, let us go the down-right way to worke. The two Houſes gave out that they fought in defence of the Kings Perſon, Crown and Dignity, do ye beleeve them? don't ye believe the King did? the Parliament ſaid they <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

Do you not ſee that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament cannot bring any thing to maturity, and what's the reaſon? but becauſe their labours will not admit a Treaty with the Sun.

This doctrine hath cauſed the ſhedding of more bloud then there is now running in the veins of living Chriſtians; whereas the truth is, it is neither Religion, nor virtue, nor grace, that is meant by this Royall <hi>Anointing: Cyrus</hi> was <hi>Chriſtus Domini</hi> as wel as <hi>Joſias,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> as well as <hi>David:</hi> If Religion were that that did the deed, then <hi>Cyrus</hi> had not been the Lords <hi>Anointed</hi>; if <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> then not <hi>Saul</hi>; if grace, neither: If Religion makes Kings, then there ſhould have been of old no Kings, but thoſe of <hi>Judah</hi>; and now no Kings, but thoſe of Chriſtendome.

A Mother doubting the diſcretion of her <hi>Children,</hi> and being to leave ſome curious look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſe in a place, doth not command her children that they ſhould not break it, but that they ſhould not touch it; knowing full well, that if they have the liberty to meddle with it in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, they may break it before they are aware, and deſtroy it when they think leaſt of any ſuch matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So God is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chary of his King, wherein he beholds the repreſentation of himſelf, and knowing him to be but brittle, and though the moſt refined earth, yet but glaſſe: he commands his people that they ſhould not touch his Anointed; knowing that if they were permitted but to tamper with him in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, their rude hands may break it in peeces, when they doe but think to ſet it right.</p>
               <p>A touch is but of one man, though but with one of his fingers, yet this muſt not be; <hi>Nolite tangere,</hi> it is not ſaid <hi>ne tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gete,</hi> wherein only the act of touching is forbidden, but <hi>Nolite tangere,</hi> whereby the will is alſo prohibited: how wary ſhould we be in touching, when the

               <p>Thirdly, We ſtretch forth our hands againſt the Lords Anointed, when wee ſtretch not our tongue and voice, when we hear of any traiterous plots or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies againſt the Lords <hi>Anointed,</hi> and ſo bring ſuch conſpiracies to light: <hi>It is a foul thing to hear the voice of conſpiracy, and not to <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Sixthly, We touch the Lords Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when we take away his revenue and livelyhood from him, the Devil thought that he had ſtretched forth his hand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly againſt <hi>Job,</hi> touch'd (and

               <p>Seventhly. Is there no ſtroke but what the hand gives?

               <p>It ſeemes by the ſtory, that Kings may be courſely dealt withall, if men make no bones of being guilty; they ſtand like the forbidden tree, in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God, men may touch them, but they had better let them alone; if God had placed (at the firſt) Cherubims, and a flaming ſword, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every way to defend that tree, how could there have been a triall of <hi>Adams</hi> obedience?

I muſt put off theſe, as <hi>David</hi> threw away <hi>Sauls</hi> Armour, <hi>non poſſum ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere cum iis,</hi> I love to knock down this <hi>monſtrum informe ingens in lumen ademptum,</hi> with a blunt ſtone taken out of a clear River, which with the ſling of applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may ſerve well enough to ſlay this erroneous <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> though he were far greater then he is.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place therefore let as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what is meant by <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> if any man meanes that Epiſcopacy is so <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that it is unalterable, and muſt continue at all times, and in all places; ſo that where it is left off there can be no Church, he meanes to give much offence and little reaſon; for there is no queſtion but the Church may alter their own government (ſo that it be left to themſelves to alter) as they ſhall thinke moſt convenient, as well as alter the Sabbath from the ſeventh day to the firſt of the week, or as well as they chang'd immerſion into aſperſion of the baptiſed, and many other things which carried as much <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> with them as Epiſcopacy, and yet were
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52433:76"/>
chang'd. The <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> that is in Epiſcopall Government, doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the Epiſcopacy, but in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, be it Epiſcopall or what it will; but where the government is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall, no queſtion but there Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall government is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> becauſe a government; and if it were otherwiſe that government into which Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy degenerateth, would be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> as well it, provided that none touch this Ark of the Church but the Prieſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for if the hand which belongs to the ſame body pull the hat from off the head, the man loſes not his right, only he ſtands in a more humble poſture, but he is in as ſtrong poſſeſſion of his owne right, as when 'twas on his head; but if another hand ſhould chance to pull it off, the party ſtands diſgracefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of his higheſt right and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So if Epiſcopall Government of the Church be put down, or altered by Church-men themſelves, the <hi>Jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> is but removed from the ſupremacy of one, and faſtened in the ſtronger hold of many members, for this is a Maxim that admits no poſterne; power never fals to the ground, neither in Church
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:52433:77"/>
nor State, but look what one lets fall, another takes up before ever it comes to ground, wherefore looſing nothing, they keep their own; but whether this power in Church or State in the point of convenience, be better in the hands of one or many, let whoſe will look to that, that's not my work; neither the names of governments nor the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of governours ſhall ever be able to fright away this <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> out of the Church government, be the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment what it will, <hi>bene viſum fuit ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui ſancto &amp; nobis,</hi> keeps in the <hi>Jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> be the government never ſo altered, whereas forbidden and improper hands, actions, as unuſuall, as unwarrantable lets out this <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> when they have changed it to what they can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; now whether or no it be proper for a Lay Parliament or a Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Lay-men, by the power of the Sword declining the Kings Authority, will and pleaſure, who was appointed by God to be a nurſing Father of his Church, to alter Church-government ſo Antient, ſo begun by Chriſt himſelf in his own perſon, over ſo many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, ſo practis'd by the Apoſtles o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52433:77"/>
others, ſo continued all along, I mean Epiſcopacy, that is to ſay, one Miniſter conſtituted an overſeer of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and to lay hold upon tumults and inſurrections, to pull down theſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, and for men who in ſuch caſes ſhould be governed by the Church, to pull down the Church-government without any the leaſt conſent of the Church-governours; I leave it for the world to judge, only my own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this, That any government thus ſet up, or by ſuch practiſes as theſe altered, muſt needs be ſo far from being <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> that it muſt needs be <hi>Jure Diabolico</hi>; but it may be objected, that if they ſhould have ſtayed untill the Biſhops had altered themſelves, they might have ſtaied long enough; to which it may be anſwered, that had the Biſhops been but as poor as <hi>Job,</hi> there would have been no ſuch haſte to change their cloathes: The Ark was a tipe of the Church, and whatſoever was lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally commanded concerning the tipe, muſt be analogically obſerved in the thing tipified; God ſate in the Mercy-Seat that was over the Ark, the Ark contained within it <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, and a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52433:78"/>
pot of <hi>Manna,</hi> ſo the Church containes the Law &amp; the Goſpel, the killing letter and the reviving ſpirit; others interpret the Rod to ſignifie the government and diſcipline of the Church, as the <hi>Manna</hi> the Doctrine of Chriſt, and food that came down from heaven: I take it to ſignifie both, and both anſwers my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if both be therein contained, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt be touch'd but by the Prieſts themſelves; neither muſt we confine this prohibition to the Prieſts of the Law only, but we muſt extend it alſo to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, both which were tipified by the two Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims, or miniſtring Angels of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; theſe Miniſters or Angels, though oppoſite to one another, yet they both lookt alike, and neither of them upon one another, but both of them upon the Ark that was between them, there was mutuality in their looks, and their wings touch'd one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; ſo though the Miniſters of the Law and the Goſpel ſeem oppoſite in the adminiſtration of the ſame grace, yet they muſt come ſo near as to touch one another in the manner of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, <hi>exempli gratia</hi>; as there was in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52433:78"/>
the old Law High Prieſts, Prieſts and Levites, ſo in the new Law, Biſhops, Presbyters and Deacons; as none but Prieſts were to touch the Ark, ſo none but the Miniſters ſhould reforme the Church.</p>
               <p>Thus much for Government; now for Epiſcopacy, the queſtion then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Epiſcopacy will be, whether or no <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> one Miniſter (which anſwers to all names and ſorts of Church-men, and Church-officers whatſoever) may not exerciſe juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and power over many Miniſters within ſuch a place or territory? if this be granted, the Biſhops aske no more: if it be denied, how then did Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Biſhop of our ſouls, give orders and directions to his twelve Apoſtles, and taught them how they ſhould behave themſelves throughout this Dioces the whole world? how did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe juriſdiction over <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> who were both Biſhops? and how did theſe two Biſhops exerciſe juriſdiction over all the Miniſters of <hi>Creet</hi> and <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>? was not this by divine inſtitution?

Chriſt laies the foundation, we build upon it, he gives us the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, we follow the pattern, the Church is built; is not this by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not lay the ſeverall ſtones with his own hands? Chriſt promiſed that he would be alwayes with his Church, and that he would ſend his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit amongſt them, which ſhould lead them into all truth, ſo that the gates of Hell ſhould not prevaile againſt it; but if Epiſcopacy be Anti-Chriſtian, then the gates of Hel have not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt it a long time; but all along.
