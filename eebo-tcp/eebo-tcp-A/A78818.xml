         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

expedient to expreſſe them in Cipher, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
grew higher in their demands ſince the Kings
affaires have beene in a declining condition, which with
their abuſing the Kings and authority in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
our Garriſons in <hi>Connagh,</hi> and turning the Engliſh
out of ſome of them, hath ſo incenſed the Marqueſſe of
<hi>Ormond,</hi> that he deſires but power and oportunity to breake
of all Treaty and fall upon them, and in order thereunto
we have had an Overture by one that came from him to us,
for the Brittiſh and Scotts Forces to joyne with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

            <p>Firſt that the Treaty betweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>

            <p>Secondly that the Covenant ſhould not be preſt upon
the Forces under his Lordſhips Command, and that it
ſhould be left free for thoſe of them that would to uſe the
Common-Prayer booke, and the eſtabliſhed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

            <p>Thirdly that the Brittiſh Army be left to the chief

I was jealous of it at firſt, and wee tooke bonds of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113386:8"/>
him to appeare before the Committee when the Scots

perhaps would not appeare then, if there were any very

            <p>Wee thinke the ſtrength of the Army ſtands well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,

who being removed, there will be no danger. Since my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
Sir <hi>Patrick Wemys</hi> is come from <hi>Dublyn,</hi> &amp; brought his

exceeding well, and if it be not effectually proſecuted, you

ſhortly, He ſaith he hath no Commiſſion to command the

Our Letters lye here for want of a Veſſell to waft

            <p>ON the Lords-day, <hi>Octob.</hi> 17. 1645, the Rebels (before the
<hi>Ulſter</hi>-Forces from the <hi>Laggan</hi> were come to <hi>Sligo)</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
the Town with about Two thouſand Foot and Three
hundred Horſe. The Gariſon ſeeing little hopes of the <hi>Ulſter-mens</hi>
advance (not knowing they were then at <hi>Bundrous)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it of abſolute neceſſity to hazard the fighting with the
Rebels with their own ſtrength and Sir <hi>William Cole</hi>'s Troop,
rather then to loſe themſelves and the out-Gariſons, which
were in a manner all blocked up by the Rebels lying between
them and <hi>Sligo.</hi> Captain <hi>Richard Coot</hi> and Captain <hi>Cole,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Horſe, being neer Two hundred; and after ſome
skirmiſhing with the Rebels Horſe, fell pell-mell into their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Diviſions of Foot, routed them and purſued them: And
Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Sanderſon</hi> ſallying out of the Town with
his Foot, and Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton</hi> coming in the nick of time
with his Troop, they had all execution upon the Rebels for
Five miles; and at the end thereof, left ſlain the Popiſh Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Tuum,</hi> the Rebels Preſident of <hi>Connaught,</hi> for a
memorable Mark. They took One hundred and fifty Horſe,
with their Arms, their Tents, and all other Baggage and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition,
and had much Spoil; ſeveral Colours of Horſe
and Foot, and many Officers of note, to the number of about
Twenty eight, Priſoners; about Two hundred killed: and
our loſſe but of one man, and Six hurt. Many more of the
Rebels might have been killed, but that our Foot left the chaſe
and fell to plunder.</p>
            <p>Their whole Army being thus defeated, One thouſand Foot
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113386:9"/>
and Three Troops of Horſe that were coming to joyn with
them, upon the news thereof returned. And our men, with
the <hi>Laggan</hi>-Army joyned with them, have ſince entred the
Barony of <hi>Tereragh,</hi> and taken Thirteen Caſtles there well
provided of Corn, which was our chief want, and like to be
the loſſe of that whole Province, if God in this miraculous
manner had not ſupplied it. The Oxen which drew the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's
Waggons, drew our Ordnance for the taking in of the
ſaid Caſtles. And now our men have good Quarters for this

            <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Tuum</hi> was a principal Agent in theſe
Wars, and one of the ſupreme Councel of <hi>Kilkeny.</hi> He atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
their Army at this time, to viſit his Dioceſſe, and to put
in execution an Order for the Arreres of his Biſhoprick, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him from the Councel at <hi>Kilkeny;</hi> which Order, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Popes Bull, and ſeveral other Letters of Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
between him and his Agents from <hi>Rome, Paris,</hi> and
ſeveral parts of this Kingdom, were found about him: The
Particulars of which Letters (in order to the Iriſh affairs)
are as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Pope would not at the firſt engage himſelf in the ſending
of a</hi> Nuntio <hi>for</hi> Ireland, <hi>till the Iriſh Agents had fully ſatisfied him
that the eſtabliſhment of the Catholike Religion was a thing feaſible
and attainable in this Kingdom; whereupon he was content to ſollicite
their Cauſe with</hi> Florence <hi>and</hi> Venice, &amp;c. <hi>and alſo to delegate</hi>
Farmano <hi>his</hi> Nuntius <hi>to attend this Kingdom:</hi> who the ſaid
<hi>Nuntius,</hi> after ſome delays in <hi>France,</hi> was at laſt expedited
thence by expreſſe Order from the Pope; and he arrived at
the River of <hi>Kilmare</hi> in a Frigot of One and twenty Pieces,
Six and twenty Italians of his retinue, Secretary <hi>Belinges,</hi> and
divers regular and ſecular Prieſts, <hi>Octob.</hi> 22. The Iriſh are
much encouraged with theſe Supplies which he hath brought;
the Liſt whereof found about the Archbiſhop, is:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:113386:9"/>
               <hi>Imprimis,</hi> Two thouſand Muskets, Four thouſand Bande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,
Two thouſand Swords, Five hundred Petronels, and
Twenty thouſand pound of Powder, (all which arrived in
another Barque by it ſelf at <hi>Brook-haven, Octob.</hi> 10.) together
with Five or Six Desks or ſmall Trunks of Spaniſh Gold, the
ſum uncertain.</p>
            <p>Theſe Letters likewiſe inform us that the Kings hopes are
from the Iriſh Nation; and if they deſert him, he is like to be
in a hard condition very ſpeedily. Several other things they
contain concerning Priuce <hi>Rupert,</hi> Colonel <hi>Legg,</hi> the King's
Loſſes at <hi>Briſtol</hi> and <hi>Cheſter.</hi> Something there is alſo of the
Treaty of Peace. <hi>Ormond</hi> (ſays one) is fonnd a Machevilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:
<hi>Dillon, Muskerry, Talbot,</hi> are for Peace: <hi>Conditionibus

there were ſome differences amongſt the Rebels themſelves,

inſomuch that Father <hi>Scaramppe</hi> went from the ſupreme
Councel to reconcile them. There was alſo a private Letter
of ſuſpitious informations againſt <hi>Dominico Spinola</hi> an Agent
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein he is ſaid to hold Correſpondence with

            <p>The Cornet of that Troop, upon Tueſday <hi>Novemb.</hi> 25, with
