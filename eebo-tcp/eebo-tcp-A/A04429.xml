         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Convenientes ibidem, &amp;c. Let the people,

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6815:5"/>
men, wherby beleevers must be saved, to weet,
the name of Iesus Christ, who shall save his
people from their sinnes; and vvhich is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
written, that in the name of Iesus every
knee should bow, every one performing it for
himself in particular, and especially while the
sacred mysteries of the Masse are in hand,
so often as that glorious name is named, let
them bow the knee of their hearts, testifying
it vvith the bowing downe of their heads.</hi> So

obtained a Papall Institution.
The superstition, if not Idolatrie, is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable:<note place="margin">Note.</note>
for we see honour and adoration

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd that especially during the Mysterie of
the Masse; as if this name had some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
vertue, when mentioned in the


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6815:6"/>
Masse, more then out of all the Masse.
And who doubteth, but this superstitious
Institution was a notable meanes to mask
the abominable Idole of their transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiate
breaden God, not long before
decreed by Pope Innocent 3. in the
Counsell of Lateran; the adoring now
of the very <hi>name of jesus,</hi> making the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration
of the corporall presence of
Christ (as they imagine) the lesse to be
stuck at; For if the very name be to be
adored, much more the body it selfe.
And by this bowing in the Masse, I take
it, our ignorant people, in the beginning
of the Reformation, had learned to
make leggs at the <hi>naming of Iesus</hi> in the
time of the Gospell, especially when
the Gospell was not preached. But this
may suffice briefly to have shewed the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonitish,<note place="margin">See Sr. Edwin Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

mouldie and hoary Antiquitie
of this superstitious Institution, set up by
Antichrist, not above 355 yeares ago.</p>
            <p>Not but that this superstition was in
use long before. As, <hi>Pope John the 20.
gave Indulgence of 20 yeares pardon so often
as any bowed at the name of Iesus; not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practized


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6815:6"/>
in Italie at this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, to the avouched for this adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and 1. of the Church. For this <hi>the
15. Canon</hi> is alleaged. The words are,
<hi>When in time of Divine Service the Lord
Iesus shall be mentioned, due and lowly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
shall be done of all persons present, as
it hath bene accustomed.</hi> Now first, who
will understand that this due reverence is
to be done, only in time of <hi>Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
and not also of the Sermon? This
might seeme to come too close at the
heeles of Popish Superstition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is not said (as in the Papall
Canon) <hi>When the name of Iesus is named:</hi>
but, <hi>When the Lord Iesus is mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Now,
the Lord Iesus is the person of Iesus (and
not the name of Iesus) to whom all due
reverence is to be done, by what name
soever he is in Scripture made knowne
unto us. For doe we reverence the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for the name-sake? or the name for
the person-sake? If the person for the
name-sake, that were flat Idolatrie: but if
the name for the person-sake, then every
name of the Lord Iesus, as <hi>Christ, Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuell,


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6815:7"/>
&amp;c.</hi> should draw from us reverence
to our Lord Christ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Canon</hi> wills <hi>due reverence
to the Lord Jesus,</hi> and who so imprudent,
so impious, as to denie it? But this due
reverence is such as is grounded on Gods
Word; Else, it is no due reverence, but
will-worship rather. Now,<note place="margin">Note.</note> Gods word
putts no such difference betweene Iesus
and Christ, as that we should more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Lord Christ by the name Iesus,
than the Lord Iesus by the name Christ;
as we shall see anone.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Canon</hi> commands <hi>such
reverence, as hath beene accustomed.</hi> Now,
I hope no good Protestant will say, that
here we are sent to the superstitious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the Synagogue of Antichrist,
taken up from that Papall Institution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
named. For as for superstitious
Ceremonies our<note n="†" place="margin">Preface to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

professedly abolished, &amp; sent them pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

Rome. But if any former custome
founded upon the Institution at Mentz
(fore-specified) be there meant in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>


               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:6815:7"/>
then this <hi>due lowly Reverence,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it is, is to be done to Christ,
whensoever by any of his names he
is mentioned: as the Learned Doctor
Willet (now with God) hath before
observed.</p>
            <p>In the second place, they presse us
with the <hi>Authoritie of the Scripture;</hi> what
Scripture? Phil. 2, 10. <hi>And hath given
him a name above every name, that at the
name of Iesus every knee should bow.</hi> But
our comfort is, that the <hi>Canon</hi> expresseth
no such thing, as grounding any such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
upon this Scripture: which is
a thing well-worth our noting. Yet
because many ground their <hi>bowing at the
Name of Jesus</hi> upon the said place, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
concurring with the Papall Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
fore-mentioned: Let us a little exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the place.</p>
            <p>First, our Church in all her Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Bible, hath by her judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
collations, and marginall quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of other places of Scripture with
that (Phil. 2. 10.) cleerely interpreted


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6815:8"/>
the place to meane, <hi>the supreame and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigne
Power of Christ over all Creatures,
men and Angells,</hi> which shall be fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
at his comming to judge the
quicke and the dead, when <hi>all knees shall
bow unto him the knee of subjection,</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at his mouth their sentence, either
of Absolution or Condemnation: For
these purpose, one place quoted in the
margent, is Rom. 14, &amp; 11. the other Isai.
45, and 23. Both which places shew that
the <hi>bowing of the knee</hi> is taken metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically,
betokening <hi>subjection and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement
of Christs supreame Authoritie
over all Creatures in Heaven, Earth, and
under Earth, as sole Iudge of all;</hi> So as the
<hi>name of Iesus</hi> is taken for <hi>the Power of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ over all Creatures,</hi> as Mark. 16. 17
Act. 3, 16, and 4, 10, Prov. 18, 10, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
places more, and <gap reason="foreign">

our eldest English Translations render.
<hi>In the name of Iesus.</hi> Not, <hi>at the name of
Iesus.</hi> And though revereud Beza ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

he interprets it <hi>of Subjection of all


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6815:8"/>
creatures to Christ,</hi> taking bowing of the
knee methaphorically, or in a borrowed
sence.</p>
            <p>Besides, this giving to Christ a name
above every name, is not any addition,
but a manifestation of Christs supreame
Authoritie in the full execution of it, as
Mediatour, now after his resurrection in
the state of glory: as Matth. 28, 18, and
Ioh. 5, 21. <hi>His Godhead now shining forth
in its full brightnes</hi> (as Rom. 1, 4) <hi>Which had

            <p>To this he answereth in the Protestants

subjection of all Creatures, of Turks, Iewes,
Infidels, yea of the Devills themselves, to the
power and judgement of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Protestants have only taken
away the Superstitious abuse of the name of
Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the kneeling at the name of Iesus
is Superstitiously abused in Poperie: For the

            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:6815:12"/>
Fourthly, due reverence may be used
to our Saviour, without any such Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of capping and kneeling <hi>saith Fulk:</hi>
neither doc vve binde any of necessitie
to use this Reverence to the Name of
Iesus, as the Papists doe, which thinke
Christ cannot otherwise be honoured; neither
doe we judge and condemne those that doe use
it, being free from Superstition, and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in knowledge, and carefull not to give
offence; for superstitions and offensive igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is not in any case to be defended.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, this outward reverence at the
name of Iesus was taken up amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
because of all other names it was most
derided and scorned of the Pagans and Iews:
and therefore they did the more honour it.
But now there is greater daunger of Popish
Superstition, in abusing holy things,<note place="margin">Note.</note> than of
Paganisme, in utterly contemning them, and
therefore there is not such necessity, and just
occasion of using this externall gesture, as was
in former times: it was not used of necessitie
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen, much lesse now. <hi>So he. D. Fulk
also in his answer to the Rhemists on
that place, (besides that alleaged by Dr.


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6815:12"/>
Willet from him) saith, in particular, to
the Iesuites.</hi> You complaine that to remove
such impietie, as the Image and name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
is to abolish all true Religion out of the
World; and to make men plaine Atheists.
The same was the complaints of the Pagans
against the Christians. But to worship God
only, according to the Prescript of his Holy<note place="margin">Note this well.</note>
Word, is true Religion, and to teach men to
worship contrary thereunto, it maketh men
either Idolaters, or altogether Atheists.
And when you say the Popish Church doth
not honour those things, nor count them holy,
for their matter, colour, sound, &amp;c. but for
respect and relation they have to our Saviour;
it is too short a Cloke to cover your Idolatry.
For the same was the perswasion of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
in their Golden Calfe, which they did
not honour for the matter, colour, fashion, but
for the relation it had to God, that brought
them out of Egypt, Exod. 32. 4. 5. The like
of Ieroboams Golden Calves, 1 King. 12. 28.
<hi>So he. Yea, we may note also from the
Rhemists owne confession, that they
place all their Religion in such supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the adoration of Images, of the


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6815:13"/>
Crosse, and of the name Iesus, &amp;c. Seeing
they charge Protestants, with abolishing
all true Religion out of the world, by
their abolishing Popish Superstitions.

            </p>
            <p>Thus we have sufficiently with a
Cloud of witnesses cleered the Scripture
from being any ground of superstitious
adoration of the <hi>name of Iesus:</hi> to which
might be added a Catalogue more both
of old and new writers, and that both
PROTESTANTS and Papists,
but it were both needlesse, and would
make an Epistle endlesse, as this allready
hath passed the bounds of an ordinary
Letter. And chiefly needlesse, to heap
up more testimonies, seeing the <hi>Canon</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged
doth not alleage this, or any


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6815:14"/>
other Scripture, as hath beene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p>How far then reacheth the command
of the <hi>Canon</hi> in this case? Surely, not to
any superstitious adoration of the <hi>name
Jesus.</hi> Superstition we all disclaime. If
to cap or knee, bow or doffe, at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Iesus, be superstitious, the <hi>Canon</hi>
chargeth it not. Worship to Christ it
commandeth, spirituall, and corporall,
Right and reason. This command is
Apostolicall, Corinth. 16. 20.</p>
            <p>But corporally or spiritually to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

            <p>Whatsoever is spoken of the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is plaine. The <hi>Major</hi> is

not only the name IEsus, but other names

when he is named Christ as Iesus. But

name of Iesus, is not the Person of the

Iesus,</hi> is not meant of the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</p>
            <p>Or thus:</p>
            <p>He that saith, that when the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,

the name Iesus only of all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

all other names, whereby the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Christ is expressed.</p>
            <p>But the CANON doth not denie other
names of Christ, wherby he is mentioned

mean by the mention of the Lord Iesus
the name Iesus onely of all his other

            <p>Or thus:</p>
            <p>He that saith, that by the mention of

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6815:18"/>
Else it must necessarily command the
Creature to be worshipped. If any reply
that the adoration at the name Iesus hath
relation to the Person of Iesus: The Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites
say as much for this adoration, and
for all other Idoll worship. But the
<hi>Canon</hi> speakes not of the <hi>name Jesus,</hi> but
of the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> personally.</p>
            <p>Or thus:</p>
            <p>He that worshippeth <hi>the Lord Iesus,</hi>
when the name Iesus is only mentioned,
and not when he is mentioned by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

saith, when the Lord Iesus is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

            <p>But the CANON doth not preferre the

            <p>Ergo, the Canon meaneth not by the

            <p>Or thus:</p>

            </p>
            <p>Or thus:</p>
            <p>All Adoration must be grounded on
the Word of God. But this Adoration
at the name Iesus, or naming of Iesus, is
not grounded upon the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Ergo, the Canon cannot mean adoration
at the name Iesus, or the naming of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved, Isai. 29. 13, &amp;
Mar. 7. 7.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Minor,</hi> if it have any ground
in Gods Word, then, Phil. 2. 10. But
that is no ground, as hath beene proved.
For it is not said there, In or at the name

as Iesus there is plainly meant of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

not of the name. And therefore all

was the mind of those that compiled and
cast the Canons, that an outward speciall
reverence, as <hi>capping,</hi> or <hi>kneeing should be
done</hi> when <hi>the name Iesus is named.</hi> I
answer, first, we are to make the most
charitables construction, and such as is
agreeable to Truth, of the words, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of our Forefathers, as farre as they
are capable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, suppose some one or two
of them had any such meaning, as so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
would pin upon them, yet were it the
duty of good Children to cover their
Fathers naked meaning with the mantle
of filiall charitie, and of a favourable
construction.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, howsoever, some perhaps in
their meaning suffer as men, yet herein


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6815:19"/>
were they wise men, in not expressing
more in words than Gods word doth
warrant. And in a word, for my part, I
have a good hope, that their meaning was
no worse than their saying.</p>
            <p>But at length,<note place="margin">Note this well.</note> to shut up all: Let me tell
you what I have observed in those that
are most superstitiously observant of <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or doffing</hi> at the <hi>naming of Iesus:</hi> They
are commonly ignorant, or very prophan
persons, that with the Iewes will
singe <hi>Hosanna</hi> to <hi>Iesus,</hi> and cry <hi>crucifie</hi>
Christ. So these will deifie Iesus with
their head, and crucifie him with their
hands and tongues, by their lying and
swearing and wicked living. Or else,
such are couzening Papists, or popishly
affected, combining and complying with
Poperie, placing all their Religion in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Rites,</hi> and <hi>Superstitious Ceremonies,</hi>
and abandoning the power and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of true Religion, feeding Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crasie,
with a vaine opinion, that they
have done God good service, when they
thus honour this name IEsus, being mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
ennemies to <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>his Gospell,</hi> and


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6815:20"/>
the true professours of it. Such are
they that would set up Antichrist againe,
that are so ready to <hi>bow, cap, cring, or kneel</hi>
to this Superstitions,<note place="margin">Phil. 3, 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>being ennemies of the

whose God is their belly, which mind Earthly
things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, the Lord purge us more and

               <p>IT is certaine, that the Christians, who
lived in the best Ages of the Church,
did aunciently observe the Ceremonies of
uncovering the Head <hi>at the Name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
as learned Zanchy doth manifestly
confesse, in his Comment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon Phil. 2,
10. <hi>A custome</hi> (saith he) <hi>not to be dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved;
for it was a testimony of reverence &amp;
adoration of our Lord Iesus Christ, which
was introduced Originally, in regard of the
Iewes and Gentile, who despised him; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
afterwards against Arrians and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hereticks, impugning the Divinitie of
Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This reason of the said Ceremonie
now ceassing, the Ceremonie it selfe
might ceasse with it: for so it is in the
Law, the soule thereof, (namely the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

because Mr. Hooker, lib. 5. Sect. 50.

Ceremonie of <hi>bowing the knee at the name

Fulk, on Phil. 2, 10. <hi>that it may be
well used.</hi> Howbeit, as Zanchy noteth
of uncovering the Head; so I may say of
<hi>bovving the knee at the name of Iesus,</hi> that it
hath beene perverted to a superstitious
practise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, as many abuse this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
in the Church of Rome, so some
abus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it in the Church of England.</p>
               <p>Now, the reasons why Christians did
use reverence <hi>at the name of Iesus, by cap
or knee,</hi> or both, rather than at any other
name, (though it and they importing one
and the same thing so their understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din)
are many.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Reasons of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient use of this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</note> because this name above all other
Names, was in great detestation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
as <hi>Festus</hi> speaketh of him, Acts 25.
19. <hi>The Ievves had question against Paul,


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6815:22"/>
touching one Iesus.</hi> This name also by the
ignominie of the Crosse, upon his title
<hi>Iesus of Nazareth</hi> was placed, became
more execrable to the unbeleevinge
World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it was his proper name, or
the name of his person, appointed by
God, foretold by the Angell, Luke. 1, 31.
imposed in his circumcision, Luke. 2, 21.
where he had his peculiar and distinct ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation,
and yet this is his personall
Name, not only as he is Man, but as he
is one Christ, and subsisteth in two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Divine and Humane.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because of the signification,
for it doth expresse the Office of the
Redeemer, in the worke of Salvation,
Matth. 1, 21.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, men tooke occasion of this
complementall reverence from the very
Text it selfe, Phil. 2, 10, as sounding to
that purpose.</p>
               <p>The question is therefore, whether or
how far forth we are bound to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
act of reverence, either by force
of the said Scripture, or by authority of


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:6815:22"/>
any constitution of the Church? Of
both which I will treat in order.</p>
               <p>1. Of the true meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Phil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2, 10.</p>
               <q>At the name of Iesus shall every knee
bow, both of things in Heaven, and
things in Earth, and thiugs under the
Earth.</q>
               <p>If it be the true proper and literall sense
of this Text, that we must bow the knee
by externall reverence <hi>at the name of Iesus,</hi>
then it is a precept binding us to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
of this practise by indispensable
obligation. If it be not the true proper
and literall sense of the said Scripture, to
<hi>bow the knee at the name of Iesus,</hi> by such
an externall act of reverence, then are
we not bound to the practise of this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie,
by the force and vertue of the
Scripture.</p>
               <p>To enter therefore into a more exact
and sound discussion of this point, wee
must observe 3. rules, which serve to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
this particular, and sundry other in
the sacred Scripture.</p>
               <p>1. Whereas no point of Religion can


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6815:23"/>
be demonstrated out of the Scripture, but
as the Scripture is taken in the true, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and literall sense (which the learnedst
in the church of Rome do also confesse)
we must acknowledge, that the Scripture
hath but one true, proper, &amp; literall sense;
the sense of it being the very forme of it,
and every thing hath but one forme, as
reason and Philosophy do dictate to our
understanding, so that all other senses, (so
called) as, <hi>Tropilogicall, Allegoricall, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Keckerm. syst. theol. li. 1. c. 9.</note>
are inded not properly senses of
the Scripture, but an accommodation of
the Scripture, to the use of the Readers &amp;
Hearers.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, that is the true, proper, &amp;
literall sense of the Scripture, which the
intention of the speaker, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing it selfe doe importe
to our understanding, by what words
soever (proper or unproper) the said sense
be expressed in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, we must therefore observe
that the true, proper, and literall sense of
the Scripture, is not allwayes that which
the words do beare immediately in their


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6815:23"/>
grammaticall signification; but that the
words of the Scripture are sometimes
proper, as, <hi>Christ is the Son of God;</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
improper, or methaphoricall, as,
<hi>Christ is a vine, a Dore.</hi> Now, if the words
be improper, and metaphoricall (as we
shall see anon) we must note that (as D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
<hi>Whitakers</hi> did truely advertise <hi>Bellarmine)
the improper vvords carry not in them the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall
sense of the Scripture immediately</hi> (for
then great absurditie would follow) but
mediatly, that is to say, as they are reduced
unto proper words, as here bowing the
knee at the name of Iesus, is an improper
or methaphoricall speech, and is reduced
to this proper speech, viz. a subjection of
the Creaturs to the Sonne of God; which
being the true, proper, &amp; literall sense of
that Scripture, is contained in an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
&amp; metaphoricall speech.</p>
               <p>I come therefore punctually to the
thing in question, and say; that the true,
proper, &amp; literall sense of the Scripture
doth, (according to the intention of
S. Paul, and the nature of the thinge it selfe) 
<q>represent unto our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6815:24"/>
not an outward Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of bowing the knee of the
body, but a reall subject on of all
the Creatures in Heaven, Earth, and
Hell, unto the Sonne of God, even
as he is the Sonne of Man also, now
exalted unto Glory.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas therefore S. Paul saith: <hi>God hath
given him a name above every name,</hi> Phil. 2,
9. The cleere and evident sense whereof
is this, that Christ, (so humbled before in
the assumption of our nature, in the cours
of this life, in the maner of his death, &amp;c.
is now advaunced and honoured by his
Father, first by the publike manifestation
of his Divinitie, which before seemed
obscure; and secondly by exaltation of
his humanitie. So that now he having a
<hi>name</hi> above <hi>all names,</hi> in Glory and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
all Creatures voluntarily, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily,
are subject to his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
which subjection is expressed by a
metaphoricall act, as Esther 3, 2. <hi>The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Ahashuerosh the King bowed the
knee unto Hamon, and reverenced him,
which Mordechai refused to performe,


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6815:24"/>
and therefore incurred his indignation,
vers.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>That this sense is the true, proper, and
literall sense of the Scripture, according
to the intention of the writer, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the nature of the thing it selfe,
you may cleerely discerne by all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the Text; and amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
to evince the same, I present these 5.
ensuing to your consideration.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">5. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, to prove it to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not of bowing the bodily knee.</note> because it is not the very name of
<hi>Iesu</hi> (literally and syllabically taken) to
which reverence is here due, and should
be performed by every Creuture, but the
person signified by this Name, and so in
other of his Names. For when we heare
this Name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and thereupon do an
Act of reverence, either inwardly in the
mind, or outwardly in the body; it is by
mediate inference of it in our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
unto the thing or person it self
signified in and by tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Name; otherwise
this Act were a literall or syllabicall Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,
by restraining it to the <hi>Name,</hi> and
not extending it to the <hi>Person</hi> Wherefore
when I heare any other of his Names, as


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6815:25"/>
                  <hi>Immanuell, Christ, &amp;c.</hi> I am (by vertue
of the said reason) bound to do the like
reverence at the sound of these other
names, if I be bound unto it at the name
of <hi>Iesus,</hi> because the same person is in
every name imported to my understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
Else in regarding one Name of his
person, more than an other, I shew that I
regard the Name more than the person,
or the name without the person; the first
being wicked, the second a foolish
conceipt, And yet neverthelesse that these
Ceremonialists, entertaining <hi>Iesus</hi> with
reverence, dismisse Christ with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect.</p>
               <p>2. Againe, if the Text bind us (in the
true, proper, and literall sense) to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
act of adoration, in <hi>bowing the knee
at the name of Iesus,</hi> then those Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nialists
(who say so, or must say so, or else
they say nothing) must performe this Act
of adoration at all times, and in all places
whensoever, and wheresoever they heare
the sound of this name; for the text spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
absolutely, generally, &amp; definitely of
<hi>bowing the knee,</hi> without any imitation or


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6815:25"/>
restreint: And yet these Ceremonialists
(either wanting judgement in what they
would affirme, or conscience, in what
they should performe) do not exercise
this Act of Adoration, at all times, and in
al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Yea, which is more, they ought by force
of their owne reason (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

ought they not, whensoeyer they thinke

                  </gap>eason (if it enforce what obey pretend)
enforceth all this which I alleage.</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly, these grave &amp; supercilious
Ceremonialists, as when they sit, they can
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot do this peculiar act of reverence (or

                  </gap>s their Science? Or where is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science?
For if they bind us so strictly

Earth; We know that the first and the last
have no knees to bow, and so it is two to
one, that this externall act of <hi>bowing the
knee at the name of Iesus,</hi> is not the true,
proper, and literall sense of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that, by force of it, we are not
obliged to this externall act.</p>
               <p>5. Lastly, you must observe, that S.
Paul in this place, Phil. 2. 10, alludeth to
the word of God, Isai. 45. 23. <hi>Every knee
shvll bow to me;</hi> which is properly and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
understood, not of corporal genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion,
but of actuall subjection unto
God. This very place in Isai, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
understandeth to be verified in the
person of Christ at the last Iudgement,
when <hi>every knee shall bow to him,</hi> as the
great Iudge of all the world: For, to this
purpose, S. Paul produceth that place
Rom. 14. 11. namely, by the subjection
of all Creatures, voluntary in some, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
in others, but necessarily to the
Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> sitting on his Tribunall seat
of Iustice; not that all shall do this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
act of reverence; but that all shall be
in subjection, which is signified and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6815:27"/>
in the same. For God descendeth
often unto Man, to speak after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Man, because Man cannot imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
and freely assent unto the things
of God.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore, you may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive, that S. Paul understandeth
this <hi>bowing of the knee</hi> no otherwise, than
he understandeth it, Rom. 14, 11. and no
otherwise in either place, than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
Isaiah before him, Isai. 45, 23.</p>
               <p>And so much of the Scripture, by
which the Ceremonialists in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the external act of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Complement <hi>at the name
of Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Canon, viz. 18.</head>
               <p>I come therefore from the <hi>Sripture</hi> to
the <hi>Canon,</hi> which runneth in these words:
<q>When in the time of Divine Service
the Lord Jesus shall be mentioned,
due &amp; lowly reverence shall be done
by all persons present, as it hath been
accustomed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:6815:27"/>
But if the Scripture be not against us,
in that which the Ceremonialists pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
we shall the lesse feare the <hi>shot</hi> out
of this CANON; and therfore we answer
briefly unto them.</p>
               <p>1. First, we dislike not simply the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
of this externall reverence at the
Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> (for we condemne not
the Church of England, much lesse the
auncient and Vniversall Church in this
behalfe,) it being done upon good and
sufficient knowledge without supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and without opinion of necessitie,
according to the purpose of the Church.
Hence it is that Mr. Hooker lib. 5, 5, 30.
confesseth in expresse words, touching
this externall act of reverence at the name
of <hi>Iesus; No man is constrained to use it
by auy Obligation of Divine Law or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Secondly, I observe, that the externall
act of reverence at the name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> hath
bin usually practised in the time of Divin
Service, not whensoever men do staud, &amp;
when in the time of their standing the
name of Iesus is sounded forth, (for we


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6815:28"/>
do stand at the recitation of the Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed,
where mention is made of <hi>Iesus</hi> (with no
bowing of the knee) but at the reading
of the Gospell; and therefore the CANON
must be understood peculiarly of that
custome, when it requireth a reverence,
<hi>as it hath beene accustomed</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any Ceremonialist will contend
with me in this point, let the same Mr.
Hooker in the same place, be an Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
betwixt us, to decide the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</p>
               <p>Because the Gospels, which are
weekly read, do all historically
declare, something which our
Lord Iesus Christ did, or suffred
in his owne Person, it hath been
the custome of Christian men,
then especially, in token of the
greater reverence, to stand,
to utter certaine words of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
Glorie be to thee, O
Lord; and at the name of Iesus
to bow. It was therefore a
Custome aunciently so to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:6815:28"/>
But I finde in Antiquitie no CANON
to establish it, (and verily generall custom
was not sufficient in this behalfe by the
rule of S. Austin. Ep. 118.) much lesse was
it a matter of necessary observation, by
the literall sense of the Scripture. And
to declare this point yet more plainely.
<hi>Zozomen. Hist. Eccl. 7. c.</hi> 19. relating sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
different Customes of the auncient
Church, writeth thus: <hi>It is a new custome
in the Church Alexandria, that the Bishop
there doth not rise up at the reading of the
Gospell, which custome I have neither found
nor read of in any other place:</hi> So that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Bishops of Alexandria to their
owne reason herein, and defence, for this
diversitie of their practise, contrary to the
generall action of the Church.</p>
               <p>I may conclude, that neither the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
bound any, nor that the Canon or
Custome bound all to the observation
of this Ceremonial act, which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Ceremonialists, partly by vertue of
the Scripture, and partly by authoritie of
the CANON would enforce upon their
Brethren. And this might suffice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:6815:29"/>
the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>NON in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>But if I shall not offend them, I could
presse them further with the Relation of
an auncient and very Learned Bishop,<note place="margin">Note this well.</note>
who being present at the making of this
CANON, did freely and confidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
that neither he, nor any of his Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
did ever condiscend unto it, when
it was first concluded, nor when it came
afterwards to the byrth, it being, as he
said, a matter caried, he knew not how,
by the power and policie of a few, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the consent or approbation of all, or
of the greatest part. He added further,
wherereas S. Paul speaketh of the <hi>name
of Iesus,</hi> that it is a <hi>name above all names,</hi>
he conceiveth the word <hi>name</hi> to be putt
there for <hi>Person,</hi> as in Acts 4, 12. <hi>There is
no salvation in any other name under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
whereby we must be saved, Quasi dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret;</hi>
God the Father hath now declared
the excellencie of this Person <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi>
that he is the Lord of all Creatures, and
that they must be in subjection to his
power So he.</p>
               <p>Well, I will leave this particular, (as


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6815:29"/>
perhaps offensive, though true) and I will
confirme it, if need were, by sacred Oath,
that such was the resolution of the said
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shop, and shutt up all the whole with
3. observations, which I wish men to
weigh well, in the Ballance of a true
judgement, and of an upright conscience.</p>
               <p>1. First, though I have often and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
noted the behaviour of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Authours of this Canon in time of
divine service, and especially in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Gospell, yet I could never
see them performe any externall act of
reverence <hi>at the name of Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Secondly, though many good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
bow not their knees, or bend their
bodies <hi>at the name of Iesus,</hi> in the time of
Divine Service or Sermons, yet this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of outward Complement, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
not from a want of due &amp; hearty
reverence to our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> but
because the Ceremonialists would impose
it upon them, by a plaine misconstructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the Scripture, therefore they are not
willing by such an act of revere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to give
testimonie and approbation to such a


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6815:30"/>
plain ignorant misconstructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the text;
Though otherwise they may be tractable
to performe it, according to knowledg,,
and to shew their obedience to the order
of the Church, which yet doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
men to the practise of this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.
For as it hath beene intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in many Congregations, and by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
is wholy laid aside; So we do not
heare, that, by vertue of this CANON, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any Minister is brought into question
for not stirring and provoking the people
unto it, nor any of the people presented
in the <hi>Spirituall Court,</hi> for neglect therof.
But if the <hi>Scripture</hi> enforce it, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
require it, why is neither the Pastor,
nor the Parishioner, more sharply entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this behalfe?</p>
               <p>3. Thirdly,<note place="margin">N. B.</note> many, yea most that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
not this Ceremonie of <hi>bowing the
knee at the name of Iesus,</hi> do appeare by
the best effects of Religion, and in all
due Circumstances thereof, to have more
true zeale, devotion, and love unto the
the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> than many, yea the most of
these Ceremonialists, who seeming to


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:6815:30"/>
honour him with <hi>Cap</hi> and <hi>Knee,</hi> do by
their Superstition rather than Religion,
herein, prepare a way for Iesuites to creep
in with the Serpent by such holes into
the Gardeu of Eden, the true Church of
God in this Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore, not so much affect
the outward forme of Religion, as make
true demonstration of our love, honour,
and obedience unto the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> by the
most essentiall and proper effects therof:
Lest, when we have reverenced him with
so many <hi>Capps</hi> and <hi>Knees</hi> (whereby we
please our selves rather than him) he turn
us away with a <hi>Non novi vos,</hi> in the great
&amp; fearefull Day.</p>

Yea, I dare be bold to say, all the

and practise. And I having, not
without Divine Providence, obteined the
Manuscript, which by the same Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

communicate &amp; present unto your view
the <hi>Opinion, Iudgement, and Determination</hi>


               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:6815:31"/>
of a Pair of reverend and learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of our owne Church, members of
our two famous Vniversities, (the one of
Cambridg, the other of Oxford) concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the same <hi>bovving, capping, crowching,</hi>
&amp; <hi>cringing at the nam of Iesus:</hi> which letter
and Treatise I confesse and professe, have
given me and some Christian freinds of
mine aboundant satisfaction in the point.
Our latter learned Authour calls them
that so much use &amp; plead for it, not unpro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perly,
<hi>Ceremonialists</hi> you may easily know
them; They are all for <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> naught

Picture, which this Age hath produced,
<hi>all belly, Nobody;</hi> nor much unlike the

these men, (like Baalls consening Priests)
all for <hi>externall vvillworship an adoration,</hi>
preferring it before <hi>internall &amp; spirituall

That if the matter may be putt for the
