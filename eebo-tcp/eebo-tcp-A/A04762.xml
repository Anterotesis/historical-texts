            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <head>The Argument of this tenth Satyre.</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>Wealth, Honour, Empire, strength and Eloquence,</l>
                  <l>Beautie, long Life, Children and VViues we wish,</l>
                  <l>These happinesses seeme to outward sense:</l>
                  <l>In this worlds swelling sea for these we fish.</l>
                  <l>Happy we thinke our selues, if these we haue,</l>
                  <l>These therefore onely of the Gods we craue.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And yet these things are those which hurt vs most,</l>
                  <l>VVealth temptes the thiefe, Honor the enuious man.</l>
                  <l>Strength makes men rash, &amp; Eloquence is crost,</l>
                  <l>Beauty's a whore, long Life is but a span,</l>
                  <l>And Wiues and Children say as doe the rest,</l>
                  <l>That things most sought for, are not alwaies best.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The man who would be truly blest therefore,</l>
                  <l>Must vnto vertues way himselfe applie.</l>
                  <l>He must be patient, constant, seeke no more,</l>
                  <l>Resolu'd, and neither wish nor feare to die.</l>
                  <l>And let him vnto God referre the rest,</l>
                  <l>VVho better then our selues, knowes what is best.</l>
               </lg>
            </argument>
            <lg>
               <l>IN all the lands, from <hi>Gades</hi> vnto the East</l>
               <l>To <hi>Ganges,</hi> few there are who know what's best,</l>
               <l>Or worst, though error's mist were quite remoued:</l>
               <l>For what with reason is there feard or loued?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8402:3"/>
What in conceit hath ere so well begun,</l>
               <l>Which hath not in the end been wisht vndone?</l>
               <l>The gentle gods giuing as men would haue them,</l>
               <l>Haue taken from them all that ere they gaue them;</l>
               <l>They by their granting all that ere men craued,</l>
               <l>Haue vndone many a house they might haue saued.</l>
               <l>In peace, in warre, most hurtfull things are sought,</l>
               <l>Thus flowing eloquence hath come to nought,</l>
               <l>Murdred it selfe. Thus <hi>Miloes</hi> wondrous strength</l>
               <l>Wherein he trusted, was his bane at length.</l>
               <l>But heapes of coine hoorded with too much care</l>
               <l>Strangle; and so doth wealth which is so rare</l>
               <l>Exceeding others, their estates and all</l>
               <l>As doth the Brittish Whale the Dolphin small.</l>
               <l>Thus, in those cruell times, when <hi>Nero</hi> bad</l>
               <l>The Souldiers rifle all the goods men had,</l>
               <l>They get them presently to <hi>Longines</hi> house,</l>
               <l>To <hi>Senecaes</hi> rich gardens, where they rouse,</l>
               <l>And spoile, and beare away what ere they can,</l>
               <l>And then beser the house of <hi>Lateran:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>These doe they rob, while as the poore man sleepes,</l>
               <l>Seldome the Souldier in a cottage peepes.</l>
               <l>Beare but a little of thy siluer plate</l>
               <l>At night about thee, when thou trauelst late,</l>
               <l>The sword, the speare, the shaddow of a reede</l>
               <l>Shaken in Moone light, filles thee full of dread:</l>
               <l>Whereas the empty traueller goes by,</l>
               <l>And sings before a thiefe full merily.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8402:3"/>
The chiefest vowes in euery Church most knowne,</l>
               <l>Are riches, wealthes increase, our cofers growne;</l>
               <l>And yet in pitchers poysons are not ta'ne,</l>
               <l>In cups beset with gemmes suspect thy bane,</l>
               <l>Or when the <hi>Setine</hi> Wine thou maist behold,</l>
               <l>Burning within a burnisht pot of gold.</l>
               <l>Now which of these two wise men dost thou praise,</l>
               <l>Or he which laught, or he which wept alwaies?</l>
               <l>A laughing censure is an easie thing,</l>
               <l>But strange; whence t'others teares should alwaies spring.</l>
               <l>Merry <hi>Democritus</hi> did alwaies smile</l>
               <l>And beate his lungs with laughter; yet meane while</l>
               <l>Within those Cities where this wise man bode,</l>
               <l>There went no purple golden coates abroad,</l>
               <l>There were no Fasces; Chaires of State as then,</l>
               <l>No swooping traines or litters borne by men.</l>
               <l>O had he seene the Praetor mounted hye,</l>
               <l>And in his chariot through the street passe by</l>
               <l>In mighty Iupiters owne robes yclad,</l>
               <l>Or in his gowne with gawdy colours made,</l>
               <l>Or else the circle of his massie crowne</l>
               <l>Such as might waigh &amp; presse his shoulders downe.</l>
               <l>The loade whereof in publike makes him swet,</l>
               <l>Now least this Consull might himselfe forget,</l>
               <l>Within his Coach his seruant sitteth by,</l>
               <l>Teaching his Masters pride, humilitie,</l>
               <l>Anon he takes his mase of iuory,</l>
               <l>On top whereof Ioues bird sits perching high,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8402:4"/>
There may you heare a noise of Corneters,</l>
               <l>And here a ranke of other Officers;</l>
               <l>Others attending at the horses raines,</l>
               <l>All which he hires, and with his mony gaines.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Democritus</hi> was wont in the same sort,</l>
               <l>At euery one he met to laugh and sport,</l>
               <l>Whose wisedome shewes, that so it may fall out,</l>
               <l>Lords may be borne amidst the witlesse rout;</l>
               <l>Mens ioyes and sorrowes he a like disdain'd,</l>
               <l>And at their teares would laugh whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain'd:'</l>
               <l>When fortune frown'd, to him it was no matter,</l>
               <l>Hee'd send a halter to her, and point at her.</l>
               <l>Thus man desires both vaine and hurtfull things,</l>
               <l>For which vnto the Gods his vowes he brings.</l>
               <l>Others desirous to be great and knowne,</l>
               <l>Haue been enuied, and thereby ouerthrowne,</l>
               <l>Their Catalogue and all their acts defaced,</l>
               <l>Their honours lost, and they themselues disgraced,</l>
               <l>Their statuaes spoiled, and dragged along the street,</l>
               <l>Their Coach-wheeles broke, and al trod vnder feet,</l>
               <l>And their proud horses which in triumph went,</l>
               <l>They must be slaine, and for their Masters shent.</l>
               <l>And now the smoke and fire begins to flame,</l>
               <l>And that adored head which had such fame,</l>
               <l>Mighty <hi>Seianus;</hi> he who was so great,</l>
               <l>Begins to frie amidst the flaming heat,</l>
               <l>And of the ashes of his honoured face</l>
               <l>Pitchers are made, and vessels of disgrace.</l>

               <l>Where for her beautie she was rauished,</l>

                  <pb facs="tcp:8402:12"/>
Which when she knew, she so abhor'd the deed,</l>
               <l>With her owne hands she made her own hart bleed.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Virginia</hi> was as faire as faire might be,</l>
               <l>As faire as any Virgin Rome did see,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Rutila</hi> a cromp-backt monster was,</l>
               <l>And ill complexion'd, and deform'd her face,</l>
               <l>Then she, a fouler no where could be found,</l>
               <l>No beast so ougly liuing on the ground.</l>
               <l>And yet how oft did faire <hi>Virginia</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Wish in her heart, she were foule <hi>Rutila:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>That she could faces change, that she might be</l>
               <l>As <hi>Rutila,</hi> and <hi>Rutila</hi> as she.</l>
               <l>Oh if that this could euer haue been done;</l>
               <l>And each could haue each others face put on.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Virginia</hi> might haue liu'd and neere been eyed:</l>
               <l>Nor by her fathers hand at length haue died.</l>
               <l>But this was her vnhappie beauties fate,</l>
               <l>It was pursur'de with lust, far worse then hate.</l>
               <l>Graue <hi>Appius</hi> her beauty gins to note,</l>
               <l>And in the end must needs vpon her dote.</l>
               <l>Who would beleeue it? <hi>Appius</hi> is a man</l>
               <l>That's wise and stay'd; who also wisely can</l>
               <l>From his experience younger men aduise:</l>
               <l>Who sayes that <hi>Appius</hi> loues <hi>Virginia,</hi> lies:</l>
               <l>For is not <hi>Appius</hi> old, <hi>Virginia</hi> young:</l>
               <l>Sweet is <hi>Virginias</hi> breath, but his like dung:</l>
               <l>Shee's soft, hee's hard, and how can these agree?</l>
               <l>He may her father, she his daughter be.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8402:13"/>
This <hi>Appius</hi> knowes, and this so kils his heart,</l>
               <l>That to himselfe scant dares he this impart,</l>
               <l>From others therefore he his thought doth hide,</l>
               <l>He would not for a world it were descride;</l>
               <l>And yet for all it is so closely pent,</l>
               <l>His heart must breake, or he must giue it vent.</l>
               <l>Maugre his head this makes him sadly mone,</l>
               <l>And with deiected eyne walke all alone,</l>
               <l>Where he doth meditate, and mainely plot</l>
               <l>How for his lust <hi>Virginia</hi> may be got,</l>
               <l>Mean while he sighs, looks wild, &amp; somtimes weeps,</l>
               <l>Forsakes his meate, and God knowes how he sleeps.</l>
               <l>Tokens of loue he sends and pretty gifts,</l>
               <l>And vseth twenty thousand other shifts:</l>
               <l>He still pursues her, wheresoere she goe</l>
               <l>Onely to talke and looke on her, no moe.</l>
               <l>But when he cannot come vnto her right,</l>
               <l>Vnder her window then he walkes in sight.</l>
               <l>When shee's away; how will he looke about?</l>
               <l>What pretty trickes hee'le vse to finde her out?</l>
               <l>When being found, nought hath he else to say,</l>
               <l>But how doo'st pretty sweet <hi>Virginia?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Or tell some tale, or else himselfe commend</l>
               <l>Somewhat aloofe, for feare he might offend;</l>
               <l>His loue (he doubts) she will not entertaine,</l>
               <l>Which makes him be afeard of speaking plaine,</l>
               <l>In a third person he his tale doth tell</l>
               <l>Lest she (perhaps) his ranker lust might smell,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8402:13"/>
With deerest words of loue he doth her flatter,</l>
               <l>But dares not neerer come vnto the matter.</l>
               <l>Whereby much time in idle talke is spent</l>
               <l>In wanton courting, and in complement.</l>
               <l>Himselfe meane time growes flag and waxeth leane,</l>
               <l>And no man may suspect what this doth meane:</l>
               <l>A silent tongue he hath, but speaking eyes,</l>
               <l>Yet who saies <hi>Appius</hi> loues <hi>Virginia,</hi> lies.</l>
               <l>Fie <hi>Appius!</hi> fie for shame! ne're be so weake,</l>
               <l>VVhat! be fraid vnto a girle to speake?</l>
               <l>How can'st thou thus endure to liue in paine?</l>
               <l>And, where thou wilt not be deni'de, complaine:</l>
               <l>The man that spares to speake must spare to speed,</l>
               <l>Who will not speake, shall neuer doe the deed.</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Appius</hi> speake thy mind, and be a man;</l>
               <l>And so he doth as much as silence can:</l>
               <l>For <hi>Appius</hi> (if you aske him) all denies:</l>
               <l>VVho saith that <hi>Appius</hi> loues <hi>Virginia,</hi> lies.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Appius</hi> is chiefe of the <hi>Decemuiri,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And liues in glitter and authoritie:</l>
               <l>He couets mightily that he may please</l>
               <l>The common people, and enioy his ease,</l>
               <l>He punisheth and pardons as him list;</l>
               <l>But many a fault in silence yet is hisht:</l>
               <l>To feare and flattery he doth encline,</l>
               <l>VVhich is the ruine of all discipline:</l>
               <l>To see a fault, and not to reprehend it,</l>
               <l>Doth often make a fault, but neuer mend it.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8402:14"/>
Hence comes disorder, pride and luxurie,</l>
               <l>Discord, and in the end an anarchy;</l>
               <l>Romes youth hereby become effeminate</l>
               <l>And dissolute, and scorne the magistrate.</l>
               <l>How can they chuse? Let modesty auaunt,</l>
               <l>As long as <hi>Appius</hi> doth vse his haunt.</l>
               <l>If <hi>Appius</hi> loue! how can the younger fry</l>
               <l>But liue and wallow in foule luxurie?</l>
               <l>VVhy? doth not <hi>Appius</hi> thus (say they) and thus,</l>
               <l>And shall it not be lawfull then for vs?</l>
               <l>If <hi>Appius</hi> his <hi>Uirginia</hi> must haue,</l>
               <l>Some liberty, as well as he wee'le craue.</l>
               <l>Thus when Superiours doe a fault commit,</l>
               <l>The people presently doe follow it.</l>
               <l>Their ill example hurts a great deale more,</l>
               <l>For all will follow, as they goe before.</l>
               <l>Meane while the Sabines such incursions make,</l>
               <l>That idle wanton Rome begins to quake;</l>
               <l>Their men and cattell now are driuen away</l>
               <l>They to their enemies are made a prey.</l>
               <l>To <hi>Appius</hi> all this harme some doe impute:</l>
               <l>No maruell then, if <hi>Appius</hi> walke so mute,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Barbatus</hi> railes vpon his gouernment:</l>
               <l>And this some say doth cause his languishment.</l>
               <l>Some one, and some another tale deuise,</l>
               <l>But who saies <hi>Appius</hi> loues <hi>Virginia,</hi> lies.</l>
               <l>Alas poore wench! <hi>Virginia</hi> all this while</l>
               <l>Thinkes <hi>Appius like</hi> her selfe without all guile;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8402:14"/>
And therefore bids him welcome, and is glad</l>
               <l>VVhen <hi>Appius</hi> comes, shee's sory when hee's sad:</l>
               <l>Good sir (saith she) why are you male-content?</l>
               <l>VVhere are your stories and your merriment?</l>
               <l>VVhich she doth speake with such simplicity,</l>
               <l>So harmelesly, and with such modesty,</l>
               <l>That though her gentlenesse inflame him more;</l>
               <l>Yet her chast modest looke makes him giue o're:</l>
               <l>So that when he of purpose would impart</l>
               <l>His secret thought, he dares not for his heart:</l>
               <l>Sometimes he therefore knowes not what to say,</l>
               <l>But then heele gaze, yet will not goe away.</l>
               <l>Anon some idle matter he pretends,</l>
               <l>Some wrong he hath receiued from his friends,</l>
               <l>He did not thinke they would haue vs'd him so,</l>
               <l>And such a one, but let that matter goe;</l>
               <l>His answeres like his thoughts are torne and rent,</l>
               <l>And interrupted and impertinent.</l>
               <l>He sees shee's chast, and should he talke of loue,</l>
               <l>Out of the way (perhaps) she would remoue;</l>
               <l>So might he loose her company and sight,</l>
               <l>And this would kill him and vndoe him quite:</l>
               <l>And therefore to preuent such misery,</l>
               <l>On any termes hee'le haue her company.</l>
               <l>By this way then no good is to be done,</l>
               <l>Some other course must therefore be begun;</l>
               <l>VVhich he so carries in such subtill wise,</l>
               <l>That who saith <hi>Appius</hi> loues <hi>Virginia,</hi> lies.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8402:15"/>
But loue encreasing, hatcheth fearelesse lust,</l>
               <l>And lust proceeds to fury. <hi>Appius</hi> must</l>
               <l>Enchaunt <hi>Virginia</hi> with some philtrous drug,</l>
               <l>And for to second it looke trim and smug:</l>
               <l>Her vncle <hi>Numitorius</hi> must be made</l>
               <l>Hot <hi>Appius</hi> pandor, and he must perswade</l>
               <l>His neece <hi>Virginia</hi> to come off and yeeld:</l>
               <l>Thus <hi>Appius</hi> hopes at length to win the field,</l>
               <l>Thus must it be (saith <hi>Appius) Numitorius,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Must first be made, and then <hi>Virginius.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And <hi>Numitorius</hi> hee must write or speake,</l>
               <l>And all the matter to <hi>Virginia</hi> breake:</l>
               <l>Perchance at first the motion will distast,</l>
               <l>But yet I doubt not to preuaile at last,</l>
               <l>Faire promises and importunitie</l>
               <l>VVill make her wearie of her chastitie,</l>
               <l>And il'e pursue her closely at an inch,</l>
               <l>Let her say what she will, I will not flinch:</l>
               <l>Shee'le say that I am foggy &amp; too old,</l>
               <l>Her vncle then shall tell her of my gold,</l>
               <l>And of my office the Decemuirate,</l>
               <l>And what a ioynture I will to her state.</l>
               <l>I am not faire indeed, nor am I foule,</l>
               <l>Nor doe I alwaies smile, nor alwaies scowle,</l>
               <l>Good meate I loue, and good clothes I put on,</l>
               <l>Shee knowes I am a boone companion,</l>
               <l>And hath not many a one more old then I</l>
               <l>Enioy'd as young as she full merily?</l>
               <l>

Why should I not then hope and hopefull wooe,</l>
               <l>And see what <hi>Numitorius</hi> will doe?</l>
               <l>Those and a thousand other tricks he tries,</l>
               <l>Yet who saies <hi>Appius</hi> loues <hi>Virginia,</hi> lies.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Numitorius</hi> is too wise a man,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Appius</hi> here must faile, doe what he can;</l>
               <l>What then? is here an end? is <hi>Appius</hi> spent?</l>
               <l>No no: <hi>Virginiaes</hi> father must be sent</l>
               <l>Vnto the warres; and then when hee's away,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Appius</hi> assures himselfe to haue the prey:</l>
               <l>For <hi>Claudius</hi> straight, a Client of his owne,</l>
               <l>He sends; and vnto him anon makes knowne</l>
               <l>His minde, coniuring him to secrecy,</l>
               <l>And then instructs him for the villanie.</l>
               <l>T'is so (saith he) I must <hi>Virginia</hi> haue,</l>
               <l>And thou must challenge her to be thy slaue,</l>
               <l>And bid her follow thee, tut! let her weepe,</l>
               <l>Take thou her home, and there thou shalt her keep,</l>
               <l>Say that she neuer was <hi>Virginius</hi> child,</l>
               <l>But that thou wa'st of her long since beguild:</l>
               <l>She in thy house was born and stollen from thence:</l>

               <l>If she resist, bring her by force to me,</l>

VVhereat her nurse and she with feare cry out</l>

               <l>And round about they stand in her defence,</l>
               <l>So that she now is safe from violence:</l>
               <l>Saith <hi>Claudius</hi> then: I pra'y be still, t'is so</l>
               <l>Along with me <hi>Virginia</hi> must goe,</l>
               <l>She is my slaue, I doe not doe her wrong,</l>
               <l>That which I doe i'le iustifie ere long,</l>
               <l>Before the Iudge the matter shall be knowne,</l>
               <l>And you shall see I onely seeke mine owne.</l>
               <l>Forthwith he brings her whereas <hi>Appius</hi> sate,</l>
               <l>And there begins the matter to relate,</l>
               <l>(VVhich <hi>Appius</hi> knew sufficiently before)</l>

               <l>Meane while I say she is my slaue, and so</l>

               <l>Her father in the warres is now away,</l>
               <l>VVithin these two dayes he may well be here,</l>
               <l>If any will but send a messenger,</l>

And t'is vniust (he absent) to contend,</l>
               <l>That he his daughter present should defend;</l>
               <l>Wherefore they beg of <hi>Appius</hi> that the doome</l>
               <l>Might be deferred vntill her father come,</l>
               <l>And that (according to his owne decree)</l>
               <l>Till then <hi>Virginia</hi> might be counted free,</l>
               <l>And not to hazard her Virginitie,</l>
               <l>Before shee's iudged to loose her libertie.</l>
               <l>Saith <hi>Appius,</hi> Then the Law which you commend</l>
               <l>Doth shew how much I haue been freedoms friend,</l>
               <l>And now as you desire, I am content,</l>
               <l>That for <hi>Virginius</hi> some man may be sent,</l>
               <l>And to deferre the sentence till he come:</l>
               <l>But <hi>Claudius</hi> meane time must haue her home,</l>
               <l>So that he promise to returne her here,</l>
               <l>Assoone as ere <hi>Uirginius</hi> shall appeare.</l>
               <l>Hereat, alas! <hi>Virginia</hi> gins to cry;</l>
               <l>The people murmur, but none dare reply.</l>
               <l>At length her Vncle <hi>Numitorius</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And (he to whom she was betroath'd) <hi>Icilius,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>These hastily come crowding through the presse,</l>
               <l>And call vpon fell <hi>Appius</hi> for redresse:</l>
               <l>But <hi>Appius</hi> cries againe, Take them away,</l>
               <l>Sentence is past, and they haue nought to say.</l>
               <l>Nought? saith <hi>Icilius,</hi> Yes: and moughtst thou know</l>
               <l>'Tis such a tale shall make thy eares to glow:</l>
               <l>Threats cannot driue me hence or hide thy lust,</l>
               <l>Who takes me hence, doe it by force he must.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8402:17"/>
Know <hi>Appius</hi> that <hi>Virginia</hi> is my Spouse,</l>
               <l>And ere that <hi>Claudius</hi> get her to his house,</l>
               <l>Yee Gods and men! marke what <hi>Icilius</hi> faith,</l>
               <l>He'il sooner loose his life, then breake his faith.</l>
               <l>The people feare lest this his vehemence</l>
               <l>Should hurt <hi>Virginia,</hi> and the Iudge incense;</l>
               <l>For now the Lictors round about him get,</l>
               <l>Yet after all they dare no more but threat.</l>
               <l>So powerfull is the strength of innocence,</l>
               <l>That it doth curbe the rage of violence,</l>
               <l>A wicked conscience when it is most bold</l>
               <l>Is but a coward, and it's courage cold.</l>
               <l>Goe to, saith <hi>Appius,</hi> you <hi>Icilius,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Would seeme to patronize <hi>Virginius,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But 'tis another matter makes you chat,</l>
               <l>You would be Tribune sir: say, would you not?</l>
               <l>And to make way to your ambition,</l>
               <l>You thinke it best to raise sedition:</l>
               <l>But you shall faile for once of your intent,</l>
               <l>And for to day <hi>Claudius</hi> shall be content</l>
               <l>To leaue his right; <hi>Virginia</hi> home shall goe</l>
               <l>Not for your sake <hi>Icilius,</hi> thinke not so:</l>
               <l>But for <hi>Virginius</hi> sake who absent is,</l>
               <l>And for the name of father, more then this.</l>
               <l>Meane while <hi>(Icilius,</hi> you and such as you:)</l>
               <l>I tell you this: and you shall find it true,</l>
               <l>If that <hi>Virginius</hi> by to morrow day</l>
               <l>Appeare not here; know that I know the way,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8402:17"/>
Nor want I meanes or power my selfe alone,</l>
               <l>To crush the Authors of sedition.</l>
               <l>Thus for the present is the Court dismist,</l>
               <l>He for <hi>Virginius</hi> may goe who list.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Appius</hi> staies a while till they be gone,</l>
               <l>Least he might seeme t'haue sate for this alone.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Virginius</hi> friends in sending are not slack.</l>
               <l>

                  <hi>Icilius</hi> brother straight without delay,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Numitorius</hi> sonne doe post away.</l>
               <l>But what doth <hi>Appius</hi> now? he doth not sleepe,</l>
               <l>He writes to his Collegues, that they should keepe</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Virginius</hi> there, nor giue him leaue to part</l>
               <l>Till they did heare from him, this was his art.</l>
               <l>But this, as it fell out, did not succeede,</l>
               <l>His letters came to late to doe the deede;</l>
               <l>For at first watch <hi>Virginius</hi> went his way,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Appius</hi> letters came not till next day:</l>
               <l>When as <hi>Virginius</hi> so fast doth wend,</l>
               <l>That by this time he's at his iournies end,</l>
               <l>Where he doth find his louely daughter fate,</l>
               <l>In mourning habite all disconsolate,</l>
               <l>With griefe and thought so pin'd away and worne,</l>
               <l>That now she seem'd not what she was beforue;</l>
               <l>She that was erst so faire, with grieuous mone,</l>
               <l>Now looks like death, she's nought but skin &amp; bone</l>
               <l>Her meate and sleepe she doth forgoe and why?</l>
               <l>Because she will not liue, but faine would dy.</l>

But all in vaine; <hi>Appius</hi> by breake of day,</l>
               <l>Towards his seate of Iustice takes his way,</l>
               <l>Where all the Citie at the barre doth stand,</l>
               <l>And still expects <hi>Virginius</hi> out of hand,</l>
               <l>The common people lou'd <hi>Virginius</hi> well,</l>
               <l>When will he come (say they) pray' can you tell,</l>
               <l>Come, come way <hi>Virginius,</hi> quickly come.</l>
               <l>Yonder he is, saith one, I pray' make roome;</l>
               <l>Whereat the people euery one lookes out,</l>
               <l>And on his tip-toes castes his eye about,</l>
               <l>Each ouer t'others head doth seeke and spie,</l>
               <l>If he see any man approching nie,</l>

               <l>So soone men credit to affection giue;</l>
               <l>For, what men wish, they willingly beleeue.</l>
               <l>But <hi>Appius</hi> thinkes he's safe enough for that,</l>
               <l>When loe! vnlookt for, oportunely pat,</l>
               <l>In comes <hi>Virginius, Appius</hi> bends his brow,</l>
               <l>A mischiefe (saith he) on <hi>Virginius</hi> now:</l>
               <l>But sad <hi>Uirginius</hi> like a man forlorne,</l>
               <l>With many Matrons which with him did mourne,</l>
               <l>In sordide and neglected weedes doth bring</l>
               <l>His lambe-like daughter to the butchering.</l>
               <l>The doubtfull people round about them presse,</l>
               <l>And all lament and pitie their distresse.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Virginius</hi> at length thus weeping said:</l>
               <l>Good sirs! I beg not, but require your aid,</l>

For you, your wiues and children in the warres</l>
               <l>My life I haue expos'd, receiued these skarres,</l>
               <l>And for all this, shall this be my reward?</l>
               <l>Shall I my daughter loose without regard?</l>
               <l>My dearest childe, the onely childe I haue,</l>
               <l>Shall she by violence be made a slaue?</l>
               <l>Thus to the people did <hi>Virginius</hi> crie,</l>
               <l>And made his mone to all as he past by:</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Icilius</hi> also told them all the same,</l>
               <l>Whereat they wept and murmurd, and cried shame:</l>
               <l>But cruell <hi>Appius</hi> mou'd with no remorse</l>
               <l>(Such is lusts rage) became a great deale worse,</l>
               <l>Vp to his iudgement seate he soone ascends,</l>
               <l>Where he all right and equitie pretends,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Claudius</hi> now demaundes his slaue againe,</l>
               <l>And of their wrong that keepe her doth complaine:</l>
               <l>But ere that he could any farther hie,</l>
               <l>Or that <hi>Virginius</hi> could make replie.</l>
               <l>Enraged <hi>Appius</hi> swolne with lust and wroth</l>
               <l>Doth burst in twaine and interrupts them both:</l>
               <l>This brall of yours (saith he) doth me offend,</l>
               <l>Take her home <hi>Claudius,</hi> and there's an end.</l>
               <l>VVhat though <hi>Virginius</hi> and the youth repine,</l>

               <l>At first the people each on other gazed,</l>

               <l>If these (the people here) shall this permit,</l>
               <l>Others I know which will not suffer it.</l>
               <l>VVith this the women doe together band,</l>

               <l>Hearing this noise, the Crier bids them peace,</l>

               <l>VVhich done, and silence made, in sullen wise,</l>
               <l>Thus subtill <hi>Appius</hi> to the people cries:</l>

               <l>If not sedition, what then may this be?</l>

So that I must thus guarded hither come</l>
