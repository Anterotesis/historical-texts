            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis our English word <hi>Church,</hi> through
custome of speech is commonly used
for the <hi>Temple</hi> or place where people
come together for the worship of God;
but they that are any thing exercised in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
know, that it also signifieth the <hi>People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
which gather together for divine service, and
this is the first and proper meaning of the
word <hi>Church,</hi> as it is used to expresse the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Scripture termes, <hi>Kahal</hi> &amp; <hi>Ecclesia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:2373:3"/>
2. This name <hi>Church,</hi> we Englishmen
(which came of the Saxons) have received
from the Saxon, German, and Dutch names
<hi>Cyric, Kirch, Kerck;</hi> whereby those nations
now, do usually cal their <hi>Temples</hi> or mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-places:
but the people which come
togither in them, they cal the <hi>Gemeine,</hi> and
the <hi>Gemeinte,</hi> that is to say, the <hi>Comunialtie;</hi>
and we in our first English Bibles caled it,
the <hi>Congreation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 As all religion is learned out of holy
scriptures, so the name and doctrine of the
church, is from thence to be deduced; and
there the <hi>Church</hi> is called in Hebrew<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 5. 22</note> 
               <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hal

also and infidels.</p>
            <p>5. Likewise the Greek word <hi>Ecclesia</hi> is
of as large extent and signification; used
sometime for<note n="q" place="margin">Ephe. 5. 23. &amp;c Heb 12. 23.</note> the Church generally; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
for a<note n="r" place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 2</note> particular church or congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Greek version of the old testament) for an
assemblie<note n="t" place="margin">2 Chron. 1. 3. &amp;c.</note> of Governours, or company<note n="u" place="margin">1. Sam. 19. 20.</note>
of Prophets, or congreation<note n="x" place="margin">Psal. 107. 32.</note> of the people:
and finally for<note n="y" place="margin">Ezek. 32. 3 Act. 19. 32 39. 41.</note> any assembly lawful or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
of good men or of<note n="z" place="margin">Psal. 26. 5.</note> evil.</p>
            <p>6. These words thus general, are in
more special sort both by the scriptures, &amp;
by use of speach among all religious people,
restreyned and appelied to such Assemblies
and Congregations as are called and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for divine exercises: and so our English
name of <hi>Church</hi> is attributed peculiarly to
spiritual or religious assemblies, called
<hi>ecclesiastical,</hi> and not to any other assemblies
civil or political.</p>
            <p>7. Of religious or ecclesiastical assemblies
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2373:4"/>
generally considered, there any many sorts
in the world; all disallowed of God, save
one sort onely which he acknowledgeth to
be his, &amp; hath separated to him self from all
the rest.</p>
            <p>8. The many false sorts, may be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
unto fowr; 1. The assemblies of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>
or <hi>heathen people,</hi> which professe some
God, Gods, or Goddesses, whom they do
worship, ignorantly, having<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 1. 25.</note> changed the
truth of God into a lie, and so serving crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
not (in deed) the creator, which is
blessed for ever, Amen. 2 The assemblies
of Iewes, who professe the true God (after a
sort) and allow the writings of Moses and
the Prophets, but abhorre Christ Iesus our
Saviour, and reject the new Testament: 3
The assemblies of <hi>Mahometists,</hi> as Persians,
Turks, Moores, &amp;c. Which professe also
after their manner, that<note n="b" place="margin">Alkoran;</note> one true God of
whom Moses and the Prophets wrote, and
acknowledge<note n="c" place="margin">Azoar 4. Azor 2. &amp; 4. &amp; 11.</note> Christ to be a Prophet sent
of God, yea and the breath or Spirit of God,
yet beleeve they not that he is<note n="d" place="margin">Azoar 12. &amp;c.</note> God, or the

follow the lies and fabels of their false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Mahomet.</hi> 4. Finally the church or
assemblies of <hi>false Christians,</hi> which professe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2373:4"/>
God and his sonne Christ, into whose name
they are baptised; but by their works doe
deny him, and by their errours &amp; heresies,
doe overthrow the truth of religion.</p>
            <p>9. The first three sorts, <hi>Pagans, Jewes,</hi>
and <hi>Mahometists,</hi> because of their so open
and manifest denyall of Christ and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by him; are generally of Christians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
as <hi>no Churches;</hi> the latter are reputed
<hi>no true</hi> but <hi>false Churches,</hi> and so also do they
esteem of true Christians, and one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Hereupon is continual controversie
between true and false Christians, which
is the true Church, and how it may be
knowen.</p>
            <p>10. To help the weak and doubtfull in
this case, I will so truly and plainly as by
the grace of God J can, describe the true
Church, which in holy Scriptures is called
the <hi>Congreation and Church</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Nehem. 13. 1. 1 Tim. 3. 5. 14.</note>

            <p>The ordinarie officers, perpetuallie be

            <p>The election and ordination of them

               </gap>rtheretn much the diligence and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the minister, that they whose minister
<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s have freely chosen him, as unto whome
under Christ they commit the most pretious
treasure of their soule: as also it bindes the
people to greater love and conscience of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of him and his ministry whome
themselves have made choice of. 4. The
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2373:10"/>
Church beeing a most free corporation, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
under Christ the Lord, is in all reason
and equity to chuse her ministers and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
under him, unto whome also, she is.
to giue wages for their service and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>34. The <hi>Pastor</hi> must be apt to teach,<note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 1.</note> no
young scholer, able to divide the word a
right;<note n="b" place="margin">2 Tim. 2, 15.</note> he must be a man that loveth good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
<note n="c" place="margin">Tit. 1, 9.</note>he must be wise righteous, holy, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
he must be of life unreproveable, as God
steward;<note n="d" place="margin">2 Tim. 4, 2, Tit. 17, 8.</note> he must be generally wel reported
of and one that ruleth his owne house hould
under obedience with all honestie, he must
be modest<note n="e" place="margin">Numb. 12. 3, 4. Esa. 50, 4, 56, Ier. 3, 15, Eze. 34, 18. 1 Tim 5. 21.</note> humble, meeke, gentle, &amp; loving:
he must be a man of great patience, compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
labour, and diligence: feed the sheep
of Christ in green and wholesome pastures
of the word: pray for them, seale up to them
the promises of God by the Sacraments: He
must alwayes be carefull and watchfull over
the Flock of Christ,<note n="f" place="margin">Ps. 23. Levit. 10, 10.</note> defend it from ravenous
beasts,<note n="g" place="margin">loh. 10, 11, 12. Song. 2, 15</note> and the wolfe, and take the little
Foxes: discerne mens deseases, and apply
the word according to every disease, and

he must doe with all willingnes and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes,
not holding his office in respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:2373:10"/>
but doing his duty to every soule, as
he will answer before the chiefe Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>35. The <hi>Doctor</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. chap. Tit. 1, cha. 2 Tim. 2, 15. 1 Cor. 1, 17, and. 2, 4. 1 Cor. 3, 11, 12, Mal. 2 6, Ephes. 2, 20. Heb 6 1. 1 Cor. 1, 17. 1 Tim. 4. 16, and 6, 20.</note> or <hi>Teacher</hi> must be a man
apt to teach, mighty in the Scriptures, able to
convince the gainsayers: He must be of life
unreproveable, one that can governe his
owne househould, he must be of manners so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
temperate, modest, gentle, and loving:
Hee must take diligent heed to keepe the
Church from errours: preserve knowledge,
build upon the rock (which is Iesus Christ)
gould, silver, and pretious stones, that his
worke may endure the triall of the fire, and
by the light of the same fire, reveale the
timber, hay, and stubble of <hi>false Teachers:</hi> And
further, hee must deliver his doctrine pure,
sound, &amp; plaine, not with curiosity or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but so that it may edifie the most
simple, approving it to every mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that the Church may increase with
the increasing of God, and grow up unto
him which is the head Christ Iesus.</p>
            <p>36. That this is an <hi>Office</hi> different from
that of the <hi>Pastor,</hi> is manifest by these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
1. The <hi>Apostle</hi> doth so distinguish
them one from another. <hi>Rom. 12, 7, 8. Ephes.</hi>
4, 11. 2. Their gifts appeare to be divers,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2373:11"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 8. 3. The <hi>Pastor</hi> is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to take one course in Teaching, the
<hi>Doctor</hi> another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 7, 8. 4. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing
of them makes more for the
building of the Church, then to unite and
make them one.</p>
            <p>37. The third Officers,<note n="†" place="margin">1 Tim. 3 &amp; 5. chap. Num. 12. 24 25. 2 Chro. 10 8, Act. 15, Numb 11 16, Deu 1 13, and 18. Exo. 39, 42 1 Tim. 3, 15, Gal. 2, 45, Colos. 4 16, 17 Rom 12, 8 1 Cor. 11. 16 &amp; 14 33. Act 20, 1 Pet. 51 Heb 54</note> are <hi>Governours,</hi>
or <hi>Ruling Elders;</hi> These men must be of life
likewise unreproveable, sober, gentle, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
temperate: Governing their owne
Families orderly: they must bee men of
wisedome, knowledge, and sound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
able to discerne betweene cause and
cruse, betweene plea and plea, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
to prevent and redresse evils. Their
especiall care must be to see the Ordinances
of God truly taught and practised, as well
by the officers in doing their duties upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as to see the people obey willingly &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily:
It is their dutie to see the congregation
holily and quietly ordered, and no way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
by the contentious and disobedient,
froward and obstinate: Not taking away the
liberty of the least, but uphoulding the right
of all, wisely judging of times and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
They must be readie assistants to
the Pastor and Teacher, helping to beare
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2373:11"/>
their burden, but not intruding into their
office.</p>
            <p>38. Jt is necessarie that these <hi>Officers</hi> bee
perpetuallie resident upon their charge.
For 1. a Minister is a Shepheard, and his
charge a Flock; now a shepheard hath a
flock to feed it continually. 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
God placeth a man, there is daylie
need of his labour and care. 3. The
people are in daunger of harme if they be
not watched over day and night. 4. The
Church requireth an Officers residencie
with her, as a dutie of him. 5. If they doe
otherwise, they cannot give their people a
good example, neither will there belove &amp;
familiarity between them.</p>
            <p>39. <hi>Deacons</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 6, 3 1 Tim. 3, 8, 9. Rom, 12, 8</note> must be men of honest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
indued with the Holy Ghost, they must
be grave, temperate, not given to excesse,
nor to filthy lucre: Faithfully ought they to
gather and collect by the Ordinance of the
Church, the goods and benevolence of the
faithfull, and by the same direction diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and trustily to distribute them according
to the necessitie of the Saints. Further,
they must inquire and consider of the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the wantes both of the Officers
and other poore, and accordingly relate to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2373:12"/>
the Church that provision may be made.
40. That the <hi>Deacons</hi> Office is not to
meddle with the Word and Sacraments,
but onely to collect the benevolence of the
faithfull, and faithfully to distribute the
same: is cleare by these reasons. 1. It is
an <hi>Apostolicall institution,</hi> that these should
attend upon the provision for the poore, <hi>Act.</hi>
6, 4. 2. The Scripture maketh it an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
and distinct Office from others in the
Church, and not to be mingled with any
other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 8. 3. No man can in any
tollerable measure discharge the Office of a
Minister and a Deacon also, <hi>Act.</hi> 6, 2.
4. The Ministeries of the Word are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
without it.</p>
            <p>41. This Office was instituted, 1. That
the faithfull might bee the more free from
feare, and follow their owne callings dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently.
2. That the Church might be the
more enriched with Heavenly and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
blessings, for the receives grace and
gifts, for the discharge of each calling.
3. To stirre men up to helpe the poore the
more willingly, considering that the Lord
hath appointed a speciall office for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
4. That there should bee no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
but that all the poore might be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2373:12"/>
comforted against their povertie &amp; wants.
Lastlie, to shew that as God hath created
soule and body, so hee takes care for
both.</p>
            <p>42. The <hi>Widowes</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 5 9. 10. Rom. 12, 8</note> or <hi>Deaconesses</hi> must
be Women of 60, yeares of age at the least.
For avoyding of inconveniences: they
must be well reported of for good workes,
such as have nourished their Children, such
as have beene harberous to strangers, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
and serviceable to the Saints, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
and helpefull to them in adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
given to every good worke, continuing
in supplications and prayer day and night:
They must minister to the sicke, lame, weary
and defeated such helpefull comforts as they
need, by watching, tending and helping
them.</p>
            <p>Further, they must shew good example
to the young women, in sober, modest, and
godly conversation, avoyding idlenes, vaine
talke, and light behaviour.</p>
            <p>43. These are the necessarie and onely
ordinarie functions,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 28.  Rom. 12, 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>9 Ephes. 4.8, 11, 12 13.</note> and offices, which our
Saviour hath ordained in his Church, unto
the due administration whereof, he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
his blessing to the end of the world.
And these are perpetuall and to continue
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2373:13"/>
for ever, and beside these it is unlawfull for
men (following the devises of their owne
braine) to institute or ordaine any in the
Churches of God.</p>
            <p>44. These offices though they be divers &amp;
severall, yet are they not severed, least there
should be a division in the body:<note n="a" place="margin">Luk 9, 46, 47. Ioh. 13. 12 17. 1 Cor. 12. 12. 25, 28 Ephes. 4, 11. 12. 13. 16.</note> but they
are as members of the body, having the same
care one of another, joyntly dooing their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
duties to the service of the saints: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can any of these offices bee wanting
without grevious lamenes and apparent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
of the body, yea violent iniury to
the head Christ Iesus.</p>
            <p>45. As every Christian Congregation
hath power and commandement to elect &amp;
ordaine their owne Ministers according to
the rule in Gods word prescribed: So right
and power to practice all other ordinances
of the Lord, &amp; namely to<note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 18 17 18. 1 Cor. 5, 4. 5. 2 Thes. 3. 5. with Levit. 24 14. 15. 16 <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>3.</note> cut of any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
the body: provided, that holy order of
proceeding bee keept, which Christ in his
will and Testament hath left us.</p>
            <p>46. The rule of Christ for excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is thus: If the fault be private, holy
and loving admonition and reproof is to be
vsed, with an inward desire and earnest care
to winne their brother: But if hee will not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2373:13"/>
heare, yet to take two or three other brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with him, whome he knoweth most meet for
that purpose, that by the mouth of two or
three witnesses, every word may be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
And if he refuse to heare them, then to
declare the matter to the church, which ought
severally and sharpely to reprehend, gravely
to admonish, and lovingly to perswade the
partie offending: shewing him the heynous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of his offence, and the danger of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie,
and the fearfull judgments of the
Lord. <hi>Lev. 19. 17. 18. Mat. 18. 15. Devt. 19. 15.
Mat. 18.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>47. All this notwithstanding the Church
is not to hold him as an enemie, but to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him and pray for him as a Brother;
prooving if at any time the Lord will give
him repentance. For this power is not given
them to the distruction of any, but to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification
of all. 2. <hi>Thes. 3. 15. 2. Cor. 10. 8.
&amp;</hi> 13. 10.</p>
            <p>48. If this preveale not to draw him to
repentance, then are they in the Name and
power of the Lord IESVS with the whole
Congregation, reverently in prayer to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to excommunication, that is unto the
casting him out of their congregation and
fellowship, covenant and protection of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2373:14"/>
Lord, for his disobedience &amp; obstinacie, and
committing him to Sathan, for the destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved
in the day of the Lord Iesus, if such be his
good wil and pleasure, <hi>Mat. 18. 17. 1 Cor.</hi> 5.
11.</p>
            <p>49. If the offence be publike, the partie
is publiquely to be reproved, and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
if he then repent not, to proceed to
excommunication, as aforesaid. 1. Tim. 5,
20. Gal. 2. 14. Ios. 7. 19. 2 Cor. 7. 9.</p>
            <p>50. Further they are to warn the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregarion
and all other beleevers <hi>to hold
him as a Heathen and Publican,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 17. 1. Cor. 11.</note> and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themselves from him, from all spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
communion, and civil familiaritie, so
farre as may be without the violation of
any naturall or civil bond.</p>
            <p>51. That obstinate sinners after due convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and patience, must be censured appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
1. By the commandement of Christ<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 18</note> &amp;
practice of the Apostolicall<note n="b" place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> churches. 2.
That the worship &amp; service of God may<note n="c" place="margin">Hag. 2. 13.</note> be
kept &amp; preserved from pollution, contempt
and prophanation. 3. That the sinner may
se his fault, be humbled<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 9. 2. Thes. 2. 14. 2. Cor. 6.</note> for it, and so saved
in the day of the Lord. 4. That the honour
and good name of the church may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:2373:14"/>
the which would be lost<note n="e" place="margin">Rev. 2. 14. 15.</note> if vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were suffered therein. 5. To prevent
the infection<note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 12 15.</note> of others. 6. That by the
zeale, e and holynes of the church, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note>may be gained to the Gospell. 7. To
glorifie Gods great name which is much
impeached<note n="h" place="margin">Eze. 36 20, 23.</note> by the unholy walking of
those which professe his truth. 8. That
others may feare,<note n="i" place="margin">Deut 17. 12. 13.</note> for if this course be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it may be a meanes to embolden many
to doe the like.</p>
            <p>52. The repentance of the partie must be
proportionable to the offence, viz. If the
offence be publique, publique: If private,
private: Humbled, submissive, sorrowfull,
unfained, giving glorie to the Lord. Lev.
19, 17, 18. Pro. 10. 12. Rom. 12. 19, and 13,
10, and 14. 1.</p>
            <p>53. There must great care bee had of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
that they be not captious or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
finding fault where none is; neither
yet in bitternes or reproach: For that were
to destroy and not to save our brother: But
they must be carefully done, with prayer
going before, they must bee seasoned with
truth, gravitie, love and peace. Mat. 18, 15.
and 26, 8. Gal. 6, 1, 2. 2 Tim, 2, 24. Mark.

discreet, faithfull and men able to speake
unto edification exhortation and comfort,
(though not yet in office of ministery) may

of the Gospell: all which are against the

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2373:15"/>
by this meanes, as. 1. the glory of God, in
the manifestation<note n="i" place="margin">Pet. 4. 10. 1 1.</note> of his manifould graces
2. That the gifts in men be not quenched.
3. For the fitting and trying of men for the
ministery. 4.<note n="k" place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 19.</note> For the preserving pure of
the Doctrine of the Church;<note n="l" place="margin">1 Tim. 3 2. 1 Cor. 14. 35.</note> which is more
in danger, if some one or two alone only
be heard and speake. 5. For debating and
satisfying of doubts if any arise. 6. For the
edifying of the Church and conversion of
others.</p>
            <p>55. As Christ (our Heavenlie Prophet) hath
set forth unto us in the <hi>New Testament</hi> the
manner and forme of the gathering and
Constitution of the visible Church: So hee
requires everie faithfull Christian, to make
himselfe a member of some particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and there to present their bodies
and soules, and to bring the gifts which God
hath given them. Our reasons are these:
1. Otherwise they are not to be admitted
unto the Holy Sacraments,<note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 26. 26.<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>9 and 28. 19. 20. Exo. 12. 43. 48. and 20. 7. Ast. 2. 38 41. and 8. 36. 37. Gen. 17.</note> the seales of
Gods Covenant: For these ought not to be
administred unto any, except they be added
unto some visible Church: unto which the
publick ordinances and ministery doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine.
2. Because of the presence of
God<note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 1. 13. 1 Tim. 3. 5. Psal. 65. 5.</note> &amp; Christ: If we will come to God, we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2373:16"/>
must come to that place where his presence
is in a speciall manner, and where he is to be
found, of all such as seeke him with their
whole heart. 3.<note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 119 6. Luk. 1. 5</note> How else have we res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to all the Commaundements. 4. That
the Saints may mutually edifie each other,
<note n="d" place="margin">Iud. 20. Rom. 1. 12 1 Cor. 11. 27.</note>and this followes upon their joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the fellowship of the Gospell. 5. To
<hi>consider</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">1. Thes. 5. 14. Heb. 3 12, 13. &amp; 1. 24. 25</note>, or observe our Brethren as wee
ought, watch over them, and seeke to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them unto a streight walking when
they goe astray. 6. Because of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 133 3. Esa. 60, 15. Deut. 4. 12, 13</note>and promise: For those which are
in the Church, are directly (as it were)
joyned to his blessings and graces, the
which are powred forth there abundantly.</p>
            <p>56. Such as joyne themselves unto <hi>true vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Churches</hi> ought first to goe unto the<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 14 ult.</note>
Elders, that by them their cause may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to the whole Congreg: afterward
they are to come into the publick assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie,
and there make confession<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 19, 18. Rom. 15. 9. 10. Psal. 18. 49.</note> of their
faith openly, and promise to walke in the
obedience of Christ: and thus beeing found
worthy, by the consent of the whole Church
they are joyfully to be received into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
communion of Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:2373:16"/>
57. As every established Church, hath
power and liberty to chuse their owne spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and Ecclesiasticall Officers: So, be it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that these Officers are tyed unto that
only Congregation<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 20, 28. 1 Cor. 7, 17.</note> of which they are
members, and by which they were elected
into office, and ought not to beare any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
Office in another, neither can they
administer the holy things of God, as <hi>Officers</hi>
and by vertue of a ministeriall calling any
where, but in their owne Congregation; No.
More then a <hi>Major</hi> or <hi>Bayliefe</hi> can execute
civill justice out of the limitts and bounds
of their owne priviledged Corporation.</p>
            <p>58. It is sure, that Christ Jesus hath not
subjected any Church or congregation, of
his, to any other superior Ecclesiasticall
jurisdiction, then unto that which is within
it selfe:<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 5. 1. Mat. 3. 2. Eph. 2. 19 1 Cor. 12. 20.</note> so that if a whole Church or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
shall erre in any matter of faith
or religion, noe other Church, or Church-officers,
have (by any warrant from the word
of God) power to censure, punish or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troile
the same, but are only to advise them:
and so to leave their soules to the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
judgement of Christ.</p>
            <p>58. It is the dutie of every Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
to be carefull, that no infant be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2373:17"/>
admitted unto <hi>Baptisme a</hi> whose parenn
(one at least) are not members of some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church. For.<note place="margin">Act. 2. 38. 39. &amp; 16. 15. 33. Mat. 28. 19. 20 Gen. 17. 7 8. 12. Eolos. 2. 12 13. Rom. 9. 41. Cor. 7. 14.</note> 1. If they doe<note n="b" place="margin">Ex. 20.</note>, by

                  <hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</hi> 4. The minister
a covenant breaker.<note n="e" place="margin">Mal. 28.</note> 5. There is no precept
nor example in the Scripture for it. 6. Such
a practice hindereth many parents from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceing
the way and order of the Gospel,
and causeth them to live and die libertines.
7. It induceth ignorant people to conceive
such an absolute necessity of Baptisme, as
that men cannot be saved without it.</p>
            <p>58. All Christians are bound to practice
Gods ordinances for his visible Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospell although the Magistrate,
<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 4. 19. 20. Danil. 6. 9. 10. Mat. 10. 28. Rev. 2. 3. Cap.</note>allow not thereof, yea forbid them upon
pean of death: For as the opprobation of
men and Angels; makes not the wayes of
God, and workes of religion never a whitt
the more lawfull, but onely, the more free
from bodily danger: so neither can their
disallowance make unlawfull such duties of
religion as the word of God, approveth, not
can they give pispensation to any person, to
for beare the practice thereof. <hi>There is more
