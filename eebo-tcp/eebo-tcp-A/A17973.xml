            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSVVERE TO THE Author of the Appeale.</head>
            <head>CHAPTER. 1.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Author of the <hi>Appeale</hi> hath troubled the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with strange Doctrines in two things especially: <hi>First,</hi> in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Predestination</hi> he attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to bring in a decree <hi>Respectiue,</hi> which he taketh for granted to bee the Doctrine of our Church: But this will neuer bee granted by <hi>vs,</hi> nor proued by <hi>him. Secondly,</hi> he taketh it likewise for granted, that the Doctrine of our Church is, that a man may <hi>fall away</hi> from grace <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>finally</hi>: If his meaning be that such as are called and iustified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods purpose may so fall away, this was neuer a Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning bee that others may fall away, which are not called and iustified according to Gods purpose, then hath he troubled the Church with an idle Discourse to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: For in this hee hath no Aduersary. For it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:24811:5"/>
in the beginning to agree vppon the state of the question. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> sets it in these tearmes: They that are called and iustified according to Gods purpose, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall away. Now against this question proposed in these tearmes, the Author of the <hi>Appeale</hi> disputeth: For <hi>pag.</hi> 37. scorning and reiecting this Doctrine, he writeth against his informers as hee calleth them, thus. <hi>It is your owne Doctrine, God hath appointed them to grace and glory, God according to his purpose hath called and iustified them, therefore it is certaine that they must and shall bee saued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the matter of Predestination I haue euer bin feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to meddle; it is one of the greatest and deepest of Gods Mysteries: We are with reuerence to wonder, and with Faith and Humility to follow that which God in his Scriptures hath reuealed in this poynt, and there to stay. But it hath beene the vnbridled humour of some to be still prying into Gods secrets, and to runne rashly and irreuerently into these Mysteries. These things were neuer so irreuerently handled by any, as they haue beene of late by the <hi>Arminians.</hi> The Author of the Appeale, doth complayne of some who <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> do conclude vpon Gods secrets. I would to God, he had beene as carefull to auoyde that fault in himselfe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tostat. in Genes. cap.</hi> 19.</note> as hee was to reprooue it in others: <hi>Tostatus Abulensis</hi> hath a remarkeable speech. <hi>In nulla materia periculosius erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quam in hac de praedestinatione: Eligerem enim magis contra totius fidei veritatem peruerse sentire, &amp; in hac non errare, quam in omnibus rectè iudicanao in hac sola deuiare.</hi> The speech is strange, but hee intended to shewe, that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is more dangerous in this point, then in all other: His reason is, <hi>Quia ex nulla speculatiua cognitione tantu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:24811:5"/>
noster statuitur, &amp; operationes diriguntur</hi>: And againe: <hi>Scientiae de praedestinatione specialiori modo, quam omnes aliae, à Deo est; ex hac enim perditio vel saluatio nostra ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordium sumit</hi>: Therefore his aduise is, that men should bee very sparing in the handling of such a Mystery: which aduise I am also desirous to follow: yet here I am drawne into it against my will. For when such men as seeme to haue little reuerence to so high a Mystery, run rashly and boldly into it, and as it may seeme without great praeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the matter, which they should haue thought on, conceiuing things contrary to that, which we haue receiued from the Scripture, I may not bee silent: For that were, as much as in mee is, to betray the Truth. Yet my care shal bee to say no more heerein, then I shall bee drawne necessarily to speake for the Truth; and to remooue that which hath beene er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneously presumed by others: For then is a man bound to maintayne the Truth, when it is oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>It troubled mee not a little, I confesse, that I am to deale with a Minister of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; one that hath beene mine ancient Acquaintance, of whom I had greater and better hopes: But in Gods Cause all respects of Friendshippe and Acquaintance, yea if it were of blood and kindred, must giue place to the Truth. <hi>Leuy</hi> sayde to his Father and to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>I haue not seene him, neither knew hee his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, nor knewe his Children: For they obserued thy Word, and kept thy Commandement: Deut.</hi> 33.9. And this is the way to do him good: For I am not out of hope of reclaiming of him, seeing hee hath promised, that if the euidence bee cleare against him, or if hee be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:24811:6"/>
               <hi>per testes idoneos</hi> to haue erred, he wil recall it. The <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are <hi>testes idonei.</hi> I shall deale freely and plainly. For the ordering of the whole: First after a briefe <hi>Introduction</hi> set downe for the better vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the controuersie, I will examine his extrauagant opinions concerning the <hi>respectiue</hi> decree of <hi>Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and after of <hi>falling away</hi> from Grace. Last of all, some <hi>particulers</hi> in his Booke.</p>
            <p>This I doe not vndertake vpon any confidence that I conceiue in my selfe. I know many in our Church more worthy and able then my selfe, and I thanke God for them: But as heeretofore I haue had experience of Gods mercy, and found that the loue of the truth hath in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things enabled me to defend the Truth, and helped me to know the Truth, so I rest vpon the same helpe: I seeke Gods Truth, which will not fayle them that seeke and loue it. And if any man of greater confidence in his wit and learning, will enter vppon the Defence of the Appeale (for I haue heard the whisperings) I shall bee willing to spend the rest of mine old dayes in this, for they cannot bee spent in a better seruice.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Church England</hi> was <hi>reformed</hi> by the helpe of our learned and Reuerend <hi>Bishops,</hi> in the daies of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, and in the beginning of the Raigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> They who then gaue that forme of reformation to our Church, held consent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:24811:6"/>
in Doctrine with <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by authority appoynted Readers in the two Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities; and with other then liuing, whom they iudged to bee of best learning and soundnesse in the reformed Churches. And of the Ancients especially with St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi> And were carefull to hold this Vnity amongst themselues, and with the reformed Churches. For that these worthy Bishops who were in the first reformation, had this respect vnto <hi>P. Martyr,</hi> and <hi>M. Bucer,</hi> it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, both because the Doctrine of our Church doth not differ from the Doctrine that these taught, and because that worthy Arch-bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> caused our Leiturgy to be Translated into Latin, and craued the consent and iudgement of <hi>M. Bucer,</hi> who gaue a full consent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as it appeareth in his workes <hi>Inter opera Anglicana.</hi> And <hi>P. Martyr</hi> beeing likewise requested, writeth in <hi>His epistles</hi> touching that matter, his iudgement and consent of the gouernment and discipline of our Church.</p>
            <p>This vniformity of Doctrine was held in our Church without disturbance, as long as those worthy Bishops li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, who were employed in the reformation.</p>
            <p>For albeit the <hi>Puritans</hi> disquieted our Church about their conceiued <hi>Discipline,</hi> yet they neuer mooued any quarrell against the Doctrine of our Church, which is well to be obserued. For if they had embraced any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which the Church of <hi>England</hi> denied, they would assuredly haue quarrelled about that aswell, as they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Discipline. But it was then the open confession both of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and of the <hi>Puritanes,</hi> that both parts embraced a mutuall consent in Doctrine, onely the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was in matter of inconformity: Then hitherto there was no <hi>Puritane Doctrine</hi> knowne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:24811:7"/>The first disturbers of this vniformity in doctrine were <hi>Barret</hi> and <hi>Baro</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and after them <hi>Thomson. Barret</hi> and <hi>Baro</hi> beganne this breach in the time of that most reuerend Prelate Archbishop <hi>Whitgift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding that these had attempted to disturbe the Doctrine of our Church, yet was the vniformity of Doctrine still maintained.</p>
            <p>For when our Church was disquieted by <hi>Barret</hi> and <hi>Baro,</hi> the Bishops that then were in our Church, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the new Doctrine of these men, and vtterly disliked and reiected it: And in the poynt of Predestination con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that which they vnderstood to be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> against <hi>Barret</hi> and <hi>Baro,</hi> who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned that doctrine.</p>
            <p>This was fully declared by both the Archbishops, <hi>Whitgift</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Hutton</hi> of <hi>Yorke,</hi> with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bishops and learned men of both Prouinces, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed <hi>Barret</hi> and <hi>Baro,</hi> refuted their doctrine, and iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the contrary, as appeareth by that Booke, which both the Archbishops then compiled.</p>
            <p>The same Doctrine which the Bishops then maintained, was at diuerse times after approued, as in the <hi>Conference at Hampton Court,</hi> as will be hereafter confirmed. And againe it was confirmed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in the time of our late Soueraigne, <hi>Articulo</hi> 38.</p>
            <p>The Author of the Appeale pleadeth against the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and iustifieth the Doctrine of <hi>Barret, Baro</hi> and <hi>Thomson,</hi> auerring the same to be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hee doth not by naming of those men, whose names he knew would bring no honour to this cause: but by laying downe and iustifying their doctrines, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:24811:7"/>
suggesting that they who maintained the doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Lambeth,</hi> are <hi>Caluinists</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi>: So that those Reuerend Archbishops, <hi>Whitgift</hi> and <hi>Hutton,</hi> with the Bishops of our Church, who then liued, are in his iudgement to be reiected as <hi>Puritans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The question is whether of these two positions we must now receiue for the doctrines of our Church: that which <hi>Barret, Baro</hi> and <hi>Thomson</hi> would haue brought in, which doctrines were then refuted and reiected by our Church: Or that Doctrine which the <hi>Bishops</hi> of our Church main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained against these men, which Doctrine hath beene since vpon diuerse occasions approued? If there were no more to be sayd, I dare put it to the Issue before any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Iudges.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Author of the Appeale, vndertaking to maintaine the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> refuteth that which hitherto hath bene taken for the Doctrine of our Church; and maintaineth the doctrine of the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> striuing to make that to be vnderstood the Doctrine of our Church. A bold attempt, whether hee doth it through ignorance, or open malice to trouble the Church with these doctrines, which haue troubled so many Churches: that himselfe knoweth best. But that this he doth, it is apparant, by that which he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and will be made more apparant by that which must
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:24811:8"/>
now be sayd in the necessary defence of the truth, and of the doctrines of our Church.</p>
            <p>The poysoned doctrines of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> were neuer well knowne before Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> discouered that daunger. The summe is to <hi>pull downe</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to <hi>set vp</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Man.</hi> This they attempted to do by defacing the grace of God. And because that could not be done, without controlling the Doctrine of Predestination, this they haue likewise attempted. Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination is fashioned into a new mould by these men, who haue made it not to depend vpon <hi>God,</hi> but vppon <hi>Man:</hi> That God himselfe and his high and holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and will must depend vpon somewhat in man, must expect mans Free will and merits. by this meanes they saw that grace might easily be defaced. So that the Question is, whether that the fountaine of grace be in <hi>God,</hi> or in <hi>Man</hi>: For they take it from Gods good wil and purpose, and place it in mans merits. This is the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Pelagians</hi>: which the Author of the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale</hi> seemeth to embrace, and, as well as he can, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth others to doe so: For first he laboreth to corrupt the doctrine of Predestination, and then to deface the doctrine of Grace: First against the doctrine of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination hee hath brought nothing, but the olde and worne obiections of the <hi>Pelagians</hi>: Finding no other he was glad to take them, that he might seeme to say som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what against Predestination. Which obiections albeit Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> and others of the auncient <hi>Fathers</hi> haue answered, and refuted long agoe; yet that thing moueth not this man: somewhat must be sayd to deceiue the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that will be deceiued. First I will examine one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his Booke, by which we may vnderstand his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:24811:8"/>
meaning in the poynt of <hi>Predestination</hi>: The sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is this. <hi>Pag.</hi> 58. speaking of the 17 <hi>Article,</hi> he sayth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In all which passage there is not one word, sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or apex touching your absolute, necessary, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, irrespectiue, irresistible</hi> (in other places he addeth <hi>Fatall necessitating</hi>) <hi>Decree of God, to call, saue and glorifie Saint</hi> Peter, <hi>for instance, infallibly, without any consideration had or regard to his Faith, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Repentance; and to condemne</hi> Iudas <hi>as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily without any respect had at all to his sinne: This</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>is the priuate fancy of some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Appeale</hi> doth often charge some men with a Doctrine, which no man did euer main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne. For I say, he is not able to proue, that any haue maintayned the Doctrine of predestination, in those tearmes which hee proposeth. Indeede <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his <hi>Followers,</hi> and amongst them <hi>this Author,</hi> haue made these obiections against the Doctrine of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination: We vse not th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se tearmes we reiect them, we neede them not, we finde them not in Scripture, we haue enough in Gods Word to maintayne this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. Touching that which hee sayth of <hi>Iudas,</hi> that some should teach, that by the decree of God, <hi>Iudas</hi> should be condemned, without any respect to his sin; I suppose it will be hard for him to finde any that teacheth so in those tearmes. <hi>Caluin</hi> I suppose is the man hee meaneth: But <hi>Caluin</hi> in many places sayth the contrary, and confesseth that wicked men are damned iustly for their sinnes: that Gods mercy appeareth in them that are saued, and his iustice in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:24811:9"/>
other. He saith indeed of the reprobate: <hi>Principium ruinae &amp; damnationis esse in eo, quod sunt à Deo dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licti</hi>: which this Author will also confesse, because he can say nothing against it.</p>
            <p>But to open this point a little further. It must be confessed that whilest some haue strayed too farre on the left hand, touching the respectiue decree, that God for respects in men hath predestinated them: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in zeale to correct this errour, haue gone some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too farre on the right hand; teaching that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination is a separation betweene men and men, as they were found euen in the Masse of mankind vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, before the Creation, and the fall of Man. It is true that this Counsell of God, was before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Fall. But here we seeke vpon what ground first presupposed, this counsell of God proceeded. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> was cleere in this, that Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Predestination presupposed the fall of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the corrupt masse of mankinde in sinne. And verily this opinion hath such firme grounds of Scripture, that (so farre as I can iudge) are vnanswera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: For the Apostle teacheth that <hi>Predestination</hi> and <hi>Election</hi> are <hi>in Christ.</hi> Ephes. 1.4. <hi>As he hath chosen vs in Christ, before the foundations of the World:</hi> and v. 5. <hi>Who hath predestinate vs to bee adopted through Iesus Christ in himselfe</hi>: And verse 11. <hi>In whom wee were chosen when we were Predestinate.</hi> Now if Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be in Christ, it must be acknowledged that this counsell of God had respect to the corrupt masse of mankind: For the benefite that we haue in Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not in the state of innocency. Some haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that the Angels had that benefit of their stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:24811:9"/>
in Christ. To this I say, granting that the Angels had that blessing from Christ: yet this is a thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting, and beyond all contradiction, that the doctrine of Predestination, as the Apostle teacheth it, is not for Angels, but only for men; not for men in the state of innocency, but for sinful men. In declaring the purpose of Predestination the Lord saith, <hi>I will haue mercy on whom I will haue mercy</hi>: Then the counsell of Predestination, is the counsell whereby God sheweth mercy where he will: But <hi>mercy</hi> doth presuppose <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,</hi> and a sinfull estate in man: Againe the purpose of God is conducted to his end by such meanes as God hath set, &amp; the Apostle hath opened: that is, by Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination, Vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; Iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to glorification, that is to the intended end. But vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot be vnderstood of angels, but of men: &amp; not of men with out sin in the estate of innocency, but of sinfull men. For sinners are called to repentance: &amp; sinners they must be that are iustified from their sins. None are called to repentance and iustified from sin, but sinners. And it is also certaine that none are thus called and iustified, but only they that are predestinated: Therfore Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth not looke vpon the masse of mankind vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt &amp; innocent, but vpon the masse corrupted. These things are set in such euidences of the Scriptures, that for my part I know not what can bee said to impeach them. Vpon these grounds we must confesse, that both Predestination &amp; reprobation do respect that sinful &amp; corrupted masse of mankind.</p>
            <p>But between Predestination &amp; reprobation, amongst many other, this is one difference, that all men for sinne haue deserued reprobation, but no man could deserue
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:24811:10"/>
mercy to be deliuered by predestination: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>For there is no difference, for all haue sinned, and are depriued of the glory of God.</hi> Then in the sinfull estate of corruption all are found once a like, and <hi>all depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the glory of God.</hi> And what is this to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the glory of God, but to deserue reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? So he sayth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.30. <hi>God hath shut vp all in Vnbeleefe</hi>: So that all that are receiued to mercy by Predestination, Vocation, Iustification, are taken out of the corrupted state of mankinde, the rest are left in their sinnes. These we call men reprobate, that are left in their sinnes; and in the end iustly condemned for sin. But why some are left in their sinnes, other deliuered from their sins by Predestination, Vocation, Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of this no cause can be giuen but the will of God.</p>
            <p>But sayth our Author <hi>in that Article there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word syllable, or apex to proue, &amp;c.</hi> Yes sir, there is somewhat, For in that Article <hi>Predestination</hi> is sayde to be <hi>The euerlasting and constant purpose of God.</hi> It is sayd in the Article, that <hi>They that are predestinated, are called according to Gods purpose:</hi> This is enough to proue all which they intend, and to ouerthrow your new Doctrine, that men are called in consideration of their Faith, Obedience and Repentance. The Article saith moreouer, <hi>That they are iustified freely.</hi> If freely, then without consideration of any thing fore-seene in man. Thus whilst in curiosity you were seeking your <hi>apices,</hi> you stumbled and are falne into a dangerous pit, out of which God deliuer you. I will doe the best ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice I can to make you see these dangers.</p>
            <p>Your common Obiection against them, that teach predestination to depend only vpon Gods will, is this.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:24811:10"/>
You say, <hi>They bring in a decree absolute, necessary, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiue, irresistible, determined, fatall, necessitating.</hi> These Obiections you borrowed from the <hi>Arminians,</hi> they had them from the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> But you say that <hi>You haue read nothing of the Arminians.</hi> It seemeth that you are an excellent Scholler, that can learne your les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so perfectly without instructors. If they who vse these Obiections take them from the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> then you see that the Doctrine which the <hi>Pelagians</hi> oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is the same which you oppugne.</p>
            <p>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Augustine</hi> had much controuersie with the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians. Pelagius</hi> taught that <hi>Grace is giuen to men in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their merits.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Augustine</hi> refuseth this error of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> for which he was condemned for an Heretick in three Synodes. <hi>Gratia Dei datur secundum merita nostra.</hi> This was the position which the <hi>Pelagians</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and which St. <hi>Augustine</hi> refuted. St. <hi>Augustin</hi> referreth the matter, to Gods will and purpose onely. But this <hi>Pelagius</hi> denied, and sayd, that grace depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not vpon Gods will onely: He denied not the will of God, but sayde that Gods will had respect to merits fore-seene. In this sense he sayth, <hi>Gratia Dei datur se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum merita nostra.</hi> And in this sense the <hi>purpose</hi> of God was held by the <hi>Pelagians</hi> to be <hi>respectiue,</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting somewhat fore-seene in men predestinated. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius</hi> himselfe said it respected <hi>merits: others</hi> said, that it respecteth <hi>faith</hi> fore-seene: <hi>others</hi> deuised the respect of <hi>workes</hi> fore-seene, which is all one with <hi>Pelagius</hi> his merits fore-seene. The <hi>Arminians</hi> haue added the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of <hi>humility</hi> fore-seene.</p>
            <p>Hence arise two opinions about Predestination. The one the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> taught by St. <hi>Augustine,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:24811:11"/>
and <hi>Prosper,</hi> by St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> and the rest that herein followed St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:</hi> The other is the <hi>opinion</hi> of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> who oppugned this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>If the question be proposed, why God receiueth one to mercy and not an other? why this man, and not that? to this question all the Orthodoxe that haue taught in the Church after St. <hi>Augustine</hi> answere, that of this taking one to mercy, and leauing an other, no reason can be giuen but only the <hi>will</hi> of God. The <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> say, that Gods will heerein is directed by somewhat fore-seene in men Predestinated. Now that Predestination dependeth only vppon Gods will without respect to any thing fore-seene in men, is as I sayd, the receiued Doctrine of St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> and of the Church following: For before St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> this thing came not in question, as himselfe in many places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth. The same is the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches. And this hath hitherto been receiued the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I will adde also, the same is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> deliuereth it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellar. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de grat. &amp; lib. arb. cap.</hi> 16.</note> For he concludeth thus, <hi>Restat igitur vt huius discretionis causa sit voluntas Dei, quae vnum liberat quia ei placet, alterum non liberat quia non placet.</hi> Wherein he followeth the Doctrine of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi> and the rest.</p>
            <p>Of these two opinions, the Author of the <hi>Appeale</hi> hath made choyce of that which <hi>Pelagius</hi> held against the Church, and maintayneth it by the arguments which the <hi>Pelagians</hi> haue vsed. For thus they obiected against the Doctrine of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that he <hi>brought in a decree, absolute, irrespectiue, irresistible, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:24811:11"/>
fatall, necessitating,</hi> and these be our Authors Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections.</p>
            <p>It must bee confessed it is a wrong to lay to mens charge Doctrines in other tearmes then themselues do teach. These tearmes are not vsed by them, whom this man chargeth: We do not deale so with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, or any other: For my part I mislike these tearmes: But if by this word <hi>decree</hi> there be nothing intended, but the purpose of Gods election, I will not wrangle for words: Onely I thinke that wee may speake most warrantably in the words of the Scripture: For the holy Scripture hath furnished us with words sufficient. We finde it there called the <hi>will</hi> of God, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>purpose</hi> of God, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Good Pleasure</hi> of God. These words suffice to sober mindes to expresse this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Then he chargeth vs to teach that this <hi>decree</hi> is <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute.</hi> Because the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and their Followers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre an absolute <hi>decree,</hi> they should declare what they meane by this word absolute. If this be the meaning of the word, that Gods purpose of Predestination de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon the onely will of God, and not vppon any thing fore-seene in men Predestinated, which God respected in Predestinating: then I affirme that this is the ancient and Catholike Doctrine of the Church, and the contrary is the Doctrine of the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians.</hi> If this Author would speake for the <hi>Pelagians</hi> against the receiued Doctrine of the Church, then must he declare vnto vs what thing did mooue the will of God. And by this meanes he will teach vs a thing which no man euer could speake to, to know the cause of Gods will. <hi>Dicat qui potest.</hi> I thinke hee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:24811:12"/>
knoweth as little in this matter as other men. And yet hee is bound to instruct vs in this Mystery. For hee that sayth, the will of God dependeth vppon something, is bound to shewe what that thing is vpon which the will of God dependeth: But if it bee independing and respecting nothing but it selfe, why then is it not absolute? And why then doth hee with the <hi>Pelagians</hi> cast this against Gods purpose of Predestination, that it is absolute?</p>
            <p>The next accusation is that this <hi>decree</hi> is <hi>necessary</hi>: Can any man giue vs a reason, why the purpose of God shold not be necessary? Our Author writeth thus, Pag. 10. <hi>The will of God is the necessity of things, say your Maisters out of Saint Augustine misunderstood</hi>: He that chargeth others with mis-understanding, should declare the true vnderstanding, that they that misunderstand, may be informed. He doth not this, but we must all be supposed to misunderstand this thing in the vnderstanding wherof he wil not helpe vs.</p>
            <p>There must be some cause of the necessitie of those things that are necessary: What cause can this be? It must either be the will of God, or some other thing. The auncient Writers of the Church make it the will of God. If you can find any other cause, you must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it. The will of God may truely be sayd to be the necessity of things, because it is the prime, high and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary cause of things. If you grant not this, then you must point out vnto vs some superior cause: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you cannot do, you must be contented with vs to confesse, that the will of God is not only necessary, but the necessity of things.</p>

                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 1 <hi>contra Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag &amp; Calest. cap.</hi> 6.</note> that this <hi>decree</hi> is <hi>irrespectiue.</hi> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> as before I related, affirmeth in diuerse places, that <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi> taught that the grace of God is giuen in respect of merits. In this respect <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his followers held the decree respectiue, as this man doth. He must tell vs what Gods purpose respected, and he must giue vs a reason why he was so bold, as to make this a doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which was first inuented, and alwayes afterward maintained by the <hi>Pelagians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church.</p>
            <p>The next accusation is, that the purpose of Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is <hi>irresistible.</hi> This obiection is much vsed by the <hi>Arminians</hi> taken from the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> This was first deuised to set forth the glorious power of Freewill. If the question be moued, whether Freewill may resist grace? it is apparant naturally in the <hi>vnregenerate,</hi> it may resist, it doth daily resist: according to that <hi>Act.</hi> 7 51. <hi>You haue alwayes resisted the holy Ghost.</hi> But if the question be moued of <hi>them that are called according to Gods purpose,</hi> whether they resist the grace of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (in which the Apostle teacheth that there is the <hi>exceeding greatnes of Gods power</hi>: and what is that but Gods omnipotent power?<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>The eyes of your vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding being inlightned, that you may know what the riches of the glory of his inheritance of the Saints, &amp; what is the exceeding greatnes of his power to vs-ward, who beleeue according to the working of his mighty power.</hi> Now we beleeue by the power of his calling, therefore this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatnes of his power is in his calling: For the first grace that is wrought in vs is faith, which is wroght

according to this power of his calling.) If therfore the question be of them that are thus called according to his purpose, and according to this great power; then, remouing the humor of contention, the truth wil easily appeare. For this power of God doth so order the will of man, that the will of man cannot but be willing to receiue this grace, when it is thus ordered, framed and wrought vpon; for the power of working is in grace: grace worketh, conuerteth nature and healeth it: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is wrought vpon, conuerted, and healed. So the question is whether nature in this case doth resist the omnipotent power of God?<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>I demaund from whence hee had this obiection to dart against Gods Predestination? it is apparant that it cometh out of the same quiuer out of which he had all the rest. I must intreat him to obserue this obiection more exactly: and by this he may finde against whom he disputeth: for the blessed <hi>Apostle</hi> layeth downe these things in order: First the <hi>doctrine,</hi> which this Author oppugneth; secondly, this mans <hi>obiection</hi> against that doctrine: and lastly, the <hi>answer</hi> to this obiection. <hi>Ro.</hi> 9.18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>doctrine</hi> in this Apostolicall conclusion: <hi>Therefore he hath mercy on whom he wil haue mercy, and whom he wil, he hardeneth.</hi> The <hi>obiection</hi> in these words: <hi>Then thou wilt say vnto me, why doth he yet complaine, who hath resisted his will?</hi> The <hi>answer</hi> in these words: <hi>Nay, but ô man who art thou that repliest against God? shal the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus?</hi> Our Author must consider against

whom he maketh this obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he accuseth Gods purpose of predestination to be a decree irresistible: For the Apostle hath met with this obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <hi>Who hath resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted his wil?</hi>

               <hi>may resist</hi> this will of God, but he saith that this maner of obiecting is <hi>replying</hi> against God. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> obserued thus much. <hi>Voluntati eius quis resistit? Numquid responsum est ab Apostolo; ô homo falsum est quod dixisti? non; sed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsum est ô homo quis tu es, qui responsas Deo?</hi> And that which the blessed Apostle hath taught in this one obiection we may by good ground and warrant from the Apostle iudge accordingly in all the rest of these accusations and obiections, which are here brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the doctrine of Predestination, that all these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections are nothing else but replying against God. How could such a desperate conceit come into the hart of one that professeth the Gospell in our Church? What this Author may thinke hereof I know not: but verily I should tremble, if I were found in such a case, in plaine termes, opposite to the Apostle; obiecting that which the Apostle hath so seuerely repressed.</p>
            <p>An other accusation against Predestination is, that it is <hi>determined.</hi> I thinke the man did not vse much premeditation in these things, but tooke them vpon the credit of some that he trusted. For that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of God should be determined, did euer any man doubt? The very word <hi>propositum,</hi> the <hi>purpose</hi> of God doth proue a <hi>determination.</hi> And hee may read that <hi>neither Herod, nor Pontius Pilate, nor the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, nor the Iewes,</hi> in shewing their greatest malice against Christ and his Apostles, and in exercising their greatest cruelty,<note place="margin">Act. 4.28.</note> could go no further, nor <hi>doe no other thing, then whatsoeuer the hand and Counsell of God had
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:24811:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
determined before to be done</hi>: This was neuer doubted, no not amongst the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that the Counsell and purpose of God is determined. Onely the question is what doth Determine Gods purpose? whether his owne <hi>will</hi> or mans <hi>Freewill</hi>? If <hi>this mans</hi> purpose bee to giue this to mans free will, then he commeth home to the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> If he confesse this determinating po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to be in Gods wil; then to what end doth he obiect this, as a thing absurd, that the decree is determined?</p>
            <p>The last accusation is, that they who hold the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Predestination</hi> bring in <hi>Fatall necessity.</hi> As <hi>he</hi> vseth this obiection, so the <hi>Pelagians</hi> vsed it, and vrged it against St. <hi>Augustine.</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> complaineth of such accusers of his Doctrine:<note place="margin">

            <p>That Doctrine of the respective decree, which the Author of the <hi>Appeale</hi> nourisheth as a Viper in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:24811:15"/>
doth indeed respect that conclusion of <hi>Pelagius</hi>; that <hi>Grace is giuen according to merits.</hi> For if <hi>grace</hi> be giuen according to some respects or vertues found or fore-seene in men predestinated, then it must follow as <hi>Pelagius</hi> taught, that <hi>Grace</hi> is giuen according to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: for in the end they will close: For this respectiue decree respecteth somewhat in the predestinated: What is that, but some vertue? and what is that but some merit? Thus hee hath brought his respectiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to a faire issue, to joyne hands with <hi>Pelagius.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps hee may seeke an euasion, that by a respectiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree he meaneth not the <hi>decree</hi> of <hi>Predestination,</hi> but of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> which is in respect of sinne. I could wish that hee had beene so aduised, as to haue reserued this refuge for himselfe: But hee speaketh of the <hi>decree</hi> of <hi>Predestination,</hi> scornfully calling it our <hi>New Doctrine,</hi> and sometimes <hi>our decree,</hi> sometimes the <hi>Priuate fancy of some particular men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But himselfe putteth this matter out of doubt, in those words of his before cited, on the 17. <hi>Article. There is not</hi> (sayth he) <hi>any word, syllable or apex touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your absolute, necessary, determined, irresistible, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiue decree of God, to cal, saue and glorifie St.</hi> Peter, <hi>for instance, without any consideration had or regard to his Faith, Obedience and Repentance, and to condemne</hi> Iudas <hi>as necessarily, without any respect had to his sinne: This,</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the priuat fancy of some particuler men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now are we come to the instance of St. <hi>Peter</hi>: For to all other things I haue spoken. In this instance hee hath somewhat roundly opened himselfe: This taketh away that refuge, which he might haue reserued, to say, that by his respectiue decree, he might haue meant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:24811:16"/>
That men that are forsaken are iustly throwne into condemnation in respect of their sins.</p>
            <p>For to speake somewhat to this particular. If that be granted which we haue prooued before by euident Scriptures, that both <hi>Predestination</hi> and <hi>Reprobation</hi> respect the corrupt masse of mankinde: This I say bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted: It followeth that Gods iustice did find a iust cause to condemne all men, because all haue sinned and are depriued of the glory of <hi>God</hi>: But <hi>God</hi> in his mercy receyueth some to fauour: Of this we can finde no other cause but the meere and onely <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God</hi>: <hi>God</hi> in his iustice condemneth other; of this beside the <hi>Wil</hi> of <hi>God</hi> wee finde a cause, to be the <hi>sinne</hi> of those men that are condemned. Here riseth a question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be an absolute decree of Reprobation? If we vnderstand an absolute decree to be such as dependeth vpon the onely <hi>wil</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> without respect to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing; then I confesse I cannot vnderstand any such absolute decree in this: For those things are here vnderstood absolute, which depend vppon no other cause, but only the <hi>wil</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Now heere besides the <hi>wil</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> wee find <hi>sin</hi> to be a iust cause to condemne, and to reprobate. For this ground wee take with Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> that <hi>Predestination</hi> and <hi>Reprobation</hi> doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect sinne. And if besides the <hi>wil</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> sinne also be a just cause of condemnation, then, I vnderstand not how any decree herein can be absolute. But if it should be further questioned whether <hi>dereliction</hi> of some in their sinne be absolute? so far as my knowledge reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, I must yeeld that this may be called absolute; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in this there is no other cause but onely the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God</hi>: For seeing that all men are once found sinners,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:24811:16"/>
there may be a cause giuen why all men may iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue condemnation: The cause is apparant, that is, sinne; but why any man should bee saued no cause ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, but onely the will of God, and his mercy to them whom hee is well pleased to deliuer from sinne. Vpon these grounds St. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, <hi>Obdurationis meritum inuenio, misericordiae meritum non inuenio.</hi> But some obiect thus: If sinne be the cause of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and reprobation, then must all men be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and reprobate; for all haue sinned. Whereby they would inferre, that sinne is no cause of condemnation and reprobation, but onely the will of God: but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the consequence; for the true consequence should be this. If sinne be the cause of condemnation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, then no man can find any cause in himselfe, why he should not be condemned and reprobate. For I suppose that the greatest Saints that euer liued, could finde no cause <hi>in themselues</hi> why they might not bee condemned and reprobate: I say <hi>in themselues</hi>: for if they looke out of themselues vpon Christ, then they finde an high and only cause, the will of God in Christ, in whom he hath fully reuealed his will and mercy to saue sinners. For Christ was sent to saue them that were lost, and to call sinners to repentance.</p>
            <p>Some may happily say, that these questions and quirkes might be forborne, and not spoken of at all. I answere, I am of the same minde: But when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Truth, <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> are euer busie in stirring these questions, these busie heads im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a necessity vppon them that loue the Truth to maintaine it, and by plaine writing to walke safely and plainely euen through the middest of <hi>Maeandrian</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:24811:17"/>
crookes and windings of the Aduersaries. The Church (sayth <hi>Tertullian</hi>) hath a rule, and this rule hath no question, but such as Heresies bring in.</p>
            <p>Thus we see there may be a cause of condemnation besides the onely will of God, but concurring with Gods will; but of saluation no cause can be giuen but the onely will of God. Yet our <hi>Author</hi> here vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to find a cause besides the only wil of God, though concurring with Gods will: This hee doth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of St. <hi>Peter</hi>: For he sayth that <hi>There is neither word, apex, nor syllable to proue that God did call, saue, and glorifie St.</hi> Peter <hi>without any consideration had or regard to his faith, obedience and repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The better to vnderstand this, we must cleare some things which hee hath confounded. They that deale not playnely confound many things of purpose, which must be distinguished that the matter may bee clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Hee sayth that Saint <hi>Peter was not called, saued and glorified without consideration, or regard of his Faith, Obedience and Repentance.</hi> This proposition in Truth containeth three propositions in it: And nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he conclude three propositions at once, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any man answere to three at once. Therefore wee must distinctly separate these three propositions, that his confusion may appeare, and that a cleare an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere may be framed vnto the poynt in question.</p>
            <p>Of these three propositions, the first is, St. <hi>Peter was not called without respect to his Faith, Obedience, and Repentance.</hi> The second is, Saint <hi>Peter was not saued without respect to his Faith, Obedience and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> The third is, Saint <hi>Peter was not glorified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect to his Faith, Obedience, and Repentance.</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:24811:17"/>
These three things are not all of one kinde. The two latter propositions we grant; the reason is, because sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and glorification are in the nature of a reward. Now the Scripture witnesseth, that <hi>God will reward euery man according to his Workes</hi>: And therefore Saint <hi>Peters faith, obedience</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> shall-bee rewarded with saluation, and glorification: And sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and glory may bee sayd to respect these goods workes that went before.</p>
            <p>But the first of these propositions is, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was not <hi>called</hi> without respect to his <hi>faith, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi> Here we close with him. I must charge with <hi>Pelagianisme</hi> in that very point of this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, for which <hi>Pelagius</hi> was condemned for an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke in the <hi>Synode</hi> of <hi>Palestina,</hi> as St. <hi>Augustine</hi> often relateth. In which Synode the Doctrines of <hi>Pelagius</hi> were condemned, as they were also in many other Synodes: <hi>Concilio Carthag.</hi> 7. <hi>Concilio Meleuitano: Concilio Arausica:</hi> And also condemned by the decrees of the <hi>Popes</hi> that then were, and the <hi>Emperors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He sayth that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>not called</hi> without respect and consideration had to his <hi>faith, obedience</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>: In denying this proposition he affirmeth the contradictory: That St. <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>called</hi> in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and respect of his <hi>faith, obedience,</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi> This is the same which the Church hath condemned in <hi>Pelagius.</hi> For <hi>Pelagius</hi> taught no otherwise but thus, <hi>Gratia Dei datur secundum merita nostra:</hi> In respect or consideration of our merits. This man teacheth that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>called</hi> in consideration or respect of his <hi>faith, obedience</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi> This is euidently <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum merita,</hi> as <hi>Pelagius</hi> vnderstood <hi>merita.</hi> For
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:24811:18"/>
those things which <hi>Pelagius</hi> and the Ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> who wrote in his time, called <hi>merita,</hi> were no other then these which <hi>this man</hi> calleth <hi>faith, obedience,</hi> and <hi>repentance; Pelagius</hi> knew no greater <hi>merits</hi> then these. If St. <hi>Peter</hi> was called in consideration and respect of these things, then was that grace of his calling giuen in consideration and respect of these things, and so <hi>Gratia datur secundum merita: Secundum merita,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we Translate, <hi>according to merits,</hi> or <hi>in respect</hi> and consideration <hi>of merits,</hi> all is one. I stand not vppon any curiosity of Words, there is no difference in the matter. It followeth necessarily, that this man teacheth that Doctrine, for which <hi>Pelagius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for an Hereticke: let him shift this as hee can.</p>
            <p>Here the Author of the <hi>Appeale</hi> may consider what wrong he hath done to the Church of <hi>England</hi>; in obtruding, for Doctrines of our Church, the old rotten Heresies of <hi>Pelagius.</hi> And let him also consider who doth now <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> trouble and betray the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Wee teach with the Scriptures, and with the most Orthodoxe Ancient Church, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was predestinated and called vnto <hi>faith, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi> This man runneth with the <hi>Arminians</hi> into the depth of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his poysoned Doctrine. And was it not likely that hee should run this way, who being a priuate man without authority, taketh vpon him to impose Doctrines to our Church, to change those that are receiued, and in place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to reuiue the <hi>Pelagian</hi> errours, to beare men in hand that these are the Doctrines of our Church; to scorne men that haue beene reuerenced for their Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:24811:18"/>
and will bee reuerenced in the ages following; such as Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Arch-bishop <hi>Hutton,</hi> Doctor <hi>Rainolds,</hi> Doctor <hi>Whittakers,</hi> and the other Bishops and Learned men, that joyned with them, whom this man accounteth sometimes <hi>Caluinists</hi> and <hi>Puritanes,</hi> sometimes that <hi>They were reputed learned,</hi> as if himselfe had that in Truth, which they did but seeme to haue: Who being a <hi>Priest</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> accuseth <hi>Bishops,</hi> his superiours, to be <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi>; as all must be to him, who yeeld not to his foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and erroneous Doctrines: who in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne stile calleth it an <hi>Exasperating stile</hi>: Who in this exasperating humour careth not, and professeth that hee careth not, what any thinke that please not this his humour: Who with such height of disdayne sleighteth the diligence and industry of his brethren gathered at the <hi>Synode</hi> at <hi>Dort.</hi> Yet they who were imployed in that seruice, were authorized by his Majesties Commission, directed by his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and when they returned rendring to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty an account of their imployment, were most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously approoued of by his Maiesty, onely they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get the approbation of this Gentleman. It were good for him to consider these exasperating humors; they proceede from Pride: Here is neyther <hi>Humility</hi> nor <hi>Charity</hi> to be found, and therefore not the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God. And what good can he do in Gods Church, that commeth in Pride, and a spirit exasperating without charity and humility? Sir, I write not this in choller, nor in malice to your person: but I haue told you plainely the censures of those men, with whom I haue spoken in this matter; both of the higher sort in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:24811:19"/>
the Church, who are your <hi>Fathers</hi>; &amp; of inferior ranke, who are your <hi>Brethren.</hi> I omit the censure of the <hi>Layty.</hi> I speake of them that are able to iudge of your spirit. And because they haue obserued these things in you, I thought the best seruice I could do you, was plainly to let you know these things that you may amend them.</p>
            <p>It were good and necessary for you to vnderstand how you haue bin fetched ouer by those cosening com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who haue plunged you in with themselues in the depthes of <hi>Pelagius.</hi> Their end in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uising that <hi>respectiue decree</hi> is, that Predestination should not be ruled by <hi>Gods will,</hi> and eternall purpose, but by <hi>mans free will.</hi> And this is the end which you must imbrace, vnlesse God turne your heart, and warne you to auoide these dangerous and pernitious doctrines, wherein you draw the yoake with <hi>Pelagius.</hi> God make you to see your errour, and to make some satisfaction to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> whom you haue so much wronged.</p>
            <p>We say in this, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sayd in the like. <hi>Promisit Deus, quae ipse facturus erat, non quod homines facturi erant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De praedest. sanct. cap.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>quum</hi> Abrahae <hi>promiserat in semine eius fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem gentium: quia etsi faciunt homines bona, ipse ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men facit vt faciant, quae praecepit. Alioquin vt Dei promissa compleantur, non in Deised in hominum est potestate.</hi> That which Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith here of the <hi>promise</hi> of God, is in like manner true in the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> of Gods Predestination. For God doth prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate that which he himselfe will do, not that which men would doe. For albeit men according to Gods purpose are called, doe beleeue, are iustified, walke in obedience &amp; repentance, and other good workes, yet
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:24811:19"/>
it is God that worketh that which he predestinateth, and worketh according to his owne exceeding great power faith in men, charity, and hope, and maketh them walke in obedience: otherwise, that Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation should haue his effect, it should not be in Gods power, but in mans power. Now if it be Gods <hi>calling</hi> that <hi>gaue</hi> to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> faith, obedience and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, how then doth this man say that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>called</hi> in consideration and <hi>respect</hi> of his faith, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and repentance? This is true that <hi>God giueth these graces</hi>: Now he sayth, that Saint <hi>Peter was called in respect of these graces:</hi> what can followe but this, that God <hi>giueth</hi> these graces to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> in <hi>respect</hi> of these graces. Which were to run giddy in a circle.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome happily may obiect, that this is not so plaine <hi>Pelagianisme</hi>: For <hi>Pelagius</hi> taught that there was somewhat in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> that did cause God to confer grace, but this man seemeth to say, that God giueth grace not in respect of <hi>nature,</hi> but in respect of <hi>grace</hi>: For faith, obedience and repentance are <hi>graces</hi>: and if in these respects God giue grace, then it is grace that draweth grace, and not nature.</p>
            <p>This obiection, as it may proceede from the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>; is of no validity: For <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that <hi>Pelagius</hi> himselfe did confesse grace in <hi>words,</hi> but in <hi>truth</hi> denied it. I will not thinke that this man
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:24811:20"/>
doth so collude in this word <hi>Grace</hi>: But because hee followeth the same course which the <hi>Pelagians</hi> held, whether wittingly, or as I rather thinke, vnwittingly: We may not suffer the grace of God, whether wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, or vnwittingly to be defaced. The <hi>Pelagians</hi> when they speake of faith, and charity, and such like graces, giue but smooth words to colour their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and to deceiue the simple: Some of them doe more plainely open themselues. <hi>Iohn Scotus</hi> who was the greatest <hi>Pelagian</hi> that liued in his time (for it was he that brought in the doctrine of <hi>Meritum ex congruo,</hi> which some of the most learned Papists, amongst who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may account <hi>Franciscus Victoria,</hi> do confesse to be the true doctrine of <hi>Pelagius.

Now seeing these be their positions, it is not much materiall what words they giue; when speaking of grace, they intend to giue all to nature in the end. The <hi>subtle Doctor</hi> saw that they who bring in the <hi>respectiue decree,</hi> affirming that God in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:24811:20"/>
of grace respecteth somewhat in man, must needs yeeld that the thing <hi>respected</hi> in man, must be <hi>nature,</hi> nothing but nature. And therefore <hi>Scotus,</hi> beeing a Famous <hi>Pelagian,</hi> granteth that roundly, because hee perceiued that the respectiue decree cannot stand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this ground.</p>
            <p>But others are or seeme to bee offended at such grosse proceedings, and therefore they would tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per this morter, and daube it vp thus: That it is not <hi>Nature</hi> but <hi>Grace</hi> that God <hi>respecteth.</hi> Thus they would in words mollifie the horrour of the other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and yet they retayne the same absurdities. The Author of the <hi>Appeale</hi> is running on with these; but God knoweth which way hee is going, for hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe knoweth not. Hee sayth, <hi>God called Saint</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>in respect of his Faith, Obedience, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> and then hee thinketh, that hee hath well sayd, in laying this respect not vppon nature, but vppon grace, as hee thinketh: But hee doth not vnderstand the absurdity that this draweth after it. For if God called Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>respect</hi> of his Faith, Obedience, and Repentance; then were Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, Obedience and Repentance some <hi>cause</hi> why hee was <hi>called</hi>; and therefore <hi>before</hi> his calling. But in true Diuinity Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, Obedience and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, are the effects of his calling, not the cause; and come after the calling, but goe not before it. It may well bee sayd that God <hi>iustified</hi> him in respect of his <hi>calling,</hi> and God <hi>called</hi> him in respect of <hi>Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and God <hi>predestinated</hi> him, <hi>Secundum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum,</hi> in respect of his <hi>purpose</hi>: For so Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> reasoneth, that for the grace of <hi>Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:24811:21"/>
wee haue the grace of Gods <hi>calling,</hi> that is grace for grace: And for the grace of his <hi>Calling,</hi> wee haue the grace of <hi>Iustification,</hi> that is, grace for grace. But the Ancients that reasoned thus, alwayes obserued that the <hi>Consequent</hi> grace might be giuen for and in respect of the <hi>Precedent</hi> grace: but that the <hi>Precedent</hi> grace might bee giuen for or in respect of a <hi>Subsequent</hi> grace, there was neuer Orthodoxe Writer that taught so: Yet the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them the <hi>Arminians,</hi> seeming willing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde the danger of that Rocke, at which so many haue made Shipwracke, that grace is giuen for some respects in nature, to auoyde this absurdity, they labour to mollifie the matter, but runne still vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the same danger: They change the manner of speaking, and say that a Precedent grace is giuen in respect of subsequent grace, as this man sayth, When hee holdeth, that the grace of calling is giuen in respect of Faith and Obedience, which are subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent graces.</p>
            <p>But this is nothing else, but for the loue to holde with <hi>Pelagius,</hi> to say something; Wherein they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake Vnderstanding, Reason, Diuinity, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and speake <hi>Non sence.</hi> For that I call Non-sence, that is against Diuinity, Philosophy and Common reason, as this is, which maketh a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent grace to bee the cause of a Precedent grace; to set the effect before the cause. And because in this manner of speech, there is nothing to satisfie the vnderstanding of a Diuine or a Philosopher, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, that this was deuised for none other end, but onely to dazle the ignorant with Wordes without
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:24811:21"/>
Vnderstanding: But a matter of this nature will not bee carryed with empty Wordes.</p>
            <p>And in so high a poynt of Diuinity, to speake without expresse Scriptures, is a signe that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume too much, eyther vppon their owne <hi>wit,</hi> or vppon other mens <hi>weaknesse.</hi> Their end is, that if thus much might be obtayned, that God giueth the precedent grace for or in respect of the consequent, they might with more ease afterward fall into the playne tearmes of <hi>Pelagius.</hi> For howsoeuer they may palliate the matter with strange VVordes not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, yet the Truth is, as <hi>Scotus</hi> confesseth, that if Gods grace bee giuen in respect of any thing in man, that can bee nothing but nature. For in man, before he be called, there is nothing but nature.</p>
            <p>And therefore the playne Doctrine of <hi>Scotus,</hi> that a man may merite grace <hi>Ex puris naturalibus,</hi> standeth more probable in reason, then this opinion which deuiseth a subsequent grace to be the cause of a precedent grace: For as this is against Diuinity, so the reason of the Naturall man refuseth it.</p>
            <p>The graces of God are ordered, and they that would disorder them, trouble the whole frame of our saluation. For God hath set the order: From Gods purpose proceedeth Predestination, from Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Calling, from Calling Faith and Iustification, from Iustification Obedience and all fruitefull workes. The first grace that wee apprehend is Calling: And therefore before we are called, there is nothing in vs but nature. If then God respect any thing in man, in respect whereof hee calleth him, that can be nothing but nature and free will.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:24811:22"/>This the <hi>Pelagians</hi> taught plainely; but some fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the <hi>Pelagians</hi> are ashamed to vtter themselues so plainely: They striue to handle the matter more finely, but whilest they seeke finenesse, they haue lost their wits. Surely they haue forsaken reason and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. Now it is not possible that from <hi>nature</hi> and freewill any <hi>grace</hi> should rise: because the <hi>Lord</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.6.</note> 
               <hi>That which is borne of the flesh is flesh, and that which is borne of the spirit is spirit.</hi> Here be two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples set, one in <hi>Nature,</hi> the other in <hi>Grace</hi>: The principle of grace and all good motions is the <hi>Spirit</hi>: the highest principle of nature and naturall motions is the <hi>Flesh</hi>: Therefore no grace of the spirit can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from the flesh; but nature and free-will is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but flesh.</p>
            <p>Againe, the order, wherin the Blessed <hi>Apostle</hi> setteth downe these things, the purpose of God, predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, calling, iustification, glorification, doth prooue that a precedent grace may be some cause to draw after it a subsequent grace; but for a subsequent grace to be any manner of cause to draw a precedent, this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. The blessed <hi>Apostle</hi> sayth: <hi>All things fall out for the best to them that loue God, to them that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to his purpose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I come to that which I intend, I would heere first remooue a scruple, which the <hi>Pelagians</hi> stumble at, in those words of the Apostle: <hi>To them that loue God</hi>: From these words they inferre, that God <hi>respecteth</hi> them that <hi>loue</hi> him; But the Apostle expoundeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the words following: <hi>To them that are called according to his purpose:</hi> For these are they who <hi>loue</hi> God; who vnderstand that Gods loue preuented them
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:24811:22"/>
and called them according to his purpose. He that hath the knowledge of this loue of God, must needes loue God againe: but this loue beginneth by Gods preuenting loue, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> sayth: <hi>Herein is loue, not that we loued God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4.10.</note> 
               <hi>but that he loued vs, and sent his son to be a reconciliation for our sinnes.</hi> There be some that begin to loue, but fall away and continue not to the end. Of these St. <hi>Bede,</hi> in his Expositions collected out of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bed.</hi> in Rom. 8.</note> expoundeth this place thus. <hi>Apostolus cum dixisset: scimus quoniam diligentibus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um omnia cooperantur in bonum, sciens non nullos dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere Deum, &amp; in eo bono vs<expan>

The <hi>Apostle</hi> sayth, <hi>All things fall out to the best, to them that are called according to Gods purpose</hi>: Then Gods calling is according to his purpose. If any man should say, that Gods purpose were according to his calling; should hee not inuert the Wordes of the Apostle, and falsifie his Doctrine? Then his <hi>calling</hi> is according to his <hi>purpose</hi>; but his <hi>purpose</hi> may not bee sayd to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>calling</hi>: because the calling dependeth vppon his purpose, but not the purpose vppon the calling. The purpose is a cause of the calling, but not the calling a cause of the purpose. Now if wee proceede from Vocation to Iustification, wee shall vnderstand the same. For as Vocation dependeth vppon Gods purpose of <hi>Predestination,</hi> so doth our Iustification depend vpon Vocation; and as this was to peruert the Apostles words, and to falsifie his doctrine,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:24811:23"/>
as before I sayd, to say that Gods purpose was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his calling: So if a man should say, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor sayth, that Gods calling is according to faith, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and repentance; this man should in like sort peruert the Apostle his words, and falsifie his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. For iustification, faith, obedience and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, depend vpon Gods calling, but his calling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not vpon them: <hi>they are giuen according</hi> to his <hi>calling</hi>; but his <hi>calling</hi> is not <hi>according</hi> to <hi>them</hi>: And therefore they are giuen for and in considetation of his calling; but that Gods calling should be for and in consideration, or regard of these things, which Gods calling draweth with it, and after it; is a thing absurde not onely in the iudgements of Orthodoxe Writers, but euen in the iudgement of <hi>Pelagius</hi> himselfe, and of <hi>Scotus,</hi> and of the most learned of that side; who thought it more probable and agreeing more with reason to say that the grace of God is giuen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to merits, then to deuise this strange fancy, that a subsequent grace should be the cause of a precedent grace. This I say is not a priuate fancy of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler men, but such a thing as was neuer vttered by any sober or learned writer. And because <hi>heresie</hi> goeth not without <hi>absurdities,</hi> it may be called either the <hi>Arminian heresie,</hi> or the <hi>Arminian absurdity.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Arminians,</hi> no man writeth thus.</p>
            <p>I may not omit to obserue in the last place, that our Authors words crosse the words of the 17. <hi>Article</hi>; which hee professeth to maintaine. For the article speaking of Predestination sayth. <hi>They which be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with such an excellent benefit of God, be called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods purpose, by his spirit working in due
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:24811:23"/>
season, they thorough grace obey their calling, they are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified freely, they be made the sonnes of God by adoption, they be made like the image of his onely begotten sonne Iesus Christ, they walke religiously in good workes, and at length by Gods mercy they attaine to euerlasting feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These words of the Article containe the true Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall doctrine: For the calling of God is here sayd to be according to Gods purpose; and iustification, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, walking religiously in good workes, these things are declared in the <hi>Article</hi> to follow the calling as effects thereof.</p>
            <p>But <hi>this man,</hi> the <hi>new maintainer</hi> of the articles and of the doctrines of our Church, peruerteth this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall doctrine contained in the article. For he sayth, that <hi>the calling is according to faith, obedience and repentance</hi>: contrary to that which is contained in the article. The article maketh faith, obedience, and repentance, to be the effects of calling, and to followe it, and proueth consequently that the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is not according to these effects, or in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and regard of these effects, but that these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are according to the calling, and in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and regard of the calling: By this mans do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>the calling dependeth vpon faith, obedience and repentance</hi>: by the doctrine contayned in the article, these things depend vpon the calling.</p>
            <p>Thus hath he cleane peruerted and crossed the doctrine contained in the article, and yet this man is thought fit to expound the <hi>Articles,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of our Church. Thus much

            <head>CHAP. 5. Of perseuerance in Grace, and falling away from Grace.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He question as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it, is of <hi>perseuerance</hi> of the Saints in grace: As <hi>this man</hi> and the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> propose it, of <hi>falling away</hi> from grace, or of the Apostasie of the Saints. The question is the same though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly proposed: so that if we proue the <hi>perseuerance</hi> of Saints to the ende, then is that doctrine ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, that bringeth in the <hi>Apostasie</hi> of Saints.</p>
            <p>If this question be moued thus: <hi>Whether a man may fall away from grace</hi>: The proposition, by reason of the ambiguous acception and vse of this word grace, may be both true and false. For this is true; <hi>a man may fall from grace both totally and finally.</hi> And this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise true, <hi>a man cannot fall from grace neither totally nor finally.</hi> They who haue a purpose to deceiue take the generality of termes; and <hi>in vniuersalibus latet do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lits.</hi> Therefore before any true proofe can be made in any disputation, the word that is ambiguous must be declared distinctly. In the Scriptures, and in those Writers that ground themselues vpon the Scriptures, there is obserued a double acceptation and vse of this word grace. I am not ignorant that many distinctions
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:24811:24"/>
are vsed of this word, and that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himselfe, and his reader with the multitude of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions of this word; but distinctions were inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>cleare</hi> the poynt in question, and not to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found</hi> things. I rest therefore for our present purpose vpon one distinction, which is playne and grounded in the Scriptures, and this it is. <hi>Grace</hi> is taken diuersly according to diuers Fountaynes from which it flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: For albeit all grace proceedeth from God, yet it proceedeth diuers wayes from him; one way is, by the way of his <hi>eternall purpose</hi>: Thus proceedeth the grace of <hi>Predestination,</hi> and the grace of Gods cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling according to his purpose, and the grace of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication according to his calling, and consequently, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his purpose. This grace is primary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and vnchangeable: This is a free gift proceeding from the purpose of God, and is wrought in vs by Gods calling.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.29.</note> Of this the Apostle speaketh. <hi>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</hi> This is one way by which grace proceedeth from God: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way it proceedeth from God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to vs by the way of <hi>Preaching.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matthew 13.</note> This way diuers graces come in diuers measures, as hte Lord hath taught in the Parable of the Sower. The <hi>Sower</hi> sowed the same <hi>Seed</hi>; but some fell by the <hi>Way side,</hi> and the Fowles came and deuoured it vp; by this are they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, who heare the word of the Kingdome and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it not: Then commeth the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sowen in their heartes. Other seede fell vpon <hi>stony ground,</hi> where it had not much earth; and forthwith it sprang vp, because it had not deepness of earth, and when the Sunne was vp it was scorched, and because it had not roote, it
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:24811:25"/>
withered away. By this are they signified, who heare the word and anone with joy receiue it: Yet hee hath no roote in himselfe, but dureth but for a time; for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by hee is offended. Thirdly, some fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst <hi>Thornes,</hi> and the Thornes sprang vp and choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it. By this he is noted, that heareth the word, and the care of this world and the deceitfulnesse of riches choake the Word, and hee becommeth vnfruitfull. Last is hee that receiued seed into <hi>good ground,</hi> he that heareth the Word and Vnderstandeth it, which also beareth fruite, and bringeth forth some an hundreth, some sixty, some thirty.</p>
            <p>I haue stayed the longer vpon the full recitall of this Parable, because it proueth fully that which I intend to draw out of it. First, it is euident hereby, that by the Preaching of the Word diuerse graces are giuen. And the very Preaching of the Word freely to some Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is a great grace. In this respect it is called <hi>Verbum gratiae, Acts</hi> 20.23. This grace, though so great, yet may be lost: For many Nations haue had it, that haue lost it: Let them that haue it make much of it whilest they haue it: For who knoweth how soone it may bee taken away? And this is one way to loose it, to suffer the Doctrines of our Church to bee corrupted. It is the Spirit of God that setteth vp Preaching, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth Preachers to one place, and not to another: As we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.6, 7, 9. This then is one great grace to haue the Word of <hi>God</hi> Preached to a people; but when it is Preached some vnderstand it not: others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue a greater measure of grace, when they receiue the word with joy. Yet this dureth not in some, but is lost both totally and finally: Others are choaked with the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:24811:25"/>
deceitfulnesse of the World, and these fall away also: Others are fruitefull and bring foorth plentifully. All receiue the seede in some measure; and thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue grace in some measure: but three sorts loose it altogether, the fourth onely receiueth it fruitfully. Then all these that receiue some grace and loose it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, are sayd, and truly sayd, to fall away from grace. These graces that are thus lost are true graces: And men may proceede farre in the practise of these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, some farther then other, and yet may loose them. Then they that speake in generall words, that a man may fall away from grace, speake at randome. The question is <hi>Whether they that are according to Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Predestinated, called and iustified, may loose these graces of their Predestination, Calling, and Iustification.</hi> This the <hi>Orthodoxe Church</hi> hath alwayes <hi>denied.</hi> The <hi>Arminians</hi> who admit no other <hi>Predestination</hi> but conditionall, <hi>affirme it</hi>; and none but <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi> The <hi>Arminians</hi> hold that men may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten predestinated, often elected; and in the end may loose all. They labour to prooue that all grace may be vtterly lost, that the power of free will may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, which then may shewe her power more fully, when there is no grace.</p>

            <head>CHAP. 6. That perseuerance to the end is a gift of God giuen to true beleeuers, flowing from Gods purpose and predestination.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst I will produce reasons to <hi>proue,</hi> that perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance in grace to the end is a gift of God giuen to true beleeuers; and then <hi>answere</hi> his Objections. To <hi>prooue</hi> this, the Scripture is euident to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:24811:26"/>
such as reade it with a single heart and vnblemished eies. First of all, those words of the Apostle proue it. <hi>Wee know that all things worke together for the best to them that loue God, euen to them that are called accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his purpose. For those whom hee knew before, hee Predestinated to be made like to the Image of his Sonne, that hee might bee the first borne amongst many brethren. Moreouer whom hee Predestinated, them also hee called, and whom he called, them also he iustified, and whom he iustified, them also he glorified.</hi> The <hi>purpose</hi> of God is the <hi>Spring</hi> and Fountaine from which all these graces are deriued: The <hi>end</hi> is glorification: From the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end are <hi>Predestination, Calling</hi> and <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> The chayne is so linked together, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be separated. He that God <hi>purposed</hi> to Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, must needes be <hi>Predestinated</hi>; hee that is <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated</hi> must needes be <hi>called</hi>; he that is so <hi>called</hi> must be <hi>iustified</hi>; hee that is so <hi>iustified</hi> must be <hi>glorified</hi>: But no man can come to glory without the grace of perseuerance to the end: Therefore where God giueth <hi>these graces,</hi> such a <hi>calling,</hi> such a <hi>iustification,</hi> hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth with all <hi>perseuerance,</hi> without which no man can come to this end.</p>
            <p>The same is prooued from the words of St. <hi>Iohn. Whosoeuer is borne of God sinneth not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Iohn 3.9.</note> 
               <hi>for his seede abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in him, and hee cannot sinne because he is borne of God.</hi> When St. <hi>Iohn</hi> sayth, that a man, once regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by the Spirit of God, sinneth not, and cannot sinne: We may not vnderstand this of <hi>sinnes</hi> of <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie</hi>: For of such St. <hi>Iohn</hi> himselfe sayth: <hi>If wee say we haue no sinnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Iohn 1.8.</note> 
               <hi>we deceiue our selues, and the Truth is not in vs, if we confesse our sinnes he is faithfull and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:24811:26"/>
iust to forgiue vs our sinnes.</hi> How then doe these two agree together? First, we are all sinners and wee must confesse our sinnes: Secondly, a regenerate man sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, yea cannot sinne. These contentions of the <hi>Arminian</hi> faction, hath taught vs to reconcile these places. For a man that is borne of God may sinne; that is, fall into the <hi>sinnes</hi> of <hi>infirmity</hi>; but yet he can not sinne, that is, he cannot fall backe into the <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice</hi> and <hi>dominion</hi> of sinne <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>finally.</hi> The thing which I especially obserue out of these wordes is, that there is somewhat which is heere called the <hi>Seede of God abiding</hi> in him that is once borne of God: And this declareth a regeneration which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the purpose of God, and from that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull calling which is according to his purpose. What this seede is, let any man declare: This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, all is not gone, all is not cut off by intercision; here is a <hi>Seede of God abiding</hi>: Call it what you will, all is one to our purpose: For whether this Seede of God be <hi>Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Word of God,</hi> or the <hi>Grace of Gods calling</hi> according to his purpose, or the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or any of these, or all these: It prooueth our purpose, that all is not gone, all is not falne away: If all be not falne away, then this man in whom it abideth can not fall totally. If Faith bee the Seed, the Word of God soweth it, the calling of God rayseth it, and makes it fruitfull,<note place="margin">1 Peter 2.3.</note> the Spirit of God quickneth it: To this purpose St. <hi>Peter</hi> sayth: <hi>Being borne againe, not of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Seede, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God which liueth and abideth for euer</hi>: The VVord of God is sayd to <hi>liue</hi> and abide for <hi>euer,</hi> because of the <hi>effect</hi> which it worketh, as some learned Interpreters haue
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:24811:27"/>
obserued: For here he speaketh of the new birth, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did, of the incorruptible seede (as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> called it) the seede of God abiding, of the word of God whereby the grace of regeneration is giuen, which liueth and abideth for euer. This agreeth with that which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> sayd of the same new birth.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Peter</hi> confirmeth this further in those wordes: <hi>Blessed be God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Peter 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>which according to his aboundant mercy hath begotten vs againe to a liuely hope, by the resurrection of Iesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance immortall, and vndefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserued in Heauen for you, which are kept by the power of God through faith vnto saluation.</hi> It is hard to deuise more expresse words to deliuer this Doctrine of perseuerance, then Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> vseth here: For he speaketh of them that are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate according to the purpose of God, when hee sayth, <hi>According to his aboundant mercy he hath begotten vs againe</hi>; he sayth, to a <hi>liuely hope,</hi> and <hi>inheritance</hi>; the inheritance is sayd to be <hi>reserued for vs in Heauen,</hi> and we are <hi>kept by the Power</hi> of God <hi>through faith</hi> vnto it. If we be kept for it by Gods power through faith, and it be kept for vs; then he that denieth perseuerance vnto the end, must breake this power of God by which we are preserued to the end: For what is this power of God that keepeth vs through faith to the end, but the grace of perseuerance to the end?</p>
            <p>The same Doctrine of perseuerance, or of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation by Gods power to the end, is confirmed vnto vs from the nature of <hi>Faith</hi> and of <hi>Charity.</hi> Of <hi>Faith</hi> the Lord saith:<note place="margin">Iohn 5.24.</note> 
               <hi>He that heareth my Word and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth on him that sent me, hath euerlasting life, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:24811:27"/>
shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death to life.</hi> The Lord speaketh of <hi>Faith,</hi> but this faith is not an <hi>Historicall</hi> faith, nor a <hi>Temporary</hi> faith; for these doe fade and haue not this promise which this faith hath of which the Lord speaketh: Then what faith can this bee, but such a <hi>iustifying</hi> faith that proceedeth from the <hi>Calling</hi> of God according to his purpose? The <hi>Lord</hi> sayth, that <hi>Hee who thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth hath euerlasting Life</hi>: If hee hath euerlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life, then what <hi>Arminian</hi> or <hi>Pelagian</hi> can take this from him, that Christ sayth hee hath? Some may answere, that when it is sayd, hee hath it, it may bee vnderstood, hee shall haue it. I stand not much vppon that, for whether the Lord, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth euerlasting life, say hee hath it, or hee shall haue, it is not much differing: But yet I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the Lords speech, who knew best how to speake. When hee sayth <hi>He hath it,</hi> his meaning is, that euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life shall be as firmely and truely giuen to him, as if hee had it already in possession, which yet hee holdeth but in hope.</p>
            <p>Now which of all the <hi>Pelagians</hi> dare say, that perhaps hee may haue it, and perhaps hee may loose it, or that hee may fall totally or finally from it, when the Lord sayth hee hath it? Hee could haue sayd, hee shall haue it, but why doth hee say <hi>He hath it,</hi> but onely to teach vs that true beleeuers haue such a grace heere, which can not be lost? The Lord sayth also of the man that hath this grace, that <hi>He shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death to Life.</hi> What is that, <hi>is passed?</hi> but to make this Doctrine sure, that there is such a grace giuen heere
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:24811:28"/>
which cannot be lost. Let the <hi>Pelagians</hi> wrangle as they will about losse of grace: this may be sufficient for vs to rest in the plaine and euident words of our Lord and Maister <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> Thus we see that a true and liuely faith carrieth with it vndoubtedly the grace of perseuerance vnto the end.</p>
            <p>The same may be confirmed from <hi>Charity.</hi> I meane such charity whereby such a faith worketh, as was last described. Of <hi>charity</hi> the Apostle hath these words. <hi>Charity neuer faileth; though prophecie fayle, and tongues shall cease, and knowledge shall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any man shall here say, that this is spoken in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of other graces that in this life we haue vse of, and go no farther. I answere, I admit that to be so: but here the <hi>Apostle</hi> sayth, <hi>Charity neuer fayleth.</hi> It is true, he numbreth vp some graces that do fayle. I graunt that in the life to come we shall not haue vse of these graces that fayle. The Apostle obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a difference here betweene graces and graces: some for the vse of this life onely, others for this life and for that to come. Of these that are both for this life, and for that to come, he nameth charitie which fayleth neuer. If charity neuer faile, no not in the life to come; then it must follow that it neuer faileth in this life: because if it should faile in this life, then it must needes faile in the life to come. For no man shall haue the glorious comfort of charitie in that life, who looseth altogether the gracious comfort of it in this life. <hi>Charitie neuer faileth</hi>; therefore it abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for euer: therefore there are graces wherein true beleeuers perseuere to the end. Heereupon some
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:24811:28"/>
Schoolemen say that <hi>perseuerance</hi> is a grace, not really differing from <hi>charity</hi>: It is true that charity waxeth cold, and the charity of many may faile, and the faith of many may faile: but the <hi>purpose</hi> of God cannot faile: and those <hi>graces</hi> that <hi>proceede</hi> from Gods <hi>purpose</hi> neuer faile them to whom they are so giuen.</p>
            <p>But because these controuersies were not knowne in the Church, before the time of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and by him more diligently handled then by any other. For the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers that liued before him, could not speake to these things which are brought in by <hi>Pelagius</hi> after they were dead, and therefore could not come to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and indeede spake somewhat securely as fearing no harme and not knowing that their words should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death bee peruerted by the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> which made S. <hi>Augustine</hi> say, <hi>Vobis Pelagianis nondum natis se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius loquebantur Patres</hi> Because, I say, before him none could, and after none did so exactly handle these things, as if he had beene raised vp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reserued by God to do this seruice to the Church, (as no doubt hee was.) I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose heere to ser downe S. <hi>Augustines</hi> doctrines in this particular, not by way of citing some sentences, but by a continued tract. I may sometimes vpon occasions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingle some things, but that shall be in a <hi>parenthesis.</hi> The whole body of this that followeth is S. <hi>Augustines.</hi> Which I do the more willingly, because I am well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that the learned <hi>Bishops</hi> who were in the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church, in the beginning of Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> raigne, did so much honour S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that in the collecting of the <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Homilyes,</hi> and other things in that reformation, they had an especiall respect vnto S. <hi>Augustines</hi> doctrines.</p>

If therefore this which he prayeth for be granted, that hee bee not lead into temptation, then surely by Gods grace hee persisteth in that sanctification which by Gods grace hee receiued. Thus farre Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> out of Saint <hi>Cyprian.</hi> And now Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his owne course. But in perseuerance it is not as in other graces.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:24811:31"/>
but hee that perseuereth to the end: Therefore this is such a grace which many may haue, but he that hath it, can neuer loose it. This grace may be obtained, but when it is once obtained, it cannot be lost through contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>Let any man,</hi>

               <p>After the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> God would haue it to pertaine onely to his <hi>grace,</hi> that man should <hi>come</hi> to him, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to pertaine to the <hi>same grace,</hi> that man should not <hi>depart</hi> from him: This grace hee hath put in him, in whom wee haue our inheritance beeing praedestinated according to his purpose that worketh all things. And therefore as he worketh that wee come to him, so hee worketh that we depart not from him: wherefore it is said in the Psalmes.<note place="margin">Psal. 80.17</note> 
                  <hi>Let thine hand be vpon the man of thy right hand, and vpon the sonne of man, whom thou hast made so strong for thine owne selfe, that wee depart not from thee.</hi> Who is this man? <hi>Iste non est primus Adam in quo discessimus ab eo, sed Adam nouissimus, super quem fit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus eius, vt non discedamus ab eo,</hi> saith <hi>Augustine.</hi> For <hi>Christus totus,</hi> all Christ with his members is for the Church, which is his body and his fulnesse.

This, I say, is the hand of him that said, <hi>I will giue my feare in their hearts, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not from me.</hi> But we see that some depart; why doth one depart and not another? why is perseuerance to the end giuen to some, and not to others? To this what can we say, but that the <hi>wayes of the Lord are past finding out.</hi> Why is one receiued to mercy and not another, can any man giue a reason but onely Gods will? <hi>Hee hath mercy on whom he will haue mercy, and whom hee will he hardeneth.</hi> So hee giueth the grace of perseuerance to whom hee will, and denieth it from whom hee will. Yet in this the faithfull must rest, that hee that hath the guift of perseuerance, is in the number of the praedesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, the other is not.<note place="margin">1.

All this is true, but yet according to another separation they were not of vs. What is that separation? Gods booke is open, we must not turne our eyes from it: the Scripture cryeth loud, let vs heare it: before the beginning of the world they had not their part in him; they were not praedestinated according to his purpose, which worketh all things.

But they who perseuere not, but fall away from the Christian faith, and from a godly conuersation, surely these men are not to bee accounted in this number, no not then, when they liued well: they are not separated from that masse of perdition by Gods praedestination, not called according to his purpose; but called amongst them of whom it is said, <hi>multi vocati,</hi> but not of them of whom it is said, <hi>pauci electi.</hi> And who will deny that these are elect, when they beleeue, and are baptized, and liue godly? They may be said to be elect, <hi>sed à ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientibus,</hi> by such as know not what they shall be; not by him who knoweth that these had not perseuerance.

               <p>Touching those Saints that are praedestinated to the kingdome of God, such an helping grace is giuen to them, that perseuerance is bestowed vpon them, not onely that without it they cannot,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.16</note> but that with it they cannot but perseuere.

For seeing that Christ ordained them to go and bring forth fruite, &amp; that their fruit should remaine, <hi>quis audet dicere,</hi> who dare say that peraduenture it might not remaine?

Now albeit the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith of all rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men liuing orderly:<note place="margin">Rom. 14.4.</note>

For he saith, <hi>He shall be established, for God is able to make him stand:</hi> then assuredly be giueth perseuerance, that is able to establish them that stand, that they may stand most perseueringly, or to restore them that fall. For it is the <hi>Lord that raiseth vp the bruised, Psal.</hi> 146. And therefore, <hi>hee that reioyceth, let him reioyce in the Lord.</hi> Hence it is that in this place of misery, where <hi>the life of man is a temptation vpon earth,</hi> vertue is perfected in infirmity. What vertue? but that he that glorieth may glory in the Lord. And for this cause the Lord would not haue his Saints to glory in their strength, no not in their perseuerance in good: but to glory in him, which doth not onely giue them such an helpe as hee gaue to the first man, without which they could not perseuere if they would; but in them also hee worketh this that they shall will. Therefore is both the <hi>possibility,</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of <hi>perseuering</hi> giuen to them from the bounty of diuine grace.

            <p>From the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> wee are to looke for no soundnesse in this point. For it is a hard thing for them to speake of grace who haue it not: Many of them speake of grace like meere naturall men. They wanted neither wit nor learning, but many of them wanted grace to speake of grace, as the <hi>Iesuites</hi> for the most part doe at this day. Therefore I passe them ouer, and come to the time of <hi>Reformation.</hi> In which time, if I should produce the sentences of them that haue beene most learned and labourious in the reformed Churches, it would bee a long worke, and happily giue no great satisfaction to the Author of the Appeale, and others whom I desire to satisfie. For how can hee receiue satisfaction from the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of late men, that seemeth to scorne their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie names? As for <hi>Caluin,</hi> his name and doctrines are made odious, but why, I know not. If hee hath written somethings amisse, as who writing so much, hath not slipped in many things? yet a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable construction would helpe in many things: And admit hee hath some things which cannot bee excused; yet, if wee consider the ancient Fathers, how often they haue slipped and erred, wee might
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:24811:35"/>
be more moderate in censuring of others. In the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we take that which they haue done well, and the rest wee pardon for that which they haue done well. And why may we not doe so with others? And what greater pleasure can a man procure to the enemies of the truth, then to speake euill and odiously of those men, whose seruice God hath vsed, and made them excellent instruments to make the truth knowne vnto vs? Some take it for a signe of such as are looking towards Popery, when they offer such a seruice to the Papists, as to speake euill of them, that haue beene the greatest enemies to Popery, the greatest propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators of the truth: but I censure none. Then lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing other Churches, wee come home to our owne Church.</p>
            <p>We haue enough in the articles of Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to confirme the same truth, which hitherto wee have proued. The <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Appeale</hi> hath gone wrong in two poynts: <hi>First,</hi> in the <hi>respectiue decree</hi>; which either he hath deuised, or taken from the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> Against this, wee haue heretofore shewed that the 17. <hi>Article</hi> hath set forth the doctrine of Praedesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in a sound and wholesome manner: that Gods calling followeth the purpose of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon it: that faith, obedience, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance follow the calling of God, and depend vpon it: but the calling of God doth not follow faith, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and repentance, nor dependeth vpon them. So did the 17. <hi>Article</hi> teach against the new deuise of this man. This I haue obserued before.</p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> thing wherein this man wandreth, is <hi>denying of perseuerance,</hi> and scorning it as a Puritan do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:24811:35"/>
I must heere againe recite the 17. <hi>Article</hi>: And I would intreat any man, that hath his eyes set right in his head, to reade and consider the words, the order and soundnesse of them: and th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n let him iudge whether perseuerance vnto the end bee not soundly and roundly set downe, and auerred in the Article. The words are:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Predestination to life is the euerlasting purpose of God, whereby before the foundation of the world, he hath constantly decreed by his counsell secret to vs, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer from curse and damnation those whome hee hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen in Christ out of man-kinde, to bring them by Christ to euerlasting saluation: wherefore they which bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with such an excellent benefit of God, be called accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods purpose by his spirit working in ane season. They through grace obey the calling, they be iustified freely, they be made the sonnes of God by adoption, they be made like to the image of his onely begotten sonne Iesus Christ, they walke religiously in good workes, and at length by Gods mercy attaine euerlasting felicity.</hi> Thus farre the words of the Article.</p>
            <p>Can any man in any words declare perseuerance more fully or plainly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning by the meanes to the end, then here is done? For what is <hi>perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> but as S. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, a preseruation or <hi>keeping</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> by the <hi>power of God to saluation?</hi> And how can it be better proued, then to draw it from the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> of God, by <hi>predestination,</hi> by Gods <hi>calling,</hi> by <hi>iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi> by the <hi>worke</hi> of Gods <hi>spirit,</hi> by <hi>adoption,</hi> by being <hi>fashioned like to the image</hi> of Christ, by <hi>walking religiously</hi> in good workes, and by this meanes to come to <hi>life euerlasting?</hi> This is done in the <hi>Article</hi>: And
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:24811:36"/>
this is the true doctrine of perseuerance. They who are called according to Gods purpose, and iustified and sanctifi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, made the sonnes of God by adoption, walke religiously in good workes and so at last attaine to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting life, are they who haue receiued the grace of perseuerance to the end: thus doth that Article set forth this doctrine. But our <hi>Authour</hi> saith, <hi>before they come to this end, they sinne</hi>: And what then? Gods calling is powerfull indeed, according to his purpose: But it was not the purpose of God in calling vs, to make vs Angels, or to set vs in such an estate wherein we should neuer sinne any more; but to teach vs humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity he suffereth vs to striue with sinne, and teacheth vs to fight against sinne. And if in this battell wee take a blow, yet hee sustaineth our weaknesse, and will haue vs to glory in nothing that is in our selues, but in our infirmities. And still in his mercy preserueth vs from falling backe from the faith, and keepeth vs from presumptuous sinnes, and from that sinne that is vnto death.</p>
            <p>This perseuerance you will say, is with great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. It is true, wee cannot glory in our perfections, which are none. The <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> who glorie in themselues, in the power of their wills, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not taste this doctrine. But wee glory in God, that through many and manifold imperfections and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of ours bringeth vs by this grace vnto the end. This worke to bring vs through many infirmities to an happy end, is the worke of God, which no power in the world can defeate.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or the better vnderstanding of these men that pleade against the grace of God, We must obserue that one espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ground of their errour is in this, that they conceiue and vnderstand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse of grace. They take it for another thing then the Scriptures haue declared, and the Church of God from the Scriptures haue taken it to be. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they define <hi>grace,</hi> they say it is a <hi>morall perswasion. Arminius</hi> himselfe saith, it is <hi>lenis suasio:</hi> they admit no <hi>power of God</hi> here.</p>
            <p>And are not these a strange kinde of men, that will make vnto themselues their owne grounds, and not take their grounds from the Scriptures? If this ground, which they so blindly begge were true, then were it indeed easie for them to proue many of their conclusions: that alike or generall grace is offered vnto all: that <hi>quantum ad Deum pertinet,</hi> for so much as is in God, one man receiueth as much grace as an other: that the difference is in mans free-will, in accepting or reiecting of grace: that grace may soone bee gotten, and soone lost altogether. But who gaue these men authority to make a definition contrary to that which the holy Scriptures haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:24811:37"/>
These men acknowledge no other power in the Gospell preached, but onely the power of the Minister that preacheth. The Preacher hath not power to giue faith and repentance, to infuse grace, but only vseth morall perswasions to the people: but together with the labour of the Preacher the spirit of God worketh:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.9.</note> And therefore we are called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>helpers with God</hi> in that great worke. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the spirit of God worketh with power in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mens hearts, humbling them, leading them to an acknowledgement and confession of their sinnes, conuerting their soules, drawing them out of the power of darknesse, out of the power of Sathan and sinne; which worke cannot be done by a gentle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion onely, it cannot be done but by the power of God: therefore the Apostle declaring that <hi>grace,</hi> which commeth to belieuers by the preaching of the Gospell,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.16.</note> calleth it <hi>the power of God to saluation.</hi> And againe,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>The preaching of the crosse is to them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish foolishnesse, but vnto vs that are saued, it is the power of God.</hi> And the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaking of faith, which is the first and one of the greatest graces which we receiue,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.3.</note> saith, <hi>your faith standeth not in the wisedome of man, but in the power of God.</hi> If our faith which is the first, and the chiefest grace whereby we stand, be in the power of God, not in the wisedome of man, then it is no morall perswasion: For morall perswasion reacheth no further then mans wisedome. But this is most perspicuously taught in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians</hi>;<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.18.</note> where the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>I cease not to giue thankes vnto God, making mention of you in my

prayers, — that the eyes of your vnderstanding may be enlightned, that you may know what the hope of his calling, and what the riches of his glorious inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is in his Saints;</hi>

               <hi>and what is the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his power towards vs which beleeue, according to the working of his mighty power.</hi> Then when wee are drawne vnto faith, when we beleeue, this is done by the power of God, by the exceeding greatnesse of his power, by the mighty working of his power. And therefore they that say, that grace is onely a <hi>morall perswasion,</hi> and <hi>quantum ad deum,</hi> that <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation</hi> is alike <hi>prepared</hi> for <hi>all</hi>: and that the <hi>reason</hi> why one receiueth grace, another receiueth it not, is onely in mans <hi>free-will</hi>: These men and their vaine and weake fancies are cleane ouerthrowne, because grace is found to bee in the <hi>power of God.</hi> For, if <hi>quantum ad deum,</hi> as they say, it were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alike to all, why then doth the Apostle say, that <hi>preaching is foolishnesse to them that perish, but the power of God to vs that are saued?</hi> If it bee foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnto some, and the power of God to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to others, then verily it is not alike vnto all. God is able to make his powerfull grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto them, to whome it is foolishnesse, but hee will not.</p>
            <p>Heere wee may finde many things to admire, and to wonder at, and to cry out with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>O the depth</hi>! But still wee finde that the power of God is in his calling, and declared in our faith, which standeth not in mans wisedome, but in the power of God. This doth sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:24811:38"/>
prooue, that the grace of God is not as these men affirme, without and against all grounds of Scripture, a <hi>morall perswasion:</hi> For it is the <hi>power of God,</hi> the <hi>exceeding greatnesse,</hi> and the <hi>mightie working of his power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that would vnderstand this controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, betweene the Church of God, and th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull and vngracious men, that oppugne the grace of God, may best vnderstand it, if they seeke out with care and diligence the definition of grace. It is of the greatest importance to know, and being knowne, will leade a man (as by a thread) vnto the particulars of this question. We finde plainely, that the loue of God, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God is in it: And wee may be sure, that they who deny the power of God to be in grace, can neuer come to the true knowledge of it. It is true, that if that definition were once granted, that <hi>grace</hi> is nothing but a <hi>morall perswasion,</hi> then would all those strange conclusions follow of which I spake before, and others more mad then they; that <hi>the purpose of Praedestination is a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine,</hi> and of no power: that <hi>Gods purpose of Praedestination must bee ruled by man,</hi> and not by God.</p>
            <p>It is much to bee wondred at, that such men should bee found in the Church, professing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie, that with such boldnesse take such a defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as granted, and with such ignorance draw those conclusions from it.</p>
            <p>Let vs but stoppe this principle, and we stop their
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:24811:38"/>
mouthes. For if <hi>grace</hi> be the <hi>power of God to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> if <hi>Faith</hi> and grace stand not in <hi>mans wisedome,</hi> but in the <hi>power of God</hi>; if wee bee <hi>drawne</hi> to <hi>beleeue</hi> by the <hi>exceeding greatnesse</hi> of Gods <hi>power,</hi> by the <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty working</hi> of his power; then it followeth, that the grace whereby we are called, whereby wee beleeue, and repent, and are iustified, and in the end saued, is the power of God. It was his good will and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to praedestinate vs, but it is his power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that good purpose, to draw sinnefull men out of the power of darkenesse, into the kingdome of light, to worke in our hearts a loue of obedience by his holy Spirit. To worke this, farre surpassed the power al of creatures, and therefore it is done by the power of God. Vpon this ground thus laide, the course of <hi>Arminians</hi> is stopped. If they tell vs that <hi>grace</hi> is a <hi>gentle perswasion,</hi> and goeth no further; Wee answer, that in grace there is the <hi>power of God.</hi> If they tell vs that <hi>grace</hi> may bee <hi>vtterly lost,</hi> wee say it proceedeth from the <hi>purpose</hi> of God, and is giuen to vs from the <hi>power</hi> of God. His purpose is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, his power who can resist? They must ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach the purpose of God, and ouercome the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God, before they can vndoe this great worke, which God with such <hi>wisedome purposeth,</hi> and with such <hi>power performeth.</hi> If it were in the wisedome of man to deuise it, or in the power of man to performe it, then might it be soone vndone: but this worke is Gods, and all men must giue God the glory, who onely hath vndertaken this worke, and onely is able to bring it to an end.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:24811:39"/>
When God hath once manifested his will, it is strange that the pride and ignorance of man should deuise wayes to bring that into questions and doubtes which God in his Scriptures hath euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set downe. <hi>But there must bee heresies that they which are approued may be knowne.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19.</p>
            <p>Now I thinke this long contention may bee brought to a short end: If any of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> or <hi>Arminians,</hi> or if all of them be able to proue, that the grace of God, by which wee are called, and iustified, and saued, is nothing but a <hi>gentle</hi> or <hi>morall perswasion,</hi> then the <hi>Pelagians</hi> haue ouercome <hi>vs</hi>: But if this <hi>grace</hi> bee wrought in vs by the <hi>power of God,</hi> then hath the <hi>truth</hi> ouercome the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi> Now I come to take a view of some particuler escapes in his booke.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Age 17. speaking of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> fall, hee saith, <hi>Christ prayed for Saint Peter that hee might not fall: and Christ was euer heard in that he prayed for</hi>: And a little after. <hi>If he fell hee must needes fall either totally or finally; for cedo sertium</hi>? And againe, <hi>auoyde it if you can, you come vp and home to our Gagger, that Saint Peters faith did not faile, and so subscribe to Bellarmine. Petro dominus impetrauit vt non posset cadere, quod ad fidem attinet.</hi> Thus writeth the Author.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:24811:39"/>FIrst this is granted that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> fell into a great sinne; but euery fall into sinne prooueth not a failing in faith. Christ prayed that his faith should not faile, and hee was heard in that hee prayed for: therefore this is true that his faith fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not. If any Papist speake or write this truth consonant to the Scripture, I take not that for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. This Author saith, that Christ prayed that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> might not fall, and Christ was euer heard in that hee prayed for; his conclusion should bee that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did not fall: Which because hee seeth to bee false; hee would interpret it, that hee fell not finally, though hee fell totally. But the ought to haue interpreted the wordes of the Scripture, and not to make words of his owne, and interpret them. Hee doth strangely confound the thing whereof hee speaketh. Where hee saith, <hi>Christ prayed for Saint Peter that hee might not fail</hi>: these bee his owne words, they are without warrant, against the euidence of the story: For Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did fall into a great sinne: But Christ knowing that hee should fall, and giuing him war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof, prayed that though hee fell, yet his faith should not faile. Hee is intangled with an idle and vnnecessary confusion, as though the <hi>fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> faith, and his <hi>falling</hi> into sinne, were one and the same thing. Distinguish these things that are confounded, and then it is cleere, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did <hi>fall into sinne,</hi> and yet his <hi>faith failed not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But saith hee, <hi>hee fell either totally or finally: for,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:24811:40"/>
cedo tertium.</hi> The ancient Fathers writing of the sinnes of the Saints, giue to him his <hi>tertium,</hi> which hee requireth. For when they speake of the falles of the Saints, they vse to note them by this word, <hi>Lapsus</hi>: which though wee in English ordinarily call a fall: Yet it is a <hi>tertium</hi> in respect of a totall and finall fall; and so saueth such a fall from beeing either totall or finall: So whether wee call <hi>Lapsus,</hi> a <hi>fall</hi> or a <hi>slipping,</hi> we stand not vpon words: the thing wee seeke is whether euery sinne in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate cutteth off faith, as Maister <hi>Thomson</hi> deuised, and <hi>this man</hi> seconds him. This they affirme, and wee deny: The iust man sinneth often, but who did euer say, that hee looseth his faith as often as hee sinneth? For in the iust and regenerate man, there are two men dwelling together, the old and the new man: and sin that is still dwelling is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times working.</p>
            <p>This is manifested in diuers places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as namely <hi>Romanes</hi> 7. In which Chapter, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer some say to the contrary, the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the person of a regenerate man. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confesseth that sinne <hi>dwelleth</hi> in him; <hi>that the good which hee would doe, that hee doth not, but the euill which hee would not doe, that hee doth: that hee delighteth in the Law of God after the inward man:</hi> (which words are sufficient to prooue against the <hi>Pelagians, Arminians,</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> that hee spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the person of a regenerate man; for an vnregenerate man cannot truely vtter those words.) And yet hee confesseth, <hi>that he seeth an other Law in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:24811:40"/>
his members, bringing him to the captiuity of the law of sin.</hi> Then it must be confessed that sin may dwell there where faith dwelleth.</p>
            <p>This doctrine is contained in the Articles of faith and religion. <hi>Article</hi> 9. in these wordes. <hi>Although there is no condemnation to them that beleeue and are Baptized, yet the Apostle doth confesse that concupiscence and lust hath of it selfe the nature of sinne.</hi> In the same Article it is saide, that this concupiscence deserueth Gods wrath and damnation. So that wee must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that sinne and faith may dwell together vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till wee come to an Angelicall state. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sinne in a regenerate man doth not make a cutting off of faith, according to the new deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed cut.</p>
            <p>Yet in this is our Author resolute, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> fell totally. I answer that cannot be in the regenerate, where there is repugnance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctation. As long as the warre is maintained, the flesh striuing against the spirit, and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit against the flesh. so long the fall is not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, neither can it bee, when the spirit is still striuing, and disallowing and recouering the hold againe. And if this warre bee maintained, there must needes bee the Spirit. For the flesh doth not striue against the flesh, and where the Spirit is there is faith. And therefore as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not totally lost in the regenerate, though many times it may bee and is greeued so faith is not totally lost in them, though they may fall
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:24811:41"/>
into diuers sinnes, by which sinnes the Spirit is greeued.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Hilary</hi> compareth the booke of <hi>Psalmes</hi> to a bundell of keyes to open the lockes (that is) the difficult places of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> and of other Scriptures. If the right key bee taken and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applyed, it will open the locke. The Author of the <hi>Appeale</hi> hath set a locke heere, that is a difficulty, where there was none indeede. I will try if I can <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight of the right keyes out of the <hi>Psalmes</hi> to open this locke, that is, to dissolue this difficulty which he maketh heere of a totall fall from grace.</p>
            <p>Psalme 19. verses 12, 13. <hi>Who can vnderstand his faultes? cleanse mee from my secret sinnes; and keepe thy seruant also from presumptuous sinnes, and let them not reigne ouer mee: so shall I bee vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and made cleane from the great transgression.</hi> Hee prayeth to bee <hi>cleansed</hi> from other sinnes, but to bee <hi>preserued</hi> from presumptuous sinnes; that they haue not the dominion ouer him: Whereby wee may collect, that the Saints are freed, and still pray to bee freed from presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous sinnes, such as reigne in the wicked: but for other sinnes, altogether they are not free.</p>
            <p>Psalme 25. verse 5. <hi>Vnto thee, O Lord, I lift vp my soule, my God I trust in thee.</hi> Heere hee
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:24811:41"/>
professeth his faith: And yet verse 11. hee saith: <hi>For thy names sake O Lord hee mercifull to mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, for it is great:</hi> then in him there was a true faith, and great iniquity dwelling together. It followeth, that not onely sinne, but sometimes great sinnes may bee in a godly man; but such as are not ioyned with presumption, but with true and sincere repentance.</p>
            <p>Psalme 37. verse 24. <hi>Though hee fall, hee shall not bee cast downe; for the Lord holdeth him vp with his hand.</hi> In this Scripture there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther instance giuen of that which this Author called for, when hee saide, <hi>cedo tertium</hi>: For the <hi>Prophet</hi> saith: <hi>Though hee fall, hee shall not bee cast downe.</hi> To <hi>fall</hi> and yet not to bee <hi>cast downe,</hi> is a <hi>tertium</hi> in respect of a totall and finall fall. For hee that falleth so, as yet hee is not cast downe, <hi>falleth,</hi> and yet neither totally nor finally: the reason is giuen which is beyond all answering: <hi>For the Lord putteth his hand vnder him to stay him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psalme 38. verses 3, 4. <hi>There is nothing sound in my flesh, because of thine anger, neither is there rest in my bones, because of my sinne: for mine iniquities are gone ouer my head, and as a weighty burthen too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy for mee.</hi> And yet, verse 15. he saith: <hi>On thee O Lord do I waite; thou wilt heare mee my Lord my God.</hi> Hee feeles the heauy burthen of his sinnes, he doth not conceale the multitude of them, they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:24811:42"/>
are so many that they are gone ouer his head, hee confesseth, hee complaineth, hee cryeth to God. What then? where so great and so many sinnes were felt (as a tender conscience must needes feele them) shall we say that this man lost all grace? No. If he had not beene much troubled with his sinnes, hee would not thus haue spoken of them; if hee had not had grace, he would not thus confesse them and call to God for mercy.</p>
            <p>Psalme 40 verse 12. <hi>My sinnes haue taken such hold vpon mee, that I am not able to looke vp, they are mee in number then the haires of head.</hi> Yet verse 17. <hi>Though I bee poore and needy, the Lord thinketh of mee. Thou art my helper and my deliuerer my God.</hi> Heere wee finde great and many sinnes, and yet a great and a precious faith.</p>
            <p>It were too long to rehearse all of this kinde. This may suffice to prooue that grace in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, is not totally lost by sinnes; vnlesse they bee presumptuous sinnes which raigne: But from these raigning sinnes, they that are borne of God are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued: according to that of S. <hi>Iohn, He that is borne of God sinneth not:</hi> Hee that standeth vpon the top of the stayres, may fall and slipp downe a steppe or two, and yet not fall to the bottome. There is danger I grant it. And if we stood by our owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and strength, as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> would haue it, then might wee fall away altogether. But in a regenerate man, there is power and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: the power is Gods, the weaknesse is his owne. When he falleth, this is his weaknesse: but
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:24811:42"/>
God by his power doth so order that weaknesse and those fals, that hee will haue his great power mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in this great weakenesse. Therefore the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> had this answer. <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee, for my power is made perfect through weaknes:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the blessed <hi>Apostle</hi> maketh this vse. <hi>Very gladly therefore will I reioyce rather in mine infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say further, that sinne is so farre from cutting off faith totally in the regenerate, that it is rather ordained, by the infinite mercy of God, (which is rather to bee adored, and wondred at, then dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) it is, I say, ordained for the better exercise of faith and repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if by falling into sinne, faith were totally lost in the regenerate, then a man so falling could neuer rise againe vnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. For hee that hath lost grace totally, hath nothing left in him but flesh, and his owne nature and free-will. Which of it selfe can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer raise a man to repentance, though the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> striue for this, and would haue all grace lost, that they might inferre, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and free-will may raise vp a man to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but this is the poyson of their heresie. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> fell into sinne, and rose againe by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, because his faith remained, and failed not, which drew him to repentance. But <hi>Iudas</hi> fell, and neuer rose againe, because he neuer had true faith.</p>
            <p>Now, why doe men striue for this, or what doe they ayme at? When they would haue faith
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:24811:43"/>
vtterly lost, against the <hi>Apostle,</hi> who teacheth that the gifts and graces of God are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; what haue they gotten that thus striue, or what would they haue? forsooth they would make Praedestination hang vpon vncertainties, vpon mans will; that a man may predestinate himselfe when he will, as often as he will: For they haue no better ends then these.</p>

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 18. Speaking of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> words, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro dominus impetrauit, vt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d fidem attinet:</hi> He addeth these words: <hi>Iust your Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane doctrine for finall perseuerance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the first time that euer I heard of a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane doctrine in points <hi>dogmaticall,</hi> and I haue liued longer in the Church then hee hath done. I thought that Puritanes were onely such as were factious against the Bishops in the poynt of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Discipline</hi>: and so I am sure it hath beene vnderstood hitherto in our Church. A Puritane doctrine is a strange thing, because it hath beene confessed on both sides, that Protestants and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes haue held the same doctrines without va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance. The discipline varied in <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Geneua,</hi> and other where: Yet the doctrine hath beene hitherto held the same, according to the <hi>Harmonie</hi> of the seuerall <hi>Confessions</hi> of these Churches. Not one doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> another of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and so of others.</p>
            <p>What is your end in this, but to make diuisions where there were none? and that a rent may bee
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:24811:43"/>
made in the Church? forsooth! that place may bee giuen to the <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> doctrines: And then all that are against these must bee called Puritane doctrines. It is true, that <hi>Arminian</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines will make a diuision, where none was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And our Authour of contentions by vertue of that doctrine, hath giuen a desperate attempt to doe the like in our Church.</p>
            <p>And that finall perseuerance should bee that Puritan doctrine, is a thing no lesse strange. The <hi>Pelagians</hi> would haue so called it in Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> time, if they had had that word then, or any thing that might giue disgrace to the doctrine of perseuerance. For Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the doctrine of <hi>finall perseuerance</hi> against the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> And doth not this man in reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that doctrine, professe himselfe to stand for the <hi>Pelagians</hi> against Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and the Orthodox Church? And yet himselfe confesseth finall perseuerance; he had the lesse reason to call it a Puritane doctrine.</p>
            <p>But hee is so various in his sayings, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing to bee at liberty, not to <hi>declare</hi> his owne minde, but to <hi>relate</hi> what others say, that it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth hard to hold him stedfast to any thing. But in this particular hee must confesse, that though a regenerate and iustified man fall into sinne, yet there is something that abideth and continueth in him to raise him vp againe to repentance. As the carnall part abideth, so the spirituall part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth, so long as the spirit striueth against the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:24811:44"/>
flesh.<note place="margin">Math. 24.13.</note> Our Lord saith, <hi>Hee that perseuereth to the end shall bee saued.</hi> S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>Hee that is borne of God sinneth not, for the seed of God abideth in him.</hi> Of this I haue spoken of before.</p>
            <p>Briefly, touching finall perseuerance, I would know how any man can truely lay to his heart that article of our faith: I belieue <hi>life euerlasting</hi>; but that withall hee must belieue <hi>finall perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:</hi> for hee that belieueth that hee shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue euerlasting life, must also belieue that hee shall perseuere to the end, without which grace no man shall attaine to life euerlasting.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> would say somewhat to infringe the doctrine of Praedesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they shew all their spight against finall perseuerance, that all grace may bee lost. And what will follow then? If all grace be lost, then surely the grace of Praedestination is lost, and the grace of calling is lost; and then must men goe to seeke a new Praedestination, and a new calling: and thus of the greatest mysteries of our saluation they make fables.</p>
            <p>I thinke that the Authour of the <hi>Appeale</hi> is but a young Scholler in the <hi>Arminian</hi> Schoole, and did not well fore-see these consequences, but from the grounds that hee hath layed, these things must follow: the grace of Praedesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the grace of Gods calling must bee lost. For I appeale to his Logicke, doth not he that saith <hi>all grace is lost totally,</hi> conclude that the grace of Praedestination and calling is lost? if so,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:24811:44"/>
then is not this man bound to tell vs how GOD pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth to a new predestination, and to a new cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? These be things which the <hi>Arminians</hi> listen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. How glad would they be to heare that the Church of <hi>England</hi> should begin to follow them in this course of multiplying predestinations and elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? This is that which they haue long aymed at: And here our learned <hi>Author</hi> hath well bestirred himselfe to doe them this service. Against these foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and fabulous fancies, the <hi>Apostle</hi> hath layed this barre.<note place="margin">Ephes. 1, 4.11.</note> We are <hi>chosen</hi> and <hi>predestinate in Christ</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginning of the world, according to the <hi>purpose</hi> of him, that worketh all things according to the <hi>counsell</hi> of his owne <hi>will.</hi> This counsell, by which he hath wrought these things,<note place="margin">Esa. 46.10.</note> is constant and vnchangeable. Against this truth the gates of hell shall never prevaile,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17.</note> though the <hi>Arminians</hi> come with all their tro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pes to maintaine the passages of hell gates.</p>
            <p>When the auncient Fathers and other godly men speake of predestination, they teach that it is a grace which God giveth, and God preserveth in vs, and by which also he preserveth vs to himselfe. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keepe &amp; preserue our selues to the end, no more then a silly flocke of sheepe can keepe, preserue, and defend themselues from the Wolues: this is the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd his care. So our great shepherd can and doth keepe and preserue vs to the end: this is his worke, not ours. But this grace is given to them that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to his purpose, and are justified, and beleeue in him that is able to bring his promise to his end.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:24811:45"/>The great mysteries of our salvation are in danger by these poysoned doctrines of <hi>Arminians</hi> to be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 25. and 26. he speaketh variously of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from grace and loosing of faith, as if he had not yet determined what to hold. He relateth a speech of his <hi>Gagger</hi> thus. <hi>You meant that faith might be lost both totally and finally in regard of God, who made no such absolute and irrespectiue Decree.</hi> If he should be challenged for this speech, he will answere, as his vse is, that he <hi>relateth</hi> onely, but doth not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine</hi> dogmatically: but in this place he is put from that answere. For he cannot relate this as the opinion of the <hi>Gagger,</hi> whom we may number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those <hi>Papistes,</hi> that deny the respectiue De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: for that they deny it, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> witnesseth, as before I haue related. Then this must be his owne speech and collection; <hi>Faith may be lost totally and finally, in regard of God that made no such absolute Decree, and irrespectiue.</hi> His reason standeth thus, If God made no absolute and irrespectiue Decree, then may faith be lost totally and finally. But this is his opinion, that God made no such absolute and irrespectiue Decree, therefore it followeth that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Decree of God, faith may be lost totally and finally. This would proue fine Divinitie, if he would stand to it; he writeth so, as if his greatest care were onely to seeke the approbation of <hi>Pelagius</hi>; for these things will never get the approbation of any
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:24811:45"/>
sound Divine in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But it is well, that before faith can be totally and finally lost, he must first proue that Gods Decree is respectiue: This he never laboured to proue, and he never heard any man deliver it but <hi>Arminians.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>PEAKING of falling away, he layeth all vpon the doctrine of the <hi>Homilies.</hi> He saith.
<q>In the second part of the Homilie of falling from God, we are sent to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion more <hi>adoppositum,</hi> not onely of totall lapse for a time, but also of finall separation, and for ever. Which also is according to the doctrine expressed in the Articles. For he that saith a man may fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and may recover; implyeth withall that some may fall away and not recover.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This belike he taketh for a solid kinde of proofe, if he doe but in his imagination thinke it implieth so much: When he vrgeth a point, he bringeth no reasons but a conceit of implications: When he is vrged, he doth but relate other mens opinions, but what himselfe thinketh, that he keepeth close. This close-keeping of his opinion, which he so much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, is very suspitious; there is something in it, that he is loath should be knowne: yet he hideth it not so closely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it may be found out. He pleadeth that a man may fall from grace totally and finally: A man may fall away from grace and become no child of God. All this may be truely said, and then
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:24811:46"/>
who hath any thing to say to him, that saith nothing but that which any other man may avouch? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, <hi>aliquid latet</hi>; If he should say plainely, that they that are called, and iustified <hi>according to Gods purpose,</hi> doe <hi>fall away totally and finally</hi>: then he seeth that he should contradict the doctrine of the auncient Fathers, and of our Church: but holding himselfe in these generall termes, that <hi>men may fall away from faith and grace,</hi> he vnderstood that this might be maintained. We must therefore open this matter plainly. This is soone done, by calling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, what hath beene said of the respectiue Decree, or irrespectiue. He holdeth the Decree of predestination to be respectiue, that is to respect something in men. If this be so, then it maketh no matter, whether faith &amp; grace be vtterly lost: For all may be repayred againe. But repayred in regard and consideration of that which men doe, and not vpon that which God hath done. But if the Decree respect nothing in man, then the case is altered. We haue before declared the doctrine of the orthodoxe Church, that the purpose of God, which <hi>he</hi> calleth the <hi>Decree,</hi> respecteth nothing but Gods will: and therefore they that are called and iustified according to Gods purpose, doe beleeue and obey, repent and walke in good workes, and at last obtaine the end, everlasting life. These graces that proceed from Gods calling according to his purpose, cannot be vtterly lost, because <hi>these gifts and this calling are without repentance.</hi> They may be troubled and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but totally lost they cannot be. This man taketh these things otherwise, that they may be totally lost.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:24811:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
To be short, we must bring him to this stand: either plainly to confesse, that the graces that are given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods calling and purpose may be totally lost: or else to confesse that his writings are idle, and trouble our Church to no purpose: because if he speake of graces which proceed not from Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and calling (as many graces doe, and in which graces men may make fayre and farre proceedings, of which graces the <hi>Homilies</hi> speake) in this point he hath no adversary, that I know. If he will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge plainly that the graces which proceed from Gods calling and purpose may be lost, then should not I trouble him in this point. Provided withall, that he giue ouer his <hi>respective Decree,</hi> which is the ground &amp; root of all this trouble, wherewith he hath troubled himselfe and others.</p>
            <p>Now we come to examine that which he bringeth out of the <hi>Homilies,</hi> concerning falling from God. The first <hi>Homily</hi> sayth, that sometimes men <hi>goe from God,</hi> for lacke of faith, sometimes by neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his commandements: to be short, all they that may not abide Gods word, but <hi>following the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions and stubbornnesse of their owne hearts, goe backward and not forward.</hi> And whereas God hath shewed to all them that truely beleeue his Gospell, his face of mercy in Iesus Christ, which doth so lighten their hearts, that (<hi>if they beleeue it as they ought to doe</hi>) (this <hi>Parenthesis</hi> the Author hath left out, which might some way direct the meaning of the <hi>Homilie</hi>) they be transformed to his image, be made partakers of heavenly light, and of his spirit, be fashioned to him in all goodnes requisite to Gods
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:24811:47"/>
children: so if they after doe <hi>neglect</hi> the same, if they <hi>be vnthankefull</hi> &amp;c: <hi>hee will take away</hi> from them <hi>his kingdome,</hi> his holy word, &amp;c. These words that follow the <hi>Parenthesis</hi> depend vpon those wordes contained in it, which our <hi>Author</hi> hath left out. It is true that if these men behold this grace and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue as they ought to doe, that then they are so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, &amp;c. But this is ioyned with that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on expressed in the <hi>Parenthesis</hi>: if that condition faile, then these other things following, are not well vrged from those words. And what is all this, but <hi>if we forsake him, he will forsake vs,</hi> as the Scripture teacheth. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2.</p>
            <p>It is evident that the <hi>Homily</hi> speaketh of profane and wicked men, that goe from God, because they never care for comming vnto God: of which profane men, there are (God knoweth) too many in our Land; whereof the <hi>Homily</hi> complaineth. The <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> speaketh partly of such, &amp; partly of hypocrites. This is evident from the words of the <hi>Homily,</hi> which are these. <hi>For God that promised his mercy to them that be truely penitent, hath not promised to the presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous sinner, either that he shall haue a long life, or that he shall haue true repentance at the last end.</hi> Doth not the <hi>Homily</hi> speake plainly of wicked, profane, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous sinners? What is this to them that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to Gods purpose, and walke with feare and obedience in the workes of their calling?</p>
            <p>To the same purpose is that which he hath brought out of the <hi>second Homily</hi>; Wherein, by his leaue, he hath vndertaken more then he hath proved, or can proue out of the words of the Homily: For he saith,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:24811:47"/>
that in that <hi>Homily</hi> is concluded <hi>not onely a totall lapse for a time, but also a finall separation for ever.</hi> This conclusion is not prooved out of the words of the <hi>Homily</hi>: And if they were, they helpe him not: For that Homily is to be expounded by the words of the former Homily, which speaketh in expresse words of presumptuous sinners: that such may fall away altogether, who did every deny?</p>
            <p>And because he vrgeth so much the words of the <hi>Homilies</hi> in this point, I would know of him a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why in that <hi>Homily</hi> which is against <hi>Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Images,</hi> he denieth that the <hi>Homilies</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the publique dogmaticall resolutions of our Church? Why doth he play fast and loose? Why doth he vrge this in one place, which he flatly deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in an other place? Let him giue a reason.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the</hi> 16. <hi>Article teacheth the same,</hi> sayth hee: the words of the Article are these.
<q>After wee haue receiued the holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sinne: and by the grace of God we may rise againe, and amend our lifes: The <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> speaketh religiously and truely.</q>
For it is true, and must be confessed that after grace given, we may fall into sinne. The <hi>Article</hi> attributeth all power of rising againe to the grace of God: This we embrace. What hath this man against this? truely, no reason, but a prety fancy of his owne.
<q>For, sayth he, he that saith a man may fall away, and may recover, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth withall, that some may fall away and no reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Which kinde of speach is a plaine confession, that he hath nothing for himselfe in the wordes of the <hi>Article.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:24811:48"/>And yet in this weake manner hee cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, vnlesse he take this libertie to himselfe, to change and controll the words of the <hi>Article.</hi> For the <hi>Article</hi> speaketh of <hi>departing</hi> from grace given, he maketh it speake of <hi>falling away.</hi> The <hi>Article</hi> saith, the graunt of repentance is not to be denyed to such as fall into sinne after baptisme; and that we may depart from grace given and fall into sinne, and by the grace of God may rise againe. He will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, I suppose, that there is no man who liveth long after his baptisme, but may fall into sinne: and that is a kinde of departing from grace giuen, From these words he concludeth, against all <hi>Logicke,</hi> that a man so falling into sinne falleth away: this is farre from the wordes and meaning of the <hi>Article,</hi> and sheweth that his purpose is not to satisfie men of iudgment, but by peruerting and intorting of words to a strange, that is, to his owne priuate sense, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the simple.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Pag</hi>: 27. he would proue from Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> and <hi>Prosper,</hi> that a regenerate and iustified man may fall away. Our learned <hi>Author</hi> did never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in writing this to satisfie the learned and iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, but to deceiue and vndermine the weaker sort of men. Would any man that had his right wits, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadg Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> and <hi>Prosper</hi> in this particuler, wherein they haue so fully, and soundly declared themselues to the contrary against the <hi>Pelagians</hi>? But some what must be sayd, and some shew must be made. Herein our Author may see the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his cause, and how little hope he hath to hold it vp, when he is driven to seeke help at them,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:24811:48"/>
who vtterly ouerthrow his cause. Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> wordes by him cited (though they are not there where he citeth them) are these. <hi>Si autem regenitus &amp; iustificatus in malam vitam sua voluntate relabitur, iste non potest dicere, non accepi: quia acceptam gratiam Dei suo in malum libero arbitrio amisit.</hi> And againe: <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum est quosdam de filijs perditionis non accepto dono perseverandi vs<expan>

            </p>
            <p>If that Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> himselfe had not made a full answere to these and such like things, as may be cited from him, this <hi>Author</hi> might with some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability haue brought these places. But if you will vrge Saint <hi>Augustins</hi> words, you must giue him leaue to expound his owne words. Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> sayth, that <hi>iust</hi> men and regenerate; nay, hee proceedeth farther, that the <hi>Children of God</hi>; yea, and more then that, that the <hi>Elect</hi> may fall away: It is true that Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> sayth all this. But if a man should cite these things from him, &amp; so leaue them, as this <hi>learned Authour</hi> doth; he should doe great wrong to Saint <hi>Augustin.</hi> For he expoundeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that these men whom hee calleth <hi>iust, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, the sonnes of God, and elect,</hi> which doe fall away, are so <hi>esteemed</hi> of <hi>vs,</hi> but that they are <hi>not such</hi> in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> They are sayd to be such: <hi>sed à nescientibus quid futuri sunt.</hi> S. <hi>Augustin</hi> speaketh

            <p>But hee hath here also somewhat out of S. <hi>Augustin</hi> touching perseverance. <hi>Sancti de suo perseveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae proemio certi sunt, de ipsa tamen perseverantiae repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuntur incerti.</hi> If we grant this, what will he inferre? Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> teacheth that God to humble vs, and to make vs to seeke him with zeale, doth hide some things from our knowledge, as our finall perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and our predestination: but this is for our good to remoue pride and presumption from vs: If wee our selues did either predestinate our selues; or
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:24811:49"/>
giue the grace of finall perseverance to our selues, then might this obiection be made; for then would things be in vncertainties: but we giue all the glory to God, who knoweth vs better then we know our selues, and we leaue this to him, which onely is able to bring his owne worke to an end. And yet if we search a little more exactly into the meaning of S. <hi>Augustins</hi> words, it will appeare that S. <hi>Augustin</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not <hi>simply</hi> against the certainty of perseverance, but in <hi>some respect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be certaine of our perseverance, may be two wayes vnderstood: either to be <hi>certaine that we shall never fall into sinne,</hi> so to trouble the course of our perseverance. Of this S. <hi>Augustin</hi> speaking saith tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we are vncertaine of our perseverance: or else to be certaine of our perseverance, may be vnderstood to be <hi>certaine of our faith, whereby we persevere</hi>; that our faith shall never vtterly fayle. Of this <hi>every</hi> man cannot be sure: But <hi>he</hi> that hath a <hi>true faith,</hi> beleeveth that his sinnes are forgiven, that he is the child of God: this man walketh in loue and obedience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which his faith is vaine, beleeveth to receiue in the end everlasting life. And therefore S. <hi>Augustin</hi> saith; <hi>Sancti de suo perseverantiae praemio certi sunt.</hi> How can a man be sure of the reward of persevera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vnlesse he be sure of his perseverance? Everlasting life is the reward of his perseverance, and of this reward he is sure. It must needs follow that in some sort, he is sure of his perseverance. What sort is that? Verily his faith persevereth, as Christ said to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> though he fell into a great sinne, and therefore did not perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere without sinning, yet he had <hi>prayed that his faith
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:24811:50"/>
did not fayle</hi>: and so he did persevere in the faith. And S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, that <hi>he that is borne of God, cannot sinne, because the seed of God abideth in him.</hi> Then he that hath the seed of God abiding in him, doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe according to that grace which abideth in him. Many men speake of grace and faith, but verily none can speake truely thereof, but they that haue these things in them. S. <hi>Augustin</hi> saith, no man can vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the truth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib. de oper. Monach. cap.</hi> 13.</note> but he that liveth a godly life. <hi>In cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitione cavendus est error, in actione nequitia: Errat au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem quisquis putat veritatem se posse cognoscere, dum ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huc nequiter vivat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now where S. <hi>Augustin</hi> saith, that Saints or true beleevers are sure of the reward of perseverance, but not of perseverance it selfe: if we should vnderstand this, as our <hi>Author</hi> seemeth to take it; S. <hi>Augustin</hi> hath wrapped himselfe in a contradiction. For if a man should thus reason against these words: Every true beleever is sure of the reward of perseverance: but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very true beleever is sure that vnlesse he persevere, he cannot be sure of the reward of perseverance: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every true beleever is sure of his perseverance. This, I say, cannot be denyed by any that graunteth with S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> that true beleevers are sure of the reward of perseverance: For it followeth, that he is as well assured by faith of his perseverance. And vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground it is inferred, because he is sure of the reward of perseverance.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>AG. 28. He maketh a great shew of all the learned men of the Church of <hi>England</hi> that <hi>composed</hi> the <hi>Articles</hi>; that <hi>confirmed</hi> them; that <hi>iustified</hi> them at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi> He saith, that <hi>these were the most learned men of our Church</hi>: Who denyeth that? or who called their learning into question? But what doe these here? And why are they troubled? <hi>All these,</hi> saith he, <hi>are such as doe assent to antiquitie.</hi> There is no doubt but these learned men did assent to learned Antiquitie. But where is this Antiquitie, or what is it? <hi>Parturiunt montes.</hi> Truely we haue not hitherto had one word from Antiquity, but onely those places of S. <hi>Augustin</hi> and <hi>Prosper,</hi> which are answered and found to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose. This is a strange kinde of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, to rayse so great an expectation, and in the end, all to turne into smoake. We expect to heare, whereunto all these learned men haue assented: here is nothing but words in the clouds. You haue made a glorious <hi>syllogisme.</hi> The <hi>maior</hi> is, that <hi>these men were the most learned men in our Church:</hi> it is graunted: The <hi>minor</hi> you say <hi>you will make good</hi>; but that is not yet done: you haue said nothing to proue it; you would proue it first out of the 16. <hi>Article</hi>; but you goe from the words of the <hi>Article,</hi> and shew vs what in your conceite it implyeth. This will never be taken for proofe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That which you vndertake to proue, is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and finall fall; whereof you haue not as yet offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 30. he saith, <hi>The doctrine of the</hi> 16. <hi>Article was challenged for vnsound in the conference at Hampton Court, by those that were petitioners against the doctrine and discipline established: and being so challenged before his Maiestie, was then and there defended, maintained, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed, averred for true, auncient, iustifiable, good and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke, against that absolute, irrespectiue, necessitating, fatall Decree of your new predestination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man would thinke that such a man as this, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting things done, should speake truely, especially of such an Act, which every man that list may know. It is more strange that he should report it so, as not to say one word true: For it is not true that it was <hi>chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged for vnsound:</hi> it is not true that it was <hi>then and there defended, maintained, avowed, averred for true:</hi> For there could be no vse of this defending, avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, averring, where, on both sides, it was confessed to be true, and where the <hi>Article</hi> was not challenged for vnsound. The plaine truth is, Doctor <hi>Rainolds</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the <hi>Article,</hi> and professed, that the meaning of the <hi>Article</hi> was sound: besides Doctor <hi>Rainolds,</hi> no man spake to that particular. How then could our <hi>Author</hi> say, it <hi>was challenged for vnsound?</hi> Doth he that saith the meaning of the <hi>Article</hi> is sound, challenge it for vnsound? The libertie is great that this man gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to himselfe, to thinke that such things would currantly passe, whether his words containe reason or none. Doctor <hi>Rainolds</hi> onely desired that it might be explained by these words added to the end of the <hi>Article</hi> thus: <hi>after we haue received the holy Ghost, we
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:24811:51"/>
may depart from grace:</hi> to these words of the <hi>Article</hi> he desired this might be added, <hi>yet neither totally nor fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally:</hi> Against this, no man spake then: but for it, that worthy and learned Deane of <hi>Paules</hi> then, after Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> Doctor <hi>Overall</hi> did speak so much as directly confirmed that which Doctor <hi>Rainolds</hi> had moved; For <hi>Page</hi> 42. of that <hi>Conference,</hi> he professed that it was a Doctrine which himselfe had taught; <hi>That whosoever, though before iustified, did commit any grievous sinne, as adultery, murther, treason, or the like, did become ipso facto subiect to Gods wrath, and guiltie of damnation.</hi> Adding herevnto, that those which were <hi>called</hi> and <hi>iustified</hi> according to the <hi>purpose</hi> of <hi>Gods election,</hi> howsoever they might and did <hi>fall</hi> into grievous sinnes, and therefore into the present state of wrath and damnation, yet did never <hi>fall</hi> either <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally</hi> from all graces of God, to be vtterly destitute of all the parts of seed thereof, nor <hi>finally</hi> from iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now when Doctor <hi>Overall</hi> did in the summe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with Doctor <hi>Rainolds</hi>; where then was the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging of the <hi>Article</hi> for vnsound on the one side, and where was that defending, avowing, averring, on the other side?</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Authour</hi> would proue his assertion out of the <hi>Conference</hi> at <hi>Hampton Court</hi>; but out of that confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the contrary is proved. He sayth, that a <hi>iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> man may <hi>fall</hi> away <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>finally</hi>; but D. <hi>Overall</hi> in that <hi>Conference</hi> affirmeth the contrary, neither <hi>totally,</hi> nor <hi>finally</hi>: he should haue vsed some more probability. He seemeth to be much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of reason, when he vseth reasons, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the first examined, proue directly against him.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:24811:52"/>
He must therefore obserue, that this doctrine of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and finall falling away, which he pretendeth to be the doctrine of our Church, was a doctrine refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> by D. <hi>Overall,</hi> and before that time was never received here: For D <hi>Overall</hi> would never haue <hi>refuted</hi> a doctrine <hi>received</hi> in this <hi>Church.</hi> Then let him seeke out when his doctrines began to be the Doctrines of our Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 35. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36. he saith; <hi>Let this be acknowledged the doctrine of our Church, that Children duely baptized, are put into the estate of grace, and salvation: but many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren so baptized, when they come to age, by a wicked life doe fall away from God, and from the estate of grace and salvation wherein he had set them. — if you grant not this, you must hold that all men that are baptized are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>

            <p>If our <hi>Authour</hi> had bene pleased, to haue observed the iudgement of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> he would not be thus troubled with <hi>novelties.</hi> This one poore obiection seemeth to trouble the man. Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> might easily haue satisfied him: For he observeth a great difference betweene them that are regenerate and iustified onely <hi>sacramento tenus,</hi> and those that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and iustified according to the <hi>purpose</hi> of <hi>Gods election. Abraham receiued the sacrament of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as a seale of the righteousnes of faith.</hi> The sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is good to them to whom it is a seale of the righteousnes of faith, but it is not a seale in all that receiue the Sacrament: For many receiue the signe, which haue not the thing.</p>
            <p>Then to proceede: <hi>Ismael</hi> was circumcised, and so was <hi>Isaak:</hi> but <hi>Ismael was borne according to the flesh,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:24811:52"/>
and Isaak according to the spirit.</hi> Now hee was not iustified, but onely <hi>sacramento tenus,</hi> that was borne according to the <hi>flesh:</hi> but he that was borne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>spirit,</hi> was iustifyed <hi>truely.</hi> Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi> saith, <hi>Cum essent omnibus communia sacramenta, non communis erat omnibus gratia.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>August</hi>: in Psal. 77.</note> And againe. <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus in nomine patris, &amp; filij, &amp; spiritus sancti bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zatis, commune est lavacrum regenerationis, sed ipsa gratia cuius ipsa sunt sacramenta, qua membra corporis Christi cum suo capite regenerata sunt, non communis est omnibus.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Israel</hi> was called to be a people of God, yet all that were so called, were not so in truth: So all that receiue Baptisme are called the Children of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, iustified: for to vs they must be taken for such in charity, vntil they shew themselues other. But the <hi>Author</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>this is not left to mens cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> (<hi>as you,</hi> sayth he, <hi>doe informe the world</hi>) because we are taught in the service Booke of our Church, earnestly to beleeue; <hi>that Christ hath favorably recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved these infants that are baptized, that he hath imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them with the armes of his mercy, that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vnto them the blessing of everlasting life: And out of that beleife and perswasion, wee are to giue thankes faithfully and devoutly for it.</hi> All this we receiue and make no doubt of: but when wee haue sayd all, wee must come to this, that all this is nothing but the charity of the Church: and what more can you make of it? For where he vrgeth this, that Children bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized are put in the state of salvation, and this must be beleived. I make no doubt of it, but because he seemeth to haue a strange vnderstanding of it, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:24811:53"/>
vrgeth it as if forsooth it could not be answered: I aske him this question, whether we must beleeue it as an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> or <hi>ex judicio charitatis?</hi> this iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of charity he vtterly reiecteth. Then he must hold that we beleeue it as an <hi>Article</hi> of faith: but this is not conteined in any <hi>Article</hi> of faith, it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in any Scripture. And the things which a man is bound to beleeue for his salvation, to speake properly, he must beleeue for himselfe onely, not for another man. And therefore this thing which hee vrgeth, that we must beleeue for other men, cannot be called properly faith and beleeving: for no man beleeveth for another: this proveth evidently that this <hi>beleeving,</hi> whereof our <hi>Communion bo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ke</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is nothing else, but to <hi>beleeue</hi> it <hi>ex judicio chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis:</hi> and can no further be stretched. Concerning this iudgement of charity, we doe not informe the world any otherwise, then Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> informed the Church long since against the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> The <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi> vrged these things as you doe, that they that were baptized were regenerate, and iustified. Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> answereth they are so, for ought that wee know, and vntill they themselues shew themselues to the contrary. Then so long as we haue no cause to the contrary, wee iudge them in charity to be such as we desire they should be: did we devise this? or did we first informe the world of this? it hath bene of old received thus in the Church. <hi>We</hi> doe but say that which the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> haue sayd before vs: and <hi>you</hi> follow that which your Fathers the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> haue taught before you. But here is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; wee following the ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> follow the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:24811:53"/>
               <hi>Church</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you following the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> follow the <hi>Enemies</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here he citeth in the margent, <hi>pag.</hi> 36. <hi>that all Antiquitie taught thus.</hi> I pray you what did Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie teach? That yong children baptized are delivered from originall sinne: We teach the same, and we doubt not, if they dye before they come to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of actuall sinnes, they shall be saved.</p>
            <p>But this is not so to be vnderstood, that no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vnbaptised can be saved: For in this poynt the auncient godly Fathers haue delivered their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, grounded vpon faire evidences of Scripture. And because this is a thing wherein some may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire satisfaction, the Reader will not thinke the time lost, if I somewhat enlarge this point. Baptisme is required as necessary to saluation, so that the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> thereof bringeth damnation; but not the <hi>want</hi> of it. For where a true faith is, and a sincere desire of Baptisme, though a man should by some inevitable meanes misse of washing by water, yet the Auncients make no doubt of the saluation of such a man. This is the judgement of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> and S. <hi>Bernard. Hugo de sancto Victore</hi> lived at the same time with S. <hi>Bernard. Hugo</hi> was troubled with the noveltie of a hot-spirited man, who taught this assertion; That since the time that it was first said by Christ; <hi>Vnlesse a man be borne of water and the holy Ghost, he shall not enter into the kingdome of heaven,</hi> since that, no man might by any meanes be saved, without the actuall receiving of the visible Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea though a man should desire the same with true faith, and contrition of heart, being onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:24811:54"/>
by death, that he could not obtaine that which he desired, yet should this man be damned without remedy. <hi>Hugo</hi> having notice of this asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wrote to S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> concealing the name of the Author of that opinion, onely declaring his asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and craved the judgement of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> in that poynt. To this S. <hi>Bernard</hi> answereth.
<q>The summe of his answere is this:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bern: epist.</hi> 77.</note> First he taketh exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the time so precisely set by the Author of this assertion. For he setteth the time to begin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vpon the speech of those words which <hi>Christ</hi> spake in secret to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> in the night when he came to him. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> sheweth that the beginning of so great a matter was not advisedly set by this new Author, he therefore would haue the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be after the promulgation of the Gospell by the Apostles. For the old Sacraments were in force so long, vntill it was openly and publiquely knowne that they were abrogated; How long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>penes deum est, non meum definire,</hi> saith S. <hi>Bernard.</hi> Then the old Sacraments did stand in force, vntill they were abrogated, that is, publiquely by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles interdicted. And therefore as <hi>Baptisme</hi> is <hi>now</hi> a remedy against originall sinne, so was <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi> of <hi>old.</hi> Now if any that are come to yeares and vnderstanding, after the publication of the remedy of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> shall refuse to be baptised, this man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth another sinne to originall sinne, &amp; so through his owne pride, he beareth the double cause of a most just damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if he should in that case chance to dye. Yet if before his death he repent, and desire and aske to be baptized, and dye before he can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:24811:54"/>
his desire, so that a right faith, a godly hope and sincere charity be not wanting; so God be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull vnto me, <hi>saith</hi> S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> as in this case I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not despayre of this mans salvation for the want of water onely; Neither can I beleeue that this mans <hi>faith</hi> is voyd, his <hi>hope</hi> confounded, his <hi>charitie</hi> fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, if that not the <hi>contempt,</hi> but onely the <hi>impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of having the Sacrament hinder him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing washed with water. And I much maruaile, <hi>saith he, Si novus iste novarum inventor assertionum, &amp; as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertor inventorum</hi>; if this new inventer of new asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and assertor of things invented, can finde a reason in this thing which was hid from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Augustin</hi>; or can finde any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie before the authoritie of these. For if he know it not, both these judged as we doe herein; let him read S. <hi>Ambrose his booke of the death of Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian,</hi> if he hath not read it, or if he hath read it, let him recall it well to memory; if he recall it, let him not dissemble; and there he shall finde that S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> confidently presumed of the salvation of that man who dyed without <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and did vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly attribute that to his minde, which was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thorough impossibilitie of performance. Let him also read the fourth booke of S. <hi>Augustin of one onely Baptisme against the Donatistes,</hi> and he will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acknowledg himselfe to be <hi>imprudently</hi> decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or proue himselfe <hi>impudently</hi> obstinare. For S. <hi>Augustin</hi> sayth, that sometimes <hi>suffering</hi> is in stead of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> as appeareth in the <hi>theefe</hi> vpon the Crosse, to whom though vnbaptised, Christ sayd, <hi>to day thou shalt be with me in Paradise:</hi> From which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:24811:55"/>
place S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tooke an Argument to prooue the same poynt: And S. <hi>Augustin</hi> addeth; Considering this thing againe and againe, I finde (<hi>saith he</hi>) that not onely suffering for the name of <hi>Christ</hi> may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the want of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> but faith also and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the heart, if happily the straitnesse of time will not suffer a man to celebrate the mystery of <hi>Baptisme.</hi> And afterward; How much <hi>(saith he)</hi> even without the visible Sacrament of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> that avayleth which the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith: <hi>With the heart man beleeveth to righteousnesse, and with the mouth man confesseth to salvation,</hi> it is declared in that <hi>Theefe.</hi> But then is this fulfilled invisibly, when as not contempt of Religion, but necessitie excludeth the mystery of <hi>Baptisme.</hi> S. <hi>Bernard</hi> having decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thus much out of S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> proceedeth thus. I confesse, <hi>saith he,</hi> that S. <hi>Augustin</hi> retracteth that instance which he put of the <hi>Theefe,</hi> and thought it not so fit to proue this sentence, because it was vncertaine whether that <hi>Theefe</hi> was baptized or no: but the sentence it selfe and assertion he confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently maintained, and diverse wayes confirmed; neither shall you finde that he did ever retract the opinion, if I be not deceived, <hi>saith Bernard</hi>: And further he saith, that S. <hi>Augustin</hi> in another place when he had spoken of some, whom the Scripture restifyeth to be sanctified invisibly, but not visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; He maketh this inference: hence it is collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>invisible sanctification</hi> hath beene had, and hath <hi>profited</hi> without the <hi>visible Sacraments,</hi> which are changed according to the diversitie of times, so that others were then, others are now. And a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:24811:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
little after; notwithstanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saith S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> the visible Sacrament is by no meanes to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; for he that contemneth it, cannot be invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly sanctified. Whereby he prooveth plainly that a faithfull man, and one converted to the LORD, is not deprived of the fruit of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hau<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Baptisme,</hi> but if he contemne to be <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</hi> From these two pillars (I meane S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> saith S. <hi>Bernard</hi>) I can hardly be drawne to beleeue otherwise. I confesse my selfe either to erre, or to be wise with these. I my selfe also beleeving, <hi>saith he,</hi> that a man may be saved <hi>solâ fide,</hi> by faith onely, having a true desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacrament, though either death antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate his holy desire, or some other invincible force hinder it: And consider when our Saviour saith; <hi>He that beleeveth and is baptised shall be saved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 16.16.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not with great warinesse and vigilancy repeated againe, <hi>But he that will not beleeue shall be damned?</hi> He saith not, he that is not baptized shall be damned; but onely, he that beleeveth not, shall be damned; implying hereby, that sometimes faith alone sufficeth to salvation, and without it nothing. Wherefore albeit we graunt, that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome</hi> may be in stead of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> yet we must vnderstand that it is not punishment that maketh this, but <hi>faith</hi> it selfe, for without it what is Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome but plaine punishment? Now it is against all reason to thinke, that faith which is reputed for Baptisme, where Baptisme is wanting, and which doth make Martyrdome acceptable to God, should be sufficient by it selfe to saue a man when
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:24811:56"/>
either Baptisme cannot be had, or Martyrdome is not required. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> vpon these, and such like reasons concludeth, that a man may be saved by faith without Baptisme, where there is a true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and no contempt of Baptisme. And that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants which die without Baptisme are consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saved, by the faith of their faithfull Parents.</q>

For the same God liveth, which hath heretofore raysed vp the spirits of his servants to maintaine the truth against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and will rayse vp others to stand for the same truth, whensoever it is oppugned.</p>

               <hi>Pag:</hi> 40. he saith, <hi>If it be an error of Arminius, which was the positiue doctrine of Lutherans, and Luther, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:24811:58"/>
Arminius was borne; why is Arminius intituled to that which is none of his, but Martin Luthers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In these words he seemeth to say that these late o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> were the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of <hi>Martin Luther</hi> himselfe. Wherein he is much mistaken. For these opinions were brought in by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: the thing is well knowne. They increased much in <hi>Germany</hi> after <hi>Martin Luthers</hi> time; and in many things disagree from his doctrine: they were seditiously amplified by <hi>Iohannes Iacobus Andreas,</hi> who was a man of a furious and turbulent spirit, and called himselfe the <hi>Pope</hi> of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> which <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther</hi> himselfe never did. Why <hi>Arminius</hi> should be intituled to this, I know no other reason, but the common course that hath intituled Heretickes to those heresies, which either they haue invented, or maintained and increased. It may be, he aff<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cted that title; sure it is that he increased the heresie, &amp; spread it where it was not before. This is no strange thing in the world, that factious men spreading strange o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, should get titles of that sect which they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: For if our <hi>Author</hi> should proceed farre in this course, which he hath so vnadvisedly begun, he might happily purchase to himselfe a <hi>title</hi> likewise; though thereby he would get no <hi>glory.</hi>

               <hi>Page</hi> 42. he saith; <hi>Surely those very points</hi> (of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, free-will, finall perseverance) <hi>being scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasticall speculations merely, and as farre from state busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as theory is from practise, are not of themselues, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae natae to breed dangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These words containe two things: First that the doctrines of predestination, free-will, and finall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:24811:58"/>
are <hi>merely scholasticall speculations:</hi> But why any doctrine contained in the holy Scripture should be called a meere scholasticall speculation, is a thing I conceiue not. He must giue a reason that calleth it so. Meere scholasticall speculations may well enough be spared without any losse or hinderance to our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: But will he say that these doctrines of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may so well be spared without any losse or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to our salvation? It would be an hard taske for <hi>Pelagius</hi> himselfe to proue that. Another thing in these words is, that these speculations as he calleth them, are <hi>not to be feared to breed danger.</hi> The Church is quiet, and without danger, vntill some new doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines be broached, and contentions raised about the truth: and then the hearts of many are disclosed, and dangers grow. These things that this <hi>Author</hi> hath moved in our Church, are more apt to breed dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, then any thing that hath beene mooved since the time of <hi>Barret, Baro,</hi> and <hi>Thomson.</hi> A desperate man may set an house on fire, and say there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; yet the danger is not the lesse, but the madnesse of the man is the more, that cryes out there is no danger. The <hi>ignorance</hi> of Gods word, and truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, is able not onely to breed <hi>danger,</hi> but to cause <hi>destructions</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>states.</hi>

            <p>Touching the point of their discipline, I can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:24811:59"/>
that they are weary of it, and would gladly be freed if they could. When wee were to yeeld our consent to the <hi>Belgicke confession</hi> at <hi>Dort,</hi> I made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen protestation in the <hi>Synode,</hi> that whereas in that confession there was inserted a strange conceit of the parity of Ministers to be instituted by Christ; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared our dissent vtterly in that point. I shewed that by Christ a parity was never instituted in the Church: that hee ordayned 12 <hi>Apostles,</hi> and also 70 <hi>Disciples</hi>; that the authority of the 12, was aboue the other: that the Church preserved this order left by our Saviour. And therefore when the <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> authority of the <hi>Apostles</hi> ceased, yet their <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> authority continued in <hi>Byshops,</hi> who succeeded them; who were by the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselues left in the government of the Church to ordaine Ministers, and to see that they, who were so ordeined, should preach no other doctrine. That in an inferior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree the <hi>Ministers</hi> that were governed by <hi>Byshops</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the 70. <hi>Disciples:</hi> That this order hath beene maintained in the Church from the time of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</hi> And herein I appealed to the judgement of Antiquity, and to the judgement of any learned man now living, and craved herein to be satisfied, if any man of learning could speake to the contrary: My <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi> is my witnesse, and so are all the rest of our company, who spake also in the same cause: To this there was no answere made by any. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we conceived that they yeelded to the truth of the protestation. And somewhat I can say of mine owne knowledge: For I had conference with divers of the best learned in that <hi>Synode</hi>; I told them that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:24811:60"/>
the cause of all their troubles was this, that they had not <hi>Byshops</hi> amongst them, who by their authoritie might represse turbulent spirits that broached no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties. Every man had libertie to speake or write what he list; and as long as there were no Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall men in authoritie to represse and censure such contentious spirits, their Church would never be without trouble. Their answere was, that they did much <hi>honour</hi> and reverence the good order and <hi>disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; &amp; with all their hearts would be glad to haue it established amongst them, but that could not be hoped for in their state. Their hope was, that seing they could not doe what they desired; God would be mercifull to them, if they did what they could. This was their answere; which I thinke is enough to excuse them; that they doe not <hi>openly ayme at anarchy and popular confusion.</hi> The truth is, they groane vnder that burthen, and would be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, if they could. This is well knowne to the rest of my Associates there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 58. speaking of the 17. <hi>Article,</hi> he saith: <hi>there is not one word, syllable, or apex touching your absolute, necessary, determined, irresistible, irrespectiue Decree of God to call saue and glorifie S. Peter, for instance, without any consideration had or regard to his faith, obedience, and repentance, and to condemne Iudas as necessarily without any respect had at all to his sinne: this is a private fancy of some particular men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this I haue spoken at large before. I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that these accusations, which he hath here made against the doctrine of predestination, were the accusations of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> against Saint
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:24811:60"/>
               <hi>Augustines</hi> doctrine. Onely here I will answer to a particuler surmise, that may happily fall into the thought of the <hi>Reader,</hi> or of the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale</hi> himselfe. Hee saith here, that these things are not contained in the 17. <hi>Article</hi>: and so after his manner of shifting, he may say, that hee deliuereth not heere his owne opinion, but onely saith that these things are not contained in the <hi>Article.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue this answer, he must remember, that in diuers places through his booke, hee deliuereth the same with confidence, not onely as his owne opinion, but as the doctrine of our Church, as <hi>page</hi> 30. Hee saith (though not truely as hath beene proued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) <hi>That the</hi> 16. <hi>Article was challenged as vnsound; but was there defended, maintained, avowed, auerred, for true, by the greatest Byshops and learnedest of our Diuines, against that absolute, irrespectiue, necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and fatall decree of your new predestination.</hi> In which words he plainely deliuereth his owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and, as hee taketh it, the doctrine of our Church. Thus much I say here to take him from that starting hole, which he might thinke of, to say that in this, as in some other things, hee deliuered not his owne opinion: his opinion is plaine, that he layeth these accusations against predestination, as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 71. he saith. <hi>That Deodate Minister and professor of the Church of Geneua, professed to him his opinion in some points contrary to the conclusions of Dort.</hi>

            <p>All the <hi>English Diuines</hi> which were there do
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:24811:61"/>
verily beleeue this to bee vntrue, because they hold <hi>Deodate</hi> for an honest man. And to put this matter out of doubt, <hi>Deodate</hi> himselfe hath written to a learned and <hi>reuerend Bishop</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing that hee neuer spake any such thing as the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Appeale</hi> imposeth vpon him, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the conclusions of that <hi>Synode.</hi> Hee, that durst deale so with <hi>Deodate,</hi> must needes loose cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in other things.</p>

               <hi>Page</hi> 72. he saith <hi>At the conference of Hampton Court, the Byshop of London Doctor Bancrofte called the doctrine of praedestination a desperate doctrine without any reproofe or taxation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, as the <hi>Byshop</hi> of <hi>London</hi> did then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it a <hi>desperate</hi> doctrine, so do I <hi>call</hi> it. The <hi>Byshop</hi> of <hi>London</hi> had reason, for speaking against a common <hi>abuse</hi> of that doctrine: Our <hi>Author</hi> hath no reason to speake against the <hi>doctrine it selfe.</hi> The <hi>Byshops</hi> words were these (which he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to wrong the <hi>Byshop</hi>) <hi>Many in these times neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting holynesse of life, presume too much of persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in grace, laying all their religion vpon prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination: If I shall bee saued, I shall bee saued:</hi> which hee termeth a desperate doctrine: and who will deny this as the <hi>Byshop</hi> deliuereth it? It was not the <hi>Byshops</hi> meaning to call the doctrine of praedestination, a desperate doctrine, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preacheth it, or as the 17. <hi>Article</hi> deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it. The <hi>Article</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>the godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of praedestination, and our election in Christ is full of sweete, pleasant, and vnspeakable
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:24811:61"/>
comfort to godly persons, and such as feele in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the working of the spirit of Christ, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the workes of the flesh — aswell because it doth greatly establish and confirme their faith of eternall saluation to bee enioyed by Christ, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth feruently kindle their loue towards God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Author</hi> had beene but indifferently affected to the <hi>doctrine</hi> of Praedestination, and to the <hi>Article</hi> that proueth such comfort to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, and receiued by it; Hee would haue said somewhat of this comfort, which the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue from this doctrine: But hee is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to finde nothing in Praedestination but a <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> doctrine. The <hi>Article</hi> saith also; that <hi>for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and carnall men lacking the spirit of God, to haue continually before their eyes the sentence of Gods Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, is a most dangerous downefall.</hi> The Bishop spake of these last words.</p>
            <p>Our learned <hi>Authour,</hi> the determiner of the doctrines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> alloweth that the doctrine Praedestination should bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a desperate doctrine.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:24811:62"/>
               <hi>the doctrine of Praedestination is a desperate doctrine,</hi> without any mention of the abuse of it; which before him, no Diuine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> euer vttered.</p>
