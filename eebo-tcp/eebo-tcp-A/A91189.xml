            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>they gave this as a Character of thoſe</hi> evil Counſellors, <hi>viz.</hi>
Theſe are the men that would perſwade the People, that both
Houſes of Parliament containing all the Peers, and repreſenting
all the Commons of England, would deſtroy the Laws of the
Land, and Liberties of the People: wherein, beſides the trust of
the whole, they themſelves in their own particulars, have ſo
great an intereſt of honour and estate, That we hope it will
gain little credit, with any that have the leaſt uſe of reaſon,
that ſuch as must have ſo great a ſhare in the miſery, ſhould take
ſo much pains in the procuring thereof; and ſpend ſo much time,
and run ſo many hazards to make themſelves ſlaves. <hi>And they
conclude that</hi> Declaration <hi>with theſe words:</hi> We doubt not
but it ſhall in the end appear to all the world, that our endeavours
have been most hearty and ſincere, for the maintenance of the
true Proteſtant Religion, the Kings juſt Prerogatives, the Laws
and Liberties of the Land, and the Privileges of Parliament:
in which endeavours by the grace of God we will ſtill perſiſt, though
we ſhould periſh in the work: which if it ſhould be, it is much
to be feared, that Religion, Laws, Liberties and Parliaments,
would not be long lived after <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</p>

in Parliament, publiſhed a</hi> Declaration <hi>in</hi> Aug. 1642.
<hi>in the preamble whereunto they aſſert;</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Exact Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, p. 491.</note> That a Malignant
party was then in armes against them, to the hazarding of his
Majeſties Perſon, and for the oppreſſion of the true Religion, the
Laws and Liberties of this Kingdom, and the power and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
of Parliament: all which every honeſt man is bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend;
eſpecially thoſe who have taken the late <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> by
which they are more particularly tyed unto it, and the more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
before God ſhould they neglect it. And finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
engaged on a neceſſity to take up armes likewiſe for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of thoſe, which otherwiſe muſt ſuffer and periſh; they did
then think fit, to give that account unto the world, to be a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
unto all men, of the juſtice of their proceedings, and a
warning to the People, to let them ſee the neceſsity and duty
which lay upon them to ſave themſelves, their Religion and
Country. <hi>In the body of the</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Ibid. p. 494.</note> Declaration <hi>they charge the</hi>
Malignant party, <hi>with an</hi> endeavour to poſſeſs the People, that
the Parliament will take away the Law, and introduce an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Government; a thing which every moral man abhors,
much more the wiſedom, juſtice, and piety of the two Houſes of
Parliament; and in truth ſuch a charge, as no rational man
can believe it, it being impoſſible ſo many ſeveral perſons, as the
Houſes of Parliament conſist of, about<note n="*" place="margin">Nota.</note> 600. and in either
Houſe all of equal power, ſhould all of them, or at least the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor

Arbitrary Government; and moſt improbable, that the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and chief Gentry of this Kingdom, ſhould conſpire to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Law, by which they enjoy their Eſtates, are protected
from any Act of violence and power, and differenced from the
meaner ſort of people, with whom otherwiſe they would be but
fellow-ſervants. <hi>They then further charge the ſaid</hi> malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
party<note n="f" place="margin">Exact Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, p. 494, 496.</note> 
               <hi>to have</hi> combined to bury the happineſs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
in the ruine of the Parliament, and by forcing it, to cut up
the freedom of Parliament by the root, and either take all Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
away, or which is worſe, make them the inſtruments of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168767:4"/>
Slavery to confirm it by Law, and leave the diſeaſe incurable:
With compelling the <hi>trained Bands</hi> by force, to come in and joyn
with them, or diſarming them, and putting their arms into
the hands of lewd and deſperate perſons, thereby turning the
Arms of the Kingdom againſt it ſelf; And with an intention to
deſtroy the Parliament, and be Maſters of our Religion and
Liberties, to make us ſlaves, and alter the Government of this
Kingdom, and reduce it to the condition of ſome other Countries,
which are not governed by Parliaments, and ſo by Laws. <hi>And
upon theſe grounds they conclude that</hi> Declaration <hi>in
theſe words.</hi>
               <note n="g" place="margin">Exact Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. p. 497.</note> Therefore we the Lords and Commons are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,

arms, and declared the cauſe thereof, no ſucceſſe made
them in the leaſt to vary from it; but in the very heat of
the war, and whole proſecution thereof to the end, they
aſſerted and adhered to the ſame cauſe, as appears in all

               <p>WHereas, both Houſes of Parliament have agreed
upon <hi>A Perſonal Treaty with his Majeſtie,</hi>
which is ſpeedily to commence, for the management
whereof, <hi>the</hi>

                  <hi>attendance of all the Members of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wil be very neceſſary, becauſe in the Multitude
of Counſellors there is ſafety,</hi> and in the ſucceſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the Alaying of the preſent diſtempers, and future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
of this Kingdom, is ſo highly concerned; It is
therefore ordered and declared by the Commons aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in Parliament, that the reſpective Sheriffs of each
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168767:8"/>
County, within the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion
of <hi>Wales,</hi> do forthwith upon receipt hereof, <hi>give particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
notice to all the Members of the Houſe of Commons,
reſiding and being within their reſpective Counties, to
attend the Houſe on Tueſday the 26th. Septemb under
the penalty of twenty pounds, fixed upon the defaultors;</hi>
that day being appointed for calling of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Members attended from all parts accordingly, and
there were appointed the Earls of <hi>Northumberland, Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,
Salisbury, Middleſex,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> for the
Lords Houſe; And Mr. <hi>William Pierpoint,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi>
Junior, and eight more of the Houſe of Commons, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
to carry on the <hi>Treaty</hi> with his Majeſtie, at the
Iſle of <hi>Wight;</hi> who took great pains therein, and finiſhed
the Treaty by the end of <hi>November.</hi> And on <hi>December</hi> the
firſt, the Commiſſioners of the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> made
their report of the <hi>Treaty</hi> in the Houſe; who preſently
entred into debate thereof, and continued the debate,

                  <hi>Friday</hi> the 15th. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> A Committee was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

that all Perſons, that have had any hand in, or given conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>But as no Member was charged with, or convicted in
particular of having any hand in the ſaid paper, ſo it doth
not appear by any entry in the <hi>Journal Book</hi> of the Houſe,
that any <hi>Member was put to ſuch diſavowal or diſclamor,</hi>
which if they had, there is no doubt they would generally
and freely have made it.</p>

                  <hi>Monday</hi> the 18th. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1648. Before any Return

the Members from comming to the Houſe, in
complyance with the ſaid Propoſals of the Army,</p>
               <p>They reſolved upon the Queſtion, that this Houſe do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
That liberty be given to the Members of this Houſe to

1648.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the ſame day they ordered,</hi> That it be referred to
the former Committee for drawing an Atteſtation, to bring in
a Declaration, how and in what manner and form the ſaid

Houſe declined their Privileges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wedneſday, Decemb. 20. 1648. <hi>The Houſe again deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Queſtion,</hi> Whether the former meſſage to the General
be renewed by the ſame Committee, concerning the Members
that are abſent; <hi>and it was carryed in the</hi> Affirmative <hi>by</hi>
32. <hi>againſt</hi> 19. <hi>So at that time there were but</hi> 19. <hi>in the

               <p>The Committee being ſome of the moſt eminent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
to the Vote when it was paſt, and ſo not very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to receive ſatisfaction from thoſe Members in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the Order, there are very few appearing in the
<hi>Journal</hi> to have been admitted upon their Reports into
the Houſe in three months after, but as if too many had
been received already, they intended a New Teſt and
Purge to feclude the Majority even of thoſe who <hi>diſſented</hi>
from or <hi>diſapproved</hi> our former Vote; For their <hi>Journal</hi>
atteſts, that on <hi>Saturday,</hi> June 9th. 1649. <hi>This Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was propounded: That none of the Members that have ſate

an High Court of Juſtice for trying &amp; judging the King.</hi>

               <p>And the <hi>Question</hi> being put, whether this <hi>Queſtion be
now put,</hi> the Houſe <hi>was divided.</hi> And it was carried in
the <hi>Negative</hi> by 27. againſt 22. <hi>that this Queſtion ſhould not

in their rooms.</p>
               <p>After this Order, though they ſate till <hi>April</hi> 20. 1653.
without itterruption, yet they never iſſued out any Writs

               <p>April 20. 1653. they were forcibly ejected, and turned
