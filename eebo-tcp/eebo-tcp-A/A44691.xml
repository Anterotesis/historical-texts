            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Honourable JOHN, Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> Baron of <hi>Ophalia,</hi> First of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Little thought, when, in so private a way, I lately offered much of the following Discourse to <hi>your Lordship's ear;</hi> I should receive the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand (which I am not now, so <hi>far</hi> as it proves
<pb facs="tcp:31704:5"/>
to me <hi>a possible one</hi> to <hi>disobey,</hi> or <hi>further</hi> to <hi>dispute</hi>) of exposing it <hi>thus</hi> to the <hi>view</hi> of the world, or so much as to present it to your <hi>Lordship's own eye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was indeed, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> to me to give an <hi>exact account</hi> of what was then discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, from <hi>a memory</hi> that was so treacherous, as to let slip many things, <hi>that</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and <hi>intended</hi> to <hi>have been said that
<pb facs="tcp:31704:5"/>
day;</hi> and that could <hi>much less</hi> (being assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but by very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect memorials) recollect <hi>every thing</hi> that <hi>was said,</hi> several daies after.</p>
            <p>Yet I account, upon the whole it is much more varied by <hi>enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> than by <hi>diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Whereby, I hope, it will be nothing less capable of serving the end of this <hi>enjoyned</hi> publication of it.</p>
            <p>And I cannot doubt but the <hi>injunction</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb facs="tcp:31704:6"/>
from the <hi>same pious gratitude</hi> to the <hi>God of your life,</hi> which hath prompted, for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years past, to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of that dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Annual Solemnity, <hi>in memory</hi> of your great preservation from so <hi>near a death.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>By a fall from an Horse.</hi> Decemb. <hi>5. 1674.</hi>
               </note> That the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of <hi>so great a mercy,</hi> might be the more <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprest</hi> with <hi>your self,</hi> and <hi>improved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so (so far as this means
<pb facs="tcp:31704:6"/>
could signify for that purpose)</hi> to the instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>many others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Lordship</hi> was pleased to allow <hi>an hour</hi> to the hearing of <hi>that Discourse,</hi> What was, proposed to you <hi>in it,</hi> is to be the <hi>business of your life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what is to be <hi>done continually</hi> is <hi>once</hi> to be <hi>throughly done.</hi> The impression ought to be very <hi>inward,</hi> and <hi>strong,</hi> which must be so <hi>lasting</hi> as to govern
<pb facs="tcp:31704:7"/>
a man's life. And were it as fully done as <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> can admit, it needs be more solemnly renewed at <hi>set times for that purpose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed that <hi>such a day</hi> should not pass you <hi>without a fall,</hi> nor <hi>that fall</hi> be without <hi>an hurt,</hi> and that <hi>hurt</hi> proceed unto a <hi>wound,</hi> and that <hi>wound not be mortal,</hi> but even <hi>next to</hi> it, looks like an <hi>artifice</hi> and <hi>contrivance</hi> of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> to shew you how
<pb facs="tcp:31704:7"/>
               <hi>near it could go</hi> without cutting <hi>thorough</hi> that slender <hi>thred of life,</hi> that it might indear to you its <hi>accurate super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency</hi> over your life, that there might <hi>here</hi> be a <hi>remarkable juncture</hi> in <hi>that thred,</hi> and that whensoever <hi>such a day</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve in the <hi>circle</hi> of <hi>your year,</hi> it might come again, and again, <hi>with a note upon it,</hi> under your eye, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ever to you as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:31704:8"/>
               <hi>Birth-day;</hi> or as an <hi>earlier</hi> day of <hi>resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon, <hi>my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Lord,</hi> the <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther design</hi> of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is to be <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly studied,</hi> and pondered deeply. For it shews it self to be, at once, both <hi>mercifull,</hi> and <hi>wise,</hi> and as upon the <hi>one account</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to it to <hi>design kindly</hi> to you, so <hi>upon the other,</hi> to <hi>form its design aptly,</hi> and so as
<pb facs="tcp:31704:8"/>
that its <hi>means,</hi> and <hi>method</hi> might fitly both <hi>serve,</hi> and <hi>signify</hi> its <hi>end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If, therefore, your <hi>Lordship</hi> shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't to reckon the <hi>counsel acceptable,</hi> which hath been given you, <hi>upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and to think the <hi>offering your self to God, a living Sacrifice,</hi> under the endearing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of <hi>so great a mercy</hi> is, indeed, <hi>a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable service.</hi> Your
<pb facs="tcp:31704:9"/>
life by that dedication acquires a sacredness, becomes an holy, divine life. And so by one, and the same means, is not onely renewed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed in the <hi>same kind</hi> of <hi>natural life,</hi> but is also <hi>heightned</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi> to a <hi>nobler,</hi> and far <hi>more excellent kind.</hi> And thus, out of that <hi>umbrage</hi> onely and shadow of death, which sat upon <hi>one day</hi> of your time springs a <hi>double birth,</hi> and <hi>resurrection</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:31704:9"/>
to you. Whereby (as our Apostle speaks in another place of this Epistle) you come to <hi>yield your self to God as one alive from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So your <hi>New year</hi> (which shortly after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins) will alwaies be to you a <hi>fresh setting forth</hi> in that <hi>new,</hi> and <hi>holy course of life,</hi> which shall at length (and God grant it to be, after the revolution of <hi>many fruitfull years,</hi> wherein you may continue a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

blessing</hi> in this wretched world) <hi>end,</hi> and be perfected <hi>in a state of life not measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by time,</hi> wherein you are to be <hi>ever with the Lord.</hi>

            <p>Our business therefore must be to shew the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this Exhortation. In the doing whereof, we shall

               <hi>Reasonable service</hi>] or <hi>worship,</hi> as the word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.

You are so to make a tender of your selves as if you would say, <q>Lord, here I am, wholly thine.

            <p n="2">2. In the next place (with less regard to the allusive terms) we come more distinctly to open, and explain.

And there is a special no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to be taken therein of the word [first] which puts a remarkableness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that passage. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle is commending their liberal Charity towards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31704:17"/>
necessitous Christians. And shews how their <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> was begun in <hi>Piety.</hi> They did not onely, most freely <hi>give away their substance,</hi> for the relief of such as were in want, but <hi>first</hi> they <hi>gave their own selves to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that we may not misconceive the <hi>nature of this act,</hi> of <hi>giving our selves,</hi> we must know, it is not <hi>donation,</hi> in the strict, and proper sense; such as <hi>confers a right</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Donee,</hi> or to him to whom a thing is said to be given. We cannot be said to <hi>collate,</hi> or <hi>transfer a right</hi> to him, who is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31704:18"/>
               <hi>Dominus absolutus</hi>; The onely Proprietor and Supreme Lord of all.

and partly improved by it, nor can therefore be sever'd from it.</p>
            <p>In the present case it is especially necessary we <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly</hi> know, and <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend</hi> the state of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us.

That so this may be our sense in our return, <q>
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> I have here brought thee back a

            <p n="2">2.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consideration</hi> is nothing else but the <hi>revolving of what we knew before.</hi> The actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31704:20"/>
the habitual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we had of things. A more distinct reveiwing of our former notices belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any case, a recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and gathering them up, a comparing them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; And, for such as appear more momentous, a repeating, and inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them upon our selves, that we may be urg'd on to suitable action. And this, though <hi>of it self,</hi> without the power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the <hi>divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> is not <hi>sufficient,</hi> yet being the means he works by, is <hi>most necessary</hi> to our <hi>becoming Christians, i. e.</hi> if we speak of becoming so,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31704:21"/>
not <hi>by fate,</hi> or <hi>by chance,</hi> as too many onely are, but by our own <hi>choice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</hi> Which is the same thing with <hi>dedicating our selves to God thorough Christ,</hi> whereof we are discoursing. For upon our having thus considered and comprehended the whole compass of the case in our thoughts, either the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our hearts would be such that we would, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, dedicate our selves, or we would not; If we would, it is because we should judge the <hi>arguments for it</hi> more weighty than the <hi>objections,</hi> which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such pondering of both,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31704:21"/>
we are not likely to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and so, for want of this <hi>consideration,</hi> are never likely to become <hi>Christians at all.</hi> Or, if we would not, it is because to the more carnal temper of our hearts the <hi>objections</hi> would outweigh. And then, if we do seem to consent, it is because <hi>what is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected</hi> came not in view. And so we should be <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to no purpose.</hi> Our contract with the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were void in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, we should onely seem pleased with the terms of Christianity, because we have not digested them in our thoughts. So our act
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31704:22"/>
undoes it self in the very doing. It carries an <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, virtual repentance</hi> in it, of what is done. We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our selves Christians, upon surprize, or mistake. And if we had considered what we are, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to doe, what to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, what to forego, what to endure, would not have done it. And therefore when we do come di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly to apprehend all this, are like <hi>actually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> and revolt. As they <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. who while they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not what it was to be a Christian, seem'd very forward followers of <hi>Christ.</hi> But when they did
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31704:22"/>
more fully understand it, upon his telling them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>went back and walked no more with him.</hi>
               <q>And he lets them go <hi>(q. d.)</hi> mend your selves if you can, see where you can get you a better Master.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. With <hi>a determinate judgment,</hi> at length, that <hi>this ought to be done.</hi> There are two extremes in this matter. <hi>Some</hi> will <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider at all,</hi> and <hi>so</hi> not doe this thing; and <hi>some</hi> will <hi>consider always,</hi> and <hi>so,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doe it. Stand, <hi>shall I? shall I?</hi> halt between two Opinions. These are both of them very vicious and faulty extremes in reference
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:31704:23"/>
to the management even of secular affairs, both of them contrary to that prudence which should govern our actions, <hi>i. e.</hi> when men will never consider what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be done, and so neglect their most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant concernments; or, when they will never have done considering, which is the same thing as if they had never taken up any thought of the matter at all. Indeed, in the present case 'tis a reproach to the blessed God to consider longer than till we have well digested the state of the case. As if it were a difficulty to determine the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:31704:23"/>
matter, between him and the Devil, which were the better, or more rightfull Lord! We must at last be at a point, and come to a judicious determination of the question. As those sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely resolved Christians had done, <hi>John.</hi> 6.68, 69. who also express the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that had (before that time no doubt) determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them. <hi>Lord, whither shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe, and are sure, that thou art that Christ, the son of the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. With <hi>liberty of spirit,</hi> having thrown off all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bonds, and quite disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31704:24"/>
given the matter is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. In the present case of yeilding our selves to God, the question cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any previous tye <hi>in point of right,</hi> or that could urge Conscience. There cannot be so much as a plausible pretender, against him. But there must be a <hi>liberty,</hi> in opposition to <hi>preingaged inclinations, and affections.</hi> And this must be the sense of the sincere Soul in treating the matter of its <hi>self-surrender,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, with the great God, to be able to say to the question, <hi>Art thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no former contrary bonds?</hi>
               <q>Lord, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31704:25"/>
none, I know, that <hi>ought</hi> to bind me, or <hi>that justly can,</hi> against thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sovereign right. I had indeed suffered other bonds to take place in my heart, and the affections of my Soul, but they were <hi>bonds of iniquity,</hi> which I scruple not to break, and repent that ever I made. I took my self indeed to be my own, and have liv'd to my self, onely pleas'd and serv'd and sought my self, as if I were created and born for no other purpose, and if the sense of my heart had been put into words, there was insolence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:31704:25"/>
to have conceiv'd such as these; not <hi>my tongue</hi> onely, but my whole man, body and soul, all my parts and powers, my estate and name, and strength, and time, <hi>are all my own; who is Lord over me?</hi> And while I pleas'd my self with such an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned liberty, and self-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, no Idol was too despicable to command my homage. I have done worse than prostrated my body to a stock, my soul hath humbled it self, and bow'd down to a clod of clay. My thoughts, and desires, and hopes, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31704:26"/>
joys have all stoopt to so mean trifles, as wealth, or ease, or pleasure, or fame, all but so many fragments of earth, or (the less-consistent) va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours sprung from it. And whereas this world is nothing else but a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of lusts, none of them was too base to rule me. And while I thought my self at liberty <hi>I have been a servant to corruption.</hi> But now, Lord, I have, through thy mercy learnt to abandon and abhor my self. Thy <hi>grace appearing hath taught me to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts.</hi> Thou hast over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:31704:26"/>
enjoy thine own conquest. I am griev'd for it, and repent from my soul that ever I did put thee to contend for, and conquer thine own.</q>
And so doth this <hi>Self-dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> carry in it <hi>repentance from dead works and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</hi>

               <hi>viz. in a resolved wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness,</hi> to yeild my self, as God's own property, to be <hi>for him, and not for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Which <hi>resolvedness of will,</hi> though it may, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral respects, admit of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral names, or be clothed with distinct notions, is but one and the same <hi>substantial act.</hi> It may be called, in <hi>respect of the competition</hi> which there was in the case, <hi>choice.</hi> Or in respect of the <hi>proposal</hi> made to me of such a thing to be done, <hi>consent.</hi> But these are, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from these refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, the <hi>same act,</hi> which, in it self considered, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>resolute volition. I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:31704:27"/>
will be the Lords.</hi> Which resolution, if one do (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>mentally</hi> or <hi>vocally</hi>) direct to God or <hi>Christ,</hi> then it puts on the nature of a <hi>vow</hi>; and so it fitly called <hi>devoting oneself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It carries in it, as a thing supposed, the implanted di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life and nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are truly said to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our selves living Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> as in the Text, or as it is exprest in that other place, chap. 6.13. <hi>to yeild our selves to God as those that are alive from the dead.</hi> (as vers. 11.) <hi>alive to God thorough Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus our Lord.</hi> Which life is not to be understood
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:31704:28"/>
               <hi>simply,</hi> but <hi>in a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.</hi> For <hi>before,</hi> we were not dead <hi>simply,</hi> we were not dead, disinclin'd, or disaffected to <hi>every thing,</hi> but peculiarly <hi>towards God and his Christ. That way</hi> we were without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, motion, tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or disposition. And so were dead <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> as to this thing, or in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. Were <hi>alienated from the life of God.</hi> Now we come to live <hi>this life,</hi> and are made by his grace to incline and move <hi>towards him,</hi> of our own accord. <hi>Dead things</hi> (or destitute of life) may be moved by another, are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31704:28"/>
mov'd <hi>violently,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or against inclination, hither, or thither. But a <hi>living creature</hi> can sponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neously <hi>move it self,</hi> as, of its own accord, it inclines.</p>
            <p>And whereas there are two more-noble principles, that belong to this <hi>divine life</hi> and <hi>nature, Faith</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> (A great and noted pair as may be seen in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi>) These have <hi>both,</hi> an ingrediency into this <hi>Self-dedication.</hi> The nature of each of them runs into it, and may be perceived in it. And it is hereupon a <hi>mixt act,</hi> partaking an influence, and tincture (as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31704:29"/>
it were) from the one and the other of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> respects the <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> of God, and what we are, thereupon, to expect from him. And so <hi>our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating our selves,</hi> to God, is a <hi>self-committing.</hi> We give up our selves to him as a trust, as the Apostles em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical expression inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. <hi>I know whom I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.12.</note> 
               <hi>and I am perswaded that he will keep that which I have committed unto him</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31704:29"/>
safe another way. As once a people, not able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain tutelage on other terms, surrender'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to them whose help they sought, with some such expression, <hi>Si non no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stros, saltem vestros.</hi> If not <hi>as ours,</hi> yet at least <hi>as your own,</hi> save, protect, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us. Nor, in our <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring our selves</hi> to God, is this any way unsuitable, either <hi>to us,</hi> or <hi>to him.</hi> Not <hi>to us</hi>; for we are <hi>really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed,</hi> ready to perish; 'tis agreeable to the state of our case. Not <hi>to him</hi>; for it is <hi>glorious to him.</hi> A thing <hi>worthy of God</hi> to be a refuge, and sanctuary to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31704:30"/>
perishing Souls; and is thereupon a <hi>pleasant thing,</hi> a <hi>Godlike pleasure,</hi> suitable to a <hi>self-sufficient,</hi> and <hi>all-sufficient</hi> being, who hath enough <hi>for himself,</hi> and <hi>for all others,</hi> whom he shall have taught not to <hi>despise the riches of his goodness. He taketh pleasure in them that fear him, and them that hope in his mercy,</hi> Psal. 147.11. <hi>He waits that he may be gracious, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in shewing mercy,</hi> Isa. 30.18. He lifts up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self when he does it, and waits that he may; expects the opportunity, seeks out meet and suitable objects (as with thirst and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31704:30"/>
an enterprising, vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant man is wont to doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, for none were ever so intent to destroy, as he is to save) yea, <hi>makes them,</hi> prepares them for his purpose. Which he doth not, and needs not doe, <hi>in point of misery,</hi> so they can enough prepare themselves; But in <hi>point of humility,</hi> sense of their necessity and unworthiness, great need, and no desert, nor disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to supplicate.</p>
            <p>These are needfull prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, make it <hi>decorous,</hi> and <hi>comely</hi> to him to shew mercy. A God <hi>is to be sought,</hi> with humble, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate veneration. And such
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31704:31"/>
an opportunity <hi>he waits for</hi>· 'Tis not fit for him, not <hi>great,</hi> not <hi>majestick,</hi> to throw away his mercies, upon insolent, and insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wretches. For, as there it follows, <hi>he is the God of iudgment,</hi> a most accurate, judicious <hi>wisedom,</hi> and <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> conducts and guides all the emanations of his flowing goodness. The part of which wisedom and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to nick the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to take the fit sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, when mercy will be most fitly plac't, best attain its end, relish best, be most <hi>acceptable</hi> to them that shall <hi>receive</hi> it, and <hi>honourable</hi> to him that <hi>shews</hi> it. And
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31704:31"/>
therefore (as is added) <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are they that wait for him,</hi> that labour to be in a posture to meet him, on his own terms, and in his own way.</p>
            <p>Let such as have a mind to surrender and yield themselves to him consider this. Apprehend you have undone your selves and are lost. Fall before him. Lie at the footstool of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-seat. Willingly <hi>put your mouths in the dust, if so be there may be hope.</hi> And there is hope. He seeks after you, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject what he seeks, he one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waited to bring you to this. 'Tis now a <hi>fit time</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:31704:32"/>
for him, and a <hi>good time</hi> for you. And you may now, in resigning, intrust your selves, also, to him. For his express promise is your sufficient ground for it. <hi>I will receive you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the matter aright; your presenting, and yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your selves to him is not to be a <hi>desperate act.</hi> 'Tis not casting your selves away. You are not throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your self into flames, but upon tender mercies, <hi>thither</hi> you <hi>may commit</hi> your self. The thing that <hi>is pleasing to him,</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31704:32"/>
which he invites you to (as he invites all the ends of the earth to look to him that they may be saved) cannot be <hi>unsafe,</hi> or <hi>unhappy to you.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Love</hi> hath a great ingrediency into this self-resignation. And <hi>as it hath,</hi> so it more admits to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>dedicating,</hi> or <hi>devoting our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This holy, ingenuous principle respects more the <hi>commands of God,</hi> as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth <hi>his promises,</hi> and eyes <hi>his interest,</hi> as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth <hi>our own. This</hi> dedition of our selves, <hi>as it is influenc't by it,</hi> designs the doeing all for him we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:31704:33"/>
can, as, <hi>by the other</hi> it doth the receiving all. As by the other, we resign our selves to him for <hi>safety</hi> and <hi>felicity</hi>; so we do, by this for <hi>service</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> to our uttermost. And an ardent lover of God thinks this a little oblation. My self? Alas! What am I? too small a thing for him, who is <hi>all love,</hi> and who, though he hath it in hand to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and turn me into <hi>love</hi> too, such as so drossy, and limited a thing was capable of being made. How mean yet, and little is the subject he hath to work upon! an atom of dust! not combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible, or apt to be wrought
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31704:33"/>
upon to this (to a divine and heavenly love) by any, but his, flame. And now therefore but a minute spark from the element of love, that must, however, thus transform'd, tend towards its own original <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Which will refine onely, not consume it. Though, that it may be offerd up in <hi>other flames,</hi> is <hi>not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi>; nor will it be much regretted by you; if the case should so require, nor shall be despised by him, if
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31704:34"/>
he shall so state the case. To <hi>give the body to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> without <hi>love,</hi> goes for nothing. But if, <hi>in that way,</hi> we were called to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up <hi>our bodies, living sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to God,</hi> it would (in an inferiour sense) be an <hi>offering of a sweet smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling savour,</hi> would even perfume Heaven, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse fragrant odours on earth. Nor would be grudg'd at by <hi>that love</hi> that first made our <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the whole of our selves, an offering to God. And whose property it is to be all things, to doe all things, to bear all things, to endure all things for him, whose we
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31704:34"/>
wholly are. So that if he design any of us to be an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> too, an whole burnt offering, and will have us to <hi>glorify him in the fire,</hi> Love will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract its vow. But say, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>our great patern, Not my will but thine be done:</hi> And as he, in his peculiar case, and design (not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable with us, though the temper of spirit should be) <hi>Lo I come to doe thy will, O God.</hi> A <hi>body hast thou</hi> (it now appears for this very purpose) <hi>prepared for me.</hi> He <hi>loved us,</hi> and <hi>gave himself for us.</hi> So are we, from <hi>our love of him,</hi> to <hi>give our selves</hi> for him,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31704:35"/>
and his use and service, in whatsoever kind he shall appoint and prescribe. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Cristian is, in the preparation of his mind, a Martyr. But they are few whom he actually calls to it. Our <hi>love</hi> is ordinarily to shew it self in our <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his commandments.</hi> And, with that design, we are to <hi>present our selves</hi> to him, as the <hi>resolved, ready instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of his service and praise. As <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yeild ye your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as instruments of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness unto sin: but yield your selves unto God as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as

instruments of righteousness unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having been more large upon what was more essential, in this dedication of our selves, I shall be breifer in most of the other things belonging to it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It must, further, be done <hi>with a concomitant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of God.</hi> His <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> (which is now enter'd) is oftentimes summ'd up, <hi>I will be your God, and you shall be my people.</hi> And is resembled, and frequently represented by the <hi>nuptial contract,</hi> In which there is <hi>mutual giving, and taking.</hi> We are to resign, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept at the same time.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31704:36"/>
take him to be our God, when we yeild our selves to be his.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>With an explicite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Lord Christ.</hi> We are to dedicate our selves, after the tenour of a Covenant whereof <hi>he is the Mediatour.</hi> God doth not, upon other terms, treat with Sinners. You are not to offer at such a thing as dedicating your selves to him, but in the way, and upon the terms, upon which you are to be accepted. The divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is declared and known, how <hi>great a one,</hi> he must be in all the transactions of God, with men; yea, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31704:36"/>
towards the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8, 9.10. <hi>He hath made us accepted in the beloved. In whom we have redemption through his bloud, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace. Wherein he hath abounded towards us in all wisedom and prudence. Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his good pleasure, which he had purposed in himself. That in the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the fulness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</hi> We must take heed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:31704:37"/>
how we neglect, or over look him, who is by divine appointment so high in power, and with whom we have so great a concern.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>With deep humility,</hi> and <hi>abasement of our selves,</hi> in conjunction with a <hi>profound reverence</hi> and <hi>veneration</hi> of the divine Majesty. There ought to be the lowliest self-abasement, such as that good man expresses, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6. (varied to ones own case) <hi>O my God, I am ashamed, and blush to lift up my face, to thee, my God: for mine iniquities are increased over mine head, and my trespass is grown up unto the heavens.</hi> And indeed this is naturally
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:31704:37"/>
consequent, upon what was last said, of the regard that ought to be had, in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the <hi>Mediatour.</hi> For surely <hi>that very constitution,</hi> is, in it self, an <hi>humbling</hi> thing to us. And we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apply our selves to God <hi>suitably to it,</hi> but with a self-abasing sense of our own state and case. Our <hi>coming,</hi> and <hi>tendring</hi> our selves <hi>to God, in a Mediatour,</hi> is, in its very nature, an <hi>humiliation</hi>; and carries with it a tacit confession that <hi>in our selves</hi> we have nothing, deserve nothing, are nothing, are worse than nothing. And that onely this constitution of his could justify our offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31704:38"/>
our selves to him, <hi>with any hope of acceptance.</hi> Or make it less than an insolent presumption, for <hi>Sinners</hi> to approach him and expect to be received into his <hi>presence,</hi> and <hi>service.</hi> It is not for <hi>such as we,</hi> to behave our selves towards him, as if we either had not offended, or were capable of expiating our own offence. Yea, and if there had been nothing of delinquency in the case, yet great humility becomes such applications to him. And <hi>that</hi> in conjunction with the <hi>profoundest reverence and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of him.</hi> For our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry business in this <hi>Self-dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is <hi>worship</hi> (as the word
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:31704:38"/>
in the Text hath been noted to signify.) And it is the <hi>first</hi> and most principal part of all the worship we owe to him, (as was noted from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5.) fundamental to all the rest. We must have before our eyes the <hi>awfull Majesty</hi> and <hi>glorious greatness of God.</hi> Which Scripture often speaks of, as <hi>one notion</hi> of his <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and which we are to have principal reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in all the solemn homage we pay to him; as <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are well observed to have been offered to him <hi>so considered.</hi>

The self-devoting person should be able to utter this as his sense, <q>Glad am I, that I am any thing, that I have a being, a Soul, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable intelligent being, capable of becoming a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to him.</q>
And that there is hope of being acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted; How great a Joy is that!

They have the <hi>use</hi> of what his providence allots them; He reserves to himself the <hi>property</hi>; and <hi>limits</hi> the <hi>use so far,</hi> as that all are to be accountable to him for all they possess. And are to use nothing they have, but as under him, and for him, as also they are to do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Therefore as they are required to glorifie him with their <hi>bodies, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which are his,</hi> so they are to <hi>honour him with their substance,</hi> upon the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. But few effectually apprehend his right in their persons; Which, as we are therefore to recognize, in this Dedication of our selves
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:31704:43"/>
to him; So we are, <hi>in a like general sense,</hi> to devote to him all that we enjoy in the world. That is, as all are not to devote themselves <hi>specially to serve him in a sacred office</hi>; But all are obliged to devote themselves to his service <hi>in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:</hi> So, though all are not required to devote their estates, to <hi>this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular pious use,</hi> they are obliged to use them wholly <hi>for his glory, in the general,</hi> and for the service of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the world. We are obliged neither to withhold from him, nor mispend, these his mercies; but must <hi>live righteously</hi> (wherein
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:31704:43"/>
               <hi>Charity</hi> is comprehended) <hi>soberly</hi> and <hi>godly</hi> in it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline no opportunities that shall occur to us, (within the compass of our own sphere, and station) of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him (though never so costly, and hazardous) ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, must forsake all and follow him, when our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and our continued pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of this worlds goods, come to be inconsistent; must submit patiently to our lot, when that falls out to be our case; Or to any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence by which we are bereaved of our worldly comforts, with that temper of mind, as to be able chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to say, <hi>The Lord hath

given, the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is indeed the greatest absurdity imaginable, that they who are not <hi>Masters of themselves</hi> should think it permitted them, to use what comes to their hands, <hi>as they list</hi>; for the service of their own lusts, and the gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a rebel flesh, that hath rejected the Government of their own Reason, and of all divine laws at once. Or that <hi>he</hi> who hath so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute a <hi>right in them,</hi> should not have <hi>that right in what he hath committed to them,</hi> as to prescribe rules to them, by which to use and imploy
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:31704:44"/>
it. At the same time, and in the same sense, wherein we make <hi>a Dedition</hi> of our selves; We do the same thing as to all that we have. Even according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, humane estimate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what interest men have in others, or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over them they have a correspondent interest in what they possess. They that <hi>absolutely surrender themselves</hi> to the power of another, leave not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves capable of proper do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion as to any thing. Therefore says the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> Non licet <hi>Dedititiis testamenta facere.</hi> They were so under several notions 'tis
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:31704:45"/>
true, but they that were strictly so, <hi>had not power to make a will</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to dispose of. No man has certainly a power to dispose of any thing (and when they surrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by their own act and deed to God, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge so much) otherwise than as <hi>divine rules direct,</hi> or <hi>permit.</hi> They have a right in what is <hi>duly theirs,</hi> against the <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim of man,</hi> but none, sure, against the <hi>claim,</hi> and all disposing power of God, whether signifi'd by his Law, or by his Providence. Therefore with this temper of mind should this <hi>Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:31704:45"/>
be made.
<q>Lord I here lay my self, and all that belongs to me, most entirely at thy feet. <hi>All things are of thee</hi> (as they are brought in saying who make that willing joyfull offering, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.) What I have in the world is more <hi>thine,</hi> than <hi>mine.</hi> I desire neither to <hi>use,</hi> nor <hi>possess</hi> any thing, <hi>but by thy leave,</hi> and <hi>for thy sake.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>With befitting cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantial solemnity, i. e.</hi> it ought to be <hi>direct, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press</hi> and <hi>explicit.</hi> Not to be hudled up in <hi>tacit, mute intimations</hi> only. We should not content our selves that it
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:31704:46"/>
be no more than imply'd, in what we <hi>do otherwise.</hi> And run on with it as a thing that must be <hi>suppos'd,</hi> and <hi>taken for granted,</hi> never <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually performed and done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very true indeed that a <hi>continued, uniform, course</hi> and <hi>series</hi> of agreeable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>an holy life, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> carries a great deal more of significancy with it, than only <hi>having once said,</hi> without this, <hi>conceptis verbis, Lord I will be thine. Practice,</hi> whether it be good, or bad, more fully speaks our sense, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses our hearts, than bare words, spoken <hi>at some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time,</hi> can do. For
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:31704:46"/>
               <hi>they</hi> at the most speak but our <hi>present sense at that time,</hi> and, perhaps, do not alwaies <hi>that</hi>; but a <hi>course of practice</hi> shews the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual posture and steady bent of our spirits.</p>
            <p>Nor do I think that a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal explicit transaction,</hi> in this matter, whether <hi>vocal</hi> or <hi>mental,</hi> with circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial solemnity, is essential to a man's being a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, or an holy man. A fixed inclination and bent of heart towards God, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed (as it will be) with a course of practice beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them that are his, will no doubt conclude a man's state to be safe and good
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31704:47"/>
God-ward. As one may, on the other hand, be the devils servant all his daies, without having made a <hi>formal covenant</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>But yet, though so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit, and solemn a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of this matter be not <hi>essential to our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> (as what is said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long only to the <hi>solemnity</hi> of any thing is therein im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd not to be of the essence of it) yet it may be <hi>a great duty</hi> for all that, and I doubt it not to be so.</p>
            <p>And it may <hi>here</hi> be worth the while, to insist a little; that, if this indeed be <hi>a duty,</hi> it may obtain more
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31704:47"/>
               <hi>in our practice,</hi> than, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it doth. Some, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough meer inanimadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, may not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered it; others that have, may possibly think it <hi>less needfull</hi> because they reckon it was <hi>formerly</hi> done for them. They were born of <hi>Christian parents,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated them to God from their birth; and they were, <hi>with solemnity,</hi> presented to him <hi>in their Baptism.</hi> What need we, then, do <hi>over again,</hi> a thing already done?</p>
            <p>Let us reason this matter therefore a while, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any such allegation, <hi>Our personal dedicating our selves
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:31704:48"/>
to God, in Christ,</hi> be not still reasonable, and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be performed <hi>by our selves also,</hi> as our own so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn act and deed?</p>
            <p>It were, indeed, much to be wisht, that our <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal dedication</hi> to God were more minded, and thought on, than it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is. When, with such sacred solemnity, we were devoted to the <hi>trinune Deity,</hi> and those great and awfull names were named upon us, the name of the <hi>Father,</hi> the name of the <hi>Son,</hi> and the name of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Baptisms are, it is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, too often in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world, turn'd into a <hi>meer
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:31704:48"/>
Pageantry,</hi> and the matter scarce ever thought on more, when the <hi>shew is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> And, very probably, because <hi>this great succedane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duty</hi> is so unpractised among Christians.</p>
            <p>And first, Let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, Are there no like cases? Do we not know that, though all the Infants in a Kingdome, are born Subjects, yet, when they arrive to a certain age, they are obliged, being called, to take the <hi>Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> and each one to come under <hi>personal obligation</hi> to their <hi>Prince</hi>; And do we owe less to the God that made us, and the Lord
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:31704:49"/>
that bought us with his bloud?</p>
            <p>Again, Though all the <hi>sons of Israelites,</hi> were, in their infancy, dedicated to God by the <hi>then appointed rite for that purpose</hi>; Yet how frequent were their <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, personal recognitions</hi> of his Covenant? their <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouching</hi> themselves <hi>to be his people,</hi> as he also <hi>avoucht</hi> himself <hi>to be their God.</hi> Which we see <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. and in many other places.</p>
            <p>'Tis remote from me to intend the pressing of <hi>a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> that contains any <hi>disputable,</hi> or <hi>doubtfull</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; or <hi>any other</hi> than the <hi>substance of our baptismal
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:31704:49"/>
Covenant</hi> it self; consisting of the <hi>known essentials</hi> of our Christianity; all summ'd up <hi>in taking God in Christ for our God,</hi> and <hi>resigning our selves to him to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably his.</hi> No more is meant than, that <hi>this may be done, as our own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable service, and worship</hi>; as <hi>our intelligent, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, judicious act, and choice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And consider further, to this purpose, the <hi>great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the thing</hi> it self, compared with the <hi>lesser concernments,</hi> wherein we use to deal <hi>most explicitly.</hi> Is it fit that a man's <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> should be <hi>less</hi> the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:31704:50"/>
of his solemn choice,</hi> than his inferiour concerns? That when he <hi>chooses</hi> his <hi>dwelling,</hi> his <hi>calling,</hi> his <hi>servant,</hi> or <hi>master,</hi> he should seem <hi>thrown upon his God,</hi> and his <hi>Religion, by chance?</hi> And that <hi>least</hi> should appear of <hi>caution, care</hi> and <hi>punctual dealing,</hi> in our very <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est concernment?</hi> How great a day in a man's life doth he count his <hi>marriage day?</hi> How <hi>accurate</hi> are men wont to be, in all the <hi>preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>previous settlements,</hi> that are to be made in order to it!</p>
            <p>And since the great God is pleased to be so <hi>very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> with us, in <hi>proposing</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:31704:50"/>
the <hi>model,</hi> and <hi>contents</hi> of his <hi>Covenant,</hi> the <hi>promises,</hi> and <hi>precepts,</hi> which make <hi>his part,</hi> and <hi>ours</hi> in it, how <hi>attentive</hi> should we be to his <hi>proposals,</hi> and how <hi>express</hi> in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent? Especially, when we consider his <hi>admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention</hi> in it, that he is pleased (and disdains not) to <hi>capitulate</hi> with the <hi>work of his hands,</hi> to <hi>article</hi> with <hi>dust</hi> and <hi>ashes.</hi> Is it reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>we</hi> should be <hi>slight</hi> and <hi>superficial,</hi> in a Treaty with that <hi>great Lord of heaven and earth</hi>; or scarce ever, <hi>purposely apply</hi> and <hi>set our selves</hi> to mind him in it at all?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:31704:51"/>Moreover it is <hi>your own concernment,</hi> and therefore ought to be transacted <hi>by your self.</hi> So far as there is any <hi>equity</hi> in that <hi>rule, Quod tangit omnes debet ab omnibus tractari, What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all should be transacted by all,</hi> it resolves into <hi>this,</hi> and supposes it. <hi>Quod tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git meipsum debet tractari à meipso. That which concerns my self should be transacted by my self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>your being devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by parents,</hi> no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses from <hi>solemn personal self-devoting,</hi> than their doing <hi>other acts of Religion</hi> for you, excuses you from doing them for your selves.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:31704:51"/>
They have prayed for you, are you therefore never to pray for your selves? They have lamented your sin, are you never therefore to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your own?</p>
            <p>Further <hi>Scripture</hi> warns us not to lay too much stress upon <hi>parental privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> or place too much confidence in it, which it supposes men over apt to doe, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's Seed</hi> may be a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Vipers.</hi> Joh. 8.37.44. <hi>I know you are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's Seed,</hi> yet he finds them <hi>another father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider <hi>moreover,</hi> the <hi>renewing work</hi> of <hi>God's grace</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> upon Soul's, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:31704:52"/>
in sanctifying their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculties,</hi> their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, Consciences, Wills, Affections. And what are these sanctify'd for, but to be used and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised? and to what more noble purpose? If there be that <hi>holy impress</hi> upon the Soul, that inclines all the powers of it <hi>God-ward</hi>; What serves it for, but to prompt, and lead it on to the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent acts? to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and eye God, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a conviction of duty, and, particularly, how I owe <hi>my self</hi> to him, to choose, love, fear, and serve him, and what doth all this import less, than
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:31704:52"/>
an entire <hi>self-resignation</hi> to him? so that the genuine tendency of the <hi>holy new nature</hi> is, <hi>in nothing,</hi> so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly answered, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd as <hi>in this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered that the <hi>faculties</hi> of our <hi>reasonable souls</hi> have a <hi>natural improvement</hi> and perfection, as well as <hi>a gracious.</hi> And <hi>for their highest and noblest acts,</hi> 'tis fit they should be used in their <hi>highest perfection.</hi> 'Tis possible, that in the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> of <hi>religious parents,</hi> there may be some <hi>pious inclinations,</hi> betimes; and <hi>the sooner</hi> they thereupon choose the <hi>God of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:31704:53"/>
the better, i. e.</hi> if you compare <hi>doing it,</hi> and <hi>not doing it,</hi> 'tis better <hi>done,</hi> than <hi>not done.</hi> But because this is a thing that cannot be <hi>too often</hi> done, nor <hi>too well,</hi> The more mature your Understanding is, the better it will be done, the grace of God concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Our Lord himself <hi>increas'd in wisedom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Moreover, let it be seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously thought on (what 'tis dreadfull to think) the occasion you should give, if you decline <hi>this surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring your selves,</hi> to have your <hi>neglect</hi> taken for a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal.</hi> 'Tis impossible, when you once understand the

case, you can be <hi>in an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency</hi> about it. You must either take, or leave.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be deny'd but <hi>personal self-devoting, one way,</hi> or <hi>other (more,</hi> or <hi>less solemn</hi>) is most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesssary to the continuing <hi>serious Christianity</hi> in the world.

whether the Gods which your Fathers serv'd, that were on the other side of the flood, or the Gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.</hi> Taking also their <hi>express answer,</hi> which they give, <hi>vers.</hi> 16, 17, 18.

nor your sins. If you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Lord, and serve strange Gods, then he will turn and doe you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</hi> Vers. 19, 20.

            <p>You should, hereupon, <hi>charge your self with all sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table duty towards him.</hi> For you have given your self to him <hi>to serve him,</hi> that is your very business.
