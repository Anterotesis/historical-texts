            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter a tedious War, <hi>England</hi> enjoying a profound Peace, under the reign of her victorious Monarch, <hi>Edward</hi> the third. <hi>London</hi> her Metropolis (where then reſided the King) ſurfeiting in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Plenty, did allure the young Gentle men to participate of her pleaſures: Theſe, having now no imployment for their ſwords, did betake themſelves to ſuch Recreations as beſt ſuited
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52694:3"/>
with their natures.) Amongſt whom <hi>Lionel Machin</hi> a younger Brother, of a good but a decayed Family, (impoveriſht in the former wars) ſlighting the Vanities and Feaſtings, to which his Companions (who were thereunto addicted) might by their examples invite him, did deport himſelf with a more reſerved behaviour. His Beauty and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, together with the good Fortune, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attended his generous undertakings, rendered him more conſiderable than was uſual for Perſons of his Age and Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Thus generouſly demeaning himſelf, Love inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly crept into his heart for <hi>Arabella Darcy,</hi> a moſt fair and beautiful youn g Lady, the non-paril not onely of the Court, but Kingdome famous for ſuch wonders; he publickly made his addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of love unto, which Paſſion he unadviſedly cheriſhed, without conſidering that his Miſtreſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the prime of yourh and Beauty, Heir to a great Eſtate, and allied to a moſt honourable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, had by theſe motives attracted many Lords and Noble-men to be her Servants: Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Lionels</hi> merit made him more kindly be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Arabella,</hi> than any of his other Rivals, who had ſubmitted themſelves under the Empire of ſo fair and charming a Sovereign.</p>
            <p>But I intend not to write the particular Hiſtory of their Loves; and therefore ſhall omit by what means he at length arrived to ſo much happineſs: Let it ſuffice to know none of the Lords addreſſes were acceptable to <hi>Arabella,</hi> ſhe deſiring nothing more than to make <hi>Lionel</hi> her Huſband. This was not well relliſhed by her Relations, by whom, her
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52694:3"/>
Father and Mother coming to underſtand the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal kindneſs of our Lovers, which they in vain ſaught to obſtruct, they immediately made their complaints to the King, repreſenting what a detriment ſuch a marriage would prove to their Family, they having before concluded a very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious match for their Daughter (which ſhe now refuſed to embrace) and therefore they moſt humbly beſaught his Majeſty to uſe his Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to hinder it. The King thought the beſt means was, that <hi>Lionel,</hi> by his Order, ſhould be arreſted, and that during his impriſonment <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> ſhould be compelled to marry the Nobleman her Parents had before deſigned her. At the ſame time both the one and the other was executed, <hi>Lionel</hi> being ſent to Priſon, and <hi>Arabella,</hi> in ſpight of all her repugnance, forced to take the Lord for her husband: Who preſently after the wedding retlred with his Wife from <hi>London</hi> to his houſe at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> a Sea-port Town ſcituate on the River <hi>Avon,</hi> which joyning with another River called the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,</hi> coming from the Province of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> both together diſemboug themſelves into the Iriſh O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lionel</hi> hears the news of this Marriage with a great deal of Sorrow, and being aſſured, that <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>'s affection toward him was not diminiſhed, he loſt all patience to be detained in Priſon, and therefore imployed his Friends to ſupplicate the King for his liberty, which was not very difficult to obtain, his Majeſty having no farther end in the buſineſs, than to content the Ladies Parents (whoſe marriage being now ſolemnized) and ſhe removed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52694:4"/>
a great way off) he at ſmall entreaty granted <hi>Lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> his liberty. <hi>But as the violence, which others uſe to hinder our deſires, doth rather augment than diminiſh their force.</hi> So <hi>Lionells</hi> paſſion by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment grew ſtronger, revolving in his mind, during his reſtraint, divers wayes how to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of thoſe he thought had done him wrong; and reſolved, being now at liberty, to execute them. For this purpoſe, ſecretly gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſuch of his Friends and Kinſmen in whom he put the moſt conſidence, judging it neceſſary with ſome reaſons to perſwade them to be aſſiſtant to him in his deſigns, he thus expreſſed himſelf.</p>
            <p>You cannot but think, that the reſentment I have for the late affront put upon me is the cauſe of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent convention. And I am perſwaded, if I were ſo baſe a Fellow to forget it, yet you have ſo much honour as not to let me neglect a revenge. The apparent injuſtice done me in forcing the Lady <hi>Arabella</hi> contrary to her inclinations to eſpouſe him, who it at preſent her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, is no doubt a great affliction to her, but more to me, who was and ſtill am her Lover. Revenge and love hurry me on ſtrange undertakings, for I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take her from him, and free my Miſtreſs out of the hands of a man ſhe hates, The action, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, is both bold and dangerous, but I ſhould think my ſelf unworthy of ſuch Friends, if I had not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to attempt it with your aſſiſtance. I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly undertake this concern alone, and not expoſe you, my Friends, to the dangers that attend this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, but I ſhould be unjuſt to you my worthy Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, not to let you participate in the revenge, for though the injury is only done me, yet the affront is put
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52694:4"/>
upon our whole Family. I were therefore much too blame, if I went ſingly to retort abuſes done us all. Were the enterpriſe ſolely on my account, I would not doubt your aid, ſince enemies who openly offend us are more pardonable, than thoſe complemental Friends, who in time of neceſſity refuſe us their help, ſhould therefore any of you abandon me, I have more reaſon to complain of him, than of a profeſſed Enemy. But ſince I doubt not thereof, let us, Dear Friends, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how we may make our affronters ſenſible of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice they have done us.</p>
            <p>This Harangue of <hi>Lionell</hi> produced all the deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed effects in the minds of them who heard it, they unanimouſly promiſing not to leave him, but reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to run his Fortune. Whereupon it was thought neceſſary, they ſhould then part, and take ſeveral Roads to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> there to watch all means, and take neceſſary meaſures to relieve <hi>Arabella.</hi> The vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and commodity of the Sea did ſeem greatly to facilitate their enterpriſe. <hi>France</hi> being pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a commodious retreat, the great antipathy between that Crown and <hi>England,</hi> promiſing them all the ſecurity they could deſire. They did not queſtion good ſucceſs, it depending on their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, which were highly excited by divers hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ique actions, which had been gloriouſly atchieved when Love was the cauſe of undertaking them.</p>
            <p>This reſolution taken was inſtantly put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and being all ſafely arrived at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> as they had before projected; they there again conſulted how farther to proſecute what they had begun, and it was thought convenient by them all, that one of their Company ſhould endeavour to procure
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52694:5"/>
a ſervice in the houſe of <hi>Arabella</hi>'s Husband, my Lord—but we know not his name, for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> to whom we are beholding for this Relation, held it diſcretion to keep it ſecret. Their eyes were inſtantly upon one judged moſt proper for that purpoſe, who willingly undertook it, and was entertained by the Lord as his Groom. It was his good fortune to have aſſigned to his care a fair pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Horſe, on which <hi>Arabella</hi> often rode, when ſhe went to take the Air, either in company of her Husband or alone. The innocence of thoſe times eſteeming a Ladies honour to be a ſufficient guard, though the preſent Age is not of that opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briſtol</hi> being as great a Town of Trade as moſt in <hi>England,</hi> there were always in the Harbor many Ships ready to ſet Sail. One of the beſt ſailing and ſtrongeſt Veſſels <hi>Lionel</hi> and his Companions reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſeize; the negligence of the Commander, and vigilence of <hi>Lionel</hi> gave them great hopes there would not be much difficulty in effecting their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: The better to carry on their work they bought a Shallop, with which they every day rowed out to Sea, as on their pleaſure, ſo that when they ſhould ſeize on <hi>Arabella</hi> and the Ship they might do it with more facility and leſs ſuſpition, both on the People a ſhore and thoſe aboard the Veſſels, which rode at an Anchor near the Ship they intended to make uſe of.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing by the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <hi>Arabella</hi> had hourly notice from her new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick of what ever was reſolved on in their Cabal, and accordingly took her meaſures: in a ſhort time all things being favourable, and the wind come fair at North <hi>Arabella</hi> had notice, that, in a day or two,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52694:5"/>
they intended to put their deſign in execution.</p>
            <p>The place <hi>Lionel</hi> had choſen daily to come to with his ſhallop was behind a Cape of Land very convenient for his purpoſe, becauſe little frequented, and by reaſon of the ſolitarineſs of the place not at all ſubject to any rancounter might unluckily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in that juncture of time, the Groom alſo to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the buſineſs, had omitted for three Days to give any Drink to the pyed Horſe which was his Charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arabella</hi> (when ſhe knew all things were in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and that <hi>Lionel</hi> and his Companions waited for her in the ſhallop, with impatience expecting that happy Hour they had ſo long waited for) mounted on Horſeback on pretence of taking the Air, and rode towards the Cape before mentioned, the Horſe being extream thirſty, hearing the Waves beat againſt the Shoar, and thereby knowing the nearneſs of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruſhed furiouſly on in ſpight of the bit or thoſe that led him, all that the pretended Groom could do was to catch hold on the reins ſeeming thereby, to ſtop him when indeed he only guided him towards the Shallop, which he might the eaſier do becauſe the Horſe, ſeeing himſelf led towards Water which he much deſired, did not unwillingly ſubmit to be ſo guided. <hi>Lionel</hi> and his Comrades ſeeing what was done a Shoar leaped out of the Shallop (where they attended the beginning of that good fortune ſhould put an end to their Diſgrace) and moſt officiouſly, laying hold on the Horſes bridle diſmounted the <hi>La</hi>dy, and immediately with the cunning Groom em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued in the Shallop, ſo that before the other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants could come to the Sea ſide. Our adventurers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52694:6"/>
were got a good diſtance thence having with Sails and Oars dilligently endeavoured ſo to do.</p>
            <p>The Day appointed to put this Action in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was alſo deſigned for ſeizing the Veſſel we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpoke of, which was the eaſier accompliſhed in regard that at the ſame time the Owners made a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel feaſt a Shore, to which the Maſter, Mariners, Officers, and Souldiers were invited, ſo that the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel being in a manner empty, was without difficulty ſurprized by <hi>Lionel</hi> and his Friends, upon which ſo ſoon as they were embarqued looſing the ſails, and cutting the Cable, they ſteered their Courſe for <hi>France,</hi> the Wind blowing a briſk gale carried the Ship ſwiftly away, which was very happy for our Lovers. What a noiſe the recital of this adventure made, not onely in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> but alſo throughout all <hi>England,</hi> what deſcants was made thereof, or what dangers the Actors underwent, and what puniſhment they deſerved, let the Reader imagine, for we intend not to particularize them in our Relations.</p>
            <p>The Eyes of Love are not always blind, for <hi>Lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> conſidering the quality of the offence he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, &amp; againſt whom, ſoon bethought himſelf that the Husband of <hi>Arabella</hi> was a perſon of ſuch Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as having not only his own power but alſo the Authority of Juſtice in his behalf, would not fail to make all the Ships then in Harbor purſue the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhers of his Wife and Honour, <hi>Lionel</hi> therefore to prevent being overtaken, made all the ſail he could not caring how ſoon he loſt the ſight of Land. At Night he altered the Courſe that in the Day he had ſteered, the better to blind any that ſhould purſue him; all that Night they ſailed with ſuch a ſwiftneſs as

uſually accompany's them that run headlong into their own ruine, the Day enſuing he found himſelf out of danger of purſuit. But the Wind, which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had continued favourable and gentle, now began to be ſo impetuous that it ſeemed rather to blow a Storm then a fair gale.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arabella</hi> now began to reflect on what was paſt, and conſider her former and preſent condition, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on theſe things ſhe came upon the deck, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to divert her melancholy, where ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Tempeſtuous Sea, and an Air ſhe had not been accuſtomed unto, ſhe then perceived what a miſerable eſtate ſhe had reduced her ſelf unto; the poor Veſſel being now become the ſport of the Sea and Wind was a general grief and affliction to them all.</p>
            <p>After five Days of Navigation, without diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Land they looked for, the wind became ſo croſs and vehement as it quite forced them from the coaſts of <hi>France</hi> whether their deſires tended; the Friends of <hi>Lionel,</hi> who were not ſo amorous as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſoon became ſenſible of their deplorable eſtate, perceiving how equally fortune treated them mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no diſtinction between the innocent and guilty, and that they were all like to ſhare in the common danger. But <hi>Lionel,</hi> was moſt extreamly tormented to conſider, that he was not only the means of bringing himſelf into that ruin but alſo his Friends, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her whom he Loved more dear more than his Life.</p>
            <p>Thirty Days were they in this Calamity running through the vaſt and dangerous deſerts of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, deſtitute of all Hope and Hourly expecting

death: when one morning about Sun-riſing, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to have ſome Hopes for they thought they ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Land, which in a little time they plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, it ſhewing it ſelf to be an Iſland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> High, craggy, and covered with trees; this gave all the Company a great deal of Joy, though <hi>Arabella</hi> received the moſt conſolation, for ſhe now hoped after ſo dangerous and weariſome a Navigation, to find that repoſe which was neceſſary for her, an end of all her pains and a new manner of living.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lionel</hi> was very much troubled to find a ſafe Port in this unknown Land, fearing to be ſplit againſt ſome Rock, he therefore ſounded, and not without a great deal of circumſpection, came ſafely to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor. They could not perceive any humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on Shore, and thoſe which were beſt ſkilled in Navigation thoughtit not inhabited, which they were the more induced to believe, becauſe a great number of Birds differing in bigneſs, ſort, and colour came and perched themſelves upon the Yards, Maſts, and Shrouds of the Ship without being any thing afraid of the Men, or endeavouring to avoid their being taken.</p>
            <p>To be more fully informed both Curioſity and neceſſity made the moſt hardy to get out the boat and go a Shoar, <hi>Lionel</hi> would fain have been one of them, but neither <hi>Arabella</hi> or his Companions would ſuffer it, not thinking it convenient he ſhould ſtir out of the Veſſel till the return of his other Friends, which they ſoon did filled with very good news, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting though the Iſland was uninhabited yet the Air was good and the Earth fertile. Upon theſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings <hi>Lionel</hi> and <hi>Arabella</hi> with moſt of the Men
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52694:7"/>
(leaving the reſt aboard to look after the Ship) went into the Boatand landed on the banks of that Land where never before any man had ſet his Foot.</p>
            <p>It being very fair weather &amp; a clear ſeaſon, the Sun as it roſe higher diſcovered to our Voyagers a moſt dainty and delicious Country, the Mountains and Hills all covered with ſhady Trees, the Valleys filled with ſmall Currants, &amp; many bubling Springs of pure and clear Water. The Iſland was alſo filled with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Beaſts, who, unacquainted with the ſight of man, the preſence of our adventurers did not affright, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things thus accord to their wiſhes it incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged them to proceed to a further diſcovery with a great deal of confidence: ſome diſtance from their firſt Landing they found a place ſurrounded with Lawrels &amp; other ſhady Trees (though they knew not how to call them) whoſe branches filled with large leaves were ſo conjoyned as they made a perfect Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor pleaſant and ſhady, from the Mountain <hi>Adjacent</hi> deſcended a fine River which formed a moſt curious Pond cloſe by the Arbor. This our Voyagers thought a convenient place for their refreſhments and ſo with Boughs and the like Materials they made it fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, reſolving for ſome time after ſuch hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips as they had indured to take the pleaſures ſo ſweet a Country did afford them. Now therefore every one betook himſelf to what his Fancy prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, ſome imploying themſelves more exactly to ſearch into the Woods. Others to run over the Hills and Dales to find what might be further worth their diſcovery. Whilſt the reſt betook themſelves to carry Neceſſaries aboard and bring others a Shore from their Ship.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52694:8"/>
But the misfortune which attended our fugitives was too great to let this tranquility laſt long, for the Night which ſucceeded the Thirteenth Day after their arrival there, hapned ſo horrible a ſtorm which came from the North-Eaſt that all the force and induſtry of thoſe who found themſelvs on board the Ship, which was then at an Anchor, could not withſtand the fury of the Wind and Sea. But they were forced to abandon her to their rage, and for two Dayes they were in the ſame Jeopardy they ſo lately were delivered out of, at the end of which they once more diſcovered Land; the Veſſel being leaky and they unſkilful Marriners they were forced to run her a ſhore, which was but the beginning of new Miſeries, for they no ſooner were Landed but they found themſelves on the Coaſt of <hi>Africa</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Morocco.</hi> The Mores who from the Mountains beheld this pitiful ſhipwrack deſcended and ſeized upon the poor Chriſtians, haling them into ſlavery and impriſoning them in the Jayl of their Capital City. Thereby making it appear that theſe Monſters of Men were more cruel then the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, for the latter intended to ſpare their lives when the former were ſo unmerciful as to make them undergo a perpetual bondage.</p>
            <p>The day light which ſucceeded this unhappy night, was more uncomfortable to thoſe aſhore than the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had been terrible, or the ſtorm frightful to them aboard, for there appearing no ſhip in Port, neither when the Tempeſt was over any returning (for they till then had hoped, that the extreamity of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had only forced her out to Sea) notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their valour, all the courage they had could not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52694:8"/>
draw them out of diſpair, for now they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſtitute of any means ever to return from that unknown part of the World. The moſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them judging, that by reaſon of the few people on board, and their unexperience in Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time affairs, the Veſſel muſt of neceſſity be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up of the waters.</p>
            <p>After this deplorable accident, thoſe amongſt them, who had been the chief Inſtruments of bringing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and friends into this miſerable eſtate, began ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to repent of their folly, though the Lady was the moſt concerned, well knowing this ſad Voyage was chiefly made on her account, ſo that ſhe fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deep melancholly, but dangers being infinite more horrible in themſelves than we can paint them; it is impoſſible for us to deſcribe the grief which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed her breaſt, for ſo deeply was ſhe afflicted that from that moment to the time of her death ſhe utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not one word: <hi>Exceſs of ſorrow is alwayes mute, rejecting the common way of eaſing it ſelf by ſighs and lamentations.</hi>

            <p>Three dayes was death in killing ſo amiable an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, ſhe expiring with all manner of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and repentance, <hi>Lionel</hi> had ſome further time granted him by God, that his ſorrows might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and he afflicted; for it was but juſt, that he who was the moſt criminal, ſhould undergo the greateſt ſufferings. After the death of his beloved Miſtreſs, with many groans and deep complaints he lay at her feet, refuſing either ſuſtenance or comfort from his Friends, though they pitying his ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters, endeavoured with their beſt rhetorick to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtanding which, all their charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <hi>Lionel</hi> and <hi>Arabella</hi> dead, the other gentlemen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to ſtay any longer in that place, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed themſelves, ſome to fit up their Shallop, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to prepare water, and the reſt to kill birds and make proviſion for their Voyage, they thinking it a great deal better to commit themſelves to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Sea in their ſmall Shallop, than ſpin out a lazy and idle life in that, to them unpleaſant place. They ſoon had left the Land, but by misfortune ſteering the ſame courſe the ſtorm beforementioned obliged their freinds in the Ship to take, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently fell in with the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> which they looked upon as a Land of comfort. But they had only eſcaped the danger of the deep to be ſlaves to the Barbarians, and paſſing through divers hands they at length came to be bought by the King of <hi>Morrocco,</hi> where they found their companions, whom before they thought ſhip wrackt, and this was

their only conſolation to find them in the ſame Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity with themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Priſon for Slaves in <hi>Morocco</hi> was like that which is this day uſed at <hi>Algiers:</hi> in it were alwayes many Chriſtian Slaves of divers Nations, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others there was a Spaniard, born at <hi>Sevile,</hi> by name <hi>Jean de Morales,</hi> a man very ſkilful in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, having been for many years a Pilot. His curioſity was mightily pleaſed with the Narrative our captive Engliſh made him of their adventures, the many years they were together gave him the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger means to know, what he ſo much deſired, for he not only learned the marks to find, but the ſituation of this new Land, and alſo all the miraculous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages had happened to the Engliſh, in their unhappy Voyage, of which Relation he hoped to make good uſe for a diſcovery, ſo ſoon as the time of his Slavery ſhould be at an end.</p>
            <p>But the better to apprehend thoſe things, which are neceſſary to be known in our Hiſtory, I muſt make a ſmall digreſſion, and let me not be thought tedious, if I ſpend ſome time on ſo profitable a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>The King Dom <hi>John</hi> the firſt, of happy memory, having made an end of his Wars with <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and not judging it convenient to abandon his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to idleneſs, which peace might very much prompt them unto, he reſolved to imploy his arms againſt the avowed enemies of our Religion. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing this generous reſolution, he ſet a foot a good Army, with which he invaded <hi>Africa,</hi> and conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Town of <hi>Centa,</hi> ſituate preciſely in the Streight of the <hi>Gibralter,</hi> which he made himſelf
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52694:10"/>
Maſter of, in the year of our Lord one thouſand four hundred and fifteen. <hi>In which Expedition his Subjects ſerved him as if his Children, and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as if they had been his meaneſt Subjects.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Portugal</hi> and all his Brethren were in this Expedition, amongſt whom Dom <hi>Henry</hi> the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, Grand Maſter of the Order of Chriſt, did ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize himſelf by many glorious undertakings, among which none redounded more to his honour than the furtherance of this action we are now about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
            <p>This Infant was alwayes much addicted to the Mathematical Sciences; and more particularly to Coſmography, which made him when at <hi>Centa</hi> in the African Expedition often converſe with divers Moors and Jews, who had Cognizance of remote places, by them he underſtood their Coaſts and Seas and upon ſuch information did conceive an extream deſire to diſcover and conquer them, not ſo much out of Ambition to enlarge his own Dominions, as to encreaſe the Kingdom of God. With this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after the Conqueſt of <hi>Centa,</hi> he retired to the Algarves, and built on a convenient place of Cape Saint <hi>Vincent</hi> a Town to ſerve him as an Arſenal for his Shipping, which he named <hi>Terca Nabal,</hi> and it was alſo called <hi>The Town of the Infant.</hi> Hence he began his new diſcoveries and Conqueſts, ſetting out his Fleets from thence for the Atlantick and Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Oceans, which were then held innavigable, and had it not been for him might have ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Albeit the Greeks to elevate their own actions ſay, by <hi>Herodote</hi> with more Oſtentation than truth that the Inhabitants of the Euxine Sea held for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52694:10"/>
that the Atlantick had communication with the Red or <hi>Arabian</hi> Sea, and they alſo affirm, that it is writ in the Annals of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that one of their Kings named <hi>Necus,</hi> cauſed certain Phoenicians to ſet out upon a coaſting Voyage, who ſailing from the Red Sea, ran through the Ocean, paſſing by the Pillars of <hi>Hercules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and ſo come back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> which Voyage he ſaith they made in two years. The ſame Greeks likewiſe report that in the time of <hi>Xerxes</hi> a certain Captain named <hi>Sataſpes</hi> doubled the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> and ſo returned into <hi>Egypt</hi> by the Straight of <hi>Cadize.</hi> And <hi>Strabo</hi> writes upon the Faith of the Grammarian <hi>Ariſtonicus,</hi> that <hi>Menelaus</hi> did ſail from <hi>Cadiz</hi> to the Indies. <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> alſo affirmes that <hi>Eudoxus</hi> flying from <hi>Jatythius</hi> King of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> ſailed from the Arabian Gulph, till he came to <hi>Cadiz.</hi> This is the ſame, <hi>Pliny, Solin, Makian, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timedore, Zenophon, Lampſacene,</hi> and others write. But this is certain that at the time of our firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt and diſcoveries there was not any cognizance either in <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>Africa</hi> of any ſuch dangerous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigations, and the <hi>Portugals</hi> affirm, that the People of <hi>Aſia,</hi> whom they have likewiſe lately diſcovered, know no more thereof than the other, which doth not at all ſtrengthen the Relations of the aboveſaid Authors, but rather diminiſh them, if we believe the credit of what we have now alledged.</p>

               <hi>Jean Gonſalve Zaxoe</hi> Gentleman of the Bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to Don <hi>Henry,</hi> was the principal Perſon ſerved the Infant in his diſcoveries, about which he did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Revenues of the Order of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This Gentleman was the firſt that King <hi>John</hi> made Knight at the taking of <hi>Centa,</hi> he ſerved the Infant with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52694:11"/>
very good ſucceſs in all his African expeditions, and 'tis held he was the firſt man which introduced the uſe of Artillery aboard Ships. Having the command of the Princes navy he paſſed the ſtraights in ſearch of ſome parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> in the Year, One Thouſand Four Hundred, and Twenty, he had before in the Year, One Thouſand, Four Hundred, and eighteen, diſcovered the Iſland of <hi>Porto Santo,</hi> upon which he was caſt as he went in ſearch of Cape <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jador.</hi>

            <p>The fifteenth of <hi>March</hi> in the Year One Thouſand Four Hundred, and Sixteen, <hi>Don Sancho</hi> (the youngeſt, Son of Don <hi>Fredinando</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> and) great Maſter of the Order of <hi>Calatrava</hi> died in <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and left by his Teſtament conſiderable ſums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to redeem Chriſtian Spaniſh ſlaves in <hi>Morocco,</hi> with which Money a Foiſt was ſent to <hi>Africa,</hi> and and was returning thence for <hi>Tariff</hi> with ſome num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of redeemed Chriſtians, amongſt which was our <hi>Jean de Morales,</hi> At that time was <hi>Gonſalve</hi> cruiſing in the Straights with his Maſters Fleet, and whereas the Differences betwixt the two Crowns of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Caſtile</hi> were not yet ſo fully reconciled but that there remained ſome miſunderſtandings between them. This made the Subjects of each King as they found themſelves ſtronger, to plunder the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, as they met one another at Sea, and <hi>Gonſalve</hi> diſcovering the Foiſt, wherein were the redeemed Captives, ſent after her ſome light Veſſels, who after a ſmall Chaſe came up with her, boarded, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance took her; <hi>Gonſalve</hi> ſeeing the miſery of thoſe whom he had now made Priſoners and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Clemency of his Prince, gave them all their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52694:11"/>
except <hi>Jean de Morales,</hi> becauſe it had been told him he was a man of great experience in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time affairs, thinking him a fit preſent for Don <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and that he would be very uſeful in the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Prince was then a making<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Jean de Morales,</hi> being informed of his new impriſonment and the cauſe for which he was detained, did not grieve, but on the contrary freely offered to ſerve the Infant and promiſed to endeavour to anſwer the Hopes they had done him the honour to conceive of him, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der himſelf more gracious with <hi>Gonſalve,</hi> communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto him ſome part of the ſecret of the New Iſland he intended to diſcover, and to gain the more Credit to his relation told him the Hiſtory of <hi>Lionel</hi> and <hi>Arabella. Gonſalve</hi> no ſooner underſtood this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative but he returned to <hi>Tarca Nalbal</hi> more rich in Hope than in the prizes during his Voyage, he had taken, being there arrived he told the Infant what a lucky rancounter he had met, preſenting him <hi>Jean de Morales,</hi> giving to him an account of his profeſſion and ſecrets. Don <hi>Henry</hi> received him with a great deal of kindneſs, and having heard what he could ſay conceived an extream impatience to execute an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe ſo agreeable to his nature. To his effect he reſolved <hi>Gonſalve</hi> ſhould go to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where the King his Father, was to communicate to his Majeſty, what he knew in the premiſes, and the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the King, and ſatisfie his Miniſters, he ſent with him <hi>Jean de Morales,</hi> to the end he might anſwer all Objections which might be made by thoſe who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither mind nor courage to undertake ſuch Actions are accuſtomed to thwart them, who are the propounders by alledging the difficulties, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52694:12"/>
ſuch diſcoveries bring along with them, thereb y endeavouring to perſwade others, that things of this nature will never be attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they appear extream feaſible.</p>
            <p>Whilſt <hi>Gonfalve</hi> was on his journey to Court, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Captains <hi>Jean Laurence, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Carvalail, Ruy Paes, Alvare Alfons,</hi> and <hi>Francis de Alcafarano</hi> (who writ this Hiſtory) and alſo with two other Gentlemen very ſkilful in Navigation, called <hi>Antony Gags,</hi> and <hi>Laurence Gomoz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Don <hi>Henry</hi> gave order to equipy a Fleet to follow this diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. which he reſolved, in caſe the King denyed him aſſiſtance, himſelf to proſecute.</p>
            <p>The favourable reception, which the King made <hi>Gonſalue</hi> and the Pilot, occaſioned by the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and the ſmallneſs of the riſque and charge, which the Infant propounded as ſufficient for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, were not ſufficient motives to ſome Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to forward the buſineſs, but on the contrary envying the grandeur of the Infant, did what lay in their power to obſtruct the deſign.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Gonſalve</hi> was received with a great deal of honour at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> yet the King making no haſte in the affair, he gave the Infant notice of the great impediments his pretenſions met with, and what pains he was at to perſwade thoſe Miniſters to receive the treaſures he freely offered the King, and that the difficulty was made greater, becauſe it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended he would convert them to his particular advantage. On this advice, the Prince being reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute not to leave the diſcovery, came himſelf to Court, where he was no ſooner arrived, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all obſtructions, which hindred the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52694:12"/>
ſo that in the beginning of <hi>June</hi> in the year 1420, <hi>Gonſalve</hi> was ſet to ſet to Sea with one Ship very well equippied, and another Veſſel, which row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Oars, with which on ſuch occaſions they uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſerve themſelves. So inconſiderable was the Fleet which parted from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> for a diſcovery of ſo great importance.</p>
            <p>There ran a rumour among the <hi>Portugals,</hi> that off the Iſland <hi>Porto Santo</hi> (to which place <hi>Gonſalve</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended firſt to ſteer) towards the North-eaſt there uſually appeared a perpetual obſcurity, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes extended it ſelf from the Sea to the Sky, and never diminiſhed, but alwayes did appear in the very ſame manner, this every one knew to be true that lived in <hi>Porto Santo,</hi> and becauſe in that infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Navigation, they wanted the uſe of the <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labe,</hi> and other inſtruments ſince invented, it was judged miraculous, if not impoſſible to go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from that black place or Cloud, but that they, who ſhould venture, muſt of neceſſity for their bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs loſe their lives. This ignorance of the Sea and its ſecrets was the cauſe, that this obſcurity was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally called an Abyſs. Some ſaid it was the mouth of Hell, and were upheld in their opinions by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, as ſimple as themſelves, who offered to prove both by Argument and Authorities, that it might very well be ſo. The Hiſtorian who pretend to be more knowing than the others, did eſteem it to be the Iſland anciently called <hi>Cipango,</hi> which God had wonderfully hidden in the Clouds to protect the Spaniſh and Portugueze Biſhops and Chriſtians, who had retired themſelves thither, out of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Moors and Saracens. And that it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52694:13"/>
contrary to God's pleaſure to endeavour a clearer diſcovery, for if he had pleaſed to have it performed he would have manifeſted his approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ſuch miracles as uſually precede his allowance, and that beſides divers ſuch ancient Prophecies under ſevere penalties, forbid the further ſearch into this Miſtery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gonſalve</hi> ſailed towards the Iſle of <hi>Porto Santo</hi> in very fair weather, and proper for his voyage; but fearing in the dark he might paſs ſomething wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of note, he made them every night lower their Sails, and lie at Hull, proceeding onely in the day, that he might the better ſee any land they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidently diſcover. This was no ſuch hindrance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but that in a little time he arrived at <hi>Porto Santo;</hi> where he and the reſt of his company were ſhewed the black Cloud beforementioned (which <hi>Jean de Morales</hi> judged to be the beginning of that Land they ſaught after.</p>
            <p>Here they held a Counſel, and reſolved to ſtay in the Iſle that quarter of the Moon to ſee if that cloud of Darkneſs did either vary its ſhape or diminiſh its bigneſs, but it alwayes continuing in the ſame form and magnitude gave them a great deal more cauſe to diſpair, than hope for a good effect.</p>
            <p>The Pilot <hi>Jean de Morales</hi> was of opinion by the information he had received from the Engliſh, and the courſe he had made them ſteer, that the Iſland he ſaught after was not far from thence, and told <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve</hi> that the rayes of the Sun lying very hot on the Earth, and drawing thence the humidity (of which there was a great quantity, by reaſon of the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Trees) made a groſs vapour to aſcend, which

filling the Skie with its foggyneſs was the reaſon of the obſcurity they ſaw, and that he was confident by theſe tokens, the Land they ſo much coveted to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, was not far from that place.</p>
            <p>All of them were of a contrary opinion to <hi>Morales</hi> and tumultuouſly cryed, how that he being a Caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, and by conſequence an Enemy, was very well pleaſed to ſee their Nation expoſed to evident dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that it was enough for men to encounter men, without commencing a war againſt the Elements, that it became only Heathens and Infidels to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the ſecrets of God, that they were to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing but death from that cloud, and that to proceed further was only to dare the Almighty, that the Infant was ill ſerved to have his Servants ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſuch unprofitable dangers, but the King was worſe uſed in regard they were his moſt faithful Subjects, who might ſerve him in more feiſible un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, than to ſearch after a ſuppoſed Land on no other ground than the Pilots vain imaginations.</p>
            <p>They farther argued that <hi>Gonſalve</hi> was a Nobleman of great merit, he might expect large recompences from his own deſerts without precipitating himſelf and them into ſuch certainty of peril; that valour was never ſhewn in puſhing forward deſpair, that it was no charity under pretence of Religion to find out people and ſeize on their Countries, whereby they ſhewed themſelves rather covetous of their own than God's glory, but that they ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with thoſe Lands they already poſſeſſed, and finally affirmed they were but men, and therefore would not undergo what ſeemed to be above Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals ſtrength.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:52694:14"/>
All theſe clamours did not ſtagger their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders reſolution, he therefore for the preſent gave them good words, reſolving (becauſe he was of greater courage than all of them) to ſurmount the difficulties, which now ſeemed greater, by reaſon of the averſeneſs of theſe men, and communicating his thoughts only to <hi>Jean de Morales,</hi> he hoiſted his ſails, and weighed anchor, ſteering his courſe directly towards the Bug-bear ſhadow, making all the ſail his Veſſels could bear, by that means the ſooner to obtain the Land he hoped to find. The nearneſs of the obſcurity did augment their fears, it appearing higher and bigger as they nearer approached to it. About mid day the Sea ſeemed altogether darkned, an unuſual blackneſs filling the whole horizon, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any ſign of Land, for the groſs cloud, into which they where now entered, covered both Sea and Skie. This was the cauſe of a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and the vicinity of their ſuppoſed danger, made them all cry out and earneſtly entreat <hi>Gonſalve</hi> that he would not proceed, which if he did, they looked upon themſelves as dead men, beſeeching him not to be the deſtruction of ſo many innocents.</p>
            <p>Their outcryes did not at all ſtartle their Captain, but calling together the Officers, Mariners, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and placing himſelf to be heard by them all, more to juſtifie his conſtancy, than ſatisfie their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, he made them this Oration.</p>
            <p>Do you think, my Friends, and Comrades, that I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem my life leſs than you do yours, if not, none cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ever went about to perſwade you, that if you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry I have any means to ſave my ſelf; that indeed would be the greateſt injuſtice in the World, that I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52694:14"/>
ſhould reap the Glory, and you the Hazards of this en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terpriſe, but equally we are to participate in both, if therefore I at preſent appear more hardy then ſuits with your content. It is becauſe I highly eſteem you, for I am inſinitely glad you underſtand what perils you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your ſelves unto, that it may hereafter be fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you deliberately and of purpoſe, not by chance, did confront theſe more than humane dangers, I do not therefore at all wonder at your fears, but I do not by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny means approve of the way, you would put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to remove them, with what juſtice can you pretend, to more glory than other Nations, if you do not thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your lives, if you follow but the footſteps of your noble Anceſtors, you may trace them in ſuch adventures as we are now a making. For what reaſon did we come from our Countrey? for what reaſon did our Maſter ſend us hither? wherefore among thouſands, which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themſelves for this employment, did he make choice of us? wherefore doth he ſhew himſelf a father to our Families? wherefore doth he take ſo kindly our Devoir? 'tis not ſurely that we ſhould do our buſineſs by halfs, or leave off our adventures, before finiſhed: Conſider, that as there is but one life, ſo there is but one death, and it is neither without reaſon, that you ſhould fear the Elements more than men for twice, by either of them, you cannot dy. If you do not refuſe to hazard your lives againſt the Enemies of your King, what is it that you dread in the wind or water, do you think a wave or a guſt of wind, more cruel then the Sword or Lance of an Enemy, is not the peril the ſame you meet with, in any rancounter, ſeeing you cannot but once receive your deaths. Think upon that grounds we are entered into the ſervice of our King and Prince, is it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52694:15"/>
not to make diſcovery of unknown Provinces, which your courages are to conquer and lay at their feet, this ought not to be abandoned by your diſobedience and fear, eſpecially being commanded on this Voyage, by their immediate orders. Truely, Friends, 'tis more ſcandalous to return home, and dy with ſhame at <hi>Lisbon</hi> then unhappily periſh in the Sea, if ſo ill fortune ſhould attend as. Let us bravely then undergo this riſque, for be you certainly aſſured, when once our reſolutions are fixed to proceed, we ſhall find all things as eaſie as we can wiſh. The Night is never more dark, then when day approaches; the ſtrange conſternation we are now in, is the greater ſign our lock'd for good fortune, draws near: Couragiouſly, Friends, examine the cauſe of your temerity, reaſon will ſoon inform you, the Cloud which is the cauſe, is but a ſhadow, if both nature and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune did expoſe us, I would be the firſt ſhould take the care of our lives, but ſeeing we have nothing but our fooliſh fancies to fear, which is misbecoming valiant men to dread, let us in the Name of God proceed.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe worked ſo powerfully, on thoſe to whom it was addreſſed, that it made all their fears vaniſh and compoſed their minds ſo firmly, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animouſly they proteſted <hi>Gonſalve</hi> ſhould not only govern them as their Chief, but command them as abſolute Maſter of their Lives, and Liberties, they reſolving to obey him blindly, and without diſpute in all things,</p>
            <p>Though the weather was fair, yet the Sea, being extream rapid, the current carried the Veſſels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Courſe, to prevent which <hi>Gonſalve</hi> fitted out two Shallops to tow them committing, one
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52694:15"/>
to the Care of <hi>Anthony Gago,</hi> and the other to <hi>Gonſalve Lovis,</hi> Men of Known Valour and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, they rowed directly towards the cloud which they approached nearer and nearer, as the Current permitted them.</p>
            <p>The Voyage continuing for ſome time in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Cloud, into which they where now entred, ſeemed to leſſen and decreaſe towards the Eaſt, but the waters made a terrible noiſe, notwithſtanding they paſſed the obſcurity, and having ſo done (a Cloud, which hung on the Earth, hindring their clearer proſpect) they thought they diſcovered land, and ſaw many armed men of a prodigeous bigneſs thereon. But they after found, that the Shore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of high Rocks was the occaſion of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake. The Air preſently clearing, and the Sun ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out, they plainly made the Land. This happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they received with the greater joy, becauſe not by them expected; The firſt place preſented it ſelf to their view was a high point of Land, to which <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve</hi> gave the name of Cape St. <hi>Laurence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which point having doubled, they ſaw a brave and fertile Country, full of fair and high Trees, which in Woods and Groves extended themſelves from the Mountains through the Valleys, to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sea-ſide. The Cloud was now ſo far retired, as it ſeemed only to crown the heads of the Mountains. This pleaſant ſight gave the minds of our Voyagers a great deal of content, the dangers and hazards they had formerly mutined about being now forgot they imbraced one another with joy, rendring thanks firſt to God, and then to their Commander by whoſe encouragement and perſwaſion, they were now
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52694:16"/>
come to ſo glorious an end of their labours, highly praiſing their Pilot, who had ſo ſucceſſefully conduct<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed them, Sailing on they ſaw a large Bay, which <hi>Jean de Morales</hi> judging to be the place, where the Engliſh had formerly reſided, came there to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor. Some were inſtantly preparing to go a ſhore, but the Sun, being then ſet, 'twas thought fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it till the morning. <hi>Gonſalve</hi> commanded a good Watch to be kept that night, becauſe ſleep is a Rock, and the more dangerous, becauſe no Pilot finds it in his Sea charts.</p>
            <p>The day following <hi>Ruy Paes</hi> by order of <hi>Gonſalve</hi> made himſelf ready to go a ſhore, which he did (in one of the rowing ſhallops beforementioned) with a well armed company of ſouldiers, he landed on the the very ſame place <hi>Lionel</hi> before had done, and by certain tokens <hi>Jean de Morales</hi> had given him, found with much ſatisfaction the footſteps of the Engliſh, and divers trees notched with a hatchet, which he knew to be infallible ſigns of men having been there, paſſing thence into the Forreſt he ſaw the great Tree, and coming nearer perceived the Croſs, and read the Epitaph of out Lovers, which abſolutely confirmed the Pilots relations. This ſpectacle cauſed a great deal of compaſſion in <hi>Ruy Paes,</hi> and his Companions, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them ſhed ſome tears, thereby confirming what long ſince <hi>Seneca</hi> wrote, that <hi>Pity is the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Kindneſs among men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After theſe recognizances the ſame day they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Jean Gonſalve,</hi> and aſſured him that they had met with all things, as <hi>Jean de Morales</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore related, upon which knowledge he diſpoſed himſelf to diſembarque, which he did with all the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52694:16"/>
precaution and ſolemnity imaginable, taking poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the place, for and in the Name of Don <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and of the Infant Don <hi>Henry</hi> Maſter of the Order and Knight of Chriſt, the water was bleſſed by two religious, and with it the Air and Earth cleanſed by calling on the name of God. An Altar was alſo erected, and Maſs ſaid where <hi>Lionel</hi> and <hi>Arabella</hi> lay buried. This Ceremony was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on the Feaſt day of Saint <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, becauſe <hi>Gonſalve</hi> would not omit any thing whereby he might attain the perfect knowledge of the place, he commanded his people to make the Tower of the whole, and ſtrictly ſearch Hills, Dales, and Woods to ſee if they could diſcover ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man or beaſt, commanding them if they found any they ſhould bring them a live or dead: But they who were ſent on this errand found no living creature, but divers Birds of differing ſorts, ſhapes, and colours, who ſuffered themſelves to be taken by the hand without any pain or trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jean Gonſalve,</hi> eſteeming himſelf rich in ſo eaſie a purchaſe, returned aboard, where calling the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of his Men to counſel, it was reſolved they ſhould not part from thence without a more particular examining the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they had then leaſure enough to do: Now becauſe the ſhore was full of Rocks, which did not in many places ſhew themſelves above the water, 'twas thought convenient to make further diſcovery in their Shallops, as they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy begun; than in their grearer Veſſels, for fear ſome of the Currents might force them on the Rocks. So <hi>Gonſalve</hi> taking the Shallop of his own Veſſel, and committing the charge of the other to Captain
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52694:17"/>
               <hi>Alvare Alfons,</hi> they paſſed the point which was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Weſt, ſeeing four fair Rivulets run into the Sea, the water of which being extream clear and good, <hi>Gonſalve</hi> cauſed ſome bottles to be filled to carry to the Infant.</p>
            <p>Paſſing ſtill on they ſaw another Valley, which was likewiſe watered with a dainty Rivulet, here they they landed ſome Souldiers, who found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a great many Fountains, and a huge grove of Trees, which grew together in form of an Arbor, on of the biggeſt whereof <hi>Gonſalve</hi> took and made a great Croſs of, ſince which this place is called <hi>Holy Croſs,</hi> ſailing on they weathered a point of Land ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it ſelf farther than ordinary into the Sea, memorable for the many large Birds, the multitude of whom was ſo great, that the men in the Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop was fearful of being devoured by them, they therefore called this place <hi>Punt a dos Gralhos,</hi> a little further was another Valley full of Cedar Trees, which made a goodly ſhew. On an adjacent Hill there grew one much higher than the reſt, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeemed to have ſet there for a Beacon.</p>
            <p>From this Valley of Cedars they came to another, where was a ſpatious Lake, which forming it ſelf by the Sea-ſide into a large Baſon or Pond, promiſed ſomething extraordinary; <hi>Gonſalve Ayvez</hi> was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with a good number of Souldiers ordered to go a ſhore; who, having by the Valley aſcended the Mountain, returned without any further knowledge then that by the Valley they could diſcover the place from whence they firſt ſet out, and thereby knew it to be an Iſland, and no part of <hi>Africa,</hi> as many of them had before conjectured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52694:17"/>
               <hi>Gonſlave</hi> however not yet content, but ſtill ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining there might be yet ſome Inhabitants, ordered his people daily to go from place to place, to ſee if they could make any further diſcoveries, by this means they found a very fair and large plain free from Trees (which covered in a manner all other places) and onely over-grown with moſt beautiful Fennel, called in Portugueze <hi>Funchal,</hi> upon this Place afterwards was founded a Town, to which was given the name of <hi>Funchal,</hi> heretofore the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis of the Eaſtern Iſlands as to Spiritualities, and ſtill ſo as to temporalities.</p>
            <p>The Portugueze more modeſt than other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who vain-gloriouſly give great Names to their Plantations and diſcoveries; have alwayes been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented either to continue the old names of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, or if they gave them new appellations to beſtow ſuch on them, as were moſt agreeable to the nature of the Place, as for inſtance this famous City is called <hi>Funchal</hi> from the abundance of Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel there found growing, before ever the Town was built.</p>
            <p>Three large Rivers, having their Randevouze in this Valley, juſt at diſembouging themſelves into the Sea, make two ſmall Iſlands, which do in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner land lock the Haven, and ſecure the Port from the Wind and Sea, as if it were a Mole.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the great peace and tranquillity <hi>Gonſalve</hi> found, yet would he not permit his people to be idle, but alway buſied them in ſome employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or other, he himſelf ſtill coaſting the Country, came to a large Rock, which he called <hi>Praya Fermoſa,</hi> or the Fair Rock, becauſe of its greatneſs, and the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52694:18"/>
delicate water iſſuing thence, which gently break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its waves againſt the ſtones made a ſweet melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Paſſing ſtill on, they found between two points a furious Torrent, the waters whereof were ſo clear, that it oblidged the curioſity of them all to look thereon: In the company were two ſouldiers of <hi>Lagos,</hi> (for whom the General had a great eſteem) theſe being very ſkilful in ſwimming reſolved to paſs the Torrent, but they were no ſooner in, but in ſpight of all their reſiſtance they found themſelves carried down the ſtream by the ſtrength and ſwiftneſs of the current, and had undoubtedly there been drowned, had not their Companions ſuccoured them. This adventure gave the Torrent the name of <hi>Soccorides</hi> more happily than that of <hi>Agravados</hi> was given to the Arabian Sea, of which our Hiſtorians make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Being now come again to Cape St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> by which ran a River, making the appearance of a Port, into it <hi>Gonſalve,</hi> with his Shallop entred, imagining he might there find ſomewhat more of moment than hitherto he had ſeen, becauſe on the ſand he thought he ſaw the traces of certain Animals, which ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, of a ſudden, a great number Sea-wolves came ruſhing out of a hollow place, which they found at the bottom of a great Mountain, cloſe by the Sea. This concavity ſerved theſe Creatures, as a den to which they retired themſelves, when they left the Sea. This being the moſt remarkable thing they found in the Iſland or their Voyage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gonſalve</hi> afterwards took the name, and Title of <hi>Comerados Lobos,</hi> as <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Germanicus</hi> aſſumed theirs from the Provinces they conquered to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

            <p>The Night after, they had come into this place the Wind came ſo ſtrong as it forced the very rivers back again, and made ſo hideous a tempeſt, as they were afraid, they ſhould have loſt their Veſſels, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the good ſucceſs they had had in their new diſcovery, but it clearing up towards day, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, for fear of ſuch an after-clap, and having now ſeen all that he could deſire, retired with his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels cloſe to the aforeſaid ſmall Iſles or place of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and there he made proviſion of wood, water, birds, plants, and the Earth it ſelf, not only for Sea accommodation, but alſo to preſent the King and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, which having done he embarqued all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſet ſail for <hi>Portugal,</hi> where he ſafely arrived in the end of the month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the ſame year one Thouſand four Hundred and Twenty, he made no anchorage at <hi>Algarues</hi> but directly entered the River and Port of <hi>Lisbon</hi> (where he found his Maſter the Infant expecting him) having not loſt one man in this Voyage, but having added to his Majeſties Dominions the beſt Iſland in the Oriental Ocean.</p>
            <p>The King and Infant, received <hi>Gonſalve,</hi> with a great deal of Joy, and made him a welcome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the ſervice he had rendred them, for the which, having given publick thanks to God for his mercies, in giving them leave to diſcover new Seas and Lands, wherein to glorifie his moſt holy Name, they thought it convenient that the relation of the Voyage of <hi>Jean Gonſalve Zarco,</hi> ſhould be made in a publick Audience, and therefore invited all the Embaſſadors and Miniſters of forreign Princes to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52694:19"/>
hear the relation of what he did ſo highly eſteem.</p>
            <p>Which day of audience being come the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Grandees of the Kingdome, Ambaſſadors, and forreign Miniſters being preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Gonſalve</hi> was introduced into the Hall accompanied with the moſt conſiderable perſons that were with him in his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, when, having kiſſed his Majeſties Hand, and paid the Infant what reſpects were due unto him, the King commanded <hi>Gonſalve</hi> to ſpeak, he then made an exact accompt of his Navigation, and what befel him at <hi>Porto Santo,</hi> of the great fear had poſſeſſed his men on ſight of the dark Cloud, notwithſtanding which, and their Mutiny, how he perſwaded them to go on their Voyage by informing them how much it imported the ſervice of his moſt ſacred Majeſty, and how much detriment it would prove to the whole Nation, ſhould they abandon it: In what manner afterwards they diſcovered the Iſland, he informed the King of the bigneſs, fertility, and ſituation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he alſo told the King the Hiſtory of the Engliſh, of the ſolitude and plenty of the place to which the King without any meditation gave the name of <hi>MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERA,</hi> by reaſon of the great quantity of Wood, <hi>Gonſalve</hi> had told him was growing thereon. He then preſented the King and Infant, the Trunks of the Trees, the Birds, Water, and Earth, he had brought from thence. It was ſoon after reſolved by his Majeſty and Councel that the Spring follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Gonſalve</hi> ſhould return with a plantation to <hi>Madera,</hi> as Governour of the place: which together with Title of Count the Eldeſt of that Family hitherto enjoy.</p>
            <p>This Voyage was began in the Month of <hi>May Anno</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:52694:19"/>
one thouſand, four hundred, twenty and one, the King gave <hi>Gonſalve</hi> leave to take all the criminals and condemned perſons throughout the whole Kingdome, but he would not accept of them, but took all manner of care to provide neceſſaries for his Voyage, which having done he parted from <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> with his Wife <hi>Conſtance Roderiquez de Sa</hi> (who was deſcended from the antient Family of <hi>Almeyda) Jean Gonſalve</hi> his Heir, and <hi>Hellen,</hi> and <hi>Beatrix,</hi> his two Daughters. In few days he arrived at <hi>Madera,</hi> and having moored his Anchors in the place from whence the Engliſh firſt, and after he landed, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Lionel Machin,</hi> who was the firſt diſcoverer he called that Harbor <hi>Porto Machico</hi> or <hi>Machino,</hi> which Name to this day it retains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gonſalve</hi> immediately began to lay the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Church reſolving that the firſt Edifice ſhould be Dedicated to our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Lionel</hi> in his Epitaph had deſired of the future Inhabitants of the Iſle, and to be more juſt to his memory raiſed the ſtructure over the grave where he and his Miſtriſs lay buried, and cutting down the great Tree he built there an Altar. Our unhappy Lovers bones having at length this honourable repoſitory.</p>
            <p>But the Town he thought more convenient to build in the aforeſaid, Valley of <hi>Funchal,</hi> becauſe near it were the two ſmall Iſles, with made ſo convenient a Harbor for ſhipping, and alſo allured thereunto by the beauty of the place, moſt proper for ſituation, ſuch a ſmall original had the Town of <hi>Funchal,</hi> which ſoon after became ſo illuſtrious, and in which the firſt Altar was erected in a Church dedicated by <hi>Gonſalve</hi> to God our Saviour, and the ſecond commended to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52694:20"/>
the Patronage of Saint <hi>Catherine</hi> by <hi>Conſiance</hi> his Lady; contrary to what <hi>Jean de Borros</hi> hath written, who ſuppoſeth the founding of two other Churches. This miſtake makes me not credit what h e writes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Gonſalve</hi> ſhould ſet fire to the Woods, which laſted for ſeven years and could not be quenched ſo long as any trees were left to feed it, which hath ſince made fewel exceſſive ſcarce in the Iſland, for it appears plainly a fable ſince there is Wood and Trees ſtill there in abundance, enough to boil Sugars to ſet awork one hundred and fifty Mills, for ſo many are now in the Iſle, wherefore his relations ſeem fabulous and incredible.</p>
            <p>After the death of Don <hi>John</hi> his Son and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, Don <hi>Duart,</hi> conſidering what great expences his Brother the Infant Don <hi>Henry</hi> had been at to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and people the Iſle of <hi>Madera,</hi> gave him the iſſues and profits thereof during life. This dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made at <hi>Cintra</hi> the ſix and twentieth day of <hi>September,</hi> one thouſand four hundred thirty and two: And alſo for the ſame Reaſons, the King gave in perpetuity the Spiritual Juriſdiction thereof to the Order of Chriſt, which was afterwards confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by King Don <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> in the year one thouſand four hundred thirty and nine.</p>
            <p>As alſo to encourage ſuch other of his Subjects, as ſhould endeavour to deſerve it: He gave <hi>Jean Gonſalve Zarco,</hi> and his deſcendants a Title of honor, and new Coat of Arms (now let it not ſeem ſtrange that the Gentleman ſhould alter his blazon, ſince the Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> themſelves have changed their Royal and ancient Arms, which were a Croſs Argent in a Field Azure, to thoſe which they now bear.)
