            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="introduction">
               <p>THE Author of a Book newly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, called, <hi>The Agreement between the Church of</hi> England <hi>and Church of</hi> Rome, saith,<note place="margin">Preface to the Agreement.</note> 
                  <hi>There has been of late a great cry, That the Clergy of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>are now the chief, if not the only Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of Popery, and Defenders of the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> And therefore, <hi>to put a Check to the insulting talk of our Clergy (who would be thought the only Champions against Popery) 'tis become necessary in the present Juncture to emit such an Essay as this,</hi> To shew an Agreement between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>; and <hi>that the Controversy lies only between the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the Protestant Dissenter.</hi> This I confess, is an Expedient of Expedients; and as it's <hi>necessary</hi> for the relief of those who are so
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106689:4"/>
successfully beaten out of their late Pleas of <hi>Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation,</hi> that they sullenly declare,<note place="margin">Page 1:</note> 
                  <hi>Vntil that be yielded, they'l not dispute</hi>: So it may be <hi>necessary in this present Juncture,</hi> for the charming that Adder, which has yet been deaf to all the Arguments of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Interest and Fear; and to put an end to that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering, Replying, Rejoyning and Sur-rejoyning,</hi> which for some Months he saith, both sides have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in. For if there be an Agreement in Opinion between both Churches, there will be no further occasion for Disputing between them; and if <hi>the only Opposers of Popery,</hi> the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are convinced of it, there will be no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Disputing nor Opposition: Since those between whom the Controversy then <hi>only lies, viz.</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Protestant Dissenter, are it seems upon terms of mutual Cessation.</p>
               <p>But now, left those of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that after all the <hi>Complaints</hi> made against them for <hi>Misrepresentation, will not grant any such thing proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in a strict sence,</hi> (and 'tis likely not in any sence) should be as obstinate and hard to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this case; Therefore to put it out of dispute, (if he be to be credited) he <hi>has with some clearness demonstrated the Agreement of Opinion between the Church of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Rome, <hi>to be exact and full.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Preface.</note> And if <hi>Demonstration,</hi> and <hi>clearness of Demonstration,</hi> will not do it, nothing will. But it's some mens way to talk most of Infallibility, Self-evidence, and clearness of Demonstration, when they are farthest from it; and I began presently to suspect our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's credit, when I found him to shift his Ground, as if he did distrust his own Demonstrations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106689:4"/>
As for instance,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He had no sooner began to demonstrate this <hi>exact and full Agreement of Opinion</hi>; but by way of Prevention, he declares,<note place="margin">Page 2.</note> 
                  <hi>He would not incumber his Discourse with a Catalogue of Agreements in the great Doctrines of Christian Religion, and Matters of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; but would <hi>confine himself to Matters of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Worship, which chiefly concerns mens Practices.</hi> How! <hi>demonstrate the Agreement of Opinion,</hi> and yet forbear medling with <hi>Matters of Opinion</hi>! to undertake it, and then to except the thing he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes! And then to <hi>confine himself to Matters of Government and Worship,</hi> as if there were not as much Reason to shew an Agreement in Doctrine, as <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>; or that <hi>Matters of Government and Worship</hi> were not also Matters of Doctrine!</p>
               <p n="2">2. When he seems to come to the Point he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines himself to, <hi>viz. Government and Worship</hi>; yet he fails again, for it's only in <hi>some parts of Worship,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 3.</note> which he ventures to say that the <hi>Agreement will be found exact and full.</hi> As one sensible, that tho there is nothing in the Liturgy and Prayers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (which he instances in) as to the matter of them, but what every Christian may allow, and so what the Pope may as well as (he saith) <hi>did approve</hi>;<note place="margin">Page 6b.</note> yet, that their Missal and Breviary contain such Prayers to the Saints, and for Souls departed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as can be by no other Figure made to agree with the Worship and Prayers used in the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> than one part of a Contradiction can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It's further worthy of our Observation, That the Agreement he pretends to prove, is not from the <hi>avowed</hi> Doctrine of either Church, but by some
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106689:5"/>
Quotations he produces from two or three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Authors, on the part of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and from such as on their own side, are rejected by the governing part of their Church. So for instance he saith of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Preface.</note> 
                  <hi>They are the avowed Principles of some of the Clergy, and late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> And when he undertakes for the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, he tells us.<note place="margin">Page 16, 18, 30, 31.</note> That <hi>a great, if not the greatest part, grant to the Pope but a Primacy, for the sake of Catholick Concord,</hi> &amp;c. For Proof of which, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the Councils of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> and the Priviledges of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. And yet the Acts of those Councils were reprobated in succeeding Councils; and so far as concerns this case, were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly disallowed, as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> saith.<note place="margin">De Concll. l. 1. c. 7.</note> And of what little Authority the <hi>Gallick</hi> Priviledges have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted at <hi>Rome,</hi> there needs no more evidence than the case of <hi>De Marca,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 22, &amp;c.</note> as it's represented by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor So that let his <hi>Quotations</hi> (which he pretends to be <hi>very just in</hi>)<note place="margin">Preface.</note> be admitted; yet his Argument from thence, for an <hi>exact and full Agreement,</hi> as to this matter, amounts to this only: Some of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are for a Primacy for Concord-sake, and some of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are for no more; therefore the Agreement betwixt the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> is very exact and full in those points. And if this be his way of Demonstration, it might to as good purpose be shewed, That there is also in several Points, this kind of Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those that (he saith) the Controversy <hi>only lies</hi> between, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Protestant Dissenter.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When he offers at a Demonstration from these particular Authors, he attempts not to prove it so
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106689:5"/>
much from what they say, as from what he himself infers from it. So much he acknowledges; for when he had charged Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> to have <hi>found out a Divine Institution for the Popes Primacy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 42, 43, 44.</note> (This being so gross, as he could not father it upon him, but he should soon be detected) he brings himself off with this, <hi>This I confess, the Doctor doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly carry any further than the Combinations of a National Church and Primacy,</hi> that is, he says no such thing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When he doth find out some things in which the Churches are agreed, they are such things as the Church of <hi>England</hi> agrees with the Ancient, and most other Churches in, <hi>viz.</hi> Episcopacy and a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy; and it had been to the like purpose, if he had also shewed their <hi>Agreement in the great Doctrines of Christian Religion.</hi> And yet, even here he fails a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for he that concludes,<note place="margin">Page 44.</note> 
                  <hi>In a word, the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the</hi> English <hi>Clergy, and the</hi> Romanist, <hi>about the immediate Divine Right of Episcopacy is so full,</hi> &amp;c. doth before acknowledg that <hi>Ordination by Presbyters is granted in the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and regular,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 36, 37.</note> and that <hi>all those that hold</hi> the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Jurisdiction of the Pope, over the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church visible, do hold the Divine Right of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to be but mediate,</hi> [<hi>mediante Papa.</hi>]<note place="margin">Page 42.</note> So that he is gone from an Agreement of Churches to an Agreement between Persons; from a full Agreement in Opinion, to an Agreement in Government and Worship; from Worship, to some parts of Worship; from Demonstrations, to Inferences, and framed Propositions of his own; from an Agreement at last, to a Disagreement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:106689:6"/>
And now we may look back with some comfort, to his bold offer, and clear demonstration at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, when he saith,<note place="margin">Preface.</note> 
                  <hi>The Author hath with some: clearness demonstrated the Agreement of Opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Church of</hi> England-<hi>Men, and the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>to be so exact and full, that if the Government should so design, it were but</hi> dictum factum, <hi>according to their Doctrine; and a</hi> Cassandrian <hi>Peace might be patch'd up presently with</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>He advances, as if he were a kind of Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary; but it may be suspected, he that has this way of Demonstration, is not like to be very fortunate in the Negotiation.</p>
               <p>Thus much shall suffice for our Author's way of Demonstration, and his Attempt to shew <hi>the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and Church of</hi> Rome; leaving a fuller Answer to some of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Discourses, to <hi>an abler Pen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, yet there remains another part toward a <hi>just state of the Controversy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 2.</note> and that is (as he well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served) <hi>to let the World know how far these Churches differ,</hi> as well as <hi>wherein they are agreed:</hi> But that was a <hi>Province</hi> he had no mind to <hi>Prosecute</hi>; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tho more to the purpose, yet not so much to his design. For certainly, he that will demonstrate the Agreement to be <hi>full and exact,</hi> must either suppose there is no Difference; or if there be, that the Difference is not considerable enough to hinder the Agreement. But if there be a Difference, and the Difference in points Diametrically opposite and irreconcilable, it is to no purpose to shew their Agreement (were it so) to be full and exact in others. And that this is the case, and the Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment far greater than the Agreement, I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

to prove, and that not from an Author or two, or far-fetched Consequences, and forced Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, and dubious Expressions; but from suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Authorities, and the avowed Principles of both Churches.

               <p>In order to which I shall premise,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there are some Articles which both Churches do in express Terms agree in, called by our Author, <hi>the great Doctrines of Religion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Agreement. p. 2.</note>

But of these Articles it is to be observed, there are some which each party differs as much from the other in (when they come to explain themselves) as if there had been no agreement in Terms. Thus it happens in Articles, 3<hi>d,</hi> 7<hi>th</hi> and 15<hi>th</hi>; as shall afterwards in part be shewed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are other Articles, wherein both Churches do agree in the Sence, tho they differ in Terms; or that are not so much Controversies between Church and Church, as between private Doctors in each Church. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apology for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, done out of</hi> French <hi>into</hi> English, 1681. Part 4. Cap. 3. p. 135, 150.</note> Of this Opinion is a Learned Forreigner of the Reformed Religion, about the matter contained in Articles, the 10<hi>th</hi> and 17<hi>th, of Free will</hi>; and <hi>of Predestination and Election.</hi> Of the former, he saith, <hi>The difference that our Adversaries will object between them and us, upon this point of Free-will, is only imaginary, and a meer cavil.</hi> Of the latter, he concludes, <hi>Since we agree in the Fundamentals of this Doctrine (as we have already set forth); and that our Dissent is but with a few of their Doctors, it would not be very hard (I should think) to find out such a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as of Temperament, drawn from the Word of God, in proposing of these Opinions, and in Terms so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to their Sublimity, as all humble and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Spirits would find sufficient for their Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There are other Points which are matter of Liberty, and left undetermined in the Church of <hi>England</hi>; And so She doth receive into her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as well those that deny as affirm. But on the contrary, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106689:7"/>
several Points of this Nature to be Matters of Faith; and anathematized those that do not so receive them. Thus they are <hi>accursed</hi> by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that say,<note place="margin">Sess. 6. Can. 10, 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>We are formally justified by the Righteousness of Christ [the only formal cause of our Justification being the Justice of God</hi>; as its there declared, <hi>cap.</hi> 8.] or that <hi>we are justified by the alone Imputation of Christ's Righteousness</hi>: Or that <hi>shall say, Justifying Faith is nothing else than a trust or confidence in the Divine Mercy, forgiving Sins for Christs sake,</hi> &amp;c. In which, and the like, unless the Church of <hi>England</hi> will curse those whom She doth bless, and cast out of her Communion such as She receives into it, She can no more be reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than in those other Points that for the matter of them are held and declared by her self to be false and erroneous.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are Articles which the two Churches do in whole, or in part, so differ in, that the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> cannot be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; nor the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Such are most, if not all, of these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Articles; <hi>viz.</hi> Art. 6. <hi>of the sufficiency of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures for Salvation</hi>: Art. 9. <hi>of Original Sin</hi>: Art. 11. <hi>of the Justification of Man</hi>: Art. 13. <hi>of works before Justification</hi>: Art. 14. <hi>of works of Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>: Art. 15. <hi>of Christ alone without Sin</hi>: Art. 19. <hi>of the Church</hi>: Art. 20. <hi>of the Authority of the Church</hi>: Art. 21. <hi>of the Authority of General Councils</hi>: Art. 22. <hi>of Purgatory</hi>: Art. 24. <hi>of speaking in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in such a Tongue as the People understandeth</hi>; Art. 25. <hi>of the Sacraments</hi>; Art. 28. <hi>of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106689:8"/>
Art. 29. <hi>of the wicked which eat not the Body of Christ</hi>: Art. 30. <hi>of both Kinds</hi>: Art. 31. <hi>of the Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ upon the Cross:</hi> Art. 32. <hi>of the Marriage of Priests</hi>: Art. 34. <hi>of the Tradition of the Church</hi>: Art. 35. <hi>of the Homilies</hi>: Art. 36. <hi>of the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bishops and Ministers</hi>: Art. 37. <hi>of the Civil Magistrates.</hi> These, besides several others which our Articles do not expresly mention, (but are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the received Principles of our Church) are the <hi>Inconcileable Points</hi>; and which all the Wit and Charity in the World can no more thoroughly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, than Light and Darkness. How far this is true, and demonstrated to be so in the following Sheets, I shall leave to the Consideration of every intelligent Reader. In which I have proceeded with care and impartiality from Point to Point; laying down first the Doctrine of each Church from unquestionable Authorities, for my own Justification; and then for the ease of the Reader, I have summ'd it up, and set each in <hi>Opposition</hi> to the other. From all which I doubt not, but whatever Friendship may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained betwixt the Members of both Churches, as we are Fellow-Subjects, yet it will be evident, that there is no possibility of Agreement between them in Matters of Religion, or of making One Church of what are so manifestly Two.</p>
               <p>It's upon the last sort I am now to proceed; and the first of which in order, is the sixth Article of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
