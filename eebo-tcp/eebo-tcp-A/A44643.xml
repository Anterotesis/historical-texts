            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>The harmless Pleasures which soft Peace injoy'd;</l>
               <l>A mighty Stagg grew Monarch of the Heard,</l>
               <l>By all his savage Slaves obey'd, and fear'd:</l>
               <l>And while the Troops about their Soveraign fed,</l>

Still as he passeth by, they all remove,</l>
               <l>Proud in Dominion, Prouder in his Love:</l>
               <l>[And while with pride and appetite he swells;]</l>
               <l>He courts no chosen object, but compels:</l>
               <l>No Subject his lov'd Mistress dares deny,</l>
               <l>But yields his hopes up to his tyranny.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Long had this Prince imperiously thus sway'd,</l>
               <l>By no set Laws, but by his will obey'd;</l>
               <l>His fearful slaves, to full obedience grown,</l>
               <l>Admire his strength, and dare not use their own.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>One subject most did his suspicion move,</l>
               <l>That show'd lest fear, and counterfeited love;</l>
               <l>In the best Pastures by his side he fed,</l>
               <l>Arm'd with two large Militia's on his head:</l>
               <l>As if he practic'd Majesty, he walk't,</l>
               <l>And at his nod, he made not haste, but stalk't.</l>
               <l>By his large shade, he saw how great he was,</l>
               <l>And his vast Layers on the bended grass.</l>
               <l>His thoughts as large as his proportion grew,</l>
               <l>And judg'd himself, as fit for Empire too.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56418:4"/>
Thus to rebellious hopes he swell'd at length,</l>
               <l>Love and Ambition growing with his strength.</l>
               <l>This hid ambition his bold Passion showes</l>
               <l>And from a Subject to a Rival grows.</l>
               <l>Sollicits all his Princes, fearful Dames,</l>
               <l>And in his sight Courts with rebellious flames.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Prince sees this with an inflamed eye,</l>
               <l>But looks are only signes of Majesty:</l>
               <l>When once a Prince's Will meets a restraint,</l>
               <l>His power is then esteem'd but his complaint.</l>
               <l>His Head then shakes, at which th'affrighted Heard,</l>
               <l>Start to each side; his Rival not afear'd,</l>
               <l>Stands by his Mistress side, and stirs not thence,</l>
               <l>But bids her own his Love, and his Defence.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Quarrel now to a vast height is grown,</l>
               <l>Both urg'd to fight by Passion, and a Throne;</l>
               <l>But Love has most excuse, for all we find</l>

The Soveraign Stagg shaking his loaded head,</l>
               <l>On which his Scepters with his Arms were spread,</l>
               <l>Wisely by Nature, there together fix't,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Their heads now meet, and at one blow each strikes,</l>

               <l>Grew on his brows, as thick their Antlers stand</l>
               <l>Which every year kind Nature does disband.</l>
               <l>Wild Beasts sometimes in peace and quiet are,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>With equal strength they met, as if two oakes</l>
               <l>Had fell, and mingled with a thousand stroaks.</l>
               <l>One by Ambition urg'd, t'other Disdain,</l>
               <l>One to Preserve, the other fought to Gain:</l>
               <l>The Subjects, and the Mistresses stood by,</l>
               <l>With Love and Duty to crown Victory:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56418:5"/>
For all Affections wait on prosperous Fame,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>While thus with equall Courages they meet,</l>

               <l>And while one slydes, t'other pursues the fight,</l>
               <l>And thinks that forc't Retreat looks like a Flight:</l>
               <l>But then asham'd of his retreat, at length</l>

               <l>So somtimes one, then t'other Stag prevails,</l>
               <l>And Victory yet doubtfull holds the scales.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Prince asham'd to be oppos'd so long,</l>
               <l>With all his strengh united rushes on;</l>
               <l>The Rebel weaker, then at first appears,</l>
               <l>And from his courage sinks unto his fears.</l>
               <l>Not able longer to withstand his might,</l>
               <l>From a Retreat at last steals to a Flight.</l>

The mighty Stagg pursues his flying Foe,</l>
               <l>Till his own pride of Conquest made him slow;</l>
               <l>Thought it enough to scorn a thing that flyes,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Vanquish'd as he fled, turn'd back his sight</l>

               <l>Sometimes his wounds, as his excuse survay'd,</l>
               <l>Then fled again, and then look back and stay'd:</l>
               <l>Blush't that his wounds so slight should not deny</l>
               <l>Strength for a fight, that left him strength to flye.</l>
               <l>Calls thoughts of Love and Empire to his ayd,</l>

               <l>Thorough the Woods he rushes not, but glides,</l>

               <l>Asham'd to live, unwilling yet to loose,</l>

               <l>His antient passions now began to move,</l>
               <l>He thought again of Empire, and of Love:</l>
               <l>Then rouz'd himself, and stretch'd at his full length,</l>
               <l>Took the large measure of his mighty strength;</l>
               <l>Then shook his loaded head; the shadow too,</l>

Stooping to drink, he sees it in the streams,</l>

               <l>No accident but does alike proclaim</l>

               <l>He thinks upon his Mighty Enemy</l>
               <l>Circl'd about with Pow'r, and Luxury.</l>
               <l>And hop'd his strength might sink in his desires,</l>

               <l>Where he alone Commanded, and was Lord,</l>

               <l>He saw th' obeying Herd marching along,</l>

               <l>Want, takes false measures, both of power, and joys,</l>

               <l>Like exiles from their Native soils, though sent</l>

               <l>Here he enjoy'd, what 'tother could have there,</l>
               <l>The Woods as Shady, and the Streams as Cleer,</l>
               <l>The Pastures more untainted where he fed,</l>
               <l>And every night, chose out an unprest Bed.</l>

               <l>But then his lab'ring soul with Dreams was prest,</l>
               <l>And found the greatest wearyness in Rest;</l>
               <l>His dreadful Rival in his sleep appears,</l>
               <l>And in his Dreams again, he fights, and fears:</l>

               <l>Still half amaz'd, looks round, and held by fear,</l>

               <l>Not by a Substance, but a drowzy Thought,</l>
               <l>His ample sides he shakes, from whence the Dew</l>

               <l>Every weak Passion sometimes is above</l>
               <l>The fear of Death, much more the Noblest Love.</l>
               <l>By Hope 'tis scorn'd, and by dispair 'tis sought,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>In the mean time, the Conqueror injoy'd</l>
               <l>That Power by which he was to be destroy'd.</l>
               <l>How hard 'tis for the Prosperous to see,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>He like a careful Monarch, rais'd his Head,</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when the searcht-out Cause appear'd no more,</l>
               <l>Then from a Slave, he had o'recome before,</l>
               <l>A bold disdain did in his Looks appear,</l>
               <l>And shook his Aweful Head to chide their Fear.</l>

               <l>Shrink from the one, and from the other Fly;</l>

               <l>Unable now to rise, and less to fight,</l>
