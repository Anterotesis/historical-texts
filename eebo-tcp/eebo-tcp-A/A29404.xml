         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Witneſſes were called, and firſt the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Tarraſs;</hi> who deponed, that Mr. <hi>Robert Martin</hi> was ſent from <hi>London</hi> by the <hi>Pannel,</hi> and other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators there, to perſwade his Lordſhip, and ſeveral other <hi>South</hi> Country Gentlemen to riſe in Arms, ſecure <hi>Berwick,</hi> the Caſtles of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and <hi>Striveling,</hi> the Officers of State and Army; which being done, they were to have preſſed his Majeſty to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> to have ſitten, and to paſs the Bill of Excluſion; and many more things his Lordſhip very clearly deponed.</p>
            <p>The Advocates for the Pannel objected againſt the Earl of <hi>Tarras,</hi> that the could be no Witneſs, for he being <hi>Socius Criminis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carceratus &amp; ſub metu Mortis,</hi> and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted for the ſaid Crimes <hi>Regiam Majeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> the Act of <hi>Robert</hi> the Second and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law allowes no Witneſſes to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch Caſes.</p>
            <p>His Majeſties Advocate anſwered, that in Plots and Conſpiracies it was impoſſible to have proved the ſame, except ſuch Perſons were ſuſtained as Witneſſes; So the Lords repelled the Objection in reſpect of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and ſuſtained his Lordſhip a Witneſs.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Witneſs was <hi>Commiſſer Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe,</hi> who was brought from his Majeſties Caſtle of <hi>Blackneſs,</hi> by a Party of Horſe of the Lord <hi>Drumlanricks</hi> Troop, and deponed that the Pannel was preſent at ſeveral meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at <hi>London,</hi> and that he did contribute for ſending Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that he deſired he might be ſent to <hi>Holland</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Argile,</hi> with the ten thouſand pounds Sterling; and many more things to this Purpoſe and Effect.</p>
            <p>The third Witneſs was <hi>Murray</hi> of <hi>Phillip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haugh,</hi> and <hi>Scot</hi> of <hi>Gallouſheilds,</hi> who both deponed <hi>Conformes precedentibus in omnibus</hi> as to the riſeing of Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſties Advocate produced for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proof, the judicial Confeſſion of Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Carſtares</hi> before the Lords of the Privy Councel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Probation being cloſed, the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates on both ſides made very learned Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the Aſſize, <hi>(i. e.</hi> Jury) who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately thereafter, <hi>viz.</hi> at the hour of twelve at Night, did cloſe themſelves in, and having choſen the Earl of <hi>Strathmoir</hi> Chancellor, <hi>(i. e.</hi> Foreman) they roſe about three a Clock in the Morning, and at nine brought in their Verdict, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they found it proven that he was Art and Part in the Crimes libelled, and that he had concealed the ſame.</p>
            <p>Which being publickly read, and the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict thereafter cloſed by the ſaid Earl his Seal, the Sentence of Death was pronounced as followeth.</p>
            <p>Forſameckle as it is found by an Aſſize, that Mr. <hi>Robert Bailzie</hi> of <hi>Jerreſswood</hi> is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the particular Crimes mentioned in his <hi>Dittay,</hi> Therefore the Lords Juſtice General, Juſtice Clark, and Remanent Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of his Majeſties Juſticiarie, and I in their Names, decree and adjudge the ſaid Mr. <hi>Robert Bailzie</hi> to be taken to the Mercatt Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> this preſent 24th Inſtant of <hi>December,</hi> and there, betwixt two and four a Clock in the Afternoon, to be hanged on a Gibbet until he be dead, his Head to be cut off, and affi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed upon the Netherhow of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> his Body to be quartered, the one Quarter to be put upon the Tolbooth of <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> the other on <hi>Lanrick,</hi> the third on <hi>Aire,</hi> and the fourth on the Tolbooth of <hi>Glaſsgow,</hi> and Ordaines all his Lands and Rents, Goods and Gear, to be forefaulted to his Majeſties Uſe, his Arms torn and rent, his Coat Armor all to be razed out of the Lyon Books, ſo that he, nor none of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, ſhall bear Arms in time to come.</p>
            <p>The Sentence being given by ſound of Trumpet and Heraulds in their Formalities did tear his Coat of Arms in face of Court, trample the ſame under foot, and did caſt them in his face, and thereafter went to the Mercatt Croſs, and performed the reſt of the Solemnities uſual.</p>
            <p>Juſt before the Sentence he profeſſed he was never privy to any Conſpiracy againſt the Life of his Sacred Majeſty, Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any Perſon in the World, and that he never did deſign to ſubvert the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but what he had done, was for the Redreſſing of ſuch Grievances he thought were lying upon the Nation, and that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Innocently, and with a good Conſcience.</p>
            <p>After Sentence, all he ſaid was, That he had too ſhort a Time.</p>
            <p>At the Place and Time in the Sentence mentioned, he was Executed, ſaying very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on the Scaffold.</p>
