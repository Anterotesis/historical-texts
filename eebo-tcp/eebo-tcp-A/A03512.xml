            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For to the glory of God, and the singing of his glories, (no man dares deny) man was chiefly made. And what art performes this chiefe end of man, with so much excitation, and expression as Poesie? <hi>Moses, Dauid, Salomon, Iob, Esay, Ieremy, &amp;c.</hi> chiefly vsing that to the end abouesaid. And since the excellence of it cannot be obtained by the labor and art of man (as all easily confesse it,) it must needs be acknowledged, a diuine infusion. To proue which in a word, this distich, (in my estimation) serues something nearely:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Great Poesie, blind Homer, makes all see</l>
               <l>Thee capable of all Arts, none of thee.</l>

            <p>For out of him (according to our most graue and iudicial <hi>Plutarch</hi>) are all Arts dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, confirmed, or illustrated. It is not therfore the worlds vilifying of it, that can make it vile: for so we might argue, &amp; blaspheme the most incomparably sacred. It is not of the world indeed: but (like <hi>Truth</hi>) hides it selfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>it. Nor is there any such reality of wisdomes truth in all humane excellence, as in Poets fictions. That most vulgar &amp; foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish receipt of Poeticall licence, being of all knowing men to be exploded; (accepting it, as if Poets had a tale-telling priuiledge aboue others,) no Artist being so strictly, and inextricably confined to all the lawes of learning, wisedome, and truth, as a Poet. For were not his fictions composed of the sinewes and soules of all those; how could they differ farre from, and be combined with eternitie? To all sciences therefore, I must still (with our learned and ingenious <hi>Spondanus</hi>) preferre it; as hauing a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall commerce with the diuine Maiesty; embracing and illustrating al his most holy precepts; and enioying continuall discourse with his thrice perfect, and most comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble spirit. And as the contemplatiue life is most worthily &amp; diuinely preferred by <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> to the actiue; as much as the head to the foote; the eye to the hand; reason to sence; the soule to the bodie: the end it selfe, to all things directed to the end: quiet to motion; and Eternitie to Time; so much preferre I diuine Poesie to all worldly wisedome.

Which affirmation of his cleare vnmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednesse in all manner of learning; I make in contempt of that nastie obiection often thrust vpon me; that he that will iudge, must know more then he of whom he iudgeth; for so a man should know neither God nor himself.

               </gap> (according to <hi>Horace</hi> and other best lawgiuers to translators) it is the part of euery knowing and iudiciall interpreter, not to follow the number and order of words, but the materiall things themselues, and sentences to weigh diligently; and to clothe and adorne them with words, and such a stile and forme of Oration, as are most apt for the language into which they are conuerted. If I haue not turned him in any place fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (as all other his interpreters haue in many, and most of his chiefe places;) if I haue not left behind me any of his sentence, elegancie, height, intention, and inuention: if in some few places (especially in my first edition, being done so long since, &amp; following the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon tract) I be somthing paraphrasticall &amp; faulty; is it iustice in that poore fault (if they will needs haue it so) to drowne all the rest of my labour? But there is a certaine enuious Windfucker, that houers vp and downe, laboriously engrossing al the aire with his luxurious ambition; and buzzing into euery eare my detraction; affirming I turne <hi>Homer</hi> out of the Latine onely, &amp;c. that sets all his associates, and the whole rabble of my maligners on their wings with him, to beare about my empaire, and poyson my reputation.

               <p>The varieties of other reports touching this, I omit for length: and in place thereof, thinke it not vnfit to insert something of his praise, and honour amongst the greatest of all Ages; not that our most absolute of himselfe, needs it; but that such autenticall testimonies of his splendor and excellence, may the better conuince the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his maligners.</p>

In which labour, if where all others find discords and dissonances, I proue him entirely har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious and proportionate: if where they often alter, and flie his originall, I at all parts stand fast, and obserue it: if where they mixe their most pitiful castigations with his praises, I render him without touch, and beyond admiration: (though truth in her verie nakednesse sits in so deepe a pit, that from <hi>Gades</hi> to <hi>Aurora,</hi> and <hi>Ganges,</hi> few eyes can sound her:) I hope yet, those few here, will so discouer and confirme her, that the date being out of her darkenesse in this morning of our <hi>Homer;</hi> he shall now gird his Temples with the Sunne, and be confest (against his good friend) <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam dormitare.</hi> But how all Translators, Censors, or Interpretors, haue slept, and bene dead to his true vnderstanding; I hope it will neither cast shadow of arrogance in me to affirme, nor of difficultie in you to beleeue: if you please to suspend censure, &amp; diminution, till your impartiall conference of their paines and mine be admitted. For induction and preparatiue to which patience, and perswasion, trouble your selues but to know this: This neuer-enough-glorified Poet, (to vary &amp; quicken his eternal <hi>Poem</hi>) hath inspired his chiefe persons with different spirits, most ingenious and inimitable characters; which not vnderstood, how are their speeches? being one by another, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently, and necessarily knowne, as the instrument by the sound. If a Translator or Interpreter of a ridiculous and cowardly described person (being deceiued in his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter) so violates, and vitiates the originall, to make his speech graue, and him va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant: can the negligence and numbnesse of such an Interpreter or Translator, be lesse then the sleepe, and death, I am bold to sprinckle vpon him? or could I do lesse then affirme and enforce this, being so happily discouered? This therfore (in his due place) approued and explaned, let me hope my other assumpts will proue as conspicuous.</p>
               <p>This first and second booke, I haue wholly translated againe; the seuenth, eighth, ninth, and tenth bookes, deferring still imperfect, being all Englished so long since; and my late hand (ouercome wih labour) not yet rested enough to refine them. Nor are the wealthie veines of this holy ground, so amply discouered in my first twelue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as my last; not hauing competent time, nor my profit in his mysteries being so ample, as when driuing through his thirteenth and last books, I drew the main depth, and saw the round coming of this siluer bow of our <hi>Phoebus;</hi> the cleare scope and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of his worke; the full and most beautifull figures of his persons. To those last twelue then, I must referre you, for all the chiefe worth of my cleare discoueries. And in the meane space, I intreate your acceptance of some few new touches in these first. Not perplexing you in first or last, with anything handled in any other Interpreter, further then I must conscionably make congression with such as haue diminisht, mangled, and maimed, my most worthily most tendered Author.</p>

                  <hi>Virgil</hi> (vsing the like in imitation) is preferd to <hi>Homer;</hi> with what reason I pray you see.

               <p>Now compare this with <hi>Homers,</hi> but in my translation; and iudge if to both their ends, there be any such betternesse in <hi>Virgils:</hi> but that the reuerence of the scholler, due to the maister (euen in these his maligners) might well haue containd their lame censures of the Poeticall furie; from these vnmannerlie and hatefull comparisons. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, since <hi>Virgil</hi> hath nothing of his owne, but onely elocution; his inuention, matter, and forme, being all <hi>Homers:</hi> which laid by a man; that which he addeth, is onelie the worke of a woman, to netifie and polish. Nor do I, alas, but the formost ranke of the most ancient and best learned that euer were, come to the field for <hi>Homer;</hi> hiding all other Poets vnder his ensigne: hate not me then, but them; to whom, before my booke I referre you. But much the rather I insist on the sormer <hi>Simile;</hi> for the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, reddition, or application of the comparison; and is nothing so. For though it be all the reddition <hi>Homer</hi> expresseth; yet he intends two speciall parts in the application more; which he leaues to his iudicial readers vnderstanding, as he doth in all his other <hi>Similes:</hi> since a man may peruial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (or as he passeth) discerne all that is to be vnderstood. And here, besides the throngs of souldiers, exprest in the swarmes of Bees; he intimates the infinite number in those throngs or companies, issuing from fleete so ceaslesly, that there appeared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most no end of their issue: and thirdly, the euerie where dispersing themselues. But <hi>Spondanus</hi> would excuse <hi>Homer,</hi> for expressing no more of his application; with affirming it impossible; that the thing compared, and the comparison, should answer in all parts; and therefore alledges the vulgar vnderstanding of a <hi>Simile,</hi> which is as grosse as it is vulgar; that a similitude must <hi>vno pede semper claudicare.</hi> His reason for it as absurd as the rest: which is this, <hi>si ea inter se omnino respo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derent, falleret illud axioma, nullum simile est idem;</hi> as though the generall application of the compared, and the comparison, would make them any thing more the same, or all one; more then the swarmes of Bees, and the throng of souldiers are allone, or the same; for answering most aptly. But that a <hi>Simile</hi> must needs halt of one foote still; showeth how lame vulgar tradition is, especially in her censure of <hi>Poesie.</hi> For who at first sight, will not conceiue it absurd to make a <hi>Simile;</hi> which ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The incredible vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence suffered by <hi>Homer</hi> in all the rest of his most inimitable <hi>Similes,</hi> being exprest in his place, will abundantly proue the stupiditie of this tradition: and how iniuriously short his interpreters must needs come of him, in his streight and deepe places; when in his open and faire passages, they halt and hang backe so.</p>

To the consideration whereof, being of much importance, I referre you in his place.

And that you may something perceiue him before you reade to him in his seuer all places: I will, as I can, in haste, giue you him here together, as <hi>Homer</hi> at all parts presents him: viz. simple, wel-meaning, standing still affectedlie on telling truth, small, and shrill voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (not sweet, or eloquent, as some most against the haire would haue him) short spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, after his countrie the Laconicall manner: yet speaking thicke and fast, industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the field, and willing to be emploied.

               <p>Sometimes valiant, or daring, (as what coward is not) sometimes falling vpon sentence, and good matter in his speeches (as what meanest capacitie doth not?)

And here haue we a ruled case against our plaine and smug writers; that because their owne vnweildinesse will not let them rise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, would haue euery man grouel like the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: their fethers not passing the pitch of euery womans capacity.

Against which, and all these plebeian opinions, that a man is bound to write to euery vulgar readers vnderstanding, you see the great master of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The verse in question, I referre you to before, which sayes, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifying a stone of a handfull, or that with one hand may be raised and cast, spoken of before; and (here being vnderstood) shooke <hi>Hector</hi> at all parts, in striking him, and like a whirlwind wheeled or whirred about. Wherein he speakes not of bounding to the earth again, and raising a dust with his violent turnings: in which the conceit and life of his simile lies, but leaues it to his reader, and he leaues it to him: notwithstanding he vtters enough to make a stone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it; how stupidly soeuer all his interpreters would haue <hi>Hector</hi> (being strooke into a trembling, and almost dead) turne about like a whirlewind. I conclude then with this question: What fault is it in me, to furnish and adorne my verse (being his Translator) with translating and adding the truth and fulnesse of his conceit; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as like to passe my reader, as his, and therefore necessarie? If it be no fault in me, but fit, then may I iustly be said to better <hi>Homer?</hi> or not to haue all my inuention, matter and forme from him, though a little I enlarge his sorme? <hi>Virgil,</hi> in all places
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19863:118"/>

                  </gap>; which <hi>Spondanus</hi> sayes is altogether here to be vnderstood: as <hi>Eustathius</hi> words teach; for to offer so fierce a beast to <hi>Ioue</hi> as a Bore, he sayes is absurd: and cites <hi>Natalis lib. 1. cap. 17.</hi> where he sayes, <hi>Homer</hi> in this place makes a tame Sow sacrificed to <hi>Ioue;</hi> who was as tamely and simply deceiued as the rest. <hi>Eustathius</hi> reason for it, is, that <hi>sus</hi> is <hi>animal salax;</hi> and since the oath <hi>Agamemnon</hi> takes at this sacrifice to satisfie <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> (that he hath not toucht <hi>Briseis</hi>) is concerning a woman, very fitly is a Sow here sacrificed.

                  </gap> altered, and expounded <hi>suem.</hi> His reason for it, he makes nice to vtter, saying, he knowes what is set downe amongst the learned touching the sacrifice of a Sow. But because it is (he sayes) <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>nihil ad rem,</hi> (though as they expound it, tis too much <hi>ad rem</hi>) he is willing to keepe his opinion in silence; vnlesse you will take it for a splayed or gelded Sow; as if <hi>Agamemnon</hi> would innuate, that as this Sow (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing splayed) is free from <hi>Venus,</hi> so had he neuer attempted the dishonour of <hi>Briseis.</hi> And peraduenture (sayes <hi>Spondanus</hi>) you cannot think of a better exposition: when a worse cannot be coniectured, vnlesse that of <hi>Eustathius;</hi> as I hope you will cleerly grant me, when you heare but mine.

Holding it not altogether vnfit with this ridiculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of our Commentors, a litle to quicken you, and make it something probable, that their ouersight in this trifle, is accompanied with a thousand other errors in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our diuine <hi>Homers</hi> depth and grauitie. Which will not open it selfe to the curious austeritie of belabouring art, but onely to the naturall and most ingenuous soule of our thrice sacred Poesie.</p>
