            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ifty years since, or thereabouts, the name of <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> first began to be known: They are a Sect so carried away with their own fancies, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and colour of adhering to their own Natural Reason, that they deny the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of our Christian Faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which are indeed above Reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of Reason, but no way contrary to Reason. This Sect of all others I have ever most hated and detested; the rather, because they pretend Philosophy and humane learning to back and to second them: which I know to be otherwise, and so I hope I have made it appear, and by Gods grace I will yet make it more manifest: for about 45 years since I had a publick disputation against them, and not resting there, I did resolve to examine every Mystery of Faith, and every Miracle wrought
<pb facs="tcp:97249:3"/>
in confirmation of those Mysteries (for so it pleaseth God that works above natural power should witness the truth of words above natural knowledge) according to the Rules of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; and I began with the first, proving the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> from Paradise by Natural Reason. Not that I was able to prove the manner of the fall, as that it should be by tasting the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fruit, by the tempting of a Serpent; but I shewed the truth and certainty of his fall, by those many punishments of sin, which are yet extant, and may be seen in Nature. And about 40 years since I set forth a book to that purpose; and although I say it, I had then the approbation and encouragement of those whom we did esteem to be the most learned men, as Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Bishop <hi>Overall,</hi> Bishop <hi>Mountaine,</hi> and others. Then I proceeded to examine the rest of the Mysteries and Miracles, but especially the Wonders which <hi>Moses</hi> wrought in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whether they were sufficient assurances to the Natural man, for admitting and introducing the Mosaical Law. I did likewise examine the Resurrection of the dead, and the general Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and truly with these King <hi>James</hi> of blessed Memory was acquainted, and did not dislike them. I did then proceed to other Mysteries, and I did examine the several Visions of Scripture in <hi>Daniel, Ezekiel,</hi> the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> how far they did agree together, and how necessary it was that there should be such Visions, to withdraw the Jews from their carnal conceits, and their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of Temporals. And after Scripture, I did then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceed what had continually hapned in the Church, and in succession of times did serve for the proof of Christianity. This I could not conveniently do, unless together I should write an History of the Church, how God had planted and preserved it. And here I reduced it as much as possibly I could, to this Island, wherein we live: but when once I came to the year 1517. being the eighth year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. then I made Annals, and set down every year constantly and particularly, what was done in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> First, I set down the then present state thereof, what liberties they had in respect of our common Laws, what Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, and what great Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues; then what alteration did yearly befal the Church, and
<pb facs="tcp:97249:3"/>
so I had composed a great volume, which I did forbear to print in this regard; I thank God for it, I did never flatter any man, and I made a conscience to relate the truth; and doing it, I should have cast very foul aspersions upon some great Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which would have drawn much envy and hatred upon me whereupon I did resolve, that it should not be published, till after my death, and then it should serve as a Memorial of my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Labors, and as a Testimonial of my Faith and Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far I proceeded before the late Wars began. I hac then five several houses in my hand, and a little houshold-stuff in each house, (and now I have not one in all <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I thank God for it:) but in every house, what with fire and plundring together with other losses, my Notes and Writings miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (a just punishment of God upon me for my sins:) And in regard of my great age, I had thought never to have stirred any further, but to have prepared my self for my grave, and to desire God to be so merciful unto me, that I might die in quietness and peace, for my wants and troubles were great. And while I was thus resolved, it did plainly appear unto me, that the <hi>Socinians</hi> did increase; for I take no notice of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons, but of publick acts: Some have been que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned before the Parliament for denying the Trinity, and blaspheming Christ, yet I never heard that any were put to death, or greatly punished. I finde that the Fonts where we are baptized, and make profession of the Trinity, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, they are generally pulled down. I finde that the solemnity and joy at Christs Nativity, was forbidden; that Fasting in Lent, and sorrow at Christs Passion, were by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Order neglected; I found that all the Memorials of Christs Passion, the harmless <hi>Crosses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> were demolished; I found no honor was given to the Name of Jesus, no setled form of Prayer, but every one left to his own inventions; nor was there any time appointed for prayers, but onely a little prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for preaching; I found that in very many Parishes the Church-doors were locked up, and there was not so much as any publick Meeting, the Churches generally decaying, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repaired; that many men would not have their children Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized,
<pb facs="tcp:97249:4"/>
and that many were Dipped, it should seem into some other Church; for if they were Christians, it is impossible they should deny the virtue and efficacy of their first baptism, no more then they can deny the Original sin, derived unto them from their first Parents. And I will insist in one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, the White-thorn at <hi>Glastenbury,</hi> which did usually blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som on <hi>Christmas</hi> day, was cut down, yet I did not hear that the party was punished; certainly the Thorn was very extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, for at my being there, I did consider the place, how it was sheltred, I did consider the soyle, and all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, yet I could finde no Naturall cause; this I know, that God first appeared to <hi>Moses</hi> in a bramble bush; and that <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod being dried and withered did budde; and these were Gods actions, and his first actions; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Glastenbury</hi> was a place noted for holinesse, and the first Religious Foundation in <hi>England,</hi> and in effect it was the first dissolved, and therein was such a Barbarous inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as <hi>Aegypt</hi> never heard of the like; it may well be that this White thorn did then spring, and began to blossom upon <hi>Christmas</hi> day, to give a Testimony to Religion, that it might flourish in persecution, as the Thorn did blossom in the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est time of Winter (though the Sun in so great a distance might seem to want heat to bring forth the sap) so Religion should stand, or rather rise up, though Religious houses were pull'd down. I never heard nor read, that any Ancient Author did mention this Thorn, which certainly they had not omitted, if there had been any such thing; and by the growth of the Thorn, truly I did judge the age thereof to be much about the time of the dissolution of that Abbey.</p>
            <p>I do accuse no man, but if I may judge of the inward faith, by the outward tokens and signes; then I must needs say, that it is high time (the Church being now undermined,) to set up props, and to raise up Buttresses, for the support of Christian Religion; and I bethought my self to whose office this did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong, Christ being the head-corner-stone, laid the foundation of his Church, the Apostles did finish the building; they were very carefull in the choyce of their successors, the first
<pb facs="tcp:97249:4"/>
thing they did after the Ascension of Christ, was the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and choyce of Saint <hi>Matthias;</hi> and generally they had the Authority, <hi>Posuit vos regere Ecclesiam Dei.</hi> So then I did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the generall care of the Church did belong unto them; and where things were not setled, and that there was no superiour amongst them, that then it did belong to every one of them in particular, but especially to the Eldest; for so in the state of Nature, the <hi>primogenitus</hi> had ever the care of Gods service; and in the Law <hi>Aaron</hi> was the eldest brother to <hi>Moses,</hi> and the High-priest hood was setled on him, and his Sons; and here I bethought my self, that having been these ten yeers, the ancientest Bishop in the Province, I was bound in conscience to do my uttermost indeavour, to strengthen and support Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or at least to enter a Protestation, and to make a Publick confession of mine own Faith, that such as would might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my example; this I took as part of my duty, and office, to which I was bound, and obliged in conscience, and to have neglected this, I thought I should have greatly sinned; then I did think my self bound, to do the uttermost of my endeavours; and when I considered, that the custom of the Church in such like cases, hath ever been to implore <hi>Brachium seculare,</hi> to whom should I address my self, but to your Lordship, and humbly crave your assistance, and furtherance herein; and whereas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly there was a course of Law, for the punishment of open and scandalous blasphemers, and that there were severall writs, <hi>de Excommunicato capiendi de haretico comburendo, &amp;c.</hi> There being now no Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, that your Lordship would be pleased to be a means to the Honourable, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Judges, to supply those wants; and to settle a course, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by there may be a legall proceeding against these publick and scandalous blasphemers, according to the true intent of the Law. Thus both in composing this Treatise, and for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication thereof to your Lordship, I have done no more, then what I thought my self bound in conscience to perform, and the rather to express my joy in some things, which have lately hapned; for living here in the Church-yard of Saint <hi>Margarets</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> which was the Church proper to the Parliament,
<pb facs="tcp:97249:5"/>
for here they kept their thanksgivings, their humiliations, and all other their solemnities; when as in their time the Font was pulled down, and so continued demolished and in ruines, it is now set up again in a most decent and comely manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I hope it will be an example for other Churches to follow: so likewise they had a very solemn perambulation in Rogation week, according to the old manner; which had been omitted during the sitting of Parliament: and Holydayes begin to be kept; thus with joy and alacrity, not without hopes of good times to suceed, I thought fit to publish this Treatise, as containing the grounds of Christian Religion; for these are the two great and principall Mysteries, which all others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose; and herein if we should waver, in the least kinde, then Christian Religion would faile and come to nothing; and by the publishing of these, it will appear what satisfaction I gave in all the rest of the mysteries; for these are the hardest and most difficult, and as I have performed in these, so let men judge of the rest; and if God shall inable me, and that I may have any competency of meanes to subsist, together with the use of a library; I shall then proceed in the rest God willing.</p>
            <p>Thus much in generall, though I am a stranger, utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and never deserving the least favour from your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, yet I make bold to become a Petitioner. When I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to write the History of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> especially in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, wherein there was the greatest Alteration and Change; knowing that the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> (your Lordships great Unckle) was then in great favour; for I have seen the Archbishops, and the Lord Chancellor <hi>Audley,</hi> their Letters unto him, to desire his help in furthering their suits to the King; and that he was then the only man imployed, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in spirituall causes; for he did exercise the whole Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall jurisdiction under the King; and by virtue thereof, he took place of the Arch bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which never any subject did, and sat on the Bishops side in Parliament; I thought it very necessary and fit to hearken after his writings; and by the meanes of Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> the great Antiquary (now with God) I had the perusall of his study, where I read all his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="tcp:97249:5"/>
Notes, and Papers; and where I found that it was the Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who made that Order in the Church, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one should learn in the English Tongue the Apostles Creed: which may be some example and encouragement to your Lordship, to defend these mysteries of our Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which hath hitherto been my whole suit.</p>
            <p>Amongst other Letters to the then Lord <hi>Cromwell,</hi> I found one from <hi>John Fisher</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rochester,</hi> a man famous for his devotion, learning and courage, when he was in far greater distress then ever I was (I thank God for it;) the effect of the Letter was, To desire his help for his relief: the Letter is yet extant, and may be produced. What effect it took, I cannot say; but I do not finde that it was ever seconded with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Letter, which is usual in cases of distress, nor did the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop complain at the time of his execution, when he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed; and therefore I conceive he found some relief. This hath encouraged me to become a Suitor to Your Lordship. I shall not here acquaint you with any particulars, (for this were to be over-troublesome) but I call God to witness, that I know no man, nor have I heard of any man, that hath suffered so much, in such several kindes, so unjustly, in proportion, as my self have done (though things are onely known to God and my self) and I have as fair Testimonials for my innocency, as any man hath, or can have in this world. I have been now five years petitioning for a hearing, if at length by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships good favour, I might prevail, you should for ever oblige me, that either I might know my offence, or otherwise that I might have some means (out of mine own) to subsist: The hearing cannot possibly take up half an hour, and I hope to dispatch it in less then half a quarter: for I will demand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for what is past, but do as heartily forgive all men, as I desire God to forgive me. And I will likewise make this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in behalf of my Brethren the Clergy, that what hath been violently taken from them, their cause never heard, or what a Committee hath done, being no Court of Record, being not upon Oath, and their power lasting onely during the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that men upon slight pretences might not lose their
<pb facs="tcp:97249:6"/>
Freeholds, to the great prejudice of the Liberties and Laws of this Nation; and Sequestrations, which are but for a time, might not be continued for ever, contrary to their own nature, but that men, upon submission and satisfaction, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to their own possession, until some just cause be shewed to the contrary in a legal way. Hereby your Lordship shall do God good service, discharge your own conscience, you shall for ever engage them, and give an earnest of your Justice and compassion. So humbly craving pardon for my boldness, with my prayers to God for your health and happiness,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Do give God most humble thanks, that I had the happiness to have my education and breeding in your College, where I found the seeds of Religion, and learning, the good example of others, and truly many favours in mine own particular; I did ever resolve (in token of my thankfulness) to give you some memoriall, not of any great value or price, but onely out of a desire that I had, (wherewith I did acquaint some of your Fellowes) that you would conform your Studies to the present occasion and necessity of these Times; for whereas before your Studying of Philosophy, did only serve for your Disputations, and your keeping of Acts for your degrees; now I could wish, that they might tend to some practise, whereby they might be more usefull, and serviceable unto you in the course of your lives; and therefore I had thought to have given you all the Mathematicall Instruments, and some things which belong to Chymistrie, together with Optick Glasses, and Herballs, and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else did tend to the Practise of Philosophy; for seeing Man is not wholly spirituall; therefore I would not have him to content himself onely with the Theorie: the charge I confess had not been great, but whatsoever it was, I am now so utterly plundered, that as yet I am able to perform nothing.</p>
            <p>In stead of giving, I am now become a suitor unto you, while I was in your College I began a quarrell, and it was against the Socinians,

and the Antitrinitarians; and truly the rather for namesake, because our College is dedicated to the honour of the Blessed Trinity, and therefore we are bound both to the adoration, and to the defence of that high Mysterie; now in my old age upon some occasion, this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell is again renewed; and as it is usuall in all duels, to have a second, so I do desire your College to second me; and being very old, I cannot live long; <hi>for I have now been these nine and twenty yeers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Ancientest Bishop of your College</hi> I do therefore leave you this Legacy, to be the Heires and Successors in this my quarrell, and to continue a deadly fewd with the Socinians and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titrinitariants; and not only to spend your Inke, but to adventure your blood in the cause. Thus I have done my uttermost endeavour, I have desired the secular power to asssist me by way of punishment; and your selves in point of Learning, and Religion, to stand in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our Faith, and cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it concerns, as your souls health, so in effect no less then the foundation of your College.</p>
            <p>This is all my business, and here I should take my leave of you; but in truth out of my love and affection, I cannot so soon and so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily part with you; but I must claim the privilege of old men, to speak of things which are past; and by calling them to minde to renew them, and so to continue them, [<hi>ad perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi>] It is now much about 54 yeers since I came to your University: and even then both the Church and Learning had many enemies, and they raised up many malitions and false reports, yet during all my time, I may truly say, (for though I was a young Scholar, yet I might fee and know the actions and carriages of my governors) there was not an University in Christendom, nor any City or Corporation bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter governed; neither can I conceive, how it could be better governed, without Religious Vowes: And for our College in particular, I may truly say, that as the Members were not inferiour to any others, for their Learning, and Studies; so for their discreet carriage, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, for their wisdom, and Prudence, in worldly and temporall affairs, I did verily believe, that no society in <hi>England,</hi> whether of Churchmen, Lawyers, or Citizens, did exceed them: I was then in the hardest times, when the College in effect was new built; when we could not get chambers or lodgings, and the debts were great in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the building, yet then did they flourish exceedingly, and had much credit and reputation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97249:8"/>And because I was a Member of several Cathedral and Collegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Churches (which are now dissolved) lest posterity may hereafter blame them, and think their offence to be great, I shall therefore give them this Testimony, that I take God to witness, I did never see any thing amongst them, but what did proceed from Piety, Charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Goodness. I was a very diligent observer, and truly in their Chapters things past with as much wisdome and discretion, as ever I did see business pass in the Lords House of Parliament. What charity did we shew to our Tenants, in accepting such small Fines? by our counsel we sometimes made them good husbands; very often we prevented the sale, and preserved the Lease for the true Heirs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if Orphans: And in a word, they lived better under us, as Tenants, then ever they will do as they are Land-lords; and I do verily believe, that if the Parliament had been pleased to imploy the Members of the Church, in stead of their Committees, Surveyors, and other Officers, (who were the very worst of men) that with renewing Leases, and putting years into lives; they would have raised as great sums of money, (yet reserving the Rents and Inheritance to the State) as now they have done by selling the Inheritance; and truly we were very provident, in improving the Church revenews; I am at this time in wants, I would desire of God no more to live upon then what I have raised, and improved in Church Rents; and what I have done together with others, that I might have but according to my propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so that in a maner <hi>pro tanto,</hi> we were in effect Founders of the Church; for we might have converted our improvement to our own private uses.</p>
            <p>And that posterity might judge of the Clergy, at this time, that we were not so faulty, or wanted courage, which might occasion our Ruine, there are two Common Lawyers who have done very ill offices to the Church, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pryn;</hi> and truly I did once think to have answered them both: but when I considered that we did differ in the course of our Studies, in our Method, in our Style, so that we should not have the same or the like weapons to encounter each other, I did therefore forbear; yet some of my intimate friends did it. For Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> he is pleased to write as bitterly as he could against Bishops, yet could he not charge any one of them with Corruption or Bribery, or any great sin; no man is accused for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb facs="tcp:97249:9"/>
or unworthiness: yet it cannot be denied, but the Gentlemen who were imployed for the buying of Impropriations (whereof I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> was a principal man) did tempt Bishops with bribes, with no other intent, but to accuse them; and to me in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular they sent twenty Angels, in the business of <hi>Cicester,</hi> but I thank God for it, I had the grace to refuse it. If a man were to write against other Professions, suppose the Lawyers (as God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid any man should) he might have found a hundred times more, and worse faults, then Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> hath done against Bishops. And on the contrary I dare boldly say, that many Bishops in their own particular persons, have done so many acts of Piety, of Charity, of Goodness, as all the enemies of the Church, taken together, have not done the like. They that did impeach us of high Treason, onely for entring a Protestation, they would never have spared us, if they could have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ound any just cause of complaint against us.</p>
            <p>Yet I confess that God would never have permitted us to have suffered in such a manner, as we have done, had we not provoked him with our sins; and that I may be our own accuser, I think our greatest offence did consist in these two things: First, that many of us did not spend our Church-means in a Church-like manner, but converted them to our own private uses, or otherwise misimployed them, therefore God justly takes them away, and permits Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; we our selves having first offended in the same kinde: for certainly Church-means should have relation as well to the uses, as to the Persons; and a Church-man in mis-spending them, commits Sacriledge. And whereas many excuse it in regard of their Wives and Children; God forbid, but regard should be had of them, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> still with moderation: I cannot excuse the excess of Apparel, and some other courses of expence. Yet this I must te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>or a truth, that speaking privately with some Bishops, they told me (and I beleeved them) that they laid not up one farthing of their Bishopricks: and this may appear, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>or many of them died very poor, as <hi>Worcester, Hereford, Peterborough, Bristol,</hi> and not unlike but others will do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o.</p>
            <p>Another great fault in the Church was, the intolerable abuse of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction; therefore God hath made us now unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any Jurisdiction, <hi>so just and wonderful is God in all his</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:97249:9"/>
               <hi>Judgements.</hi> I confess in mine own particular, I did as much desire and labour to reform it, as any man could do, yet I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prevail. Herein a little to excuse the Church, I have it, and can produce it at this time, under the Kings own Hand and Seal, wherein he forbids that any Church-man or Priest in holy Orders, should be a Chancellor; and this was the occasion of all the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Spiritual Court: for the Judges at the Common Law have their Pensions and Allowances, but Chancellors have none at all, they live onely upon the Fees of the Court, and fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> them to dismiss a cause, it was to lose so much blood: Now if they be naugh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> in themselves, then they must for their own advantage and prosit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have Instruments and Agents accordingly; so the Registers, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Apparators, they were <hi>pessimum genus hominum.</hi> Whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the Spiritual Court was onely governed by Church men and Priests, as it ought to be, (and hath ever been so heretofore) they ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> their Spiritual Benefices and Dignities to live upon, and did scorn the Fees of the Court: besides, the holiness of the Profession kept them from bribing and corruption. Little do men think how much they suffer by this one position, <hi>That Church-men should not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose in Civil and Moral affairs:</hi> Whereas formerly Bishops and Church-men were onely trusted with Last Wills and Testa ments, and granting out Administrations: and certainly, if ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> be any honesty amongst men, it must be supposed to be rather in them then in others; but there having been such an abuse, it must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that <hi>God is most just in all his wayes,</hi> and what hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> befaln us, it is according to the deserts of our sin.</p>
            <p>And now at length, my good Brethren, I will be no further troublesome unto you, but onely make this small motion, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds out of my love: Your Statutes do allow the Fellows to travel beyond Seas, to see the state of the Christian world, to better their experience, whereby they may be fitter to do the Church and the State service at home. Now I would fain adde some encouragement i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> this kinde, and perswade you to be forward, thereby to learn Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and to enable your selves to do the State service; and while you are in your Travel, though you are not publickly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet to do your Countrey what good office you can, by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. This is my suit to the Fellows in general: but I do
<pb facs="tcp:97249:10"/>
earnestly intreat the Master and the Seniors, that they would be so far from abating any part of their allowance, as that they would rather give them some addition towards their charge, besides all brotherly assistance and furtherance. This is the onely motion which I make: but if any of your Members should offer me his help in my Study, now that mine own sight and memory do fail me (for I would very fain finish my intended course, to give satisfaction to Natural Reason, in all the Mysteries of Christian Religion) truly, if ever God should enable me, I would reward him. So <hi>GOD BLESSE YOU ALL.</hi> I rest,</p>

Law, and a Rule to square out our actions, necessary it was that after the Rule given, there should be some pattern to exemplifie the rule. <hi>Praecepta docent, Exempla excitant;</hi> the Rule is imperfect without an Example.</p>
            <p>But before the time, the fulnesse of time, wherein God appeared in our<note place="margin">The word of God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ.</note> flesh, there could be no example of true holinesse and obedience to Gods Law, and therefore for the upshot and conclusion of the Law, in the Eclipse of the Prophets, <hi>Cum silentium contineret omnia, &amp; nox in suo cursu me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iter haberet, omnipotens sermo tuus, Domine, exiliens de coelo à rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus sedibus durus Debellator in mediam exterminii terram prosiluit: Sap:</hi> 18. here is the example annexed to the rule, an example in whom dwels the fulnesse of the deity, all the treasures of Gods wisdom, from whom as from a fountain the written law is derived, to whom as to an Ocean, the whole scope of the law is directed, thus is the Rule perfected by the example; the written word serves for a precept, the begotten word serves for a president; the yoak is made easie, the burden is light: for wherein the law might seem obscure and difficult, that shall now easily appear by the practise, example and imitation of this word, <hi>for this word was made flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Austin</hi> hath well observed, that before such time as the word<note place="margin">Man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulates with God.</note> was made flesh, man in the pride and presumption of his own heart, might have used some excuse unto God; Lord, why hast thou commanded such strict lawes, such as are opposite to the inclination of nature, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving of wrongs, the chastising of the flesh, the mortifying of passions, continuall repentance and sorrow; whatsoever thou didst unto man, thou didst it with the greatest facility and ease, <hi>verbo virtutis tuae,</hi> thou spak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the word, and all things were created; but whatsoever thou requirest of man, it is done with the greatest difficulty and labour: Thus (in effect) especially considering the manner, thou seemest to require more of man, then thou hast done unto man; here then there is no proportion.</p>
            <p>But behold, to stop the mouthes of Blasphemers, that sin might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable,<note place="margin">Blasphemers suppressed.</note> behold the word is made flesh, God hath entred the Lists of our misery, and hath run thorough the whole course of our Pilgrimage, in <hi>sudore vultus,</hi> in the sweat of his browes, with watchings, and fastings, with labour, and passions, he hath fulfilled the law, and having perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in his own person, it is no wrong or injustice to impose the same law upon his vassals and creatures, <hi>for the word was made flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Man as he totally proceeds from God, so is he totally directed to God,<note place="margin">Whole man is made capable of God.</note> but before such time as the word was made flesh, it should seem only the better part of man, the soul and the understanding, were capable of Gods word; Alas what becomes of the sensible part? shall the body and the flesh be excluded? if it lookes for a portion in glory, needs it must have some earnest in grace; body and soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are both creatures alike, they are both parts of man alike.

            <p>But leaving all preambles, I will tie my self more strictly to the words of<note place="margin">The division of the Text.

I will first set them down as the Church receives them; then I will illustrate them by naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the grounds of Philosophie; and lastly I will give sufficient assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for the truth of them: for I will produce miracles above natural power, for confirmation of mysteries above naturall knowledge, which is an abundant satisfaction.</p>

            <p>You shall then observe, that both Saint <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> they use<note place="margin">The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison between both.</note> the same first word in both their writings, <hi>in principio,</hi> in the beginning; only with this difference, that <hi>Moses</hi> intended the beginning of time, where first God began the Creation, and set the first wheel on going; but our Apostle and Evangelist, like an Eagle, makes a higher flight, and looking upon the Sun, and fastning his eyes thereon, is no way daunted (though the Sun be the master piece of the creation, which other creatures cannot behold) but aymes at a higher beginning, <hi>In aeterno principio aeternitatis,</hi> in the eternall beginning of eternity; (you must give me leave, is sometimes I speak in unusuall termes, when neither the words, nor apprehension of man, can otherwise serve to express, or conceive the mysterie.)</p>
            <p>And to what can the regeneration or new birth of man, be better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled<note place="margin">They both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</note> or compared, then to the creation? See then how they agree, and concur together; After the creation of the heaven and the earth, and the confused masse of the waters, the first thing created for ornament and beauty, was light, <hi>Gen:</hi> 1. 3 Light, is but an accident, and must presuppose a substance, and though it be light, yet in respect of the substance, it is in effect but a shadow; Saint <hi>John</hi> therefore doth better express this light together with the fountain of this light, in the fourth verse of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, speaking of the Word, <hi>In him was life, and the life was the light of men;</hi> and as in the creation, before this light was created, the state of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97249:12"/>
world is described by <hi>Moses</hi> Gen. 1. 2. <hi>And darkness was upon the face of the deep,</hi> which is most truly explicated by Saint <hi>John</hi> in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse of this Chapter, <hi>The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth it not,</hi> this darkness betokeneth the state of sin, the death of sin, as <hi>Adam</hi> soon after his creation committed sin, whereupon followed the sentence of death.</p>
            <p>And out of this death of sin, it was the great mercy of God, that man<note place="margin">Moses.</note> should be awakened, and that by degrees, first, with the sound and noyse of the law, which came with Thunder and Lightning, to strike terror into man, as the bellowing of beasts, designed for slaughter and sacrifice, might shew them their own condition, <hi>for death is the wages of sin;</hi> and thus far <hi>Moses</hi> proceeds.</p>
            <p>Man being now rowsed &amp; a little awakened with this great sound of the<note place="margin">Iohn Baptist.</note> Law, trembling and fearing he listens, and finds that this sound becomes a voice, <hi>Vox homine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sonat,</hi> the voice betokens a man; and here after the great terror and threatnings of the law, he begins to conceive hope, that he may find bowels of compassion, and then expects mercy and pity: This was the office of Saint <hi>John Baptist,</hi> whose time was an <hi>interregnum</hi> between the Law and the Gospel; and who was <hi>Vox clamantis in deserto,</hi> the voyce of a cryer in the wilderness described by S. <hi>John</hi> in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verse of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have heard the sound of the law, and the voice of a Cryer;<note place="margin">Christ.</note> but all this will not suffice to discover the secrets and mysteries of God; we must then listen, and we shall find that this voyce doth tend and end in a <hi>word;</hi> and that this word may be fitted to mans capacity, it is necessary that this word be made flesh, <hi>Verbum caro,</hi> and <hi>in him should dwell all the treasures of Gods wisdom;</hi> And as this word was of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary condition, so it is necessary that there should be tongues of an extraordinary nature and form, fit to express this word, <hi>Linguas attulit qui pro verbo venit,</hi> and this was the holy Ghost, who came down in the form of fiery cloven tongues to testifie of this word; and here you have the full hight and perfection of the state of grace; and this is the scope, and the object of Saint <hi>John,</hi> which is implyed in his name, for it signifies the grace of God; So that <hi>Moses</hi> comes as far short of Saint <hi>John,</hi> as time doth<note place="margin">Saint <hi>John</hi> transcends <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
               </note> of eternity, and in other respects, especially for the object, Saint <hi>John</hi> as far exceeds <hi>Moses</hi> as the fruit doth the blossom, or the substance the type, or the body the shadow; <hi>Moses</hi> by a propheticall spirit, and speciall illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination describes the creation of the world, and the making of man; and so descends downwards, and writes only the History of his own time; but our Apostle transcends, and as he begins with the eternity of Christ, so in the Revelations, he prophesies of the Church, even to the worlds ends, and after the dissolution of this world, then to remain glorious for all<note place="margin">The heavy judgements ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying the law.</note> eternity. And as they had several ends, so they proceeded severall ways; <hi>Moses</hi> according to the office of a Law-giver sets down many judgements
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97249:12"/>
of God upon the committing of the first sin, as the sentence of death, the expulsion out of Paradise, the murder of <hi>Abel,</hi> the vengeance upon <hi>Cain,</hi> the deluge, the confusion of tongues, the burning of Sodom, the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Egypt, besides the heavy yoak of Gods own law, that they should begin with circumcision, the shedding of bloud, that they should be so many in number, commanded with such strict observances, with such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere punishment, and notwithstanding all this, yet could he not so much prevaile, as to bring the Israelites into the land of promise.</p>
            <p>But our Apostle Saint <hi>John,</hi> according to the nature of an Evangelist, in<note place="margin">The Gospell accompanyed with works of mercy.</note> every page brings many tokens, signes, and assurances of Gods mercy, and goodness; they are so many, that I will not reckon them: and as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the creation, man committed sinne, so in our regeneration, he that knew no sin, became a sacrifice for sin. Mans nakednesse did then appear, but now he is clothed with Christs righteousness; Paradise was then lost, but now he recovers a better inheritance; and that it might appear, how in every point and parcell a full restitution should be made, as in Paradise there was the tree of life, and pleasant fountains, and waters; so the like are described in the heavenly Jerusalem; as Paradise was kept shut by an Angell, with a fiery sword, so on the contrary the heavenly Jerusalem hath many doores, all standing wide open, there is free entrance, none are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, as you may read in the latter end of the Apocalypse, besides those frequent and daily works of mercy practised by Christ, whose custome was <hi>deambulare benefaciendo,</hi> he had no other imployment, but onely to doe works of mercy curing all manner of diseases, feeding many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands raising the dead, blessing sanctifying, and teaching men in the wayes of salvation; and to reckon them up in particular were endless, onely I conclude with our Apostle, in the last words of his Gospell, where he confesseth that the world would not contain the bookes, that might be written of Christs Acts.</p>
            <p>Thus our Apostle doth every way inclose and incompass <hi>Moses,</hi> and so far doth the last Evangelist exceed the first Law-giver, both in the object whereof they treat, (for the world was created of nothing, but the word was begotten in the understanding of God,) not six thousand years are yet past, since the world was created; but the word was begotten from all eternity: so <hi>Moses</hi> ends with his own time but our Apostle proceeds to the eternity of the Church, &amp; by comparing the first pen-man of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">The great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ending of Scripture.</note> with the last, it is memorable to consider the difference between the beginning of Scripture, and the end of Scripture, between <hi>Genesis,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalipse;</hi> for it points out the whole course &amp; progress of Christianity, that man was first created in happiness, then he commits sin, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expelled Paradise, untill justly for his sin passing through a vale of misery, God takes mercy on him, becomes his Shepherd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> guides him with his grace, dies for his sin, and in the right and virtue of his own
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97249:13"/>
passion conducts him to the heavenly Jerusalem, where you may see the tree of life, the water of life, and no longer darkness, or the state of sin; and so man attaines a far better condition, then what was lost in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, as you may read in the last of the Apocalypse; which I confess was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured out in the Mosaicall law, for upon the death of the high Priest, the banished men returned, and were restored to their own inheritance; so by the death and Passion of Christ our high Priest, there was purchased a full restitution of Paradise, implyed in that heavenly Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>Having thus compared the first pen-man of Scripture with the last,<note place="margin">Of the name of <hi>John</hi> how imposed upon Saint <hi>John Baptist.</hi>
               </note> let us now take our Apostle Saint <hi>John</hi> more particularly; and first for the very name of <hi>John,</hi> which signifies the grace of God, it was given by a Miracle to <hi>John Baptist;</hi> &amp; he that imposed the name, old <hi>Zacharie,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately received the benefit, for he was instantly restored to his speech, as an argument of the cessation of the law, and an inchoation of the state of grace to be suddenly put in execution, as it was already in part begun; for an earnest thereof was given, when as <hi>John Baptist</hi> in the wombe did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press joy, as it were in reverence saluting Christ in the virgins womb; &amp; then he became the immediate forerunner of Christ; and what the Prophets spake a far off, and somewhat obscurely, he pointed out Christ with his finger, <hi>Ecce Agnus Dei,</hi> and had the honour to be Christs ghostly Father, in Baptizing him, preparing the way for Christ, by preaching repentance; and by his strict and austere life gave a good example of mortification, sending his Disciples to Christ, and himself suffering Martyrdom in the execution of his office, for reprehending <hi>Herod;</hi> and then did Christ express sorrow, and mourn for his death, giving him an honourable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony.—</p>
            <p>Thus did the grace of God appear in <hi>John Baptist,</hi> according to his<note place="margin">A compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of Saint <hi>John Baptist,</hi> with Saint <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist.</note> name, but much more in our Saint <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist; for though <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was greater then the old Prophets, yet he that is least in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven is greater then he, much more the beloved Disciple, who leaned on the bosom, and pointed out the eternall generation of Christ, which is a work of much more excellency, and difficulty, then to point him out in the wombe. Our Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had the honour to be the onely Prophet of the New Testament, the forerunner of Christs second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in glory, which is described in the Apocalypse; and which is much more admirable, then to be a forerunner of Christs first coming in our flesh. Our Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was present at the transfiguration of Christ, where he did see the glory of God; and as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were there transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured, no doubt but our Apostle might likewise be transfigured, and have an earnest of his reall and actuall enjoying of Gods glory, besides those many visions which he had in the Apocalypse, as a farther and successive confirmation, for the assurance of his possession; and these are the great favours and graces of God, which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tly implyed in the name of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:97249:13"/>
Thus far for our Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist in comparison with <hi>Moses,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and such as went before him; now for such as did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him in respect of the rest of the Apostles.</p>
            <p>He was the youngest Brother of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle, both sons of<note place="margin">The parents of Saint <hi>John,</hi> and how he was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to be an Apostle.</note> 
               <hi>Zebedee,</hi> their Mother <hi>Mary Salome</hi> recommended them to Christ desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him that one might sit on the right hand, &amp; the other on the left hand in his kingdom: which requests did savour of much weakness, that she should presume so far to make such a suit, considering their unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and how unfit it was that they should encompass and monopolize Christ on every side; yet proceeding out of the great love and affection of a Mother, Christ gave but a slight reprehension, and in a sort yeelded to her request; for these two brethren were ever in speciall favour with Christ, and ever imployed in the greatest actions, suppose in Christs transfiguration, which did betoken the kingdom of Christ, or the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Church in heaven, and therefore it was in the Mount, but below was S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or the Rock upon whom the Church should be built; and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none other then present but Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> surely they might be said to be sup-porters or butresses on either side, both on the right hand, and on the left hand, to uphold the building, while Christ doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reside in his Church.</p>
            <p>But because the transfiguration was not a kingdom, having but a short<note place="margin">How his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers desire was accomplished.</note> time of continuance therfore it may be the more fitly understood in regard Saint <hi>Iames</hi> was the first of al the Apostles who suffered martyrdom, some very few years after the ascension of Christ, and so being first admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, in regard of precedencie he might be said to have the first place, or to sit on the right hand of Christ; and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> as being the last A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle that dyed, for he lived almost 70 years after the ascension of Christs, even to the beginning of the second Century, because the reward of his glory was so long deferred, therefore Christ admitted him as the beloved Apostle to lean on his bosome, and no doubt nearest the heart, on the left side, and so was the Mothers desire accomplished.</p>
            <p>Of all the Apostles our Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> had the prerogative to be called the<note place="margin">Saint <hi>Johns</hi> prerogatives above other Apostles.</note> beloved Apostle, in so much that the great Apostle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> made him a mediator and intercessor for him, what he himself durst not presume to ask, he beckoned to him to know of Christ; and further above all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, he had the happiness and courage to be present at the sacrifice of Christ, together with the Blessed virgin mother, whilest Saint <hi>Peter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed Christ, and all the rest of the Apostles fled for fear of the Jewes, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> alone was the onely Apostle, there to assist, as a Deacon, or a Priest, or a servant to the high Priest, in offering up himself a sacrifice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the holy Altar of his Crosse; and as a token of the great love of Christ to him, and as a reward for his observance and attendance, at the Crosse, as the mother of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> recommended him unto Christ, so Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97249:14"/>
him to his own blessed mother the virgin, he adopts him, and makes him her son, and commits her to his custody, which as it was a high honour unto him, so it argues a greater trust reposed in him then in others.</p>
            <p>His love and observance still continued after the death of Christ, for when it was known that Christ was risen, then did both Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> run together to the Sepulcher, but Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> came thither first S. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 4. and when they were in the ship together, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was the first man that knew Christ, S. <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 7. After the ascension of Christ,<note place="margin">After Christ he did adhere to Saint <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </note> he did ever most entirely adhere to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and did accompany him to the Temple, where the lame man was cured <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 1. Then they were joyn'd in Commission to goe together to Samaria <hi>Act.</hi> 7 And that I may yet further adde to stir up our thankfulness; he was an Evangelist of the<note place="margin">Saint <hi>John</hi> was the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist of the Gentiles.</note> Gentiles, as may appear by the manner of his speech, for he never names the Passeover, but he expresseth it that it was a feast of the Jewes, which if he had written expressely to the Jewes there needed no such explication, as being sufficiently known unto them, thus in S. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 13. 6. 14. 55. Therefore by all likelyhood he wrote to them that might be ignorant of that feast; it appears likewise by the translation of some words, whereof we have three examples in this very first Chapter of Saint <hi>John;</hi> as verse the 34. <hi>Rabbi</hi> is interpreted <hi>Master,</hi> verse 41. <hi>Messias</hi> is interpreted <hi>Christ,</hi> v. 42. <hi>Cephas</hi> is interpreted <hi>Peter,</hi> which interpretation had been needless, if S. <hi>John</hi> had written to the Jewes, for they spake Syriack, and understood Hebrew, and therefore needed not any such interpretation, but the Gentiles who were strangers, and knew not the language, they needed the interpretation.</p>
            <p>Next the manner of speech used by our Apostle, as the word was with<note place="margin">The occasion of writing his Gospell.</note> God, and God was the word, they seeme to savour of Platonicall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, which hath much of <hi>Ideas,</hi> and certainly the Platonicks had it by tradition from the Jewes, <hi>Faciamus ad imaginem nostram:</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was the Apostle of the Gentiles, and therefore did use quotations out of heathenish Poets, so Saint <hi>John</hi> being the Evangelist of the Gentiles, in the Apocalypse, he describes the heavenly Jerusalem, with some rites and solemnities used by the heathens in their triumphs, as the wearing of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, &amp;c. whereby may appear what use is made of human learning in Theologie; so much are we beholding to this Evangelist above others, who living very long, and in his time there beginning some heresies to arise, as <hi>Cerinthus</hi> and the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> who denyed the Trinity, (though the Church had ever beleeved the Trinity, as may appear by the profession of our faith made in our Baptisme,) the Bishops of <hi>Asia,</hi> where Saint <hi>John</hi> lived, and was their superiour, became earnest suitors unto him, to write his Gospell, both for the confutation of the Hereticks then being, and for the prevention of the future; this Saint <hi>John</hi> did at their request, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97249:14"/>
done upon that occasion, therefore he was more exact, and more ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate in that one mysterie, then the rest of the Evangelists were.</p>
            <p>If you aske how Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> above others should have such an exact knowledge of their mysteries; surely in regard of the heresies then rising,<note place="margin">How he might come to the knowledge of this mysterie.</note> and the necessity of those times, God did more enlighten him, as no doubt he doth his holy Catholick Church to this day. Some may conceive, that because our Apostle was present at Christs Transfiguration, where <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> the Law and the Prophets were transfigured, that such Apostles as were then present, were a little transfigured and might see the glory of God, though Christ for the present did forbid them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale those mysteries: yet our Apostle living some 70 years after, might make them known, especially being the beloved Apostle, and leaning on the bosom, he might suck out these mysteries, and might know more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, then were opened to others.</p>
            <p>And it is not unlike, but he might have a greater knowledge from the blessed virgin mother, being appointed by Christ to be her son; to whom the Angell <hi>Gabriel,</hi> was sent in a message of the Annunciation. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly other mysteries were then imparted &amp; revealed to her; especially the blessed Trinity; as conducing much to the incarnation: for Persons being supposed in the Deity, you may the more easily beleive, that one of those Persons, (that is) the Son of God, might become the Son of Man; and Persons thus supposed, it seems the lesse strange, that one Person should satisfie, while the Godhead receives satisfaction for sin; so that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in regard of Persons, might both offer sacrifice, and receive the oblation.</p>
            <p>And it is further observed in the blessed virgin, that of all others, she<note place="margin">Saint <hi>John</hi> might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by the blessed virgin.</note> did most observe Christ, and laid up his sayings in her heart, as she did conceive him in her heart, before she conceived him in her womb; and she never forsook him, no not at the Crosse; Now it is the office, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a mother, to instruct her son: especially such a son, as was so recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto her, as our Evangelist was, and to Catechise him in private, though not in publick; for women must be no teachers in the Church, (in regard of their sex) and therefore as soon as the blessed virgin, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the holy Ghost, for her own private sanctification, there is no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mention made of her in the <hi>Acts,</hi> nor in the Epistles; but there the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles wholly intend the conversion of Nations.</p>
            <p>But for this great mysterie of the Trinity, in my poor judgement, it is<note place="margin">At the annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation there was implyed the Trinity.</note> intimated at the Annunciation; for mark the message of the Angel, <hi>That she had found favour with God,</hi> that she should bring forth a Son; and why may not this Son imply as well the Son of God, as the Son of the woman? God is every way truth, and nothing but truth; and if in the same word, there is involved a double truth, this is most agreeable to Gods wisdom; and how far the Son of God is here signified, that which followes may make it manifest, that his name shall be <hi>Jesus or Emanuel,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97249:15"/>
               <hi>that he shall be great,</hi> and <hi>shal be called the Son of the Highest,</hi> Luke 1. v. 31, 32. And then followes in the 35. verse, the <hi>holy Ghost, and the power of the Highest shal over shadow thee;</hi> and here is the third person in the Trinity; for is it credible, that the Angel coming upon such a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, that he should be so sparing in his relation, as that he should discover no other mystery, which might tend to strengthen and illuminate her faith, to raise up her hope, to increase the measure of her love, and thereby to make her a fitter Temple, wherein the Godhead might dwell bodily.</p>
            <p>Thus having compared our Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> with <hi>Moses,</hi> with Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and the rest of the Apostles; and from whence, and upon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion he might know this mysterie above others; that so being revealed to him, they might be received with greater reverence, and work the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per impression: now let us a little consider him in himself. He is figured<note place="margin">Saint <hi>John</hi> an Eagle.</note> unto us in the form of an Eagle. An Eagle hath these properties, both to behold, and to fasten her eyes on the Sun, thereby to betoken the high mysteries discovered by our Saint <hi>Iohn;</hi> and secondly, the Eagle renewes her age to betoken the long life of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> or rather the eternity of such things as he prophesied, in so much, that it gave occasion to a false report; for whereas Christ made only a supposition, they conceived it as really true, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> should not die; and thus far indeed it proved true, that he died not of a violent death, as all the rest of the Apostles suffered Martyrdom, but his Matyrdom it should seem was then, when he did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist at the Passion of Christ, and none other Apostle attended there but himself; and no doubt, but his then sorrow and grief might equall, or rather exceed in virtue and power, the Martyrdom of others.</p>
            <p>And secondly, that common fame and report of his not dying, might thus far prove true, that he died not in that age, but lived to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the second Century, being now very old, as S. <hi>Hierome</hi> relates in his commentaries upon the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians;</hi> when he could not<note place="margin">As he was the beloved Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, for he did ever Preach love.</note> goe of himself, but was carryed by others, to the Church, or place of meetings; he made no other Sermon but this, [<hi>Filioli diligite alterutrum, quia praeoeptum Domini est, &amp; si solim fiat, sufficit</hi>] it should seem being the beloved Disciple, the love of Christ was so fastened, and fixed in him, that it made a repercussion, and became an Echo, and brake out into these termes of love; <hi>Filioli</hi> my sons, whom I so dearly love, let not my love rest in you as singulars, but impart it to each other, that so you may be united and linked together in the Bonds, and Chaines of love, that as this love proceeds from Christ to me, and from me to you, so from you to each other among your selves; that we may all lay hold on the Anchor of our hope, Christ the Son of God, who hath reconciled us to God, notwithstanding our sins and transgressions.</p>

            <p>THe first word of my Text, standing in the forefront (<hi>&amp;</hi> and) being a conjunction copulative, gives me occasion to look back, and mark the dependence; wherein I dare boldly say, that neither the large volumes of the Fathers, nor the subtill and curious invention of the Schooles, nor the deep and profoundest Divines, can better unfold the mystery of this word, then may be well gathered by the precedent and express words of this Evangelist: onely here stands our weakness; That as <hi>Moses</hi> having talked with God, his countenance received that light, that the Israelites could not behold the face of <hi>Moses:</hi> so this our Apostle having leaned on the bosom, and sucked out these mysteries, he is now become <hi>Boanerges,</hi>

order, perfection, but necessary it is, that God should impart his own nature, which nature though infinitely imparted, yet still continuing infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, it can be but one and the same nature equally communicated to the three Persons, <hi>three persons and one God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a man communicate his nature to his son, this nature though still<note place="margin">The difference between God and man.</note> continuing the same in kind and condition, yet must it differ in number, in regard of the finitenesse of our nature, the circumscription both of time and of place: but it is otherwise with God; for out of the infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his own nature, one and the same deity, the same in number, the same in virtue and power, is equally and totally imparted to the three persons in one blessed, and undivided Trinity.</p>
            <p>Thus much (<hi>ad intra</hi>) concerning the relation of Persons within<note place="margin">The three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons outwardly concurre.</note> themselves, now <hi>ad extra</hi> in respect of the creatures, it followes in the third verse of this Chapter, <hi>Et verbo facta sunt omnia,</hi> and without him nothing was made: so that both inwardly and outwardly, the deity of this Word appears; inwardly, in the coeternall existency, and infinite participation of the Godhead; and outwardly, as together concurring in the creation, framing and making of this world. And having thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the second person, because we acknowledge another person in the deity, take therefore the testimony of this second person concerning the third, <hi>when the holy Ghost whom I shall send unto you from the Father, the spirit of truth which proceeds from the Father, he shall give testimony of me, John</hi> the 15. 16. 26. these are the mutuall testimonies of Persons in behalf of each other; and hereunto I shall adde, what the holy Catholick Church out of other texts of Scripture doth undoubtedly, demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and most necessarily conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verbum</hi> a word, must necessarily imply <hi>intellectum</hi> an understanding to<note place="margin">The manner of the generation of the Word.</note> conceive this word; this understanding being alwayes active, the word must be of like continuance and eternity; and being active, as there was an eternall, so is there a daily and continuall generation of this word, <hi>Hodie genui te.</hi> This word being naturall to the understanding, it proceeds not from any voluntary, or free election of God, but from the necessity of his nature; and according to his nature, so is it begotten in a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and most unspeakable manner, being in the understanding, answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the understanding, and of like extent. It can be no creature, seeing by it all things were made and created; and being in the understanding, it must subsist of the same nature, which nature being infinite, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely imparted, yet still it remaines one and the fame infinite nature, and cannot admit a plurality; and though the nature be the same both in kind and number, yet must there be a difference of persons, in regard of the different act of generation, <hi>Deus intelligendo seipsum, genuit verbum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we have an Understanding and a Word, but can this Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subsist without a Will? or what shall unite and knit together the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97249:16"/>
and the word, as they are in themselvs most inseparable, but only <hi>Amor</hi> the love of God; or that conformity of the understanding to the word &amp; of the word to the understanding, which proceeding from both, serves to unite both? Here then we have a third person, the holy Ghost;<note place="margin">The mauner of the procession of the holy Ghost.</note> and seeing the will of God, is no lesse active then the understanding, this third person must therefore be necessary and eternall, with the word, and with the understanding; proceeding from both, it must be of like extent, and nature with both, the understanding infinite, the word infinite, the love must likewise be infinite; this nature being infinite it can be but one, and the same nature infinitely imparted to the three persons; and though the same nature, yet this love proceeding, it must be a person; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the different manner of procession from both, needs it must be a different person from both, God comprehending and understanding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be infinite, begets <hi>verbum infinitum,</hi> which is the action of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; and by this word knowing himself to be <hi>infinitum bonum,</hi> from the understanding, and from the word proceeds <hi>amor infini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>us,</hi> which is the action of the will.</p>
            <p>Thus the understanding, and the will, as they are the most inward, active,<note place="margin">A prerogative of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and will of God above his other attributes.</note> and eminent qualities in every spirit, so are they most wonderfull in God, for they are fruitfull in their own kind; neither power, providence, justice, mercy, nor any other divine attribute can produce the like unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; these look only <hi>ad extra,</hi> as if from the Castle of the Deity the windowes were opened, and they should look only upon the creatures, but the wisdom, and the will of God look <hi>ad intra,</hi> re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lect upon the deity it selfe, God comprehending and understanding himself to be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, begets <hi>verbum infinitum,</hi> which is the action of the understanding; and by this word knowing himself to be <hi>infinitum bonum,</hi> from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and from the word proceeds <hi>amor infinitus,</hi> which is the action of the will.</p>
            <p>These three persons though admitting a difference between themselves,<note place="margin">How the three persons agree in actions and attributes.</note> in regard of generation and procession, yet they agree in their nature, and the whole nature is in every person, and there can be no more then the whole, in the three persons, according to the nature of an infinite, which being infinitely imparted, yet still it remains infinite; hence it is that all the actions of God, are alike ascribed to every one of the Persons, and though the different Persons revealed, may appear unto us by different actions, as the Father by creation, the Son by redemption, the holy Ghost by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>As all the actions, so all the attributes of God are likewise ascribed to every one of the Persons, yet in the Persons they are tyed to the nature: thus we say not three incorruptibles, but one incorruptible; not three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibles, but one incomprehensible; three persons in unity, and one God in Trinity; the father is God, the son is God, and the holy Ghost is

other Gods, according to the very letter, &amp; not the persons in one Godhead,<note place="margin">The Jews que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion answered.</note> for they are but one God: and if you would know what gods are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, surely the verse following will direct you, <hi>Thou shalt worship no Idols.</hi> But why this mystery should not be revealed to the Jews, this is a question of such a nature, as being answered, yet still the like questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on remains; as, Why should not all other mysteries, and why should not the Incarnation be long before it was? and therefore I will make bold to propose the same question to the Jews.</p>
            <p>Why should God reveal himself to the later Prophets, more then he did to <hi>Moses?</hi> or why should <hi>Moses</hi> institute Sacrifices, and such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ceremonies, which were never discovered to <hi>Abraham?</hi> or why should God by <hi>Abraham</hi> institute Circumcision, which was unknown unto <hi>Noah?</hi> or why were not all the mysteries together revealed unto <hi>Adam,</hi> the father of mankinde, created in Paradise, in a state of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, sanctified with Original grace, and himself being the immediate workmanship of God?</p>
            <p>Now to all these questions I will return this answer, God is not to be tyed to mans captious curiosity, he may do as he please, and reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self according to such manner, as his own wisdom shall appoint.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that in all natural things God observes degrees, and nothing<note place="margin">God is known by degrees.</note> comes all at once to his ripeness and perfection: Thus there is a blossom and a bud, before you come to the fruit; thus a childe begins first to learn his letters, then to reade, before he comes to any exact knowledge: So God did make himself known by several Names, and each Name did import more mysteries then other, as God speaks, By my Name of <hi>Sadai, quod sufficit,</hi> I did reveal my self unto them, but not by my Name of four letters, which of all other Gods Names, did involve the greatest mysteries: and God requires no more of man, then God hath given unto man, and that shall abundantly suffice, until it shall please God further to reveal himself. Think you that God would not reserve some mystery for his Son to reveal, more then ever was known to the Prophets? and what greater then the Trinity, which neither men nor Angels can comprehend, and both men and Angels must adore?</p>
            <p>Neither do I think that all is yet revealed, but that we shall have a<note place="margin">All mans knowledge is gotten by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</note> further knowledge of things in the state of Glory, when we our selves shall be made more and more capable of his knowledge, and in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim God doth herein deal with men but after the manner of men, as he doth in all other things. Thus we get knowledge by degrees, and first we begin with the easiest lessons, and then come to that which is more difficult: and this stands well with the honor, majesty, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of God, that we should come to him by degrees; thus was there a Court, a Porch, a Temple, before we come to the Holiest of Holies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:97249:17"/>Thus far I have answered their Objection, and requited them in the<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Moses</hi> had some knowledge of this mystery.</note> same kinde, by proposing another question of like nature, but I may not so far wrong <hi>Moses</hi> and the Patriarchs, as to think they were utterly ignorant of this mystery, though it may be they had not such an express knowledge, as God revealed in succeeding times: and likewise for the manner, that it was not in such express terms. We reade then that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> the Law and the Prophets, did attend Christ, when he was transfigured in the Mount; whereby is intimated, that they had Christ in figures and types. So then, if I shall make it appear, that either the three Persons, or any one of the Persons, are named or appeared in Scripture, we may thence very well gather, that they had some knowledge of the mystery.</p>
            <p>First, let us view the Creation, <hi>Verbo Domini Coeli formati sunt, And</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Trinity appears in the creation of the world.</note> 
               <hi>God said, Let there be light: Said,</hi> that is, spake the word: To whom should God speak, when as yet there was nothing but himself? So then, a Word is begotten in his understanding, which reflects upon the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and proves a distinct Person, <hi>and the Word was God:</hi> then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>And the Spirit of the Lord moved on the waters:</hi> This Spirit could be no creature, for now began the Creation, the Spirit of the Lord. Surely there is nothing in God but God; God can admit of no mixture or composition, he is <hi>actus purus &amp; simplicissimus,</hi> nothing but pure form, therefore this Spirit must be God the holy Ghost. Do we not here see how all the three Persons did concur as in one nature, so in the same outward act of Creation?</p>
            <p>From the creation of the World, where it is said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Dii creavit,</hi> let us come to the creation of Man, for whom the world was created: and therefore being a work of so great moment, God seems to deliberate, and to enter into consultation: Certainly when we enter into counsel, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a diversity of persons, or at least it must imply a greater caution, that neither in words or acts there might be any mistake; the rather, because it is the first time that ever God spake of himself, wherein frail man is usually more cautionate and wary then in any other discourse: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this may much more be supposed in the most wise God; let us then hear God with the greatest reverence, <hi>Faciamus hominem ad imaginem nostram, Let us make man according to our own image,</hi> the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which argues Persons, is here twice implied, both in the act <hi>facia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, let us make,</hi> and in the type or sampler, <hi>ad imaginem nostram, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our own image.</hi> If here you shall tell me, that it is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew phrase, and an ordinary and usual form of speech, I confess it, and acknowledge it: but therein I do more magnifie the providence of God, who did so ordain the speech and language of men, as that it should be fit to express such a mystery: yet withall consider, that it is otherwise with God then with men, for God is Truth it is self, and therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97249:18"/>
that there is not a metaphor or figure spoken of God, wherein there is not a stamp of truth involved. And whereas it is now frequent, that great Princes do speak of themselves in the Plural number, I conceive that it is therefore more justifiable, because they are Politick Bodies, and in a sort Corporations, and so represent others; and that it might imply, that whatsoever they do, it was with the grave advice of their Councel, and therefore for the greater honor and majesty they use the Plural number.</p>
            <p>Come we then after the fal of <hi>Adam,</hi> to that which the Fathers call <hi>Semen</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Messias must needs be a Person in the Deity.</note> 
               <hi>Evangelii,</hi> the beginning of our Redemption; <hi>Semen mulieris conteret ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentis caput:</hi> is it possible that when as <hi>Adam</hi> being the immediate work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship of God, and therefore of the greatest perfection, created in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, in a state of innocency, sanctified with Original grace, that he should not be able to resist the temptation, and yet the seed of the woman, of the weaker sex, should be able <hi>to bruise the head of the serpent,</hi> (that is) utterly to destroy the Kingdom of Sin and Satan? surely it must needs argue, that the Son of the woman, could be no less then the Son of God, seeing such a Conquest farre exceeds the power of all Angels and Creatures.</p>
            <p>After the sin, consider the punishment, and therein Gods Mercy and<note place="margin">God doth sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; there are Persons in the Deity.</note> Compassion, how he clothes the nakedness of <hi>Adam with the skins of beasts.</hi> Some Divines do ask, what became of the carkases of those beasts; and they conceive it very credible, that God did offer them up in sacrifice, to himself, to shew <hi>Adam</hi> the manner of sacrificing; and withall to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure, that God alone should offer up the only great, sufficient, propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory sacrifice, that is, <hi>that he should offer up himself to himself;</hi> which must needs argue severall Persons in the Deity. Hence followed as an earnest or type thereof, the sacrifice of <hi>Abel;</hi> and because his sacrifice was acceptable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he himself was more acceptable then his sacrifice, therefore he must be offered up in sacrifice, to prefigure him, whose blood speaks bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, then the blood of <hi>Abel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto Gods promises for the coming down of his Son were only tyed<note place="margin">The seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> is more then man.</note> to mankinde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but after the confusion of tongues, when men were dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then it pleased God to make choice of his nation, &amp; to promise <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, That in his seed all generations should be blessed;</hi> in token &amp; memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereof, God instituted Circumcision, as it were for the honor of his issue, and for the assurance of his faith, that Christ should succeed; and as a pledge thereof, <hi>Abraham</hi> being to administer an oath to his servant, takes his hand, and layes it upon his loynes, and then makes him swear. Now in a corporall oath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ever lay our hands upon the most holy thing, suppose the Bible, or the Altar; and therefore the servant layes his hands upon the loynes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 2. seeing that Christ was then in the loynes of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Another memorable thing in <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he saw three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97249:18"/>
and he worshipped one, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 3. Which may a little set forth three Persons and one God.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Isaacs</hi> sacrifice it is more manifestly implyed, for God would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isaac</hi>'s sacrifice.</note> require that of man, which he did not intend to perform unto man; and therefore God requiring of <hi>Abraham</hi> to sacrifice his Son, what was then only proposed, God would hereafter really perform on his part, in sacrificing his only Son, for <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Sons. <hi>Isaac</hi> gives the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to <hi>Jacob;</hi> of whom that I may say nothing of his life, the blessing which he gives unto his Sons upon his death-bed, was very memorable, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. Giving his blessing to <hi>Judah,</hi> from whom Christ was to descend, he there prophesieth of the time of his coming, and expresseth much joy and comfort therein; but after speaking of <hi>Dan,</hi> that <hi>he was a serpent,</hi> certainly he had some relation to that cursed serpent, which seduced our first Parents; for <hi>Judas Iscariot</hi> who betrayed Christ, was of the tribe of <hi>Dan:</hi> and it is not unlike but the great Antichrist shall be of the same<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jacobs</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</note> tribe, which <hi>Jacob</hi> foreseeing suddenly breaks out into these words, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectabo salutare tuum Domine,</hi> Lord I will expect thy salvation; though some of my posterity shall betray thee, yet lay not the sin to my charge, hold me as innocent; and therefore in the assured hope of Gods mercy he takes order, that his body should be carried out of Egypt, as it were going to Jerusalem in Pilgrimage; there to meet Christ at his coming.</p>
            <p>And not to trouble my self with so many testimonies, all which do suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently<note place="margin">The faith of <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </note> prove the truth of Christs coming; and that Christ must needs be the Son of God, which presupposeth the great mysterie of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: take one instance for all. When God did deliver his people out of Egypt, with so many wonders, and miracles; and that he gave the Law, and used the ministry of Angels: yet notwithstanding at that time, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> out of the certainty of his hope, should use these words, <hi>Mitte quem missurus es,</hi> Lord, use no such preparation, but send him whom thou art about to send, (that is) send thine own son immediately: for he must needs be the Son of God; for he must be greater then <hi>Moses,</hi> greater then the Angels, who were then imployed, greater then all the commands of God, which were then to be delivered to his people; and his work and imployment must be greater then their deliverance from Egypt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be a freedom, and liberty from the captivity of sin, hell, and damnation, and the conducting of us to that heavenly Jerusalem, the true land of promise, which is a work and imployment only fit for the Deity.</p>
            <p>Many other types might be produced; Suppose the three Children in the<note place="margin">The whole Law directed to Christ.</note> fire, all praising God with one voyce, see how three do concurre in one, and that the fire did not hurt them (as the fire did not burn the bramble bush, wherein God appeared to <hi>Moses) they saw one among them like the Son of God:</hi> so here is not only an acknowledgement of the Son, but as if they had known him by his face and countenance, that he was the Son
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97249:19"/>
of God. What shall we bring further instances, when it is most certain, that the whole scope and intent of the Law tends only to Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must undoubtedly assure us, that he could be no less then God? for if we should think that God would rest satisfied with the slaughter of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable creatures, we must thinke it to be a very unreasonable service; and we cannot imagine, that Gods service should be directed to any other end, but himself, which must inforce the Deity of Christ.</p>
            <p>But further you shall observe, that whereas the form of our Baptisme<note place="margin">The Jews had a tradition of our Baptisme.</note> is, <hi>That we are Baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost;</hi> and that the matter of our Baptisme is water, and therein we make a profession of the Trinity; certainly the Jews had a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that the <hi>Messias</hi> should institute Baptisme in this manner: for whereas there is no such thing written in Scripture, yet the Priests and the Levites did send to Saint <hi>John Baptist,</hi> to know whether he were the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> or not; and <hi>if he were not, then why he did Baptize?</hi> In token and memory hereof, some there were, who kept watering pots after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Jews, S. <hi>John</hi> 20. And this was done likewise by tradition, for they had no warrant in Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>To the message of the Priests, and to the common custom of Jews, give<note place="margin">And severall types of our Baptisme.</note> me leave to adde that miraculous pool of Bethesda, <hi>John</hi> the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> where the Angell came down at a certain season<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and moved the waters; and such as took the first opportunity to be let into the water, were cured, of all their diseases; this first letting down, did only betoken their watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, their zeale, their strength of Faith; and how the endeavours of men must concurre, cooperate, and correspond with Gods goodness, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Here then we have the matter of Baptisme, the element of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, severall times intimated: shall we then think, that the Jews were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant of the form, which is no lesse then the profession, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the blessed Trinity? Certainly as they had types and figures of the one, so they might have an obscure knowledge of the other; and this I do rather beleive, because at the Baptism of Christ, when the three Persons did so manifestly discover themselves, for there was <hi>vox Patris, This is my well beloved Son,</hi> there was the Person of the Son and there was the holy Ghost, <hi>in the form of a Dove;</hi> yet we do not read, that this seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any way new or strange to Saint <hi>John Baptist,</hi> who certainly if he had been utterly ignorant, would have been strangely strucken with asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment and admiration of this so great a mysterie then revealed:<note place="margin">They knew the form of our Baptisme, as well as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> but Saint <hi>John</hi> not contenting himself with that present mysterie, taking it as granted; he points out a further mysterie, when this Son of God should become the Lamb of God, and be made a sacrifice to satisfie for the sins of the whole world, <hi>Ecce agnus dei, qui tollit peccata mundi.</hi> Now it is not credible, that the Jews should have so many tokens, and such use of the element of waters, as the matter of Baptisme; and should be utterly

ignorant without any the least intimation, or notice of the form of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, which is the profession of the Trinity: and to conclude, how often do we read in Scripture, <hi>Verbum Domini venit ad prophetas, spiritus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini replevit orbem terrarum,</hi> which very Phrases seem to imply Pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As when the Sun ariseth, the Stars are obscured. So lest the Jews might take any of Gods messengers for the <hi>Messias,</hi> the time now approaching for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore God sent no messengers, untill at length <hi>Zachary</hi> at the time of his sacrifice was strucken dumb, and so continued untill the Birth of his Son, to whom he gave the name of <hi>John, which signifies the grace of God, and points out the proper time of the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you look to the totall abrogation of the Law, as it was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated<note place="margin">The Temple destroyed.</note> in the dumbness of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> when he was sacrificing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so not the Priest alone, but the Temple it self did suffer, in the passion of Christ; for the vayle of the Temple was rent, as if God were then dissolving, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down his own Temple, with an intent no longer to inhabite there; and so the Temple was afterward destroyed by <hi>Titus.</hi>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97249:20"/>
they sought false witnesse against Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. here was malice, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and perjury; and as there was renouncing of God in words, so in deeds: because Christ made himself what indeed he was, the son of God; therefore they cryed Crucifie him, crucifie him; and here was <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Thus they fell by degrees, together with their Law, and their Temple; yet no doubt but God had many servants, who then were in the state of Salvation; for here is the difference between the Synagogue, and the Church, many were saved out of the Synagogue, as the Ninevites, but the Church is the mother of all the faithfull; and without the Church, there is no hope of Salvation: the reason hereof I conceive to be, because the Synagogue was hedged in within the bounds of <hi>Palestina,</hi> but the Church is Catholick over the face of the whole world: So they are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable, who do not adhere to the Church.</p>
            <p>All this I write to the Jews, that seeing the whole Law was referred to Christ; all their sacrifices directed to Christ; all their prophets prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ; many types and figures of Christ, and all due preparations for his entertainment: surely this must needs argue the Godhead of Christ; for here was a worship onely proper to God. Or if we look not<note place="margin">Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Jewes.</note> to the service of God, then take Gods Judgements upon the Jews, they are become slaves and vass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ls to all Nations; I never heard that any of them had so much as a Seigniory, though certain it is, that they are the most expert, and skilful Merchants in the world, and the richest: a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is but some of them should intend a Plantation, and erect a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. I do likewise conceive them to be the best Physicians in the world, not onely because their Ancestors lived in the East<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Countreys, where the best drugges and simples are; and so they were better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their virtues and operations, by the daily experience of them: and certainly they did leave the knowledge of them by tradition to their successors; which they keep secret among themselves, while throughout the whole world, they are become slaves and vagabonds, ever since the passion of Christ, even as <hi>Cain</hi> was upon the murder of <hi>Abel:</hi> that now in the whole world, they have not one place for sacrifice; their tribes are confounded, their Temple destroyed; and this hath continued longer, then their own Mosaicall Law continued in his vigor: which could never stand with the goodness and providence of God to permit, had it not been that the Law was accomplished; and therefore abrogated by God himself, that the Gospell might succeed.</p>
            <p>Thus I think now at length, I have satisfied the Jews, and made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,<note place="margin">The Jewes no longer a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> that their An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97249:20"/>
then I have paid them home at last, (that is) I have come to their own homes, I have dispersed them, I have scattered them, and in effect dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved them; so that as a Nation, they shall no longer oppose, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue obstinate; it must be now held self-will, perverseness, and every mans particular contumacy. So from the Jews I come to Gentilisme: which as it was accompanyed with infidelity and Atheisme, so you shall give me leave to strike at the Root, that I may eradicate both Root and Branch; and because the Gentiles had no other pretence, but human rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</p>
            <p>I will now give satisfaction to human reason, in this high mysterie of<note place="margin">The method how to deal with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</note> the Trinity; not that reason can comprehend the mysterie; for neither Sc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphins, nor Cherubins, nor all the Angels in heaven, can fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand God: For to understand God, it is indeed to be God, and to make his understanding equall to that eternall Word, in the understanding of God. But I do undertake, to satisfie human reason in this mysterie, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our own ignorance. First, I will make it appear that there is a God, and but one God; then that this God is every way incompr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible, whereby it must follow, that the blessed Trinity, exceeds mans reason no further, then all the rest of his attributes do. Then I will bring some proofes for the blessed Trinity; and lastly, I will seal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all with miracles, works above naturall power, to confirm words above naturall knowledge.</p>
            <p>This world being the workmanship of God, serves as a book or a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, whereby every letter or punctilio points out the Maker: I shall not need to insist in the motion of the heavens, the influence of Starres, the strange and wonderfull meteors; but take the least flie or worm, and it shall afford infinite arguments, for the proof of the Deity; and I do here call heaven and earth to witness; and I desire God, that my tongue may cleave to the roof of my mouth, and that my right hand may forget her cunning, if ever I shall faile in any the least creature, to produce infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible demonstrative arguments, for the proof of the Deity. And<note place="margin">The Atheist is the greatest impostor.</note> therefore of all others, the cursed Atheist is the greatest impostor, denying, a God, he makes himself God; for denying his Maker, he must needs make himself, and consequently makes himself God, who cannot adde one haire to his own growth, nor a minute to his age. Yet some such there are, who continue thus in their mad Blasphemy; and here I call all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to witness against them, and all Arts, and Sciences shall concurre in the same Testimony, and utterly condemne them.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever is seen or unseen, whether it belongs to the visible, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible world, every thing points out a Deity; and from the severall perfection of creatures, we thence infer severall attributes in God, which although they may seem severall to us; yet being every way, and every one infinite, (for what should limit or bound God, when as indeed there
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97249:21"/>
is no thing but God) it must therefore necessarily follow, that there can be but one infinite; and the attributes, though they appear severall to us, yet are they all but one infinite God: more particularly, because we receive our first information from sense, we thence conclude,</p>
            <p>Whatsoever is, is either God, or the work of God, <hi>Deus est quod vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>

               <hi>totum, &amp; quod non vides totum,</hi> whatsoever thou seest, or seest not, serves as an argument, and proof of the Deity; as for example, in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in generall, consider their proper and bounden nature, together with so great variety and perfection in their own kind, in this nature such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent properties, affections, and accidences, which do so well agree with the nature; from this nature such strange and wonderfull operations and effects; by this nature, such an excellent order and proportion, both in themselves, and to the whole universe; through this nature, such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and perseverance in keeping their due course, in performing their duty, service, and Ministery to man; and as all the creatures look to one end, so they must needs have but one efficient cause, which made and directed all to the glory of himself, the perfection of the universe, and the good of particulars, in their preservation, that they might be more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and serviceable to man; who might therefore return his praises, and thankfulness to God; that all may tend and end in Gods glory, this was the end which was first in intention, and now is the last in execution: that as the world is circular, where it begins, there it ends; so beginning with God, it endeth with God, <hi>thus every thing doth testifie a God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may fill up a Book greater then the whole world, with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and proofs of the Deity.</p>

            <p>From the Metaphysicks, I come to the Mathematicks, which have the<note place="margin">The Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks shew the wonders of God.</note> commendations that of all other Sciences, they are the most demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: I will therefore borrow some examples from them; and I will only instance in Astrology; and when it plainly sheweth so many great, and such strange wonders in the heavens, such as a man of ordinary capacity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not easily conceive, it must needs argue that God himself must be much more admirable, and incomprehensible: suppose that the Sun which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears unto the eye, to be but of a little compass and quantity, yet should be so much greater then the whole Earth, which certainly it must be, or else it could not enlighten so great a part of the World; secondly, the motion of a Bullet may seem very swift, for the eye cannot follow it, nor avoyd it;<note place="margin">The wonders in Astrologie.</note> yet certain it is, that the Stars near the Equinoctiall, do move a hundred times swifter then a Bullet, which must needs be, considering the great cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit which they make within the compass of a naturall day; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they seem unto us, as if they stood still; thirdly, the spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Earth, together with all her huge Mountains and Rocks; alas, they carry no proportion of any sensible quantity in respect of the heavens, when we are at Sea, we see the whole medietie of the heavens, as if there were no earth at all to hinder our sight; fourthly, one mother earth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording the same nourishment, a little durty Pap to the severall plants, yet by virtue of the heavens, it should prove sweetness in one, bitterness in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

and so of all severall tasts and savours fitted and proportioned to all particular natures; this I write to assure man, both in his sense and in his understanding, that there is such a difference, and disproportion between the two Worlds, that man might see his own infirmity, acknowledge his weakness; and himself to be so much inferior, as to be ignorant in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the spirituall World; and therefore not rashly to oppose, but humbly to submit his own Judgement.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Not to confound my self with generals, I will descend to particulars.<note place="margin">A particular instance, for proof of the Deity.:</note> When we look upon the heavens, and see the Suns continuall motion for our service, when we our selves are not the Authors thereof, nor yet those heavenly bodies, as wanting understanding, cannot direct their course, and know not the use of their own motions, doubtless we must conceive some higher agent, some intellective power, who both giving and knowing the influence and operation of the heavens; as likewise the use and necessities of this inferior World, did accordingly dispose and order these Actions, and that <hi>is God himself.</hi> And seeing that all things are carried, <hi>Certa lege, pulcherrimo ordine,</hi> by the Rule and Square of his providence, seeing all things were Created <hi>verbo virtutis suae,</hi> by the word of his mouth, for otherwise a world of ages would not have sufficed for the framing of this world: doubtless we must conceive, that in God there is an infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But here if, I shall further demand what is an infinite? then we begin
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97249:23"/>
to discover our own weakness, <hi>Natura abhorret infinitum,</hi> we cannot<note place="margin">We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, yet we cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And thus by the light of reason, we are brought to acknowledge God; this God to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and by the same light of reason we are taught, that we cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly conceive an infinite. Now every thing in God being of like extent, that is, infinite; reason in the knowledge of God, must be taught in hurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to prostrate her self, and not with blear eyes to behold the Sunshine; with waxen wings, to draw near a consuming fire, as it were again p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously to taste of the Tree of knowledge.</p>
            <p>For your further satisfaction, let us consider other attributes of God,<note place="margin">God must be Infinite.</note> every one of them hath this property, to be infinite; and even naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shall testifie so much; for to be infinite, is to be without bounds, or limitations; and what should bound or limit Gods nature, when as there is nothing but God, and the Creatures the effects of Gods power?</p>
            <p>Thus God hath a most absolute freedom, &amp; liberty of wil; neither violence can inforce him, nor any necessity can be imposed upon him, only he is tyed<note place="margin">Without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection.</note> to the Laws of his own nature, which makes for his infinite excellency and perfection, for thereby he is made uncapable of any blemish or defect; thus being infinitely good, or Goodness itself, he cannot commit sin; being Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice it self, he can do no injury or wrong; being Truth it self, he cannot speak falshood, there can be no contradiction in his words; he is a light without shadow, he neither hath, nor can any imperfection befall him.</p>
            <p>Since God is the Author of his own beeing, he must therefore have the<note place="margin">God is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</note> best and most incomparable beeing, to which there can be no addition made; for his duration or continuance, both <hi>à parte ante,</hi> and <hi>à parte post,</hi> it is alike infinite, for it is from all eternity, and to all eternity, for the<note place="margin">Eternity.</note> extent of his being, it is infinite, he is every where, and hath an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Ubiquity, the whole world, and the heavens cannot contain him,<note place="margin">Ubiqui y.</note> and the least<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>punctilio cannot exclude him: for his Wisdom, he is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient,<note place="margin">Omnis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>When his wisdom hath once laid the ground and platform (give me leave to speak of God after the manner of men, having the weakness of infirmity of man in my self, and speaking to men, who cannot otherwise conceive me) then the power of God puts all in execution, and this is infinite, and therefore Omnipotent, for he creates all things of nothing,<note place="margin">Omnipotency.</note> 
               <hi>à non-ente ad ens,</hi> there is an infinite distance, which requires an infinite power, and what can resist this power, when as there is nothing, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the effects of his power? Things being once constituted, then suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97249:24"/>
Gods infinite providence, which implies his wisdom and power,<note place="margin">Providence, Constancy.</note> together with the constancy of his will, for the preservation of that, which being founded with such excellent wisdom and power, cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be permitted to perish. And as there is such a constancy in his actions, so is there an Immutability in his nature, for having the best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,<note place="margin">Immutability.</note> if he should any way alter or change, it should be for the worse, and so to his detriment and loss, which his infinite wisdom and power could not permit: and upon all several occasions God is most abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided, for having given unto men a liberty and freedom of will, making man according to his own image, and like unto himself, hereby man is enabled and made capable either to conform himself to Gods law, or to transgress: and answerable thereunto, there is in God an infinite Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,<note place="margin">Gods Justice.</note> to punish the offence of infinite malignity, being committed against an infinite Majesty; or otherwise there is in God an infinite Mercy, to<note place="margin">Mercy.</note> accept and reward the poor weak endevours of man, which are of no value in themselves: for alas, what can man do to deserve Gods favor? when as he is nothing in himself, surely his works must needs be less then nothing, for if the substance or body be wanting, there cannot be so much as a shadow: Gods infinite mercy, and Christs passion, as the means must make them acceptable, and crown them with an infinite bliss, both in respect of the object, which is God himself, as likewise in respect of continuance, which is for Eternity.</p>
            <p>Neither can God make any thing which shall be wholly independent<note place="margin">As every thing was made, so it must depend upon God.</note> from himself, for this were to devest himself of his own power, and to resign it to the Creatures, and so to deprive himself, which God cannot do: for as man was created of nothing, so without a constant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual support, he would in every moment fall unto nothing. As God is the first and sole Cause, so he is the continual and sole preserver of all; and though making man according to his own image, he hath given him a liberty of will, yet still God hath reserved to himself, not onely the foresight and prescience, but when occasion serves, he hath a curb to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and order this liberty of will, as he shall see cause, and Gods presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence imposeth no necessity upon the action, for as the Omnipotency of God creates all things out of nothing, so the Omnisciency of God may foresee and foreknow all things out of nothing, Gods power and Gods knowledge are of like extent and efficacy, and when no cause is determinated and ordered, yet <hi>God who seeth all things which are not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How causes may be free, yet the effects ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</note> 
               <hi>as if they were,</hi> so he may foresee things which shall be, though the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses be free, and not determinated, for he sees things not onely in their causes, but in the infinite light of his own Intellectuals; so that in respect of the causes (whereof alone we are to judge) the effects may be free &amp; volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, though in respect of Gods prescience (whereof we are not to judge) they may be necessary, and infallibly succeed. This I will illustrate by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97249:24"/>
an example; He that stands on a high Mountain, and on either side sees passengers riding in the same rode-way, some forward, some backward, some towards each other, the passengers ride of themselves, and it lies in their power to go or not to go, but he that stands on the hill may know where and when they shall meet, and yet notwithstanding his foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they meet very casually and voluntary: and thus may Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science stand with the freedom and liberty of mans actions.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have made a high flight, and now me thinks I am like a<note place="margin">Mans weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note> man that is weary in holding up his head to look upon the Sun, and the heavens, and finding that his spirits are a little wasted with too much light, he retires home, and coming to his inner rooms, he findes them so dark, that he can see nothing, yet rests himself there for a time to recover his strength, whereby he might be the better enabled again to discern the Sun and the heavens: So give me leave, in stead of making further search into the Attributes of God, wherein I finde my eyes dazled, now to turn mine eyes inward, and to make a diligent search, what knowledge man hath of his own, in such things as meerly concern himself, and how far his natural knowledge may transport him in the knowledge of God, and Religion, and how far we may presume upon our natural light, to discern a supernatural object, and things of another world, &amp; of a higher condition.</p>
            <p>Our own reason informs us, that there is nothing in man that hath not<note place="margin">Every thing in man is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> bounds of Circumscription: Thus in our stature, <hi>Datur maximum &amp; minimum,</hi> we cannot adde to our own growth; thus in our senses, <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens sensibile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>orrumpit sensum,</hi> we cannot fasten our eyes on the Sun; thus in the strength of our limbs, we finde in our selves a definite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate power, that we cannot work beyond our ability; so is there a measure and stint of knowledge, that we cannot conceive beyond our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited capacity.</p>
            <p>This will better appear, if we consider the several degrees of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing<note place="margin">The difference of men n their intellectuals.</note> in man himself, how one man doth far exceed another in wit, capacity and apprehension. Thus we finde that all wits are not fit for all studies, and all Sciences; he must have the light of great natural Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals, who is fit to wade through the midnight of the Metaphysicks, or to spy out the curious subtilties of School-learning; he must have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines in his brain who is fit for Mathematical studies, or Architecture; he must have a quick and nimble fancy, who aims to excel in Poetry or Rhetorick; he must have an exact memory, to compute the Concordancy of Times, to be a perfect Historian: So then it pleaseth God so to order the states of men, and the several gifts of nature, that some should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Teachers, others prove Scholars, and Proficients, as God shall give a blessing, and prosper their endevours: And while they are learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, necessary it is that they should believe their Teachers. And is there such a difference of men between themselves, comparing one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97249:25"/>
then much more is there a far greater difference between God and man. Suppose I should compare God with man in other Attributes, and<note place="margin">No compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son between God and man.</note> see the infinite difference, what is the strength of man but weakness, in respect of Gods Omnipotency? what is the length of mans age, but less then a minute, in respect of Gods eternity? what is the wealth of man, but beggery, in respect of Gods treasures? Then what is the wit and understanding of man, but meer foolishness, in respect of Gods wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?</p>
            <p>But that we may lay a deeper foundation, lest natural reason might<note place="margin">Mans natural Reason is bounded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the natural world.</note> presume too far, she must first be taught to humble her self; I would then first ask, what is the object of natural reason? surely I will extend the object as far as possibly I can, I will give her the uttermost due, and therefore I do acknowledge the object of natural reason to be the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral world; for upon the same grounds and principles whereof the world doth subsist, Reason doth likewise guide her self by way of direction: but man sees the bounds of the natural world, the material heavens, which incompass and hedge in the world, as a Circumference to the Centre or Circle: Then surely he must see the bounds of his natural Reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which he cannot extend his natural knowledge, which is very fitly set forth by the form and fashion of mans head or scull, which is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what circular, and not unlike the Globe of the world, all his brains are within the scull, and what is without, is no part of man: So what is within the cavity of the Globe of the world, may be partly involved and laid up in mans brain, as it were written in Characters; but what is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the convexity of this Globe, it cannot enter into mans brain.</p>
            <p>Thus every faculty hath his object, and this must be <hi>adaequatum</hi> every<note place="margin">The object &amp; faculty must be proportionable.</note> way answerable and proportionable to the faculty, and what exceeds this object, comes not within the sphere of that faculty, as the eye cannot hear, the ear cannot smell, the hand cannot taste; for every faculty hath as her own proper organs and instruments, so her own proper bounds.</p>
            <p>And lest Reason should be presumptuous, and being onely natural, should rashly adventure to leap into the supernatural world, or out of infidelity should utterly deny, what is above her reach and apprehension; I must lay open her weakness, and see how far she is wounded even in her own naturals, that she may be well asham'd of her self, if being so ignorant at home, and in things which concern her, yet she must presume to comprehend mysteries of another world, which so far exceed her reach and apprehension.</p>
            <p>See then our defects in natural knowledge, not onely in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Our natural ignorance in natural things.</note> of the heavens, the insensible Influences, the miraculous Meteors, but come we to the meanest Creatures, and to speak of them in general: The Philosophers will tell you, that the forms of things are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97249:25"/>
whence the Logicians conclude, That we cannot assign the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per differences, and consequently both of them fail in their definitions, and content themselves onely with bare descriptions, and outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: And therein we are so far from attaining any perfection, that every day new qualities are discovered. And thus far I tax the greatest Philosophers in the world; <hi>Hippocrates</hi> who knew as much as any man did living in his time, begins his book with excusing his ignorance, <hi>Ars longa est, &amp; vita brevis.</hi> Alas, what shall we say of the ordinary sort of men, when great Clerks after much study, night-watchings, and labours, think it a great perfection, if they can but discern their own ignorance. I remember when I was a young Scholar in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> sometimes for our own health and recreation, taking the fresh air in the fields, we would look for Herbs and Simples, but for the virtues and operations of them, alas, alas, ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> Her alists were wonderfully defective: At the same time, to try conclusions, we would finde out a Birds nest, and when the Hen had laid her full number of eggs, and began to sit, every third day we would open an egge, to see the manner and degrees of Conception; it was the white of the egge which made the skin, the bones, the feathers, the beak, while the yolk was reserved for the more inward and vital parts; and truly, we could but admire Gods workmanship and wonders in the course of nature, and thence we did conclude, that if there were such ignorance in natural things, it could not seem strange if we proved stark blinde in supernaturals.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have taught the natural man his ignorance in natural<note place="margin">The same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals as in super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturals.</note> things, and until he can acquit himself therein, it were a strange presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to trust to his own skill in supernaturals. Now God observes the same method and rule for our learning and instruction, both in things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and supernatural; and that is, that first we must begin with belief: thus it is necessary that the scholar should first believe his Schoolmaster, and he that is simplest and weakest in apprehension, out of a trust reposed in others, doth naturally submit his own opinion to the better judgement of others. Thus the poor silly childe, who understands not the reason of his fathers counsel, yet he believes him, and follows his counsel. Thus the poor Countrey Husbandman or Plowman, though he knows not the reasons of State, nor the secret Counsels of his governors, yet he believes them, and yields his obedience accordingly: and if this course be taken in temporal things, why not much more in spiritual? wherein first God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires faith, which by degrees is more and more inlightned, until at length it comes to the beatifical vision, and then no longer faith of things unseen, but an actual vision, and a real possession.</p>

condition, and to this end God hath added to his natural reason, some spark or thirst of knowledge, more then natural: for seeing the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, which are the bounds of nature, he conceives that above these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens there must needs be some more excellent and supernatural world, <hi>Regio superior incognita,</hi> a place not yet discovered, wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he desires to make a plantation, for he concludes in Reason, and by the rule of Architecture, that the Roof is the fairest and beautifullest thing in building, as being most in sight, the pavement and groundsel is the meanest and basest, as being to be troden on, therefore the material heavens which are the roof of this inferior world, they are the fairest thing in nature, beset and imbroydered with most rich and costly Jewels, the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, yet are these heavens nothing but the pavement and groundsel of the superior world, where the inhabitants do tread and trample them under their feet, and over our heads, and therefore are the meanest things in that superior world. And as in dignity and worth, so likewise in quantity, for the whole earth is in effect an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible point, and carries no sensible quantity in respect of the heavens,<note place="margin">A supernatural light must ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discover a supernatural world.</note> which plainly appears by many Astronomical demonstrations: Then what inconvenience is it, that there should be such a disproportion in the knowledge of these two worlds? for the supernatural world must needs have a supernatural light, for nothing can be known or acted without means, and the means must be of like condition and nature with the end; as here below we see the Sun and the Stars onely by their own light, so is it much more necessary that we should know nothing above the heavens, but by a revealed light, answerable and agreeable, and of the same nature and condition with that superior world. Thus natural Reason, by the force and strength of natural Reason, is brought to acknowledge the use and necessity of grace to sanctisie and inlighten our natural blindness and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. And if the difference be such for the beauty and quantity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two worlds, natural and supernatural, then surely there must be as great a disproportion in the knowledge of these two several worlds: for to understand the supernatural world, needs there must be some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural light, for nothing can be known without means, and the means must ever be of like condition and nature with the end; as here below we see the Sun and the Stars, not by Candle-light or Torch light, but by their own light; and the natural eye is not capable of that supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light, neither yet can reason, for want of means to discourse, come to any supernatural knowledge; yet God, for the satisfaction of reason, hath ingraffed in man wonder, astonishment, admiration, whereby man may see his own blindness, and not oppose the truth of things, which are above his reach and apprehension.<note place="margin">Man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Thus for the knowledge and attaining of the supernatural world, there must be a supernatural light, and in man there are some aspiring thoughts,

               </gap>ee of Knowledge, was the first sin which proceeded from curiosity; so God in his mercy is pleased to sanctisie mans curiosity, that being kept within due bounds and limits, it proves to be the first step or degree to bring man unto God; for now he is curious to know things of a better world, and takes this world but for a transitory passage, tending and ending in death and destruction.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have brought the natural man to believe, that seeing the<note place="margin">Admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ation is a kind: of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faith.</note> bounds of the natural world, he is apt to confess, that above the heavens there is a supernatural world, for knowledge whereof there must be a supernatural light; for procuring whereof, he findes naturally in himself wonder, astonishment, and admiration, and needs there must be some proper object answerable thereunto. And here God, like an excellent workman or planter, doth ingraff and inoculate a Sciens, giving man grace and faith to believe, and together revealing a knowledge, which could not be collected by any natural inquisition; &amp; then God for his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honor that it might appear he had made an absolute conquest of man, according to the military fashion, he sets up his Standard in the principal part of man, even in the Understanding of man, that as in his Law he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires<note place="margin">The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing must obey in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, as the will in performing.</note> obedience contrary to the natural lusts of flesh and blood, and mans own violent passions: So he requires submission of his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to believe what is above the reach and comprehension of reason; and therein together he gives him this assurance, that as for the instant he gives him an earnest or taste of things, so in due time, he shall impart the full and real possession. And thus whereas I did compare the Circumference of the heavens to bounds and limits, to hedge in this natural world, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I did likewise prove, that this God can be but one, because he is infinite, and there cannot be two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finites, for then they would bound and limit each other, and then neither of them should be infinite. I shewed likewise, that what is Infinite must be incomprehensible, because having no limits or bounds, it is therefore incomprehensible as in it self, so to mans knowledge. I did then make a digression, to view mans natural knowledge, how mean it was in natural

things, and wholly defective in supernaturals, and what degrees were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in his preparation to grace, and by a dislike of his present state, what hopes and ambition he had to aspire to a better condition. I did likewise insist in many Attributes of God, and I proved that they were all incomprehensible. Now seeing those Attr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>butes are somewhat better known unto us, then the Persons in the Deity, I will therefore use those Attributes as arguments and proofs to introduce the blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>I have formerly proved, that Reason doth acknowledge in God many<note place="margin">It is a greater wonder that Accidences should become Substances in God, then that one Substance should become Persons.</note> Attributes, as Providence, Power, Justice, Mercy, &amp;c. for these do all demonstratively appear in their several effects, and from these Attributes I will draw some arguments to prove the Persons in the Deity. Though there are Attributes which to us may seem Accidences, for so they are in man, as Power, Justice, Mercy &amp;c. yet Reason assureth us, that there is no Accident in God, there is nothing in God, but God; to admit a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in God, were to detract from his Integrity, and from his Eternity, for every thing must first subsist in it self, before it can come to composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus then the Attributes of God are Substances, and what is more, they are God himself: and thus God is not so properly Good and Just, as Goodness, and Justice it self; Goodness in abstract, for God is the Fountain of his own beeing, and therefore must have the best beeing, and cannot admit Accidences, which are inferior to Substances: So that what is in God, must be a Substance; yet Reason cannot possibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, how that which is a quality in man, should be a Substance in God, and I pray is there so great a difficulty in acknowledging persons in the Deity? seems it not a far greater inconveniency, that Accidences contrary to their own nature should be made Substances, then that a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance agreeable to nature should become Persons? In the first there is an opposition and difference of nature, in the second there is onely a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of number. Now as is the opposition and difference less, so is the inconvenience less, in beeing, and in our understanding, give me leave to speak according to the weakness and capacity of man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, how the Attributes do agree in the Godhead, though many<note place="margin">It is a greater wonder that all Gods Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes should be but one Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, then that one Substance should be three Persons.</note> and several Attributes, which I have already proved, yet being all Infinite, and there being but one Infinite, (for if we should admit two Infinites, they would bound and limit each other, and so neither of them should be Infinite) therefore all these several Attributes of God, can be and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but one and the same infinite Attribute. Thus the Wisdom of God is his Power, the Power of God is his Eternity, the Eternity of God is his Ubiquity. These and all other his Attributes, are indeed but one and the same Attribute, <hi>Deus est actus purus,</hi> he consists of no Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal parts: This Reason acknowledgeth, and the same Reason ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth this to be Incomprehensible; and I pray is there any greater
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97249:27"/>
difficulty in believing the Three Persons in one Deity, and the Deity to be equally competent to the Three Persons?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there are some Attributes in God, which seem to detract from<note place="margin">That Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice should be his Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>f<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in believing the Three Persons in one Deity, between whom there is no seeming Contrariety (as there is between Justice and Mercy) then to believe so many Attributes, and those to have several objects, and to appear in their various and several forms, yet all these Attributes to be but one and the same, this we must yield by necessary demonstrations in Philosophy; and if those very Attributes of God, whereof the light<note place="margin">Gods Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes as won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull as the Persons.</note> of Reason informs us, we cannot apprehend: Can it seem strange if in those mysteries which we onely receive by revelation, such as are of like condition with the Attributes of the Deity, and do equally, or rather more inwardly, touch the nature and essence of the Deity, we be found alike purblinde, and cannot discern them. In a word, I do here challenge the whole world, all the Philosophers, and all the Socinians, let any man undertake to discover any one Attribute of God, and I will with as great ease and facility discover the Trinity.</p>
            <p>Give me leave sometimes to recall my self, lest I might lose my self in<note place="margin">A brief of what hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> these dark mists of Divine Mysteries: I have proved a God, and but one God, and that this one God is every way Infinite, and therefore In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible: I have proved all the several Attributes of God, as Wisdom, Power, &amp;c. that they are all Substances, which notwithstanding in the Creatures are but Accidences: I have proved that all the several Attributes they are but one and the same, for there cannot be several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finites, for then they would bound and limit each other: I have proved that some Attributes, according to mans apprehension, seem to oppose each other, as Mercy detracts from Justice, yet that they are but one and the same Attribute in God: And now I conclude, That all these being duly considered, they do as farre exceed mans natural Reason, as doth the great and ineffable Mystery of the most holy, blessed, and undivided Trinity.</p>
            <p>I never name Gods Mercy, but my heart danceth for joy, and then I<note place="margin">A digression upon the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God.</note> begin to lay hold on it, and to fasten on it, and I cannot so cursorily pass over it. I would here by way of objection ask, How can all the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God be infinite, when as Scripture seems to enlarge Gods Mercy

for every thing must do, and consequently hath knowledge, according to his own nature, whether spirituall, or corporeall: and certainly the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of one World, cannot conceive the state and condition of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, the Angels would be as ignorant of this corporeall World, as we are of their spirituall, unless it be revealed alike to both. Suppose then that I should elevate my reason above the course of this our present nature; and that I had conference with an Angell upon my relation, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Angell not having any other knowledge of the inferiour World infused from God, but judging of things according to his own spirituall<note place="margin">A conference with an Angel.</note> condition, he would say it were more impossible, that one <hi>individuum</hi> or Person should subsist of different natures, <hi>matter and form,</hi> then that one nature should subsist of different Persons. The Angell would think it a far greater inconvenience, that one nature not able to preserve it self, yet should be able to communicate her nature to another: that is, to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative in her own kind (for so the Angels are not) as that one eternall nature should be alike, and equally communicated to three Persons; or if I should inform the Angels, that one grain of Corn, when it is dissolved,<note place="margin">The Angels wonder at na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things.</note> and seems to be rotted in the Earth, yet then it should send down a Root, send up a Blade, and so come with an increase; and happily bring twenty graines for one, this would seem more strange to an Angel, then that one infinite nature should be alike, and equally imparted to three Persons. This I write only by way of supposition, for I doubt not, but the Angels by their spirituall condition, and by their daily assistance, and Beatificall Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, have a far greater knowledge revealed unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both of the state of the naturall world, as likewise of the most blessed Trinity, then we have, being only in <hi>Statu viae,</hi> having now but an earnest of what we shall hereafter receive in greater measure.</p>
            <p>From conferring with an Angel (which many others have done) I<note place="margin">A conference with an infant in the wombe.</note> will now descend to a conference, which may seem much stranger then that of the Angel; for it is with an infant in the wombe, who hath a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Soul, and wants only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>it Organs, and a right disposition for the practise and exercise thereof, as Saint <hi>John Baptist</hi> did spring in the wombe upon the approach of our Saviour, wherein he did express both reason and Religion; yet this is not ordinary; but suppose an infant had the right use of understanding, I would tell him, that he should no longer lye crouching, and sleeping in the wombe; but he should come abroad, and prove a day-labourer, and get his living in the sweat of his browes; that there should be no further use of the Navill, but his mouth should be his taster, and his Teeth should be grinders, that he should be no longer silent, but should go to School, and learn a language, these things would seem as strange, and as incredible to the infant, (for want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and due information) as now they seem frequent, usuall and ordinary to us; for every thing hath knowledge according to his present

condition; and therefore no marvell, <hi>if the naturall man cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the things of the Spirit of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it plainly appears by the Angels, by the Infant, that there is a<note place="margin">The wonders in nature.</note> great difficulty in conceiving things of an other nature, but to instance in our own nature. Suppose I should ask of the greatest Doctors, and Philosophers the reason and cause, why the Adamant should draw up Iron, and turn it self to the North; or how should the Moon, which is not able to turn a little stick, yet should be able to turn the whole Ocean; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are we bound to believe, whereof we cannot understand the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and means? And therefore if in very naturall things it is very necessary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there should be a faith and belief, some reposing trust in others, in regard that all are not of a like apprehension, much mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e in things, which are not within the compass of this naturall world, and therefore fall not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compass of mans naturall reason. But there is as great a distance between them, as is between Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>And all Creatures, even Angels themselves in respect of God, there<note place="margin">The creatures are nothing in comparison with God.</note> is as great a difference between them in knowledge as is in beeing; or if you will have me to express it further, there is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as is between finite and infinite, between the most excellent being, and no being; between something and nothing; for so all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are both in themselves, for what they have of themselves, and in comparison with God.</p>
            <p>Here then at length, I come to the greatest difficulty, Why should<note place="margin">Gods under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and will produce Persons.</note> there not be the like operations upon the Godhead from his other attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, as there is from the understanding, and from the will? for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding begets <hi>verbum</hi> a word; and from both proceeds <hi>Amor,</hi> which is the action of the Will; and here are three distinct Persons, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said of the rest of Gods attributes. Surely the answer is very plain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because the understanding, and the will of God, they look <hi>ad intra,</hi> they reflect upon the Deity it self; for thus God is the object of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, he understanding himself, doth thereby enjoy most infinite happiness; he is likewise the object of his own will, or his love, for knowing himself to be infinitely good, he must therefore love himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, and is therefore necessarily, the finall end of all. So that all are refer'd unto God; but for the other attributes of God, they look [<hi>ad extra</hi>] upon the creatures; and therefore it is only proper to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and the will of God that only from them there should be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Son, and a procession of the Spirit; and so a difference of Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn this answer. Do ye think that what the Church shall determin in this and other mysteries, that it proceeds from the wit and invention of man? do you ascribe no more to the cloven tongues, that fell upon the<note place="margin">The determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Church, are more then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> Apostles, whereby they were replenished with Gods Spirit? and which Spirit they did conferre upon others, by imposition of hands, by electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or succession; and do you stile all this, by the wit and invention of man? when I consider the determinations of the Church, their form of divine Service, their Canons, their Discipline, their religious Orders; God knows, I do verily believe, that I do see more in them, <hi>then the wit and invention of man;</hi> and I think them to be the immediate dictates, and directions of Gods Spirit.</p>
            <p>But call them what you will, for these words of <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Trinity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Church in effect, doth translate.</note> truly I conceive them to be nothing, but the translation of Scripture; and I hope you will think translations very necessary; for the Evangelists, and the Apostles use the translations of the Septuagints, in their quotations of the old Testament; if then Christ shall prescribe the form of our Baptism to be, <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost;</hi> and that we know there are no Accidences in God, but all are Substances [<hi>and distinct Substances</hi>] surely I know not by what other term I should call Substances, and distinct Substances, but by the name of <hi>Persons;</hi> and if these three Persons be one God, and so the Scripture stiles them, <hi>The word was with God, and God was the word;</hi> surely I know not with what other words to express it, but by the name of <hi>Trinity</hi> or <hi>triunity.</hi> So likewise those words of Schoolmen, <hi>Deus intelligendo seipsum genuit verbum,</hi> are not these words taken out of Scripture, <hi>hodie genui te,</hi> and thence they infer, <hi>verbum in intellectu?</hi> Thus without the determinations of the Church, and unless due respect and reverence be given to the Church, no Religion can subsist, but will instantly fall to confusion.</p>
            <p>Thus as our understanding begets a word; and there is a mutuall love,<note place="margin">The personali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</note> and correspondency between this understanding and this word, so if God be said to beget a Son, or a Word, in a spirituall manner in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and that from both proceeds the holy Ghost, the Church must then necessarily conclude, that they are severall and distinct Persons, not that we should conceive them to be like the Persons of men, with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscription of time and of place, in various and different formes; but to be divine Persons, all alike partaking of one infinite nature; and what God hath revealed, what the Church hath explicated, that we believe; desiring the same God, by the inlightning of his Spirit, to engender faith in our hearts, to strengthen and increase it; and what God hath reserved
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97249:29"/>
only for his own knowledge, that not curiously to pry into, but content our selves with such a measure and proportion of knowledge, as he hath been pleased to impart: remembring that the first Sin which gave occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all the mischieves and miseries which have befallen us, it was the tasting of the Tree of knowledge, whereby in stead of that great light, which we aymed at, whereby we should have knowledge like God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we had our eyes opened, but it was to see and feel our own naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to our own confusion.</p>

Yet here we must take heed of curiosity, and know the weakness of mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that we cannot speak of God, but after the manner of men: and it is most probable, that God should commit his secrets to the care and custody of his Church, which may put them into such form and fashion of speech, as may best beseem them, rather then that particular spirits, who are so apt to be misled with errors, even in things of least mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, should be left to their own inventions and expressions in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est mysteries.</p>
            <p>But how should the whole Deity be in every Person? is it not true in all<note place="margin">The Godhead being spirituall and infinite, is imparted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loss.</note> Homogeneall bodies? Suppose the elements that where they are, they are totally, they carry their whole nature about them: but this truth more especially appears in spirits; for there is nothing so common and triviall in Schooles, as this known principle, <hi>Anima ubi est tota est tota in toto &amp; tota in qualibet parte totius.</hi> But if this Deity be wholly imparted, yet then how should it still remain whole and entire? is it not proper to all spirituall qualities, as Light, Knowledge, and the like, that they should be communicated, without any loss, or diminution of themselves? Here then at length consists the whole difficulty, that the nature being imparted, there should be no difference in number, reason seeing the difficulty, sees likewise the reason of the difficulty, for her own further satisfaction; for this in the creatures proceeds from the bounded, finite, and limited na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the creatures, which must be circumscribed both with time, and with place, and so make a difference in the number; but if you will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

            <p>What I have hitherto written, hath been according to the opinion of<note place="margin">Proofes of the Trinity in nature.</note> our best, and most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>earned Divines, together with the acknowledgement of the whole Catholick Church, to which I do believe a man may very safely subscribe; for whatsoever is there related, as it is grounded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so it is strengthned, and fortified with the Bulwark; of naturall Reason and Philosophy; and against which, the most wicked Socinian shall never be able to oppose. Hereunto, as an addition give me leave to relate my own private opinion, which I hope may be without offence, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God or man, for that it proceeds not out of any vain presumption; neither doth it any way derogate from the truth: but whether it ariseth from a strong apprehension, and from a minde, that is totally possessed with the love of truth, and admiration of this great and ineffable mystery, that I leave to better judgements.</p>
            <p>The first is, that I do believe, and am confident, that this mystery of<note place="margin">The Authors private opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> the most blessed Trinity doth together, and as well as all the rest of Gods attributes, appear, and is plainly made manifest in the works of nature; and in the framing of this created, visible, corporeall world. My reasons, and arguments briefly are these. First, see in the framing of the creatures, what footsteps there are of the Trinity; which may in some measure, point out a Triun-efficient cause: take nature in her first ground and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, are there not three distinct principles, the Matter, the Form, the sympathy, and agreement between both? see how these principles are knit and united together; the Matter, <hi>tamquam matrix &amp; commune se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarium;</hi> the Form, <hi>edu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>itur ex materia;</hi> the sympathy, and agreement, indifferently arising from both. Or if you take the Elixir of bodies, have not the Chymists found out that all bodies consist of <hi>Sal, Sulphur, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury?</hi> Thus far it is in the constitution of things, take then the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the kinde; do not the Male and Female agreeing in nature, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in sex, number, and person, bring forth an issue?</p>
            <p>I will leave curious subtilties in Philosophy, and descend to the gross,<note place="margin">Footsteps' of the Trinity.</note> and terrestriall substances; wherein you shall likewise observe some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure shadow of a Trinity; Do not all bodies consist of three dimensions, Longitude, Latitude, and Profundity? and these necessarily, and insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly knit and united together? do not all qualities admit of three degrees of Comparison? is not the most perfect number the number of Three? which I think was the occasion, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> could say, <hi>In numero ternario perfecto colitur Deus.</hi> A strange speech for a Heathen man! whether he spake it casually, or blindely of himself, or whether by an elevated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, he was carryed in an extasie or trance; or rather, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose guided by a divine providence, being the King of Philosophers, among the Heathen; like <hi>Caiaphas</hi> at the Death and Passion of Christ,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97249:30"/>
God put into his mouth words, which he himself understood not, as it were to give a true testimony to succeeding ages, for the conversion of the Heathen.</p>
            <p>No perfection ought to be denyed to the Deity, suppose that all things<note place="margin">Reasons in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to prove the Trinity.</note> were good in their own kinde, in the root and foundation of nature, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods own approbation, <hi>Et vidit deus &amp; erant omnia valde bona,</hi> yet are there severall and different perfections: as first, in respect of quantity, there is one perfection of an unity, an other of a number; let the number appear in the Persons, the unity in the Godhead: so secondly, in qualities they are good in themselves, good in diffusion, <hi>Bonum est maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè diffusivum sui ipsius,</hi> what is finitely good, doth finitely commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it self, therefore that which is infinitely good, must infinitely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it self, within it self, to the Persons in the Deity. Thirdly, in relations there is a paternal, there is a filial relation, both perfections must appear in the Deity. Fourthly in Actions it is the highest perfection of the Creature, <hi>Generare sibi simile,</hi> and therefore not to be denyed to the Deity; yet being impossible to produce many severall infinite natures; therefore different Persons do appear in one and the same infinite nature; for it is as proper for God to be perfect, as it is to the Creatures to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; let all perfection be elevated to the Deity, while the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like dross fals upon the Creatures: man himself though fruitfull in his own kinde, yet corruptible in his own kinde; the Angels though beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and incorruptible, yet fruitless, and barren like <hi>Rachel;</hi> but with God in respect of himself there is a generation, without any corruption or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution; as in respect of his works, there is a creation without any change in his nature. Fifthly, God made man according to his own Image, and likeness, and then God spake of <hi>Adam, Non est bonum hominem esse solum,</hi> it is not good for man to be alone, let us make him a helper like unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. If then man be like unto God, why may not he reflect upon God? and say unto God, <hi>Non est bonum Deum esse solum,</hi> it is not good for God to be alone: we will therefore in all humility prostrate our selves; and with boldness and confidence adore three Persons in one Deity; for the greatest comfort which a man hath in this world, it is in a sweet society, therefore God injoying infinite happiness, he must have <hi>Consortium aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> a sweet society; there must be severall persons in one Deity.</p>
            <p>I come now to my second position, which God knowes as it proceeds<note place="margin">Gods preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive may be examined.</note> from no ill intention, so I hope through his Mercy, I may deliver my poor opinion without offence: I confess that Supreme Magistrates are very tender of their prerogative, as without which they cannot support their government; and therefore they seldom name it, but with this addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Parenthesis, <hi>Quam argui nolumus,</hi> so jealous they are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and of their own power: but surely with God it is otherwise, for he is able, as he made the world of nothing, so with the least word of his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97249:31"/>
mouth, to reduce it again to nothing, and thereby upon every occasion to vindicate his own Authority.</p>
            <p>Here then I will first inform you, That it is necessary that every act which God doth, it should partake of God, and what is contrary to Gods nature, it is without the compass of Gods power; God can do no injustice, being Justice it self; God cannot speak an untruth, being Truth it self; or commit any sin, being Goodness it self. 2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, God can do nothing to the prejudice or disparagement of himself, as to make any thing independent from himselfe, but it is necessary, as it was made of nothing, so it must be continually supported from falling to nothing, to which of it self, being left to it self, it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly fall. 3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, God can do nothing according to the uttermost extent of his Power; the Reason is, because his Power hath no uttermost extent, but is every way Infinite: So when he hath made the most excellent Creature, (in respect of such as are now in being,) yet still he is able to create a more excellent: and as in every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God doth imprint a Character of himself, whereby it speaks the<note place="margin">A resemblance of the blessed Trinity must appear in every creature.</note> praise of the Maker: so my second position is this, That as there is not any creature, wherein at this time the footstep and impression of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity doth not appear, as I have already proved; so I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God can make any creature, wherein the stamp or mark of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity shall not be imprinted. My reason is, that God alone is <hi>Actus purus &amp; simplicissimus,</hi> nothing but pure form, a light without shadow, or an absolute perfection, without blemish or spot; but whatsoever is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides God, is was created by God of nothing, and therefore in respect of this nothing from whence it arose, it must have in it self <hi>quiddam poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiale,</hi> something defective and imperfect, that being made of nothing, it is apt of it self, being left to it self, to return again to nothing: So then it must consist <hi>ex actu &amp; potentia,</hi> and there must be <hi>vinculum</hi> or <hi>ligamen</hi> to knit or unite together this <hi>Actum</hi> and <hi>Potentiam.</hi> So here is some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of the blessed Trinity, in effect, those three first Principles, whereof every thing doth subsist, and which are so much insisted upon in Philosophy. And here you see that the blessed Trinity doth necessarily appear in the works of God, as well as the rest of his Attributes.</p>
            <p>More particularly if it be lawfull to make comparison between small things and great, wherein I do the rather presume, because I know my intention to be harmless and innocent, and I serve a merciful God, who is apt to forgive sins, especially such as proceed out of ignorance, I would<note place="margin">The knowledg and love of man, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents it works.</note> take notice how farre forth this Mystery of the Trinity is shadowed forth in the knowledg &amp; affections of man himself. It is the counsel of the wisest Philosopher, <hi>Nosce teipsum,</hi> Know thy self; thou mayest make better use of the knowledge of thy self, for the direction of thy self, to thine own happiness, then of any other forain or outward knowledge: so for the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97249:31"/>
love of thy self, it is imprinted in thy heart, that man should love himself above all others, <hi>Proximus ipse mihi,</hi> and all his actions tend, and are directed accordingly: which may a little, if not point out, yet resemble the operations, which the knowledge, and love of God do cause in the blessed Deity; and therefore if we were to prefer some of Gods Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes above others, natural Reason would say, that his Understanding and his Will did excel all the rest of his Attributes (as they the most active and eminent qualities in every spirit) for first, our Understanding must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us, and then our Will must execute; so in God they are the most eminent of all his Attributes, for God himself is the object of his own Understanding, and his own Will, and so he is not of the rest of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, for he is not the object of his own Power, nor of his Justice, nor of his Mercy, but onely of his Understanding, and of his Will, and these being operative, and producing some fruits (as all the rest of Gods Attributes have their proper effects) needs they must produce wonders in the Godhead, to the astonishment and admiration of Reason.</p>
            <p>Consider how the strong apprehension and longing of a woman in the<note place="margin">The longing of women.</note> time of her childe-bearing, makes an impression sometimes in the mother, but most commonly in the infant, to the astonishment of Philosophy, when the Physicians with their Dissections and Anatomies, can neither shew the means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the manner, but profess their own ignorance.</p>
            <p>And as the Understanding works such effects, so in the next place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the nature of our humane love, which of all other passions is the strongest, and doth most firmly and inseparably unite, and therefore<note place="margin">Two persons become one.</note> makes two persons, man and wife, in the eye of the Law, to be reputed but as one person: and this is much more strange, that two persons having two natures, and differing in Sex, should be but one person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then that one nature should be in several persons; yet so the wisdom of the Law esteems them, and it were high presumption in any man, to question their wisdom. Mans understanding and mans love, have such operations in mankinde (and no other faculties in man have the like.) Thus in the Schools it is said, <hi>Intellectus fit quod intelligit,</hi> The understanding doth work upon it self; and for our love, <hi>Amor unionem,</hi> Love hath ever that property and appetite, as to desire an union: how the poor mother hugs the childe in her arms, takes it into her bosom, and with all her might and power would fain incorporate the childe into her self! and if such be the effects of our understanding and our love, then what may we conceive of the understanding and love of God?</p>
            <p>But contraries do sometimes best appear by contraries, and therefore to<note place="margin">The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and love are causes as of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion so of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction.</note> know the strength and efficacy of the understanding and love in man, consider them in their defects and abuse, and in the heavy judgements which sometimes befall them; for all fits of Madness, when men are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted and out of their wits, most commonly they arise either from the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97249:32"/>
understanding, when with night-watchings and studies they distemper themselves, and so with strong impressions of melancholy, have not the right use of their wits; or otherwise when with outragious lusts, in the strength and vehemency of their love-passions they do impart themselves, and then rest in their rage and their fury besides themselves.</p>
            <p>God grant that I do not offend in making any Comparison to that which is incomparable, the Mystery of all mysteries, the Secret of all secrets, and is ineffable, not to be understood by Men or Angels; yet seeing God hath in part revealed it, I thought fit, with all humility and submission, prostrating my self at the footstool of Gods Throne, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it, according to the Tenents of Gods Catholick Church, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, strengthning, and confirmation of our faith.</p>
            <p>I will now at length give this admonition to the Socinian, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth to believe no more of God, then his own Reason shall teach him; and Reason, we know, depends upon the information of sense;<note place="margin">How <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Thus he should not believe all those delicious and beautiful fruits which the Eastern Countrey affords, nor should he believe those great Whales and Monsters of the Sea, whereof he hath not been an eye-witness; nor should he believe the former Ages of the world, nor take any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the relation of others, much less should he believe a spiritual world, which is of another nature and condition; nor should he believe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the heavens, which exceed his Reason, for they are not sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; nor should he believe the working of Gods Spirit, and that his prayers should be of any efficacy or power. And thus he utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws all Faith and Religion, and so in effect is a profest Atheist, onely he would cover it with a cloak and pretence of natural Reason, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some great skill and knowledge in Philosophy, which I know to be very little, very little indeed: and were my age fit for an encounter, I would question their skill in Philosophy, as here I will give you a little taste thereof.</p>
            <p>And first, see and consider the great difference and opposition between<note place="margin">The an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And this I have learned of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97249:32"/>
Heathen, who did erect an Altar <hi>ignoto Deo,</hi> to the unknown God, or to the incomprehensible God. Surely there is a greater difference between the true God and man, then that we should make God of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and condition with our selves, as that we should think our selves to be able to comprehend him.</p>
            <p>Before I proclaim war, I have ever thought it a necessary point of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, first to try how far forth the difference may be reconciled, and so to go hand in hand as far as Honesty and Truth will permit us; and when as once we become irreconcileable, then to make an utter separation, and every man to stand on his own guard. That I may then deliver my opinion concerning natural Reason, how far she is to be admitted in Religion; I do not commend credulity, nor would I have a man apt to believe, but upon good grounds: <hi>Memento diffidere</hi> is the first Rule in Policy, though I confess, as Mysteries are above Reason, and that I would have Reason to know her distance, and not to incroach too far, yet would I have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to have full satisfaction, for it is the guide which God hath given to man for his direction, not onely in Humane and Civil things, but even a little to prepare and direct him in his way to salvation, and to make him capable of Religion (whereof the brute beasts are not:) and though Religion be as far above Reason, as the Heavens are above the Earth, yet is she no way contrary to Reason, but serves to inlighten, and to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie<note place="margin">The excellent use of reason in Religion.</note> Reason, and to confirm Reason in her own Principles and grounds, as the Heavens adde beauty and perfection to the Earth: for neither Jewels nor beautiful flowers, can be discerned, or appear glorious, without the light of the heavens. Thus for all the Moral Law, which is a great part of Religion, Reason serves as an excellent Glosse, or a Commentary, for the Exposition. Thus Reason being sanctified, having a tincture of grace, serves to draw excellent Conclusions, and Theological Precepts, <hi>out of the premises of Scripture:</hi> but if we should know no more of God then Reason informs us, surely we should be then very unreasonable, for we should know nothing of the state of that other world, since natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can make no discovery of a supernatural world.</p>
            <p>If then we should know no more of God, but onely so far forth as may be gathered by the works of Nature, it would much shorten our knowledge of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a little detract from Gods glory, besides a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterous course: for whereas we are to govern and teach the dumb crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who are onely made for our use, and therein attain their own ends; now on the contrary, they should be our onely teachers, to direct us to<note place="margin">Dumb crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures catechise the Socinians.</note> our last end and perfection, if all our knowledge of God should be onely by their information, and that we should know no more of God, but onely so far forth as they should instruct us, or catechise us: and seeing that every day we learn more and more in the creatures (for new quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and secrets of nature are daily discovered) it must hence follow, that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97249:33"/>
as yet we have not learnt so much of God, as the creatures can teach us, they are our very learned Schoolmasters, and we are ill Proficients, and thus contrary to all good order and form, our Reason must be subject to their sense, even for the knowledge of such things, as do infinitely exceed all sense and all reason.</p>
            <p>Nor is it possible that God should be so forgetful of man, as to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him with all the provisions of this world, for his back and belly, for<note place="margin">God is mans Schoolemaster.</note> his kitchin, his wardrobe, and yet should neglect his breeding and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to teach him at School, and there to instruct him in his necessary ways and means to attain his last end and salvation. Surely God is more merciful to the dumb creatures, for they have a natural instinct in themselves, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and necessary for their preservation, to conduct them to their own last natural end; and what is wanting in them, God hath commanded man to take the care and charge over them: yea further, God hath given them some priviledges, as that they should take the benefit of a rest on the Sabbath, that they should have some refreshing in their labours, <hi>Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the corn,</hi> that they should be priviledged from slaughter when they are breeding; and God hath given them an ingenuity, to be taught what is fit for their condition. Thus the horse learns his pace, remembers his way, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his last end is to be a Traveller: Thus is there a natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in every thing, to conduct and direct it self in attaining its own last natural end.</p>
            <p>And surely God will be no less merciful to man in supplying him with such means as shall be necessary for his last supernatural end: The world was created for man; the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, have their continual motion, for the fruitfulness of the earth, and the preservation of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary world; and all nature tends to the use, service and ministery of<note place="margin">Man is the end of nature, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not end in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> man: Man is the end of nature, and therefore man cannot end in nature, or have a natural end, by the course of this world, and the continual suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, he knows it can be but a passage, he sees the bounds of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural world, the material heavens; and then he concludes, that needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove this natural world, there must be a supernatural world; thus over and above his natural knowledge, which consists in a rational discourse, he findes in himself wonder and admiration, which may serve him for his knowledge of that supernatural world: Thus he still looks up to heaven, and by his aspiring thoughts, his hopes, and expectation, he seems to cast up an Anchor to heaven, and wants onely wings to fly up, or a ladder to climb, and that blessed Spirit which came down in the form of a Dove, supplies him with wings of grace and the Cross of Christ serves for his ladder, or for Mathematical <hi>Jacobs</hi> staff, to take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>I will further adde by the actions and carriage of man, it appears, that God hath placed in him some Majesty and magnificence, that he justly claimes more then a naturall descent; for if you take the elements, they are moved by their own naturall qualities, and their highest ayme and intent, is only to preserve their naturall beeing; so the dumb creatures (consisting only of elements) they run the same course, and have no higher ambition, for they have no choyce, freedom, or liberty, in their actions, but are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried<note place="margin">How man stands natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affecte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

by the act and exercise of the understanding, from the will proceeds <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> as the heart is the fountain of all affection; and thus is there some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of the blessed Trinity, in the manner and form of mans appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.</p>
            <p>Come we then to look into Gods Attributes, which some distinguish<note place="margin">Gods perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, consists not in variety, as the Creatures doth.</note> in this manner, that most of the Attributes are <hi>operative,</hi> some are <hi>not ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative,</hi> yet make for the perfection of the Deity, but there are none <hi>passive:</hi> such as they conceive are not operative, are the eternity of God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his continuance, the ubiquity of God in respect of extention, the immutabillity of God in respect of duration, the constancy of his will, as ever making choice of the best, and so makes for the certainty of his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, &amp;c. And these men are thus misled, because they conceive the greatest perfection to consist in variety; and because amongst the creatures, such accidences as proceed from the <hi>Matter,</hi> suppose <hi>all quantities,</hi> they are not operative; but truly I am otherwise perswaded; for I think that there is but one best, and <hi>that one best must be Gods nature,</hi> for better it is to be operative, then not to be operative; God is <hi>actus purus,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but pure form, and it best befits and resembles the nature of spirits, which are alwayes in action; for to be not operative, it comes neerer the condition of Stocks and Blocks; which in doing nothing, seem to incline to idleness and sloth; and if once it be acknowledged, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all Gods attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are operative, then better it is to be fruitfull then barren, rather to produce some fruits, then none at all; and these fruits to be rather perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent then transient; and these attributes concern the Godhead it self; for as God is the first efficient cause, so is he the last finall, to whom all is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
            <p>Now of all the attributes of God, to speak according to the manner of<note place="margin">The effects of Gods power &amp;c. do not alwayes appear.</note> men, the Understanding and the Will are the most excellent, and have the most wonderfull operations; they are likewise the most inward, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate such as cannot be discerned, but by Gods own relation of himself; and thus it fals out with man, who was created according to Gods Image, we can easily judge of mans strength, of his age, and other ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lities; but for his understanding and his will, they are most private and secret to himself; and I pray here note, that Philosophers do seldom reckon the understanding, and the will of God amongst his other attributes, but they do usually supersede them, as if they were eminencies, and excellencies in God above the ordinary attributes, for though they were all eternall, and equally perfect in God; yet did they not alwayes appear in their effects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therein God did moderate them, and qualifie them, as seemed best to his wisdom; for before the Creation, Gods Power did not appear in the effects; Gods providence in governing the world did not appear, when as yet there was no world to be governed; the justice of God could not appear in any outward act, when as yet no sin was commited; the mercies of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97249:34"/>
God could not appear in relieving miseries, when as yet there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but God himself; all these attributes of God, though they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally in God, and every way alike perfect in regard of virtue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy; yet in the outward act, in respect of the effects, God appointed his time, when first to manifest them, and that according to measure and proportion; for God did not work according to the uttermost of his Power, he could have created many infinite worlds, with the same ease and facility; so then these attributes, which concern the Creatures, there was a space when they had not their act, and exercise.</p>
            <p>But above all others, there are two principall the understanding and the<note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Gods understanding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Here then we may expect admirable ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, more then of his other attributes, for they look outwardly upon the Creatures, but these look inwardly, and reflect upon God himself, and are operative, and produce wonders; his other attributes doe not so nearly and inwardly concern him, as his understanding and his will do, (as for example) God cannot be the object of his own Justice to punish himself, God cannot be the object of his own Mercy; for to be in case and condition of relief, it implies imperfection; God is not the object of his own omnipotency, for he cannot work upon himself, to adde any new perfection to himself, or to make any change, or al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eration in his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; so for Gods providence, though he governs the world yet he doth not thereby regulate himself. Thus the attributes which concern the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though they were eternall, and equally perfect in God, yet they did not appear in their objects, before God began his Creation.</p>
            <p>But it is necessary that God should ever know himself, and his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and thus knowing himself by the act, and exercise of his own understanding, which is alwayes operative, and not barren but fruitfull; needs he must beget in a spirituall, and most excellent manner, <hi>verbum in intellectu,</hi> a word in his understanding, every way answerable to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, for here God imparts himself <hi>quoad ultimum posse,</hi> and so he doth not in the Creatures; and by this word, knowing himself to be infinitely good, needs there must proceed from the word, and from the understanding, <hi>amor infinitus,</hi> an infinite love, answerable to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and proportion of the goodness; and these are the proper fruits of Gods understanding, and his will from all eternity, and what is from all eternity, is every way infinite; and can be no less then God himself? That is a Person in the Deity, which Persons have no difference between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but onely in respect of the act of generation and procession; so that God without the act of knowing himself, and loving himself, he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97249:35"/>
could not subsist one minute, but he subsisted many infinite Ages, and was alike perfect in himself, before the Creatures were made. So then here is the difference, other attributes of God, produce the Creatures of God; but his understanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his will, being inward and reflecting upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">What kinde of Persons there are in the Deity.</note> they produce Persons in the Godhead; which notwithstanding we must imagin not in a carnall, and in an humane, or sensuall manner; as if Persons should be circumscribed with time, place, circumstances, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther differences, but in a most spirituall, and a most excellent manner, as all things in God, are incomprehensible, so is the generation of this Word, and the procession of this Spirit, and the personality in the Deity; thus as God is his own beginning, subsists of himself, preserves and continues himself; so he must be his own end, and his attributes must tend to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.<note place="margin">God only must reveale the Trinity.</note>
            </p>
            <p>These are those inward and secret jewels, which are lockt up, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed within the Cabinet of the Deity, such as are not alwayes visible; for they are not kept, or to be seen in the outward Shop, or Magazin of the Creatures, as other attributes of God are; but the understanding and the will of God, they are most inward and secret, such as God himself must reveale, as amongst our selves, the thoughts and intentions of man, must onely be discovered by man himself. Yet we are confident in this, that the fruit of Gods understanding, and his will being in God himself, they can be no less, then God himself, (i. e.) severall Persons in the Deity, which God himself hath been pleased to reveale.</p>
            <p>So then there is a difference between the attributes of God, and the act<note place="margin">What God did before the Creation.</note> and exercise of those attributes; for Gods omnipotency is not alwayes creating, Gods Justice is not alwayes punishing; and many infinite Ages past, before there was a Creation; and this was necessary, that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might know their distance, and how inconsiderable they were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God, who was alike perfect and absolute without them; and God himself making choyce of his own instant for their Creation, did thereby manifest, that he was a most free agent; and the Creatures wholly depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, both for their beginning and all other circumstances ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying; while before their Creation, God wanted not a greater and a more excellent imployment, in the eternall and spirituall generation of his Son, and the procession of his Spirit, for these were from all eternity. God in his own understanding must ever know himself; and knowing himself to be infinitely good, he must therefore infinitely love himself; and these must ever work <hi>ad ultimum posse,</hi> and because they look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; therefore they produce Persons, and not Creatures, which Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are the works of his free-will; and may subsist or not subsist at his pleasure; and are qualified as he shall dispose; and have their beginning, as he shall appoint: So then here is the difference betwixt his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and his will, from his other attributes, for these look <hi>ad intra,</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:97249:35"/>
and therefore produce Persons in the Deity; whereas his other attributes look <hi>ad extra,</hi> and therefore produce only Creatures of the Deity.</p>
            <p>I will yet give an other instance, whatsoever man receives in this world,<note place="margin">Mans salva ion hath more refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Persons, then to his other attributes.</note> whether in respect of soul and body, whether for food or rayment, as there is nothing in man, which he hath not by the free gift of God; all these are the fruits of Gods attributes; but when I come to the last end, and perfection of man, which consists in a beatificall vision, or in a large measure and extent of Gods knowledge, together with a most perfect union, love, and conformity with God, these seem to have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Persons in the Deity; for the vision hath reference to the word in Gods understanding and mans conformity to God, hath reference to that love of God, which proceeds from the understanding; therefore these last perfections of man, coming neerer the Persons in the Deity, and more representing them, are therefore of a more excellent condition, then the fruits of his other attributes; so that which makes mans supreme and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happiness, it is a compliance, as with the attributes of God in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; so more immediately with the severall Persons in particular, by a beatificall vision, and a wonderfull love and union with the Deity.</p>
            <p>And thus it is in all spiritual Substances, the Understanding and the<note place="margin">The exce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Here I did examine all the miracles, and the most remarkable things in<note place="margin">In the notes which are plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and lost.</note> the old Testament; and first I did reduce all the Ages of the world to the Deluge, where I did infer by many probabilities, what past before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge; for that it could not stand with the Mercies of God who created all things to begin with such an heavy Judgement, as an universall deluge; and because we have no other Records of those times, but the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I did therefore produce necessary and demonstrative arguments for the proof of the Deluge, and of Scripture, together with some remarkable Tokens, I did insist upon, which must needs point out some former times before the deluge: here I made good proof, that the Eastern parts of the world, must needs be the first parts inhabited; I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the greatness of their Monarchies, their continuance and dissolution; I shewed how all other Nations issued from them; and how they borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Customes and Manners: I shewed how the Hebrew was the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Tongue of all the Eastern Languages, by the roots, and by the proprieties of that Tongue. I did instance in all the Ancient Monuments; and made it appear, that the world could not be elder then the time related by <hi>Moses</hi> for the Creation.</p>
            <p>For the Histories before Christ, I did use <hi>Torniellus, Pererius, Salia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>

It is true, that at this day heathen there are, but they no way partake with the Ancient Heathen, neither in the same gods, nor in the number of their gods, nor in the manner of their worship; only like upstarts, because they must have a Religion, (for they cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If hereunto you will adde Christs Miracles, which were above Nature, and did presuppose Nature, as being done in natural bodies, and though not offering violence to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet being far above the reach and power of Nature, and therefore therein Nature did seem to suffer. Seeing this supernatural power is much above Nature, surely it may be truly said, That the natural world cannot contain those books which might be written of Christs supernatural power, for they include Nature, they exceed Nature, they are over and above Nature; and therefore something must remain, which the natural world cannot contain. And this shall serve to have spoken of the great mystery of the most holy, blessed, and undivided Trinity.</p>
            <p>Thus I hope in God I have given satisfaction to mans Reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e no less then God himself, for there is no accident in God, there is nothing in God but God. Yet these being produced by the Understanding and the Will, needs they must have such a difference between themselves, as to make several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the Deity, which is not so with the rest of Gods Attributes, for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97249:40"/>
they look outwardly upon his works, and therefore onely produce the creatures: And though the blessed Trinity do infinitely exceed mans ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, yet doth it no more exceed, then all the rest of Gods Attributes do; for they are all above reason, beyond reason, and infinitely transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding reason, but no way contrary to reason, and therefore they are the objects of our faith, in respect of Gods knowledge revealed, and they are the objects of our admiration, in respect of our own natural ignorance. And so to conclude, Persons being supposed in the Deity, here is one step and degree towards the Incarnation, for now we may with more confidence lay hold on a Person in the Deity, and cloth him with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and our flesh.</p>

and in defect of our knowledge, Reason gives way unto faith, and thence insers a necessity of grace, to sow the seeds of this supernatural faith in our natural hearts. If mans condition were wholly above Reason, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Angelical, then he should have his Religion altogether by infusion, without any rational discourse, but being such as it is, surely both his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and his Senses must concur in his Religion, his Reason to strengthen<note place="margin">Reason and sense must join in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> his Faith (having first received satisfaction in her self) then his senses must joyn in the service of Religion, as memorials to his Reason, to stir up and increase his devotion, and for the honor of Gods worship and service, that God might be served like a God, with all decent Ceremonies, with all rich and costly Ornaments, while our Sectaries, out of their sacrilegious ends, though otherwise under the colour of Idolatry) abandoning these, they do indeed rob God of a great part of his honor, though with the Jews they do not murther Christ, yet they can be content to share in his garments, to make him poor and naked, and both his servants and service con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.</p>
            <p>Thus is my intent to give satisfaction to Reason in the mysteries, onely<note place="margin">Mysteries are to be adored, not curiously to be searched into.</note> I love to distrust my self, and therefore on my bare knees I do humbly desire God in his mercy, to grant, that I may not offend in prying too far into the secrets of God, they are above my reach, capacity and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, onely so far forth as God hath revealed them, for his honor, and for the strengthning of our faith, I hope I may explain them, and therefore here I fall down in humility, prostrate my self, and humbly adore those great blessed Mysteries, <hi>The ineffable Trinity, The wonderful Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which God hath revealed, the Church hath received, whereof in our Baptism we make our profession; and God grant that we may all live and die in the true faith of Gods holy Catholick and Apostolick Church, without which there neither is, nor can be any salvation.</p>
            <p>See how credible things are in Religion, as God created all things of<note place="margin">What God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of the Creatures.</note> nothing, and is the first Efficient Cause; so undoubtedly he must be the final Cause, to whom all things are directed: for being the most excellent good, he cannot so deprive himself, but he must be the end of all. Thus all things tend to his glory. And as God hath done so much for the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to make them of nothing, to preserve them from falling to nothing, to give them whatsoever is necessary or convenient for their beeing, no doubt but God will expect something from the Creatures, that according to their abilities they should in some sort express their thankfulness. Thus the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, do move as God first appointed them, they do not alter their course, they neither hasten nor slacken their motion: so it is with the Elements and dumb Creatures, they follow the course of their nature, according to that path wherein they were first put, they still keep their way, and do not offend; and as from God they have their beeing and protection, so there is due from them unto God, a thankfulness in

And this they attempted even against God, in despight of God, who made them of nothing, and from whom they held in courtesie what they had, and in whose power it lay, every minute to destroy them; yet did they oppose God, and fain would subsist of themselves without God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was in effect to equal themselves to God, and to enter upon Gods Throne: therefore were they justly cast down, and became the most accursed, and had the most wicked imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>in tormenting others, to be tormented themselves.</hi> All this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture relates; and by their punishment, it is made most credible, the work of Creation, is a work of mercy, for thereby God imparts himself, and if any punishment do befal the Creatures, it argues their sin and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression in deserving it.

               </gap> Secondly, their sins were spirituall, as Pride and Presumption, which stand more in opposition to God; and are more hatefull unto him, then carnall sins of Gluttony.

            <p>That the forbidden fruit should be the Tree of knowledge; how<note place="margin">God used means.</note> many fruits and plants are there, which upon an instant intoxicate the brain, and bereave man of understanding? then why may not other fruits and plants, refresh the understanding, and by generating good spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten it and quicken the apprehension? is there not an Eye-bright which serves in stead of Spectacles to clear the sight? Hereunto you must adde Gods speciall appointment, and ordinance; who as he can do all things without means, so he may do all things with meanes, according to his own good will and pleasure.</p>

breach of Gods command, in taking the pleasure of a delicious fruit; and thereby the flesh prevailing against the spirit.</p>
            <p>In this triall of mans obedience the same cursed Angel, who was his<note place="margin">The Devill tempts man.</note> own destruction, being now forsaken of God he became desperate; and whether out of his hatred to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or his envy to man, he begins to tempt and seduce man; and not appearing in his own shape, for then he might have easily been discovered; he takes upon him the shape of a serpent; and inticeth the weaker vessel, the woman to break that only commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which God had prescribed; this was done in the infancy of the Creation, when <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> might happily be ignorant, whether the rest of the Creatures were rationall or irrationall? whether they were dumbe, or spake a language? they might see that their works, and all their naturall actions were very agreeable to reason; and the Creatures having all the instruments of speech, why might they not be supposed to have the free use, and exercise of speech, as well as man? and for other things, they could speak nothing by their own experience; we have heard of Monsters of men, whom by their shape and form, you could hardly know to be men; yet had they the use of reason. There was a Fish taken in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. so like a man, that Fishermen were mistaken, and did conceive him to be a man indeed; certainly without triall and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which our first Parents could not have so immediately upon the Creation, it was easie for them to mistake: I should never believe that Parots and Pyes should speak so distinctly, were it not that I find it by proofe.</p>
            <p>But not to trouble you with every circumstance, the Angels did sin spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually<note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mans sin was small.</note> in their pride and presumption (sins spirituall answerable to their condition) as they are wholly spirits; Man subsisting of flesh, sinned car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in tasting the forbidden fruit; and therein his flesh prevailed over his reason in breaking Gods command: only some of the Angels sinned, and they were punished accordingly; but the first Parents of Mankinde sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and in them according to the course of our own ordinary justice, their whole race and posterity was to suffer; but the punishment was small, for they had the benefit of repentance, whereby they might not only have remission; but likewise through the Mercies of God, and the Merits of Christ, they might attain a greater degree of happiness, then was at first allotted unto them: And for that punishment of death, which God enacted by a Statute Law, <hi>Statutum est hominibus semel mori,</hi> alas it is but the transition to a better world, whereby we take the possession of that, whereof we are not now so capable; and therefore it should be a great part of our desires, <hi>Cupio dissolvi &amp; esse cum Christo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus after the fall of Angels, God having given the like freedom of will unto man, in pleased God likewise to make tryall of his obedience in giving him the free use of all the rest of his Creatures, only forbidding one

fruit, <hi>the Tree of knowledge,</hi> which might be seen, but not tasted; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by might appear, whether Gods command, or mans inordinate appetite, were the more powerfull in man? or whether man subsisting of flesh, and spirit, which of these should be predominant? whether man being placed between the blessed Angels, and dumbe Beasts, should by his abstinency and conformity to God, draw neerer to the Angelicall state, and become more spirituall? or by his carnall uncleanness, giving way to his appetite, and gluttony, he should fall down to the sensuality of Beasts? that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he lusted after, he should not deny himself, what his own eyes, and his carnall concupiscence should offer unto him, he should greedily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; and thus by the tasting of the forbidden fruit, which the Socinians conceive to be but a small offence, there is implyed the great opposition between the flesh and the spirit.</p>
            <p>Now for the truth and demonstration, that man did offend, it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear<note place="margin">My book of he fall of man.</note> by the punishment; for I have already proved by undenyable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that man is fallen from his first integrity, and perfection; and that the state of the world is much changed and altered, since the Creation; that many things have, and do daily befall man, which can be no less, then the punishments of sin, and the just effects of Gods vengeance; that man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by his fearfulness and naturall uncleanness, seemes to acknowledge a guilty conscience, and himself to be justly condemned. This I have already proved; and I set forth a Book to that purpose about 40 years since: the Title of the Book is, <hi>The fall of man, or the fall of Adam from Paradise, proved by naturall reason,</hi> wherein I do not only give satisfaction to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; but I do plainly evince it by many naturall proofs; I consess I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do the like for other mysteries, but only for that alone, because it comes nearer our naturall state and condition, while other mysteries are far above our reach, and concern the state of another world; but the fall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Nature must manifestly, and demonstratively appear in the effects and punishment of sin; and therein the ground and foundation of Socinianism, is utterly dissolved; and though since that time, many of their Books have been vented, and published; yet I never heard that the scope and intent of that Book, was ever so much as questioned; which I am ready still to make good, and to justifie now in my old age, though my strength, memory, and intellectuals do a little faile me, I thank God for it.</p>
            <p>Man being fallen from his first integrity, as God would not utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him, so neither would he suffer him to continue in a sinfull state and condition: look what distance there is between heaven and earth, between life and death; such and so great is the distance and opposition between corrupted nature and grace, therefore needs there must be a regeneration, and a redemption of man; but whether this should be done without means, only by Gods omnipotency, as was the act of Creation, therein
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97249:44"/>
we doubt; it is true, that in the Creation no means could be used, (for then there was nothing but God) yet notwithstanding in the Creation it self as soon as God had created the confused mass of the heavens and the earth out of nothing; then immediately he useth this generall mass, as a means for producing particulars, <hi>Producat terra herbam virentem, pro ducant aquae reptile,</hi> and that light which was created the first day, did serve to make the Sun and the Stars the fourth day; and in the constituted course of nature, there is nothing done without meanes, the sap and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the earth, together with the Sunshine, and influence of the heavens, (God appointing, protecting, concurring, and blessing his own means) serve for our fruitfulness, and to continue nature in her own kind: Thus in Religion, God hath instituted Sacraments and Rites; then certainly the<note place="margin">God doth ever use meanes.</note> same God, who is ever so constant in the uniformity of his works (for that he doth ever make choyce of the best; and therefore is not uncertain, or wavering in the constancy of his own resolutions) he would use means in the work of mans redemption, as well as in the preservation of the world; for God out of his infinit love, desiring to impart himself, as he gives a beeing, whereby Creatures made of nothing, may together subsist with himself; so they subsisting to honour them the more, he refuseth not their help, but useth them as means, that they should together cooperate with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Thus in all naturall works God useth meanes, and why not in super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturals? it is most credible, that the same wise God observes the same wise course, for the effecting of his own will; nor can this disparage God, for the means are none other, but such as God himself doth appoint; thus is God the beginning, the end, and the meanes, that God may be all in all.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that meanes must be used to purchase our redemption<note place="margin">The treasures of Nature.</note> (i. e.) that a price or ransome must be paid for our sin, but where should we procure this ransom? if we have it not of our own, where shall we bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it? who will be bound for us, or become our surety? it is true that God hath locked up in the bowels of the earth (as it were in Natures coffers) great treasures of Gold, Silver, precious Stones, Minerals; and these serve to make our Coyn, which carries the price of all things; whereby these worldly commodities are bought, and sold in the Market; and these will serve to pay for the ransom of Princes, or to corrupt Magistrates, and to buy their consciences; or for any other worldly or finister imployment: and answerable hereunto, God hath his coyn in the materiall heavens; his Golden Sun, his Silver Moon; and as the Chimists observe, there is not a Planet, which hath not a speciall influence upon some Metalls. Thus do Gods treasures in the heavens cause the generation of ours in the bowels of the earth; but alas, all these are temporary, the rust doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume them; and therefore they are not currant mony to purchase eternity; neither yet do they serve in the exchange, and remission of sins.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:97249:44"/>After the Metals, we will consider the Vegetatives, the beauty, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness<note place="margin">Vegetatives.</note> of fair and delicious flowers; the odoriferous, and aromaticall fruits, the pretious drugs, and all whatsoever else the earth doth afford; these may very well be Natures incense, or sacrifice to God; but alass, their odours do vanish, like vapours; and cannot wash away the spots, and cleanse the uncleanness of sin.</p>
            <p>After the Vegetatives, we come to the Beasts, such as have motion and sense; and in them by their slaughter and sacrifice in the Mosaicall Law, we finde the just deserts, and rewards of our sin, that <hi>death is the wages of sin;</hi> so that God in the Law, did institute sacrifices to betoken the truth of things to succeed; for it appears that the spots and staines of sin have so far defiled, and made such a deep impression in man, that they cannot be washed away, but by the effusion of bloud, <hi>it is bloud and bloud only, that must serve to scoure them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From beasts come we to Man, for whom the whole world was created,<note place="margin">Man alone not sufficient to satisfie for sin.</note> and in whom the whole world did transgress; and having now found out the principall party, we must lay hold on him, he is our Prisoner; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we proceed first against him, we cannot touch upon the accessaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>death being the wages of sin,</hi> therefore man must dye: but seeing the sin was of infinite malignity, as being committed against an infinite Majesty, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires either an infinite price and ransom, or an infinite punishment and satisfaction: therefore the death of poor silly man alone cannot suffice, though we must take it in part of payment, yet it cannot discharge the whole debt.</p>
            <p>We must then ascend higher, and if meanes be used in the redemption<note place="margin">God and man must joyn in satisfying for sin.</note> of man, as it is a work of the highest nature, so needs it must have the most excellent meanes. This whole world is sublunary, and serves for our inferiour uses, to cloth the back, and to fill the belly; it cannot reach so high as the heavens, or the work of our redemption; the Angels are only our gardians, they attend and assist us; and being so meanly ministeriall, it were high presumption to make them our redeemers; for they cannot be sufficiently thankfull for their own beeing, much less are they able to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for the sin of others; which sin being infinite, requires an infinite sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and therefore none but God alone can suffice, for in justice there must be a proportion between the offence, and the punishment; but if the punishment should be infinite, either in the torments, or in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, then there were no place for Mercy, but it should be wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, which being one of Gods attributes, it must ever subsist; therefore it was necessary, that some infinite Person should suffer; and seeing that the work of Redemption is far greater then the work of Creation; and therefore we call the time, <hi>Hebdomada major,</hi> for in the Creation there was no resistance of Gods Power (for there was nothing) but in the work of redemption, our sins stand in opposition, and thereby hinder
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97249:45"/>
Gods action; and therefore God is pleased not to use any of those generall attributes, which performed the work of the Creation, as the omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in making, the providence in preserving, the justice in punishing; but a Person in the Deity must be ingaged, and the more to interest him, in the cause, and the more for the satisfaction of justice; there must be an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staticall union of the Godhead and Manhood in one Person, whereby the weakness, and guiltiness of man supported by the power, and al-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Godhead, might make a full satisfaction for sin; and though it be not agreeable to justice, that an innocent should dye for the nocent, yet by the free oblation of himself it seems very reasonable and just; and thereby he <hi>becomes a true reall propitiatory sacrifice</hi> for the sins of the whole world; and as man using means under God, repentance and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for sin, laying hold on Gods Mercies in Christ, shall receive the full benefit, so I doubt not but the cursed Angels, the very Devils themselves, may finde some mitigation of punishment, even by Christ's Passion; for God could infinitely increase their Torments, as their sins have justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;<note place="margin">All Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are by Christ.</note> and it is the mercy of God to binde them up in chaines, that they might not be permitted to do more mischief, whereby they might further provoke and incurre Gods heavy wrath and vengeance against them; and that they are capable of some mercy, or at least of some miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of punishment; they are Gods creatures, they partake of a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall nature; and are in the compass of Gods generall mercy, which may abundantly suffice all; and I do ascribe all the mercies of God to Christ.<note place="margin">A Person in the Deity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems us.</note>

            <p>Thus then for our redemption, no less then a Person in the Deity can suffice; and as this is necessary in respect of justice, which requires a due recompence; so in regard of the purchase, which is no less then the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, and a Crown of Glory; and therefore could be of no less undertaking, and performance, then of a Person in the Deity; and that it should be the second Person, because he is the word, or the wisdom of God; and the sin was committed against the wisdom of God, by tasting the Tree of knowledge; and though God be life in himself, &amp; imparts life to all others, yet hereby he makes himself lyable to death without which there could be no satisfaction. Thus God becoming man, he is inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed in the cause; and so the Justice and Mercies of God are fully recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled in Christ.</p>
            <p>Thus the Incarnation being presupposed, let us now consider what inconveniency or disparagement it may be, or rather what advantage, or prerogative, may thereby accrue to the Deity; and how all the creatures are thereby exalted and honoured, but man especially is infinitely tyed to his thankfulness. For any dishonor to the Deity, certainly there can be none at all; for the whole universe, in respect of God, is as nothing; and therefore what aspersion may arise from the Creatures, and be cast on the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97249:45"/>
Deity, it doth utterly vanish, and come to nothing. Thus the mists, and ill vapours of the earth ascend no higher, then the middle region<note place="margin">No dishonor to God to be incarnate.</note> of the aire; and there they are dissolved into Showers, Storms, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, and so fall again to the earth: thus Blasphemies and sins done in contempt of God, yet no way sasten on God, or any way obscute his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, but thereby God takes occasion in justice, to powre down his wrath and vengeance upon the transgressors. Thus God according to his own ubiquity is every where, and in every Creature, yet without the least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to himself: as the Sun-beams or light, shining upon the most unclean and sordid places, yet are thereby no way tainted, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; much less can the Godhead receive any blemish or stain from his Creatures. So there being no inconvenience, let us see what advantage, benefit and honor redounds to the Godhead by the Incarnation.<note place="margin">Gods infinite love.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, we know, and our Fathers have told us, that the love of God towards man is infinite, but how shall this appear really and actually, if all the fruits of Gods love towards man, be finite, and so bounded? therefore it is requisit, that some act of this infinite love might appear; this is done by an infinite bond, by an hypostaticall union of God with our nature; and this is such a bond, as that God himself can do no more, he cannot come nearer man, then by uniting the two natures in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and this we must truly confess to be the fruit, and plainly to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate Gods infinite love towards man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we confess Gods omnipotency; but how shall this appear,<note place="margin">Gods omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</note> unless there should be some infinite Creature? It is true, that making must something of nothing, there being an infinite distance, <hi>a non ente adens,</hi> it needs argue omnipotency; yet this is only in respect of the manner, but that Gods omnipotency might every way appear, it is necessary there should be an infinite Creature: and here behold God and Man are united, and become one Christ, who is truly infinite, and omnipotent; and therefore doth every way confirm Gods omnipotency.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Incarnation seems to adde some perfection to God, and<note place="margin">Gods experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> to improve Gods knowledge: it is true, God knowes all the miseries and sorrowes of man, all his imperfections and weakness; but he knew them not in that manner as now he doth, for he knew them not by way of triall and experience in himself. The sick patient, who feeles the smart, and sorrow of his disease, may seem to have better knowledge then the Physitian, who hath it onely by speculation; God himself had not that experimentall knowledge of mans condition, before he became man, and put on our nature, and in his own Person became subject to passion.<note place="margin">Gods Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, to vindicate the Justice of God, for God requires no more of man, then what God performed to man. The Creation was done by the word of his mouth, <hi>verbo virtutis su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> with the greatest ease and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97249:46"/>
but what God requires of man, it is accomplished with sorrow, labour and misery, therefore here is no proportion. Now to stop the mouthes of blasphemers, God himself hath taken up mans nature, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make himself subject to passion, and so to perform more in his own person to man, then he requires of man, or that man can perform unto God, for that God died for man, but man dies for his own sins.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, as God was the Creator of all things, the end and conclusion<note place="margin">The Mediator.</note> of all, so it was necessary, he should be the Mediator and Redeemer of man; that so God might be all in all, the beginning, the means, and the end.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, it was a great addition and increase of honor to God, which I<note place="margin">A new honor of God in his Title.</note> prove by the Title which God assumes to himself: for whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was called <hi>The God of heaven and earth, The Lord of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, The Maker and Creator of all things, The Lord God of Hosts:</hi> now he assumes another Title and style of honor, to be called <hi>The God of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob,</hi> which is a more honorable style, then to be called <hi>The God of heaven and earth,</hi> seeing that he was then in their loins, who did infinitely exceed the whole Universe. And as this was his Title in the Old Testament, so in the New he is called more particularly <hi>The Father of our Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> and this is Gods greatest honor.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, and as these advantages and prerogatives accrue unto the Deity by the incarnation of Christ; so there are great priviledges which<note place="margin">The dignity of the creatures by the incarnation.</note> befal the Creatures, in having God to be one of their number and socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for without this priviledge, the Creatures might have expostulated with God, that although they were made of nothing, yet still in respect of God they were nothing. Now God is verity and truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to verity and truth, they were yet still as nothing: See then how much God is disparaged in the work of his Creation, that he should create nothing of nothing: See how man and all the Creatures are become contemptible, for that in respect of God, <hi>that is in verity and truth,</hi> they are nothing, this were to abate their thankfulness to God, and to make them dislike their condition; and man himself, though he may seem to boast of Gods love, that he was created according to Gods image, yet still he discerns, that there is an infinite distance between God and man: but when as once God became man, and the Creator was made a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this did not onely shorten the distance between both, but did indeed incorporate them, and made both Natures, God and Man, to be one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as if God should descend from the Throne of his Majesty, and come nearer the Creature, and stretch a hand out of the clouds, while poor man out of the dust, raised by Gods grace, lifts up his hand of Faith and Hope, and while these two hands meet, and are joyned and coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there becomes a perfect marriage, both are united in one Person, the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97249:46"/>
Deity puts on our weakness, and our manhood is clothed with Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>: And thus is there a perfect union in the Person of Christ.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, though the Creatures were made by God, yet still it lies in<note place="margin">The Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the creatures.</note> Gods power to unmake them, and in every minute to reduce them to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and some wic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed men might a little distrust God, but for the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the continuance of Gods favors, God is become man, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor made a Creature, both Natures now fastned and riveted together by an indissoluble knot of marriage, which can never be broken; and which serves as a great ingagement and assurance from God, to preserve and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his graces and blessings upon the works of his own hands, whereof we have a pledge or earnest in Christ, perfect God and perfect Man, both Creator and Creature united in one Person, never to be separated. So I hope it plainly appears, that as the Incarnation can be no dishonor to God, so it tends to the great honor and settlement of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>In speaking of the blessed Trinity, I began with the beginning of S. <hi>Johns</hi> Gospel. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word.</hi> Then for proof and assurance of this great mystery, I ended with the end of S. <hi>Johns</hi> Gospel, wherein he affirms, that <hi>the world could not contain the books which might be written of Christs acts;</hi> thereby intimating, that the works and miracles that Christ wrought above natural power, did most abundantly serve to confirm and justifie the works and mysteries which he taught above natural Reason. And now that I come to the Incarnation of Christ, where the invisible God becomes visible man, it is strange how this our Apostle S. <hi>John</hi> alters his style: for in his first Epistle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. speaking of God in our flesh, he saith, <hi>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. <hi>John</hi>'s testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the incarnation.</note> 
               <hi>we have seen, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life:</hi> So that he who speaking of the Deity of Christ, like an Eagle soared aloft, as it were out of sight, even beyond all humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and understanding, speaking now of the Humanity of Christ, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends so low, to make it more manifest and palpable, as he seems to fall beneath sense, for that he calls all the senses of man to witness, <hi>which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled:</hi> and this in effect twice repeated, whereby we may be the more assured of the truth of his Manhood.</p>
            <p>As there was an eternal generation of this Word according to the Godhead, so was there a Temporal birth of this Word in the fulness of time, according to his Manhood: for these two Mysteries, though very different in themselves, yet are they both very wonderful. In the first you shall observe three Persons in one Nature; in the second you have three Natures in one Person; a Trinity of Persons in a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97249:47"/>
Unity of Nature, and a Trinity of Natures in a Unity of Person, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, three distinct, several, and real Persons, yet all subsisting in one undivided Essence of the Deity; the Flesh, the Soul, and the Godhead, three distinct and several Natures, yet all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in one undivided Person of Christ.</p>
            <p>How wonderful is the mercy of God, that whereas our Saviour the<note place="margin">The incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeds from Gods mercy.</note> second Person in Trinity was All-sufficient and happy in himself, yet in commiseration of man, man that had sinned in the root, sinned in the bud; when to our first-fathers guilt we had heaped up innumerable trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions against the day of wrath, he took up our nature and infirmities to satisfie for our sins, to offer up himself as a propitiatory Sacrifice to reconcile us to God: Men, Angels, and all other inferior created powers, cannot any way satisfie for the least part of our guilt, as not being able to be sufficiently thankful for their own beeing.</p>
            <p>Sin is an infinite evil, as being committed against an Infinite Majesty; and therefore in the exact ballance of Gods Justice, requires no less then an infinite Rans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>m, or an infinite Punishment. Righteousness and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice pleaded against man, that our sins were such as could not stand with his integrity freely to pardon; Mercy and Peace put him in minde of his ancient love, that as he had freely created man, so now likewise in the bowels of compassion he should freely intend the Redemption of man. And thus it was concluded in the High Court of Parliament in the highest<note place="margin">Gods Justice and Mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled in Christ.</note> Heavens, that God himself, Christ Jesus the second Person in Trinity, should take our Nature upon him, that as every act of his proceeding from his Deity, the shedding of the least drop of his blood, the trickling of one tear, the suffering of one stripe, the least temptation, was of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite value, of infinite estimation: so he alone was able to recompense for sin. And thus it was fulfilled what was said by the Prophet. <hi>Mercy and Truth have met together, Righteousness and Peace have kissed each other:</hi> Here is the agreement, and thus is God and man reconciled, by the coming and Incarnation of our onely dear Lord and Saviour Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>When I consider the first sin, the sin of the Angels, I cannot conceive<note place="margin">The occasion of the sin of Angels.</note> that such excellent Creatures in their own kinde, understanding Natures, intelligent Spirits, should attempt such a foul offence against God, as to ascend up to his Throne, to take upon them Gods Majesty, were there not some probability, or likelihood to effect it. I cannot say, whether they had it by immediate infusion from God, or to speak after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, by some common fame or report, that the Creator and Creature should be united in one Person; or whether by the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their own knowledge, they did fitly gather, that as the Creation was a work of Gods infinite love, and as God was existent in every creature, according to the infinite extent of his own nature; so undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly as an effect of that infinite love, God should tie unto himself some
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97249:47"/>
creature by an infinite band, namely, by an hypostaticall union: And this their Conceit gave some way and occasion to their pride and presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, as claiming and challenging that high prerogative, above other creatures, by virtue of their birthright. But herein did appear the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight and ignorance of the Angels, for the creature was not to aspire to the height and dignity of the Creator, but the Creator was to descend to the humility and baseness of the creature; neither was God to be<note place="margin">Christ was not to take the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Angels.</note> united to the Angelical nature (though otherwise highest in order and condition) but to descend lower, to give a more undoubted token of that infinite love, even to the humane Nature and Manhood, mans Nature being the Centre in the midst of the Circumference, a little Microcosin, in whom all the creatures are united: things sensible partake in his Body, the intelligent Spirits are combined in his Soul; and thus God taking the nature of man, sits in the very midst of his creatures, imparting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self infinitely to all, so far forth as it may well stand with the truth of his Godhead, and with the state and condition of the creature.</p>
            <p>But supposing the three Persons in one Deity, why should the <hi>Word be</hi>
               <note place="margin">Why the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Person, rather then any other, should be incarnate.</note> 
               <hi>made flesh,</hi> the Father and the Spirit excluded? Certainly, if we were to make choice of the Person, reason would inform us, that to be the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural son of man is more agreeable to the natural Son of God, then to the unbegotten Father, or to the proceeding Spirit: The manner of his double birth would testifie the same truth, begotten in the understanding of God from all eternity, conceived in the womb of a Virgin in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of time. The nature of that sin which was the first motive of this descent, seems to fasten a necessity upon the second Person of the Trinity, it was a sin against the wisdom of God, the tasting of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>Eritis sicut Dii scientes bonum &amp; malum;</hi> and therefore fit it was, to shew the large treasures of Gods mercy, and the strictness of Gods Justice, that the same wisdom offended, should satisfie for the offence, <hi>Foelix culpa quae talem habuit Redemptorem;</hi> where is the wrong?<note place="margin">How Gods words are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</note> where is the injury, when the party offended shall satisfie? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will with humility retort Gods own words upon himself, who upon the fall of man could say, <hi>Ecce Adam quasi unus ex nobis;</hi> so now upon the fall of God, that is, upon the descent of God, we will say, <hi>Ecce Deus quasi unus ex nobis.</hi> If man lose the image of God, as concerning Holiness and Sanctity, wherein he was first created, nothing can restore this image, but that which gave the first impression. If man cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himself unto God, then for an upshot and agreement between both, necessary it is that God should consorm himself unto man: Man lost Gods image, God takes up mans image; and this was most competent to that Person in the holy Trinity, who as the Apostle describes him to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> was <hi>Splendor gloriae, &amp; figura substantiae Patris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observe, I beseech you, the creation of man, being made of the earth,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97249:48"/>
               <hi>God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life:</hi> Breath, if it were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able<note place="margin">The incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intimated in mans crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to Gods nature, yet certainly proceeding from an intelligent Spirit, it could not be bare breath, but necessarily it must be accompanied with some word, especially considering, that in all other Creatures you shall finde the power of this word; for God spake the word, and they were created. But here this word is concealed, and therefore we may well sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that there is some mystery concealed.</p>
            <p>Behold then the first earnest of his Incarnation, God intending a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between the Deity and the Humane Nature, he takes the body of man, as it were taking his wedding gloves, breathes in them, to extend them, to warm them, to sit them for himself, at length puts them on. Here now at length the word accompanies the breath, the breath made us living souls, the word shall make us quickning spirits; breath gave us a natural life, the word shall regenerate, and give a new birth: and thus by virtue of this breath, by virtue of this word, man hath a double root,<note place="margin">The first <hi>Adam</hi> and the second <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </note> the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and the second <hi>Adam,</hi> taking sap from both; he is <hi>Arbor &amp; arbor inversa,</hi> he hath a root downward, and a root upward, he treads upon the earth, and looks up towards heaven. And thus God, if ever intending the renewing of his Creatures, sit it was, that God should there begin, where he did end: Man was the last work of the Creation, and therefore in man there must be the first beginning of renovation, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiat ubi desitum est,</hi> it is a rule in all works, and here you shall finde it true by experience, the last work is first perfected, <hi>For the Word was made flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I would gladly demand of the Jews, who do not acknowledge<note place="margin">The great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery in Gods name.</note> these mysteries, either the Trinity, or the Incarnation, Why should God be so careful and curious in giving himself a Name, a Name it is, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordained to make a difference in a multitude, as many men of one kinde are distinguished by their names: But the nature of God is one, as the Sun is but one, and therefore wants no name, but the name of his own kinde. Gods Name then, as it imports no difference in his nature, so it implies a distinction and difference of Persons in that one nature of the Deity. This will better appear, if you please to consider that great and ineffable Name of God, the Name of four letters: The first letter was <hi>Jod, quod significat principium,</hi> and doth undoubtedly betoken the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Father; The second was <hi>He, quod vivere significat,</hi> setting out the second Person, as being life in himself, though life by participation, imparting life unto the Creatures, for <hi>in him we live, we move, and have our being,</hi> he is <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life;</hi> The third letter was <hi>Vau, quae vim apud Hebraeos habet Copulandi,</hi> intimating the love of God proceeding from the Father and the Son, whereby the Father and the Son are united; The last letter it was the same with the second letter, <hi>He</hi> twice repeated, <hi>ut duas in filio fateamur naturas, &amp; Dei &amp; Hominis.</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:97249:48"/>
And that you may conceive that this observation of the Name, proceeds not from mans fancy, and conjecture, I pray give me leave to bring an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Example to this purpose.</p>
            <p>When God had tied himself unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> as touching the promised<note place="margin">The name of <hi>Abraham</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</note> seed, in token hereof it pleased God to change the name of <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>Abram</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> by the addition of a letter; so likewise of his wife, from <hi>Sarai</hi> to <hi>Sarah,</hi> by the substraction of a syllable, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a letter. Now you shall observe that this letter, which was added to both their names, it was indeed one and the same letter, and it was a letter of Gods own Name, the second letter of his Name, that as the second Person was to be united to the nature of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> so this letter given and received, might serve as a pledge or an earnest to signifie that union.</p>
            <p>Observe the phrase and style of Scripture, <hi>Verbum Domini venit ad</hi>
               <note place="margin">Several presages of Christs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note>

Why should God speak of himself after the manner and fashion of men? I cannot disallow the opinion of our Divines, that God speaking to mans understanding, fit it was that he should descend to mans capacity; but desiring that truth in Gods words might altogether appear, I had rather apply them to an intended incarnation, then to admit a bare figure in Gods words, which happily to us might be some occasion of error.

all Nations, Peace and Plenty within their walls, a wise and a just Law, Politick and good Governors, valiant and victorious Captains; and yet in those dayes there was a continual expectation of the Messias, not to adde to their worldly pomp, but to establish a higher Kingdom, the Kingdom of Grace and of Truth, which herein exceeds all earthly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it wants no outward Thrones nor Ceremonies to set forth his own greatness, but it appears glorious in baseness, powerful in weakness, that so Gods immediate hand might better discover it self, who <hi>pulls down the mighty from their seat, and exalts the humble and meek.</hi> Far be it that the coming of the Messias, the expectation of all Nations, should only tend to worldly and transitory honours, which is but vanity of vanities, and cannot quench the moderate thirst of the soul; neither is so befitting mans present state and condition for this world, which we now inhabit, is but the place of our exile, a vale of misery, a just punishment for our fathers disobedience, and onely serves as an earnest, or a passage to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther happiness. If Paradise were to be replanted on earth, God had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expelled man Paradise; yet let the Jews apply those Promises of<note place="margin">Christs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> glory to the second coming of Christ, his coming to Judgement, and there shall they finde them truly verified according to the letter, that not one tittle of the Law can miscarry.</p>
            <p>Thus having incountred with the Jews, I will now come to the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statical Union of this Word with our flesh: for Explication whereof, I do much commend the saying of a Father, <hi>Nec inferiorem consump sit</hi>
               <note place="margin">Two several Natures.</note> 
               <hi>glorificatio, nec superiorem minuit assumptio,</hi> two distinct and several na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Godhead and Manhood, and yet the weakness and infirmities of man not swallowed up in the Majesty of God, nor yet Gods Majesty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based or lessened by the assumption of the Manhood, but both continue whole and entire, both make but one Person, Christ Jesus, our dear and blessed Messias.</p>
            <p>I will illustrate this with two similitudes: God first appearing to<note place="margin">Similitudes to set forth the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
               <hi>Moses,</hi> appeared in the form of fire in a bramble bush, the fire not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming the bush<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the bush obscuring the fire, but both continuing whole and entire in their own nature. 2. Our Saviour is here styled by the name of a <hi>Word:</hi> and in a word you shall observe these two parts; <hi>Sonus,</hi> a sound, the elision of the air proceeding from the mouth, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing the ear; and likewise <hi>Verbum,</hi> a significant word, carried by the Conduit-pipe of this sound, and informing the understanding. The sound proceeds from motion, and onely beats upon the sensitive part; the word taking his descent from reason, doth likewise speak to the reasonable soul, neither sound nor word are confounded, neither sound nor word can be separated. I will not onely content my self with bare similitudes, but it shall further appear by a type. <hi>Benjamin</hi> had two names, from his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was called <hi>Henoni,</hi> that is, the son of sorrow, the son of affliction;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97249:49"/>
and from his father he took the name <hi>Benjamin,</hi> that is, the son of Strength, the son of Portitude and Courage. Make the application to Christ.</p>
            <p>Now, for the possibility of this union of the Godhead with our Nature,<note place="margin">The possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> doth not Reason inform us, That as Creatures have their condition from God, so it cannot stand with the same goodness of God, without great, and just occasion, to alter and change their state and propriety. See you not God in all his works, and yet the works still continuing and subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their own kinde? Canst thou conceive how all the contrary Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments should be combined in one compound subject? Canst thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how the body and soul are united, two distinct and several substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of several kindes, the Spirit and the Flesh, not necessarily depending upon each other, the soul having life, motion, action, existency, without the help of the body, and the body likewise subsisting in his own Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without the information of the soul? Then why should it seem strange or incredible, that the Godhead and Manhood should be linked in one Person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> since nothing is impossible to God, but that which implies a contradiction?</p>
            <p>From this union of the word with our flesh, necessary it is that the<note place="margin">The conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the Incarnation.</note> manhood of Christ should receive all possible infusion of grace, all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible perfection, which may be any way competent, or stand with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a creature; and that in the first moment of this union, Christ increased in knowledge, but it was according to mans apparance and Judgement; for in his first conception, the manhood in the right of the Deity, contained in it self all the treasures of Gods wisdom, the fulness of knowledge; which notwithstanding by degrees, according to mans state and condition, did manifest and discover themselves.</p>
            <p>This band between both being indissoluble, which did well appear in<note place="margin">How the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited.</note> the time of Christs (passion hough the soul and the body were separated, yet the soul and the Deity were never divorc'd) and two distinct natures being knit together by this indissoluble bond, making but one person; hence it is, that there is a mutuall communication of attributes between both, and that without the breach of truth; mans weakness fastned on the Deity, and Gods power ascribed to mans infirmity, <hi>Deus natus est, &amp; passus est, homo fecit miracula, &amp; captivam duxit captivitatem,</hi> in this union nothing was wanting to Christ, which was necessary to mans nature, no imperfection redounding in Christ, whereof the nature of man might be priviledged, he was conceived without sin, and therefore might well subsist without sin, yet the punishment of sin, of that originall sin, <hi>Morte morieris,</hi> being tyed to our nature, by a Statute Law, <hi>Statutum est homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus semel mori,</hi> if God takes up mans nature, he cannot be exempted from that penalty; though free from the sin yet lyable to the punishments as sustaining the person of whole mankinde, and with his undeserved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97249:50"/>
satisfying for all; but for our actuall transgressions, as he was likewise free from these sins, so neither could the vengeance of God, due<note place="margin">No sickness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could befall Christ.</note> for those particular sins, seise upon Christ; no error in his understanding, no perverseness in his will, no blemish in his body, nothing defective in his members, no sickness could attach him, no leprosie infect him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the price of his innocent bloud, being of infinite value was made an infinite ransome for sin; and takes away the guilt, both of originall and of our actuall sins; for he dyed for our sins, and rose again for our justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and thus is the Word made flesh; God is manifested in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of the Angels, preached to the Gentiles, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on in the world, and received up in glory.</p>
            <p>And now I come to the manner and circumstances of Christs Birth<note place="margin">The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Christs Birth.</note> and Nativity; not intending to speak any more of the mystery it self. I wil only insist in some very few outward circumstances, not unlike our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Historians, who sometimes unacquainted with the secresies of State, the close carriage of business, and the inward affaires of kingdomes, are able notwithstanding to discover many severall circumstances, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward occurrences, whereby the judicious reader better conceives then the Author could happily inform: so here for want of due knowledge, I will only acquaint you with the circumstances, reserving the mysterie it self, to your godly and serious meditations; these circumstances, I will divide according to the Schooles division, <hi>Antecedentia, concomitantia, subsequentia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First in the preparatives to his coming, I might be infinite in relating<note place="margin">The prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to his coming.</note> the severall promises of God, as touching the seed of the woman; the Stock, Tribe, and Family, to which these promises were tyed and intayled; the truth of these promises, continued in many prophesies, acted out in Types, resembled in figures, shadowed in parables, offered up in bloody sacrifices; and in a word sealed and confirmed unto us, in the whole scope and intent of the Law; from hence proceedeth such a certain expectation of the Fathers, that in their infallible hope and assurance, they went so<note place="margin">The Gentiles.</note> far, as to make his nuptiall Song, the Song of Songs, the Canticles, <hi>as if they had been to bo sung,</hi> on the day of his marriage; and in their deaths, that it might appear, that still their hopes did survive them. I will only instance in <hi>Jacob, Expectabo salutare tuum Domine,</hi> in token hereof, as it were making his last Will and Testament, bequeathing his soul unto God; he takes order for his Christian buriall, layes a charge on<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jacobs</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation.</note> his Son, to carry his dead body out of Egypt, as it were then going to Jerusalem in Pilgrimage; that so, Christ at his coming, might tread upon his dead bones; and that he might for ever rest near the place of his rest, the holy Sepulcher.</p>
            <p>But I will here only make choyce of prophesies, for that it is said that<note place="margin">The prophesies of Christ.</note> Christ before his coming, was <hi>Assimilatus in manibus prophetarum,</hi> fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:97249:50"/>
out in wax, in the hands of the prophets: not unlike a custom of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who intending to match with strangers, as it well beseemes their high condition, and stands with the policy of government State; having no opportunity upon all occasions, or suddenly to meet themselves; first they send their Ambassadors to treat of a marriage; and together with them, their own pictures, to move love and affection. So Christ intending to espouse himself to the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> willing not personally to appear before the fulness of time were accomplished; first sends out his prophets, who so lively and accurately describe him to the world, as that in his coming, we could not mistake either in his person, or in his condition; but if I should give way to all severall prophesies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I should prove infinite; How am I plunged with varieties, and over-laded with plenty, in this argument! I will only tye my self to some few prophesies, which point out the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant time of his coming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. The scepter shall not depart from <hi>Judah,</hi> nor a l. a wgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<note place="margin">The coming of of <hi>Eltah.</hi>
               </note> from between his feet, untill <hi>Shiloh</hi> come, and the people shall be gathered unto him; that this is meant by the <hi>Messias</hi> all confess; and it is manifest by the word <hi>Shiloh,</hi> which signifies the prince of peace; that the time is now accomplished it is apparent in <hi>Herod,</hi> who first succeeded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and put down their <hi>Sanedrim</hi> or councell house; consisting especially of the chosen men of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> in so much that many of the Jewes, well perceiving that the time was now come; and knowing Gods promises to be certain and infallible, they began to acknowledge <hi>Herod</hi> for their<note place="margin">Herodians.</note> 
               <hi>Messias,</hi> as succeeding the tribe of Judah, in the government of that State; and from thence they are called <hi>Herodians,</hi> as they are mentioned in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles. Others seeing that all things were not accomplished in <hi>Herod,</hi> began to acknowledge <hi>Vespasian</hi> the Emperor for their <hi>Messias,</hi> as having the government of the Roman Empire; and pretending that he was descended by his Mothers side from the high Priest, and the tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> A third sort seeing that all things were not accomplished in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> or <hi>Vespasian,</hi> began presently to rebell, and stir up in Armes against their Prince and the <hi>Romans;</hi> as then expecting upon this occasion, that their <hi>Messias</hi> should manifest and discover himself; and at length recover their weak, decayed, and ruinated Monarchy. The best of them the high Priests, the Scribes, and the Levites sent to <hi>John Baptist</hi> to know, whether he were that expected <hi>Messias</hi> or not? as being privy and guilty to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that the time was now come for the approach of the <hi>Messias;</hi> How<note place="margin">Christ no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> as he Jewes expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</note> were these men deluded, when through pride and hardness of heart, they went a whoring after their own inventions, expecting a Lord ike, and a temporall <hi>Messias;</hi> and looking to the glory of this world, their eyes were dazelled; and they could not discern Majesty clothed in humility, power shadowed in weakness; our expected <hi>Shiloh,</hi> our deer and blessed <hi>Messias</hi> Christ Jesus; even at that time born of a Virgin, and laid in a Manger</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:97249:51"/>The second Text of Scripture to prove the just time of his coming, is<note place="margin">The time of his comming.</note> taken out of the ninth of <hi>Daniels</hi> Prophesie, whereby the number of weeks the time is described; so that by the exact computation of Chronologie, it cannot possibly betoken any other time, then the Birth and Nativity of our Saviour. The third Testimony is taken out of the second of <hi>Aggay</hi> 7, <hi>Yet a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the Sea, and the dry Land; and I will move all Nations, and the desire of all nations shall come; and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of Hosts,</hi> this could not happen at any other time, but in the dayes of our Saviour; and many hundred years are now past, wherein the Jewes have continued an ignominious, and desolate people; a reproach to all Nations, their Temple destroyed, their Priesthood abolished their Tribes confounded, their kingdom ruinated, and themselves scattered, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed over the face of the whole earth; and therefore these things were then accomplished, at the Birth of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>For the manner of his coming, see how all other Prophesies do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre<note place="margin">The manner of Christs comming.</note> with our Saviour, that he should be born of a Virgin, <hi>Esay</hi> 7. Born at <hi>Bethelem, Mich.</hi> 5. That then he should come into the world, when there should be an universall peace, for the greater propagation of Christianity, <hi>Esay</hi> 2. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. That <hi>John Baptist</hi> should be his forerunner, and prepare the hearts of men by preaching repentance, <hi>Mal:</hi> 3. <hi>Esay</hi> 40. that the Gospell should be preached to the poor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Miracles, <hi>Esay</hi> 35. and the 61. that poor, and yet as a King, he should enter into <hi>Jerusalem, Zach.</hi> 9. that the Gentiles should be called, the Jewes rejected, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. and the 66. Alas, I should be infinite, if I should run over all severall prophesies. Thus much in generall, there is not any one Action attributed to the <hi>Messias</hi> by the prophets, which is not most truly competent to Christ, all severall Types are likewise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished; the brazen Serpent lift up in the wilderness, the paschall Lambe slain in remembrance of their delivery from the bondage of Egypt, all other sacrifices offered by the Priests, for the sins of people: these and many other infinite are all fulfilled, in our dear and crucified Saviour. I shall not here need to speak of their miracles, for they tending wholly to strengthen, and confirm the truth of their Doctrine; their Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing referred to Christianity, their miracles do likewise testifie our faith and belief; and so I come to the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>Not any prophesie to my understanding, more evident and effectuall,<note place="margin">Prophesies and preparatives among the Gentiles, for the comming of Christ.</note> then was the prophesie of <hi>Balaam Numb.</hi> 24. wherein we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the certainty of his hope, <hi>videbosed non modo, intuebor sed non prope,</hi> the double nature of Christ, together with his descent and genealogie, <hi>stella orietur ex Jacob,</hi> the kingdom of Christ, <hi>Virga consurget de Israel,</hi> the power of this kingdome, together with the large extent, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this kingdom in the words following, <hi>Percutiet duces Moab &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>For the truth and confirmation of this prophesie, lest the Jewes might<note place="margin">A miracle to confirm the prophesie.</note> seem to distrust him, and wholly to neglect, and condemn all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles (when as notwithstanding some of them had the knowledge of the true God) behold a miracle, the Asse speaks; for I should as soon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that an Asse might see an Angel, know an Angel, discern the secret intent, and thoughts of an Angel, be able to speak, able to reprehend his master, though a prophet, as that a heathen man of himself should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prophesie of the comming and kingdom of Christ.</p>

            <p>But I will not borrow my evidences from Scripture, I will deal with<note place="margin">The prophesies of the <hi>Sibylls.</hi>
               </note> the heathen in their own Records; it was not the simple and rude multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or the ignorant and vulgar people, which so much admired, and extolled the <hi>Sibylls;</hi> but the <hi>Sibylls</hi> were famous among the learned, much esteemed of the wise, such as were the only Oracles in all the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties of State; and here see the wonderfull works of Gods providence, whereas their writings had lien moth-eaten for many yeers, wrapp'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use them under a certain penalty; see here a little before the Birth of our Saviour, by the Emperours command, they were reviewed, and set to the open sight of the world, that all people might take just notice of the truth; and accomplishing of these prophesies, see here a thing which seems casuall to the eyes of man: God hath ordained even by the means of bad instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Heathen Emperours, the manifesting of his glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:97249:52"/>Now for the subject matter, contained in their prophesies. I can give<note place="margin">The <hi>Sibylls</hi> speak very punctually of Christ.</note> no other Testimony but only this; it is impossible for the best grounded Divine, or the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s, all verified in our Saviour; then are contained in their prophesies. The blessed Saint <hi>Austin</hi> hath well observed, that the first Letters of their verses, being joyned together will make up these words, <hi>Jesus Christus filius unige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus Dei,</hi> Jesus Christ the only begotten Son of God. It were needless to repeat any of their sayings, seeing all of them tend, and bear witness of the <hi>Messias;</hi> insomuch as the Christians were ever after forbidden the use of their books, by the Heathen Emperours, the persecutors of Christ, lest they should convert, or confound them, by the Testimony of their own Prophets.</p>
            <p>Now for the Religion of the Heathen, see how God did naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graff<note place="margin">The Religion of the heathen a preparation to Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> in them some small shadow of his Deity; or otherwise permitted their errors, that so they might the sooner be brought to believe these my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Christianity, they acknowledged one God; and thus they were taught by the light of reason, for there can be but only one infinite; and yet they worshipped many God, as <hi>Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,</hi> and such like; which doubtless, hath some small resemblance, and is an obscure shadow of the Trinity; wherein we acknowledge three Persons, and yet but one God. Secondly, in their Gods, they considered one, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the rest, <hi>Divum pater, &amp;c.</hi> All of them link'd together in the Chain of consanguinity and kindred, and this may in some sort, set forth the eternall generation of Christ, that God the Father, did beget his Son; and from both proceeds the holy Ghost. Thirdly, their Gods were men, which in effect might intimate thus much, that God should prove man, Christ Jesus God and man, two d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>stinct Natures, and yet but one Person and substance; and thus the Jews in regard of the Divine revelation, the Gentiles by the principles of their own Religion, cannot suppose the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Christianity, to be strange and incredible; but all might acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Star of Salvation; which God hath prepared before the face of all people, to be a light to enlighten the Gentiles, and to be the glory of his people <hi>Israel:</hi> and so now I come to such things as are <hi>concomitantia,</hi> such as did accompany his Birth.</p>
            <p>God having decreed to take our Nature upon him, he prepared for<note place="margin">The Mother of Christ, an espoused Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</note> himself a chosen vessel, the most pure, spotless, immaculate, &amp; undefiled Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that ever did subsist of our corrupted flesh, the Blessed Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Blessed be the wombe that conceived my Saviour; and happy are the Paps, that gave him suck! <hi>Mary</hi> an espoused Virgin; and that for these five Reasons. First, that no unjust imputation should be laid against her, through the infamy of childbirth. Second<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y, that she might have the comfort of a spouse, a fellow-helper in such extremities. Thirdly, that the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97249:52"/>
Birth of Christ, might be concealed from the evill Spirit, who did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly foresee, that the <hi>Messias</hi> should be born of a Virgin; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the providence of God, that she should be an espoused Virgin; so to prevent his mischievous, and wicked practises and designes. Fourthly, for the approbation of all the severall states of men; virginity which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended unto us in the Mother of Christ, and yet an espoused Virgin; and there is the approbation of marriage. Fifthly, and most especially as I conceive; because the genealogie of <hi>Males</hi> was only enrolled, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick notice taken only of their Tribe; and they matching in the same Tribe, there could be no further question, but both were of <hi>Judah;</hi> whereof the promise was made for the descent of the <hi>Messias.</hi>
            </p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; see here there comes forth an edict from an heathen Emperour, that so the prophesie might be fulfilled, that the <hi>Messias</hi> should be born at <hi>Bethlehem, Mich:</hi> 5. Secondly, whereas there might be made some doubt of his Genealogie, <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> by virtue of this edict, were constrained to go to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> a City of <hi>David,</hi> thereby to make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that they were descended from the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> whereof the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi> was expected. Thirdly, whereas it was prophesied, that <hi>the Scepter should not depart from Judah, nor a Law-giver from between his feet untill Shiloh come,</hi> by this one act of gathering together the dispersed people, and that for the payment of Tribute to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to a forain Prince, it is manifest that the people were now in thraldom and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; and that the time now approached for the coming of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

but he was instantly circumcised among the Jews, which did serve for the triall and touchstone of his Manhood: so with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> he is here numbred and accounted amongst men. And as his Nature, so his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition did appear, that he was not to be any Temporal King, for he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in his mothers womb, to pay Tribute unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> and therefore <hi>Herod</hi> might be well secured of his own Kingdome, <hi>Non eripit morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia qui Regna dat coelestia.</hi> How many and how great Mysteries are contained in this one action, Time, Place, Genealogie and Descent, the truth of his nature and condition, all manifested by a Decree of an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Prince, little intending the good of Gods Church, <hi>God over-rules the hearts of Princes:</hi> And this is wholly to be referred to his All-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Providence.</p>
            <p>Coming to <hi>Bethlehem, Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> were lodged in a common Inne: No marvel, for here was the birth of a stranger and forainer, God of himself, yet now become man, being Lord over all, yet for our sins taking upon himself the form of a servant, &amp;c. Thus the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Why Christ was born in a common Inn.</note> for his birth and nativity, was answerable to his state and condition: In a common Inn, as being to extend equally his universal grace unto all, none are excluded from a common Inn, none are rejected from the bosom of the Church, the passage lies open to all, and all are admitted through Faith and Repentance: So was his Passion. <hi>Extra portas Civitatis,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the walls of the City, as not redounding to the particular benefit of City or People, but equally extended to all. In a common Inn, where commonly the greatest excess, the greatest ryot and disorder is observed; and therefore it shews the end of his coming, which was to satisfie for the sins of his people.</p>
            <p>And yet there was no room in the Inn (it should seem it was taken up,<note place="margin">Christ was born in a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> with a multitude of guests in this great concourse of people) and therefore she must be delivered in a Stable. See here a homely entertainment of the Majesty of God, and mans unthankfulness for his mercy! and thus it befals the heart of man, which being wholly possessed and swallowed up with our worldly thoughts, the lust of our eyes, the concupiscence of our flesh, cannot afford the least entertainment or harbor for the working of Gods Spirit. Born in a Stable? Here it was verified that the Ox and the Ass acknowledged their Lord and Master, while sinful man stood wilful and obstinate, neglecting his Maker. Born in a Stable? True it is, that from the first day of his birth, to the last minute of his Passion, <hi>the foxes had holes, the birds had their nests, but the Son of man had no place of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.</hi> Born in a Stable? Here is no preparation, no solemnity, as if we were to expect not a man, but the worm of men, and the outcast of the people. Alas dear Virgin, comfort thy self, thy Babe is thy Comforter, thy Comforter thy Saviour: <hi>for behold, from henceforth all generations shall call thee blessed.</hi> Alas sweet Babe, pardon our unkindness and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtesie

               </gap> wert born in a Stable, and laid in a Manger. And thus much for the Place now I come to the Time.</p>
            <p>It was in the sixth Age of the World: As man was created on the sixth<note place="margin">Christ was born in the sixt age.</note> day, so in the sixth Age God intended the renewing and redemption of man. We are not to demand, why sooner or later he took not our flesh? for this was in the free choice and election of God; onely this probable reason may be given, That as wise Physicians then labour to purge the disease, when it is grown to his height and ripeness; so God expected the time when Charity was grown cold, the Kings office decayed, the Priests duty neglected, the Synagogue divided into Sects and Schisms: and this is in some sort resembled by the barrenness of the earth, for he came in the winter season. And it is to be feared, lest our Sects and Divisions, our sins, our crying sins, will hasten his second Coming in Judgement. His coming was in <hi>Solstitio Brumali,</hi> when the days were at the short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and then began to increase. And hence is gathered, though a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, yet a witty observation of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that as <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, so Christ should increase; <hi>John Baptist</hi> born at Midsummer, when the dayes shorten, and Christ with the lengthning of days increasing in glory. See here an admirable Providence in every the least circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; Christ was born at midnight, as may appear by the Shepherds<note place="margin">Christ was born at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</note> watch, which argues the worlds universal darkness, and that his coming in the flesh was to cover and conceal sin, that in the day of Gods wrath he might take our iniquities upon himself, and impute his Righteousness to us: and therefore it was an approved and laudable custome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to keep their watchings the same night, and to offer up their prayers and thanksgivings, in memory of the hour of his Nativity. And so I come to such things as are <hi>Consequentia,</hi> such as followed his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</p>
            <p>I will not speak of the Angels song to the Shepherds, which was the<note place="margin">What followed the birth of Christ.</note> Calling of the Jews. I will not speak of the Stars appearing, which guided the Wise-men to the place of his birth, where they worshipped, and were the first-fruits of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> I will onely name one action, which is the Murther of Infants, the Martyrdome of Innocents. It should seem then that the birth of Christ was not a matter of small importance, or little moment in the eyes of Princes, that <hi>Herod</hi> should slay all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from two years old and under, for the assurance of his State and Kingdom. But here observe the Providence of God; <hi>Herod</hi> in revenge, and to satisfie his own ambition, attempted such an horrible cruelty: God permitted the action, 1. For the punishment of the Jews, who for not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97249:54"/>
place for our Saviours birth, they justly incurred his wrath and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, insomuch that their own eyes beheld the slaughter of their own<note place="margin">The martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Innocents.</note> babes, flesh of their flesh, and bones of their bones, late conceived in the womb, now committed to the grave, from the Cradle to the Coffin, late pampered in the bosom, novv putrifying in the dust. 2. That the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie might be fulfilled, <hi>In Rama was a voice heard, mourning, and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and great howling, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they were not,</hi> Jer. 31. 15. 3. For the manifesting of his own glory, that upon his entrance into the world, so many happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants should be ordained from all eternity to suffer Martyrdome for his Cause, the day of their death was much more happy to them, then was the day of their Nativity; and therefore we celebrate and keep solemn<note place="margin">The keeping of the feast, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the truth.</note> a certain Feast-day, in memory of those Innocents. 4. Since <hi>Moses</hi> was a type of Christ (for both of them were Law-givers) as the children of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were put to death at the birth of <hi>Moses;</hi> so the death of these infants might give testimony to a second, to a new Law-giver.</p>
            <p>Thus as King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did persecute <hi>Moses,</hi> so King <hi>Herod</hi> persecuted<note place="margin">A comparison between Christ and <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </note> Christ: <hi>Moses</hi> was laid in a Basket, Christ in a Manger. And as they thus agreed in the circumstances of their Nativity, so in the manner and course of their lives. <hi>Moses</hi> led the Israelites through the Red-sea; Christ led his people through Baptism, and so through his own blood: Both of them fasted forty days: <hi>Moses</hi> appointed Seventy Elders; Christ Seventy Disciples: <hi>Moses</hi> sent out Twelve Spies to discover the promised Land; Christ sent out Twelve Apostles into the world, to publish the Kingdom of Heaven: <hi>Moses</hi> wrought his Miracles by a Rod; Christ by his Cross: and therefore as <hi>Moses</hi> Rod was laid up in the Ark; so the Cross of Christ hath ever been most precious in the Church: <hi>Moses</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his people from the bondage of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and Christ delivered his from the thraldome and slavery of sin. Thus do the two Law-givers agree, whereby it appears, that <hi>Moses</hi> was but a type of Christ, and the Law only a preparation to the Gospel.</p>
            <p>But I will leave the <hi>Jews,</hi> and descend to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whose posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">Signs amongst the Gentiles for the coming of Christ.</note> we are: and I will take a view, what hapned amongst them upon the birth of our Saviour. Certain it is, that the Oracles then spake, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had brought forth a King, and immediately the Images which were wont to be worshipped in Churches, fell down, and were broken, which many referred to the greatness of <hi>Augustus,</hi> though truly it was compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to Christ. <hi>Eusebius</hi> reports, that at the same time there sprang out of the earth a River of Oyl, which argues that grace was now to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that he was now born, who <hi>was anointed with the oyle of gladness above his fellows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Orosius</hi> reports, that <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> then Emperor, commanded on the same day, that no man hereafter should call him Lord or Master; as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:97249:54"/>
if God had secretly inspired in his heart, that then was born the Lord of lords, the King of kings, Christ Jesus, God and Man: and therefore it was impiety and sacriledge for any vassal of his, during his presence, to accept the Title of Lord or Master. <hi>Suidas</hi> reports, that when <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus Caesar,</hi> having offered his Sacrifice, demanded of <hi>Apollo</hi> who should<note place="margin">The Oracles having first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged Christ, after became dumb.</note> reign after him, at first he stood mute; and after a second Sacrifice, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned this answer, <hi>Me puer Hebraeus, Divos Deus ipse gubernans, Cedere sede jubet, tristom<expan>

Whereupon <hi>Augustus</hi> returned, and built a stately and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Altar, with this Inscription, <hi>Ara primogeniti Dei,</hi> The Altar of the first begotten of God. One of the <hi>Sibyls</hi> at that time living in <hi>Rome,</hi> shewed <hi>Augustus</hi> a Circle near the Sun, wherein there sate a Virgin with a childe in her arms; and withall she told him, that now was born a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and mightier Prince then he. <hi>Templum Pacis,</hi> the Temple of Peace, whereunto was annexed this Prophesie, That it should so long continue, until a Virgin should conceive: at the birth of our Saviour suddenly it fell down; whereupon there was another Temple erected, <hi>Virgini pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> To the Virgin that doth or shall hereafter conceive. And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, some have observed, that at the same time when Christ took our nature to honour man, and make him equal with Angels, such as had abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed our nature, such as were tainted with the most foul, unclean, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal sin, all suddenly perished, and the execution of death overtook them unawares.</p>
            <p>My method hath been to confirm the Doctrine by Miracles: and as<note place="margin">The Miracles which ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e hapned in the Church.</note> the blessed Trinity is the highest and greatest Mystery of all others, so for Confirmation both of that and of the rest of the Mysteries, I did onely produce such Miracles as were done by Christ in the Gospel. Now seeing to that Mystery I have added the Incarnation, I will then here produce such Miracles as were done in the Church successively, for Confirmation of Christian Religion in general: for I should as soon believe, that Christ never instituted a Church, as that he should be wanting in the means to preserve that Church. You shall then observe, that no Church or State can subsist without government; therefore in the last of S. <hi>John,</hi> Christ appoints a governor in his Church: and the first thing that is done by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> was the choice and election of <hi>Matthias, Act.</hi> 1. in stead of <hi>Judas Iscariot,</hi> that so the number of the Apostles might be made up: and the last thing which he did a little before his death, was to appoint his own successor, as it appears in his second Epistle. The first great Miracle after Christs own Ascension, was the coming down of the Holy Ghost in fiery tongues; the effect of these tongues, that they spake all languages; the power and efficacy of these tongues, that in one Sermon he converted 3000, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97249:55"/>
But because men are most moved with things that are sensible, therefore<note place="margin">S. <hi>Peters</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> S. <hi>Peter</hi> cures one that is born lame, and then 5000 believe, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 4. And as it falls out in Military affairs, and in all governments, some must be made examples of Justice for the terror of others: so <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> were strucken to death with his bare word, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. And that it may appear that the powers of Hell could not oppose him, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> can testifie, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. And that it might appear how beneficial his power was to Mankinde, he healeth the sick at <hi>Lydda,</hi> and raiseth <hi>Tabitha</hi> from death at <hi>Joppa, Act.</hi> 9. And all this was done the first year after the Ascension of Christ. And how much he prevailed in <hi>Rome,</hi> may appear by a Heathen Author, <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Claudius.</hi> I shall not need to prosecute this any further, when it may appear by my Annals.</p>
            <p>It is the practise of the Church, that seeing S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Where Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture leaves the Church.</note> both in one day, and that they were the great and the chief Apostles, therefore the Church doth never separate them. See then the miraculous Conversion of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that there should be such a light, and a voice to be heard, and himself to be strucken blinde, while he was in his heat of persecuting the Christians, and that he should become such a Convert, which is a far greater Miracle, then that he raised up <hi>Eutychus</hi> from death, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. or his prediction of the shipwrack, or the casting away of the Viper, without any hurt to himself, which the very Heathen did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be wonderful. Thus the Acts of the Apostles, as they begin with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> so they end with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and they leave him at <hi>Rome,</hi> that both S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> together might suffer Martyrdome on the same day; and together with them the Church was there left, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking the <hi>Jews,</hi> came to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> and as all the Religion of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> had been formerly coyned at <hi>Rome,</hi> so no doubt but the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was a special means to propagate the Church. As the <hi>Jews</hi> had their Types and Figures, their Prophesies of Christ; so the <hi>Romans</hi> had their Moral Virtues, and their humane Learning in great measure, onely as a preparation to Christianity: And seldome are the <hi>Romans</hi> mentioned<note place="margin">A commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romans.</note> in Scripture, but with some commendation; insomuch that Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self would not come into the world, and descend of the <hi>Jews,</hi> untill the <hi>Jews</hi> first became subject to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and Christ himself travelled in the womb, onely to pay Tribute to <hi>Caesar;</hi> and in his Preaching he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched obedience to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and thereby setled that Empire, then newly erected. And <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Governor, did what he could to set Christ at liberty; and being inforced by the importunity of <hi>Jews</hi> to Crucifie him, yet he washed his hands in his own innocency, being thereunto forewarned by his wife (that so she might make some recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> the Tempting of <hi>Eve</hi>) the <hi>Romans</hi> did likewise revenge the death of Christ upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> destroying their Temple, scattering them, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97249:55"/>
making them no Nation. S. <hi>Paul</hi> likewise thought it an honor to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a <hi>Roman,</hi> and claimed the Priviledge, and did appeal unto <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar.</hi> And certainly the intercourse which the <hi>Romans</hi> had with other Nations, did serve as a great means to propagate Christianity: and I doubt not but in the Apostles time, it was here planted in this Island of <hi>Britany. Tertullian</hi> in the second Century, makes mention of it, though for any solemn Message for our Conversion, or for any general Profession, no publick notice might be taken thereof, that might be respited accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the occasion of State, and as it might stand with the Civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and peace.</p>
            <p>And here I made a History of the Church, and examined all the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<note place="margin">The dignity of the Church.</note> Miracles as they fell out; and if whole Scripture in effect be but the History of the Church, how God hath preserved it, what wonders he hath wrought in it, either in protecting his own people, or for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sin; Thus the Old Testament shews the manner of Creation, the first Ages of the world, Gods Judgements, Gods Mercies, the giving of the Law, the instituting of Sacrifices, their hopes and expectation of the Messias, together with Gods frequent Messages and Admonitions by Prophets. Thus the four Gospels of the New Testament describe the Life and History of Christ; the acts of the Apostles shew how the Church was planted and continued; the Epistles were written upon several occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; the Apocalypse is a Prophesie of the Church to the end of the world: And if Scripture hath such reference to the Church, and that the Penmen of Scripture were but particular members of the Church, surely the Church cannot be vilified or neglected without great offence to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or rather to God himself.</p>
            <p>And therefore in my judgement there is yet one great daily continual<note place="margin">The dignity of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> Miracle in the Church, which exceeds all, and serves most abundantly for the confirmation of Christian Catholick Religion; and it is this, To consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the Times and Ages of the world, and all the parts of the habitable world, and therein the several Religions professed, and compare them with Christian Catholick Religion, and they will all instantly vanish and come to nothing. God hath ever had the guiding, and a special providence in the protection of his Church; it hath ever been accompanied with all Moral Virtues, with paternal Civil government, with fruits and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of Peace, attended on with all humane Learning, with the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all Arts and Sciences; to consider how this Religion hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and been preserved in all Ages, visibly, successively, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Persecutions, and the cursed attempts of Gods adversaries. To consider these things, <hi>uno intuitu,</hi> not to insist in singulars and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but take all things together in general, and then they shall amount to as much as a Miracle, above Nature, in so much that a man may plainly say, <hi>Hic digitus Dei est,</hi> These things could not fall out in a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97249:56"/>
naturall course, but by Gods extraordinary Providence.</p>
            <p>Here I did consider what Religion was every where professed, through<note place="margin">All other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions vanity.</note> the whole world: I found when those Religions began their progress, and what Testimony they gave to Christianity, and what they borrowed from Jewes, or Christians; and this I did for the satisfaction of those which are learned; but for such as were simple &amp; ignorant, they cannot but hear of the Navigations of this age, how we have compassed the whole earth; and finde that a great part of the world is not yet inhabited; so the world in effect is but newly created, this morning, for it hath not yet once seen a revolution of the Heavens; nay, it hath not yet seen the sixt part of one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, for it hath not yet seen 6000 years; and take all the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, we know, and can point out their beginnings; the most Ancient Monument in the world, is not above three thousand yeers continuance; we have our Merchants, and Factors in all Nations, under the Sun; we have the Fruits, the Spices, the Druggs, the Silk, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of all Nations: it is easie then to hearken out what Religion is every where professed; alas, you shall finde them all barbarous, and not worth the naming, in respect of Christian Catholick Religion.</p>
            <p>I cannot insist in particulars, onely in generals for the distribution of<note place="margin">A distribution of times.</note> times, as Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> the first Evangelist divided the times by 14 ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations; so I do distinguish the time of the Gospell by three hundred yeers; and mark the degrees how Religion hath been setled, and since hath declined from the first integrity: after our blessed Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, Christ Jesus had laid the first foundation of his own Church in his death and passion; then for the raising of walls, and to finish the building, it was necessary, that there should be some conformity; that the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men &amp; labourers, in laying their Stones upon that head-corner-stone, should temper their Morter with their own bloud, As then in the Birth of Christ there were miracles, a vision of Angels, and a Star appearing in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, together with the Massacre of innocents, so in the Birth of his Church, there were miracles, his own resurrection, a vision of Angels, the coming down of the holy Ghost in a miraculous manner, the gift of Tongues, many miracles: so was there great effusion of bloud, for the<note place="margin">The first ages after Christ.</note> first 300 yeers past, in ten great persecutions, and Martyrdom it self, is a kinde of miracle, to see such courage and resolution accompanied with all morall virtues; and that man in the flesh, shall renounce the flesh, and<note place="margin">The age of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Martyrs.</note> scorning the world, and the pompe thereof, shall offer up himself as a sacrifice for the truth of his Religion, and the honour of God; and this to be done deliberately, advisedly; not out of rashness, or any strong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of melancholy; surely this can be no naturall act, for it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, and deny nature in her own denne; and therefore being a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall work, it can be no less then a miracle; and this age lasted to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the blessed Emperour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:97249:56"/>After the Martyrs, the next 300 yeers was the age of Confessors, and<note place="margin">The age of Confessors.</note> excellent Writers, men that for their sanctity, holiness, and great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing became lights in the Church; and by their mortified lives, by their preaching, and writtings, though their Letters were not written in bloud, yet did they serve to convert the Nations, and this age lasted to the six hundred yeer after Christ to the time of Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the great.</p>
            <p>After the Confessors, the next 300 yeers was the age of Virgins; here<note place="margin">The age of Monasteries.</note> were those brave magnificent foundations of Monasteries, the erection of Cathedrals, where God might be served like a God, with the greatest magnificence; and that fond expectation of a temporall <hi>Messias</hi> might in some sort, be verified by the great solemnity of Gods service; and in this age lived many famous Founders here in <hi>England,</hi> King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> King <hi>Osricus, Ulfrune,</hi> with others whom I doubt not but God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
            <p>In the next 300 yeers, was the flourishing time of Laicks, where the<note place="margin">The age of Laicks.</note> Kings were generally much given to devotion and piety, where so many great Princes took upon them Religious habits; and so many excelled in all virtue and piety, as here amongst us King <hi>Alfred, Edmund, Oswald, Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane, Edward</hi> the Confessor, my blessed Founder; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto you may adde the Christian valour of Princes, in recovering the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> where <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bullen</hi> was their chief Captain; and this age lasted to the end of the twelve hundred yeer after the Birth of Christ.</p>
            <p>In the next 300 yeers, began the School Learning to flourish, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>Peter Lumbart,</hi> and Saint <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> to be in request, together with all the rest of the Schoolmen: and thus much I will say in the behalf and honor of Schoole-Learning, that it is the very Touchstone of all truth; and it is impossible for any falshood to endure the tryall thereof; And hereunto we may adde some military orders, as Champians to fight in defence of the Church, and though military, yet were they Religious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; as that of Saint <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Windsor,</hi> where I had the honour to be a Chaplain, to that great Order, instituted by my blessed Founder, King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> and I have been a servant to that order near 40 yeers.</p>
            <p>God having thus laid a sure and strong foundation of his Church, that besides the operation of his Spirit, and his over-ruling providence, even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Reason, by demonstrative Proofes, might be sufficiently assured, and convinced in the truth of Religion. Now for a further tryall of our Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the beginning of the fifteenth hundred yeer after Christ, he exposeth his Church to a tryall, by the incounter of enemies, and first the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Learning, which indeed did sharpen the wits of men; yet for our sins, some out of perversness, and others out of shallowness of brain, not able to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom the depth and grounds of that Learning, they made all the Articles of our Faith disputable; and as in humane things there is variety of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97249:57"/>
so in Religion, if man be left to himself, there will be nothing but Sects, and Divisions. And here the carnall man hath found out two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to incourage him in his cursed attempts: first, he conceives that all the Laws of the Church, are like so many yokes imposed upon him to infringe his Christian liberty; thus he would fain be a lawless man, and wholly left to his own carnall will and profaneness. The second motive is, that whereas he sees stately and great Cathedrals erected; which as they were built with great charge, so they must be supported with great meanes; and here a sacrilegious eye is cast upon them, yet must there be some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Religion, as if these had proceeded from superstition; and that God needed not, nor required any such sumptuous charge in his service, that it was superfluous, and that a spirituall service of the inward man might suffice; and could we but look and search that inward man, it is not unlike but we should finde as much emptiness there, as outwardly we finde ruines: but this serves for the present, and so much I will say; let all the ages from the Creation of the world be examined, &amp; I am confident it will be found, that God was never so much provoked to right himself, and in his own quarrell to revenge himself, so much upon man, and to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his own honour, as in these times; And seeing he made the world of<note place="margin">God will go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the world.</note> nothing, onely with the word of his mouth, and that he daily supporteth this world, and preserves it from falling to nothing, it is he that will go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern this world; and may in an instant, with the blast of his mouth, bring all the endeavours and practises of men unto nothing, and this he may do in his own due time, when we think all is secure.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot sufficiently blame these times, and our unhappy<note place="margin">The contempt of the Church.</note> condition; it was the observation of <hi>Josephus</hi> the Jew, speaking of the worst sort of men, and wondring much that there should be such Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters amongst men, <hi>Sunt qui ex contemptu Religioni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> &amp; sacerdotum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam &amp; opinionem sapientiae &amp; Nobilitatis sibi aucupantur;</hi> alass! this is now grown to be the common condition of these times, a man for his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit sake, and that he might be reputed a wise States-man, doth general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scorn and contemn Churchmen; and therein he dishonours God, and makes his service contemptible; thus the devill hath long intended and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to blot out all Religion out of mans heart: but this he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do, for as long as man can look up to heaven, so long he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives hopes of Gods Mercy, and sees the skirts and bounds of an other world, and if man lookes down to the earth, he sees the place of his buriall, and the way of all flesh; and that he is in his passage, for every day he loseth a day of his age, and a great part of his life is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spent, and is dead unto him, he shall never see it return; and that which remaines, it is the worst part of his age, the dregges of his age, the longer he lives he shall be sure to have the more sorrow; and these very<note place="margin">The devills policie.</note> thoughts must needs work some Religion in man: now the Devill seeing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97249:57"/>
that he could not herein prevaile, to root all Religion out of mans heart, therefore he hath found out another stratagem, to reduce all Religion to some few acts or heads; and then to make those acts of Religion contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible; and so to bring Religion to nothing: and this I fear he hath effected.</p>
            <p>For whereas Religion is <hi>lex Christiana,</hi> a Law to govern our actions, he hath made it <hi>dogma Christianum,</hi> a theame to be disputed on, or a text to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>iscoursed on, as if the whole practise of Religion, did onely consist in the precept; and that men should be alwayes learning, which is an argument of their ignorance; and that they are not come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth: Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> (that wise Lord Chancellor) did foresee this, and therefore called it by the name of <hi>pelpeting,</hi> wherein men would take occasion to broach all their new and strange opinions, and wherein the State might likewise suffer, for somtimes it might serve for sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Preaching should not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude other acts of Religion.</note> what a lamentable thing it is to consider, how all the exercises of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are laid aside, as if Preaching alone would suffice, thus we have no Fasting, Mortification, Confession, Charity, Devotion, Sacrifice, or fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Sacraments, no Religious Orders, or Magnificency in Gods service, and in a word, whatsoever else may tend to the honour of God, and the furtherance of Piety; we know not the practise thereof. Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> was wont to say, that she had rather speak to God her self, then to heare an other speaking of God, she seldom heard Sermons, but onely in Lent, and then as it may be supposed, she heard them with the greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; there was a sufficient ground laid for the whole year after to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise; it were to be wished that preaching alone, might not swallow up all publick prayer, and all other acts of Religion.</p>
            <p>You will say likewise, that we have a strict observation of the Sabbath;<note place="margin">The keeping of the Sabbath.</note> I fear it is over strict, and not kept in the right way, for it ought to be kept, with hospitality, relief of the poor, and whatsoever doth tend to nourish love and society between man and man; and certainly after Gods service, to express our joyfulness, and to stir up a cheerfulness of minde, with honest recreations; for a man may be so tired, and dulled in Gods service, as that he may be unfit for his service, and sin more against God with his wandring thoughts, and his sleepy heavyness, then if he should be absent from Gods service; but under colour of this strict observation of the Sabbath, Chirurgians have been hindred from going to dress wounds, Physitians from visiting their patients, Midwifes from doing their duties, and poor infants cannot have a little new sweet milk on the Sundays; alas, they know not what belongs to the Sabbath: <hi>Mundus vult decipi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will here make bold to desire my Brethren the Church-men, that<note place="margin">None should preach without much study.</note> they would intend painful and profitable preaching, rather then frequent and tedious preaching; which I speak out of the great honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence which I bear to preaching, <hi>Multiloquium parit contemptum.</hi> Some there are, I fear, who spend their hours with vain repetitions,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97249:58"/>
while their Auditors in stead of taking things to heart, and working upon their affections, they labour and take pains on the Sabbath, with their short writing of Notes (while others wonder what they should write) but this gives them occasion to make their repetitions at home and that breeds them up perfect Preachers, so that now you have Preachers of all Trades and Professions; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>am sure some have preache i who can neither write nor reade, and their Sermons are plundred of all learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and elegancy, and they think themselve, such Preachers, that they are grown to have a very mean esteem of all humane learning, which certainly in the end must bring in Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>barism. Some men there are who take a very preposterous course, for they begin their Religion, and in effect their whole course and practise of Religion consists, in the last book of Scripture the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> for all their devotion is in pointing out Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and in pulling down <hi>Babylon:</hi> Thus they are destroyers. But take heed of the Apocalyptical Doctors I think I should have called<note place="margin">Take heed of Apocalyptical Doctors.</note> them <hi>Apocalyptians,</hi> for they are very like our <hi>Gyptians,</hi> who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes wandering up and down to tell Fortunes, and to cousen people: so in truth they are very great impostors, they have raised up so many Controversies in Religion, that now Religion it self is become a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie; and therefore I desire every Lay-man, especially such as have had good b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eeding and education, that seeing Church-men themselves are parties, therefore they as more indifferent, would be pleased to see with their own eye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, and to allot one hour in the day to study the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of Religion: for while men are wavering and doubtful in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, they take little thought of the Practise. But let them consider, that our time is but short, and here we are to lay up for Eternity. If we were but rightly perswaded of Religion, it were impossible that such actions should proceed from Christian men. God grant we may so live in this world, that we may not lose the end of our Creation.</p>
            <p>What a lamentable thing it is, to see all the great Cathedral Churches,<note place="margin">The pulling down of Churches.</note> and all the ancient Foundations which were erected for Gods glory, and the practise of our Piety, that they should serve as an occasion to our Sacriledge, and that our devotion should be to pull them down, and to convert the Revenue to profane uses, as if we did grudge and envy that God should be served, who notwithstanding created the whole world for man, and created the world especially for this end, that man might serve God: but we on the contrary, as if we did desire utterly to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Gods service, we pull down the Monuments and Reliques of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, erected by the Ancients our present Reformation consists in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molishing; and it is to be feared, lest we give such an example to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that none of them hereafter will erect Churches, and God grant they do not forget all devotion; and this not onely for the present, but for all times past, and future, from the beginning of the world to the end
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97249:58"/>
of the world, if it lay in our power we should make Gods service void, and of none effect.</p>
            <p>I cannot speak of these Times with patience, and therefore I will here<note place="margin">The Author ends abruptly.</note> end abruptly; onely this I will say, That when I began to speak of the blessed Trinity, I began with the beginning of S. <hi>Johns</hi> Gospel, and I ended with the end of S. <hi>Johns</hi> Gospel; and when I spoke of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I began with the beginning of S. <hi>Johns</hi> Epistles, and now I end with the end of S. <hi>Johns Apocalyps, Surely I come quickly, Amen, even so come Lord Jesus: the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, Amen.</hi> How long, how long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer thy Church to be thus afflicted?
