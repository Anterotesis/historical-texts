            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I am sorry I haue
no better Cates to prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
you with: but pardon I
pray you, for this which
I haue heere prouided,
was bred in Lent, and Lent (you know) is
said of <hi>leane,</hi> because it macerates &amp; makes
leane the bodye: if therefore this dish bee
leane and nothing answearable to your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
let it suffice twas bred in Lent:
neither had it anye time wherein it might
gather anye thinge vnto it selfe to make it
more fat and delightfull. His Epistle I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
any time these three yeares, but this
mine aunswer <hi>sine fuco loquar,</hi> though it be
<pb facs="tcp:6345:3"/>
not worthy to bee called the worke of
one well spent houre) I haue wrought
foorth out of the stolne houres of three
weekes: for although occasion hath been
offered euer since the Epistle hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
to answere it: yet held in suspence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the man and matter, whether I
should take it vpon mee or no: at last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
him easily answerable, I haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
it: therefore howsoeuer you see it
crept abroad Gentles, receiue it well in
worth: Your fauours happily might adde
strength vnto it, and stirre vp the faint cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
steps to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore liuely pace: it by hard
hap being denied of the progresse, keeping
at home hath growne somewhat greater.
To tell you what the man is, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this book, were but triuiall and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,
only this, you may call it <hi>The trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Thomas Nashe,</hi> wherein hee is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.
In trimming of which description,
though I haue founde out and fetcht from
the mint some few new vvordes to coulor
<pb facs="tcp:6345:3"/>
him, grant me pardon, I thinke them fitte
for him who is so limmed and coullored
vvith all nevv found villanie: for if they bee
etimoligisde, they no vvhit disagree from
his properties Slender labour hath suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to vveaue this thinne superficiall vaile
to couer his crimson Epistle, and shaddovv
it foorth vnto the vvorld. For as a garment
of too bright a color is too euil an obiect for
the eyes (as is the Sun) &amp; is nothing gazed
after, no not of those vvho neuer savv it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
yet nevve things are desired, because
tvvould proue pernicious to their eyes, but
once ore-clovvded and couered vvith a
lavvne vesture, through that it shines &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
a lesse hurting obiect, and dravvs
the peoples sight after it: so his Epistle in it
ovvne colour beeing too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esplendent and
hurtfull to the readers, is laid apart &amp; is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in request, for that tvvould proue as a
burning glasse vnto their eyes, but vestured
vvith this Caule &amp; rare-vvrought garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it
loseth part of it hurting vigour, &amp; therefore
is cald to be seene againe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6345:4"/>
Loathed tediousnes I also eschewed as no
lesse hurtfull than too bright an obiect: the
Booke which he dedicateth to me, is so te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
that had I read it through, it so loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
would haue vvrought more on mee
both vpvvard &amp; downvvard, then 3. drams
of pilles: his Epistle is not behinde hand, to
that I might say as said <hi>Diogenes</hi> to the men
of <hi>Minda,</hi> (vvhose gates vvere greater in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogicall
proportion then their Citie:) O
yee men of <hi>Minda,</hi> looke to your Citie, that
it flyes not out at your gates: So his booke
might well for the largenesse of the Epistle
haue flowne out at it, and surely I thinke
had his book any wings, that is, any queint
deuise flying abroad to please withall, it
would neuer haue staid till this time: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I thinke it prouidently done of him
(though out of doubt the foole had no such
drift) to make the gates so bigge, that when
vve haue passed through the gates, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all the Cittie to be sutable to the stateli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of them: but after we are entred, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:6345:4"/>
our selues meerely guld, and that all the
Cittie is not worth the gates, vvee may the
more readily finde the vvay out of the
Cittie againe, the gates beeing so great:
and this remedye I founde once vvhen
I tooke my iourney into his Cittie. But
to returne, If this bee not so vvell set foorth
as you could vvish it vvere, blame mee not:
for as the Moon being naked &amp; bare, is said
once to haue gone to her mother, and asked
of her a coat to cloath her: but she ansvve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
there could bee no coate made fit for
her, for her instabilitie, sometime she being
in the ful, and somtime in the vvane: so hee
being a man of so great reuolution, I could
not fit him, for if I had vndertaken to speak
of one of his properties, another came into
my mind, &amp; another follovved that, vvhich
bred confusion, making it too little for him:
therefore vvere it not too little, it might be
tvvold be fit, but hovvsoeuer, pardon (Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen)

            <head>The trimming of Thomas Nashe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, heere is a gentleman at the doore
would speake with you. Let him come
in. M. <hi>Nashe!</hi> welcome. What, you
would be trimd? &amp; I cannot denie you
that fauour. Come, sit downe, Ile trim
you my selfe. How now? what makes
you sit downe so tenderly? you crintch in your buttocks
like old father <hi>Pater patriae,</hi> he that was father to a whole
countrey of bastards. Dispatch, st, boy, set the water to
the fire: but sirra, hearke in your eare, first goe prouide
me my breakfast, that I goe not fasting about him; then
goe to the Apothecarie, and fetch mee some repressiue
<hi>Antidotum</hi> to put into the bason, to keep downe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous
vapors that arise from his infectious excreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts:
for (I tell you) I like not his countenance, I am afraid he
labours of the venereall murre.</p>
            <p>Muse not (gentle <hi>Thomas</hi>) that I come so roughly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
you with Sit downe, without anie Dedicatorie Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
which (I know) you expected; for that your Epistle
(in some wise) brought forth this small Worke: which
purposely I omitted, scorning Patronage against you.
For if (by an Epistle) I had made some Lord or Knight
my Patron, it would haue mennaged and giuen courage
to you, that (not sufficient of my selfe) I should get some
Protector to stand out with you. As in a Cocke-fight, if
the Cocke-master takes off his Cocke when they are
buckled together, it encourageth the other Cocke (dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="tcp:6345:6"/>
his aduersarie to flye to his Master for refuge): so
that hee crowes foorth the triumph before the victorie.
Therefore forsooth, if for orders sake (that of custome
might be made a necessarie law) you would haue an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,
I thought it best, respecting the subiect matter, as
neere as possibly I could to patterne it with the like Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron.
Then not knowing where to heare of some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant,<note place="margin">O elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</note>
polluted with all vices both of bodie &amp; minde:
and viewing ouer all the imprest images of men in the
memoriall cell of my braine, at last I espied your selfe
more liuely ingrauen than the rest, and as it were offring
your selfe to this purpose. Then presently I made choice
of you, that like an asse you might beare your burden, &amp;
patronize your owne scourge, as dooth the silly hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparrow,
that so long fostereth vp the cuckow in her
neast, till at length she bee deuoured of her: or the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that is destroyed of her owne whelpes. All <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

ioy soone ends) this crosse happened; That knowing it
to bee my duetie to gratulate my Patrone with the first
hereof,<note place="margin">Item for you.</note> but not knowing where to finde you, for that
you (the Worlds Citizen) are heere and there, you may
dine in this place, &amp; goe supperlesse to bed, if you know
where to haue your bed:<note place="margin">Wel put in</note> you maye bee in one prison to

souerraigne medicine, so if of my friendes I could not

by that thou art brought into contempt, thy talking
makes thee bee accounted as a purse that cannot bee

in that house is nothing worthie the taking away, so
out of thy mouth proceedeth nothing but noysome

together the stringes, and locke vp the doore of thy

manie who are accounted to haue good wits,
(to whom I haue oft giuen perticular occasion) would

therefore my wit is excellent. Therefore I wyll aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
thee.</p>
            <p>I would to God thou &amp; I were to dispute for the best

combate with the bace? Wise-men (though mooued)
will not worke reuenge on euerie obiect? and the more
stately oake, the more hardly set on fire? More plainly in
a similitude, the like reason is to bee gathered of the

would sting them if they should, and so for that small

thou art suffered to be quiet, and not wrote against, not
for that thou canst not bee aunswered, but that by aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering

            <p>Thus thou art quite put downe, thou art drawne drie:

my selfe (for fault of a better) will supplye that
roome, and determine of our Disputation. And herein
it shall not bee amisse, (the Question so requiring, and
you also requiring it in that place of your Epistle, where
you lay wit to my charge) first to tell what a good wit
is. And whereas thou burthenst me to say, that <hi>much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traor

how vniust were mens wits, not to affoord vs extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
descant of that, which giueth vs descant for euerye
thing?</p>
            <p>A good wit (therefore) is an affluent spirit, yeelding
inuention to praise or dispraise, or anie wayes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
(with iudgement) of euerie subiecte. Mistake
me not (I pray you) and think not that I thinke all those
to haue good wits, that will talke of euerie subiect, and

            <p>A good wit is it that maketh a man, and hee is not
a man, that hath not a good wit. The verie brutish and

she should haue had her head left out to breathe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

rate thee as a Dog that hath done a fault. And yet doo
not I know why I should blame Dogs? for <hi>Can,</hi> which
signifieth a Dog, is also a most trustie Seruant; for that
Dogs are faithfull Seruants, to whome their Masters in
the night time giue in charge all their treasure. They
are at commaund to waite vpon their Masters, whether
they bend their iourney, to fight for them against their
Enemies, and to spend their liues to defend them, and to
offend their aduersaries, as we read of King <hi>Cazament:</hi>

prison, and when he was dead, he remained howling by
the carcasse: to whom when one cast meate, he laid it to
the mouth of his dead master, to reuiue him againe: and
when his corpes was throwen into the riuer <hi>Tybris,</hi> the
dogge leapt after it, so that all the people wondered at
the loue of this faithfull creature. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rhus</hi> the King go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a iourney, came by a dogge which kept the bodie of
a dead man: which when hee saw, he comaunded the
bodie to be buried, and the dogge to bee brought home
with him: this done, a few dayes after came souldiours
before the King, among whom the dogge espyed them
which killd his master, and barked incessantly at them;
sometime looking and fawning on the King, and then
barked againe. At which signe the King astonished, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
them, and vpon light examinations they confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the murder, and tooke punishment for it. Further,
we read of a dogge called <hi>Capparus</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi> which in
the night pursude a theefe that robbed a Church, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
driuen backe with stones by the Theefe, followed
him aloofe off, but alwayes kept him in sight, and at last
came to him, and sat by him while he slept. The next
morne, so soone as euer the Sunnes golden crowne gan
to appeare, and his fierie steedes trapperd in their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons
set on their wonted race, the theefe fleeing, the
dogge stil kept his chase, and complaind in his language
to the passengers of the theefe. At last he was taken and
brought backe, before whom the dog came all the way
leaping and exulting for ioy, as to whome all the prayse
was due for this deed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:6345:23"/>
The <hi>Athenians</hi> decreed that for this publique good,
the dogge should be kept by publique charges, and the
care of his keeping was alwaies afterward layd vpon the
Priests. And I feare mee, and almost diuine so much,
that the verie dogges (wheresoeuer thou plaist least in

of himselfe and in himselfe; and in antique time they

no other beast but a dog rauened in the dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casse.</p>
            <p>Lastly, to come neerer to your selfe, you shall heare
of a dogge that was an excellent Actor. In <hi>Rome</hi> there
was a Stage-player, which set out a Historie of diuers
personages, among whom there was a dogge to be poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
and reuiue againe; a Part of no lesse difficultie
than the king or the clowne, and was as well perfourm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
for (at his time) he eate the poyson, and presently
(drunkard-like) stackered vp and downe, reeling back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and forward, bending his head to the ground, as
if it were too heauie for his bodie, as his Part was; and
at last fell downe, stretcht himselfe vpon the stage, and
lay for dead. Soone after, when his Cue was spoken,
first by little and little he began to mooue himselfe, and
then stretching forth his legs, as though he awaked from
a deepesleepe, and lifting vp his head, lookt about him:
then he arose, and came to him to whom his part was he
should come: which thing (besides the great pleasure)
mooued wonderfull admiration in olde <hi>Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These prettie tales of dogges might keepe mee from

            <p>First, the blacke choller which raigneth in them tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

and in Autumne: and you though you are mad all the

this last Autumne; they, alwaies run with their mouthes
open and their tongues hanging out, wee know howe
wide your mouth is, how long your tung; your mouth

borne. Woe to the teats of thy Dam that gaue thee suck,

            <p>Nowe let mee see thy punishment for thy Isle of

wee take a dogge that hath done a fault, presently to
