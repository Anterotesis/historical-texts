            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IVstice, no lesse then Obseruance, vrges me to inscribe this <hi>Historie of Tithes</hi> to your name. So great a part of it, was lent me by your most readie Courtesie and able Direction, that I restore it rather then giue it you. And it cannot but receiue an increase of estimation from your interest thus seen in it. For to haue borowd your help, or vsd that your inestimable Library (which liues in you) assures a curious Diligence in search after the inmost, least known and most vsefull parts of Historicall Truth both of Past and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Ages. For such is that Truth which your Humanitie liberally dispenses; and such is that which by conference is learned from you. such indeed, as if it were, by your example, more sought after; so much head-long Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, so many ridiculous impostures would not be thrust on the too credulous, by those which stumble on in the Rode, but neuer with any care looke on each side or behind them.
<pb facs="tcp:17576:3"/>
that is, those which keep their Vnderstandings alwaies in a weake Minoritie that euer wants the Autoritie and Admonition of a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. For, as on the one side, it cannot be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that the too studious Affectation of bare and sterile <hi>Antiquitie,</hi> which is nothing els but to be exceeding busie about nothing, may soon descend to a Dotage; so on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Neglect or only vulgar regard of the fruitfull and precious part of it, which giues necessarie light to the <hi>Present</hi> in matter of <hi>State, Law, Historie,</hi> and the <hi>vnderstanding of good Autors,</hi> is but preferring that kind of Ignorant Infancie, which our short life alone allows vs, before the many ages of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Experience and Obseruation, which may so accumulat yeers to vs as if we had liud euen from the beginning of Time. But you best know this; in whom that vsefull part is so fully eminent, that the most learned through <hi>Europe</hi> willingly acknowledge it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen hath your courtesie euer made the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious store of it to me, that I could not but thus offer you whatsoeuer is in This of mine own also, as a symbole of some thankfulnes. It was at first destind to you. And howeuer through the hastie fortune that (I know not why) it sufferd at the Presse, some pieces of it haue been disperst without the Honor that
<pb facs="tcp:17576:3"/>
your Name might adde to them; I shall be yet euer so ambitious of that Honor, that the whole shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer (for so much as I can preuent) be communicated without this prefixt testimonie of Dutie to you. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it fauourably, Noble Sir; and continue to me that Happinesse which I enioy in that you neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute me vnworthy of your Loue, nor permit me in Ignorance when I come to learne of you.</p>

And doubtlesse, the Priest had not a litle work to perswade them that what they should there meet with, was not an vnluckie <hi>Empusa,</hi> not a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable <hi>Mormo,</hi> not a wanton <hi>Cobalus,</hi> not a mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous <hi>Furie,</hi> not indeed any thing that their idle brains, being such meer strangers to the abstrusest parts of Truth, had fashiond out. The many fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that Malice, Ignorance, and Iealousie haue framd to themselues touching this of Mine, haue been no lesse ridiculous; and some equally fearefull, but equally false. And I must here first play the Priest also, and so cleer, if it were possible, those Fancies, by protesting that it is not writen <hi>to proue that Tithes are not due by the Law of God</hi>; not writen to proue <hi>that the Laitie may detaine them,</hi> not to proue <hi>that Lay hands may still enioy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations</hi>; in summe, not at all <hi>against the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Clergie.</hi> Neither is it any thing else but it self, that is, a meer Narration, and the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

of Tithes.</hi> Nor is the law of God, whence Tithes are commonly deriud, more disputed of in it, then the Diuine Law, whence all Creatures haue their continuing subsistence, is inquired after in <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi> historie of liuing Creatures, in <hi>Plinies</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall historie, or in <hi>Theophrastus</hi> his historie of Plants; or then the Iustice of the old Courts of <hi>Rome,</hi> is examind in <hi>Brodaeus</hi> his historie of them, or the conuenience of the Ciuill and Canon Laws in that of <hi>Riuallius.</hi> Nor was any thing, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Title, purposely omitted. Nor was any piece of it stolne from any other mans notes. That as the rest also hath been most maliciously imputed by some that so impudently dare conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture (though they be farre enough from being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—<hi>arte aut scientia Diuini</hi>) and as iudiciously censure it or me, as those in <hi>Lucian,</hi> could <hi>Euripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> that were weekly stark mad in Rime till Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by reason of what they had heard of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies in Summer, and could neither iudge at all of what they said nor yet possibly hold their peace. But they know there are neuer wanting long eares readie stretcht out to base detraction; and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimates them. I know not how otherwise to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm these protestations then by sending him, that beleeus me not here, to the view of the whole. He may be there further satisfied. and shall then see al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that it is not of the Pitch of the Doctrine of the Breuiarie, or within the compasse of Pocket-lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Nor will it, I think, looke like what were patcht vp out of <hi>Postils, Polyantheas,</hi> common

            <p>But wee leaue this preposterous Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Negatiues (yet by reason of the head-long importunitie of such as haue in great number al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie misconceiud it, they were necessarie and could not elswhere haue had so fit place) and shortly thus delineat what it is by the <hi>end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi>

            <p>For the first; we find that in the frequent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations about Tithes, not only Arguments out of holy Writ for proofe of a <hi>Diuine right</hi> to them, but matter also of <hi>Fact,</hi> that is, <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Storie,</hi> is very often vsed; as the <hi>kinds of paiment</hi> of them among the <hi>Ebrews,</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Maintenance of the Church</hi> in the Primitiue times, the <hi>Arbitrarie Consecrations, Appropriations</hi> and <hi>Infeodations</hi> of them in the midle times, the <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them at this day</hi> in the seuerall States of Christendom, together with the <hi>various Opinions</hi> and <hi>positiue Laws</hi> touching them. For, <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> as they are related only and fall vnder the Question of what and whence they were, are meerly of <hi>Fact.</hi> And proofs are hence often drawn to confirm sundrie occurrences in inquirie for the truth on either side. That of the <hi>Diuine right</hi> of them is so wholly a point of Diuinitie and handled so fully by diuers <hi>Schoolemen,</hi> so imperiously by most of the <hi>Canonists,</hi> and so confidently by some of our <hi>late Diuines,</hi> that what euer could be said touching that only, by inference out of the holy Text (which must be the sole triall of it) would but seem taken from some of them which haue so pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely disputed it. Neither were that so fit to be medled with by any as by a profest <hi>Diuine.</hi> But for that other part which falls vnder <hi>Historie,</hi> there is not one of them all which hauing boldnes enough

to aduenture on it (which he disputes withall of the <hi>diuine right</hi>) shews not also too much either Ignorance or Negligence in talking of it, being v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually deceiud and deceiuing in it those most of Readers that giue their Historicall faith captiue to bare Names and common reputation.

To argue therefore from affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Canons only to Practice, is equall in not a few things (and especially in this of Tithing) to the prouing of the Practice of a custom from some consonant Law of <hi>Plato's</hi> common wealth, of <hi>Lucians</hi> men in the Moon, or of <hi>Aristophanes</hi> his Citie of Cuckoes in the clouds.

By this time, I trust, you conceiue what the name of <hi>Historie</hi> in the Title pretends. and the <hi>Tithes</hi> spoken of purposely in it (for perhaps it is needfull to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish that also) are only such as either haue been paid, vowd, or dedicated to holy vses, or els giue light to the consideration of the performance or omission of such payment.

on Sundaies should be seuerally, and as deuided from the other Offerings, thought on to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

But he permits not that any mony or other profit, being not <hi>liuing gifts,</hi> as he calls them, is by the Law of God Titheable. so that where no such <hi>liuing gifts</hi> and increase are, there no Tithes (as Tithes) are paiable to them, as he concludes. Nor indeed is any mention of other Tithes in the <hi>Leuiticall</hi> Law, then of the increase of the earth in Fruit and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, that is of the gaine only out of those more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Trades (which <note n="l" place="margin">

In very dedde they must haue leuyngs to kepe them out of necessite. and thereby it is to se how in</hi> London <hi>they cannot receyue ther leuyngs of Godd by no liuely gifts of grace, like as in the Countrey. But in</hi> London <hi>they must receiue their leuings of mens gifts; that is money which is euery mans own, for their office doing. The</hi> Pope <hi>by his Law nor by his Bulls cannot compell no man te giffe his own gode to theym for their office doyng more then people will consent to giff theym. for</hi> Christ <hi>saith that their leuing is freely giuen them of Godd, if they do ther office to see all peple worke. Therefore that if the peple haue not labors and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, they ought to haue none nor can make no Law whereby to axe no mans goode.

For the old Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques that neuer would professe that they had found a Truth, shewd yet the best way to search for any, when they doubted aswell of what those of the Dogmaticall sects too credulously receiud for infallible Principles, as they did of the newst Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions. they were indeed questionlesse too nice, and deceiud themselues with the nimblenesse of their own Sophismes that permitted no kind of established Truth. But plainly, he that auoids their disputing Leuitie, yet, being able, takes to himselfe their Libertie of Inquirie, is in the only way that in all kinds of studies leads and lies open euen to the Sanctuarie of Truth, while others, that are seruile to common Opinion and vulgar suppositions, can rarely hope to be admitted neerer then into the base court of her Temple which too speciously of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten counterfaits her inmost Sanctuarie. and to this purpose also is that of <note n="*" place="margin">

that talks of Tithes without reference to such <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue Law,</hi> makes the obiect of his discourse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he would haue should be, then any thing that indeed is at all. For what State is in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom wherein Tithes are paid <hi>de facto,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then according to Human Law positiue? that is, as subiect to some Customes, to Statuts, to all ciuill disposition. If they bee in truth due <hi>Iure Diuino</hi> (which Diuines must determine of) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main equally so aswel after as before Human Laws made touching them. But that is a question dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly controuerted; and among the Clergie. Now, who euer disputes it and relyes only on <hi>Ius Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> or the holy Scripture for the right of Tithes, doth but make way for him whom hee cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade that they are due by the Law of God, to thinke that they are no way due.

And let <hi>Human Laws, Practice,</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> bee as their Autors will; yet whatsoeuer argument may be found in the law of God for the right of Tithes, remains still as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht and equally of his former power, as the heat and light of heauen euer did, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the vse of Fire had vpon earth.

deuotion in their Churches, an interest somewhat like to what more anciently the Bishop had in the offerings made at the Churches wherein hee only placed the Ministers.

of such Churches as they were Patrons of, and that the Bishop should bee wholly excluded. But it fell at length that, without much difficulty, the Church, what through Constitutions, what through Constitutions, what by their Doctrine, had remedy for this vsurpation vpon the Offrings solemnly consecrated to the Priests at the Altar.

Yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, another interest, that is, the interest of Patronage, and a right of disposition of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall endowments, which the Lay founders first challenged in their new erected Churches, which was a right of Collation or Inuestiture, whereby the Incumbent might receiue full possession with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ayd of Bishop or other Church-man, could not so easily be gotten from them, although some <note n="n" place="margin">

By reason of these Inuestitures (wherein the Glebe, Tithes, and all Endowments of the Church, as well as the Church it selfe, in point of interest or estate, passed from the Patron, and at euery vacancie were in him as in the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietarie of them) when Appropriations in these ancient times were made, it was not only the Church it selfe, or the <hi>Titulus Ecclesiae</hi> (for that also, once by consecration created, was giuen by lay Patrons, when the Clerk had already his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) or the patronage, that was directly in point of interest conueyed, but withall the Glebe and Tithe made parochiall by Grant, Foundation, or Custome. And the title of the Church, the Monasterie (according to the Patrons prouision in many Appropriations; and in others, at their pleasure) still gaue afterward by Presentation of a Clerk, whom the Bishop instituted.

Neither did any such thing follow vpon such Presentation as Disappropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, in regard of the Endowments or Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralties. for such was the nature of the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations, that the Church remaind notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing presentatiue. and the Incumbent, that came in by presentation, had the Church only

Neither was the Title of the Church, and the Endowments, so entire a thing, but that, according to the Patrons interest and will, they might by the Law then in practice be so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerd.

Which opinion also, it is no wonder, that those Bishops should be willing to preserue and continue, after Parishes were there diuided, and after Tithes came at length to be paid them. For long they preached, and much stirre was about it, before they could get a vsuall payment of them. Neither need you mistrust, that their right to Tithes, so cleerely

Where you see, hee diligently remembers also an Exemption giuen to it by that Bishop: which could hardly haue been, if the generall right of Tithes had not beene supposed in him. But out of these things you may probably collect, that by this time (that is diuers yeeres before the end of these CCCC. yeeres) in some of those Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Churches, Tenths were payd more iustly, according to the desire of the Clergie, then in other places; where you shal find arbitrarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations by Lay men, continuing till about MCC.. For if the Bishop had not had these Tithes payd, but had pretended only right in them, his bountie to the Monasterie had been to litle purpose. So in the Diocese of <hi>Olden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> about MCLX. payment was duely, it seems, made to the Bishop by all, sauing those which had improued the deserts of <hi>Wagria,</hi> which could by no means be brought to it. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimas ex more</hi>

The Abbot stood vpon the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation; the Bishop vpon his Episcopall right, which by the Canon Law is, and anciently was, the same with parochiall, in places not limited to any certain Parishes.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17576:75"/>
there to answer in the same Action; and verie soon after departed this life. Not many daies interceded, but the Bishop riding towards the Court where this Suit had depended, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch some proceedings touching it, suddainly fell from his Horse very sick; and being carried into his Inne, gaue most strict charge (as one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely moued) that the Abbey should haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and quiet possession of those Tithes for euer; and admonisht them all, that were by, That who euer had been parties with him in that oppression against the Abbey, should by the like Iudgement from Heauen, suffer as he did; confessing to the two Bishops of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> and <hi>Hildenesheim</hi> (then visiting him) that he was now called, according to the Abbots summons, to answere his exaction of the appropriated Tithes, before the Iudgement Seat of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie: and soon after, hee most miserably died; <hi>Vto</hi> his Arch-priest, who had been his great Instrument in the Suit, the same yeere sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly following him. But how euer either the vsuall practice, or this example wrought; a yeer or two after, this questioning of Tithes vpon E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall right (that is, vpon pretence that all Tithes of euery Diocese were due to the Bishop, as to the Rector of a great Parish; for such a right was most specially pretended by Bishops in <hi>Germanie,</hi> as is alreadie declared, and that both against Appropriations &amp; arbitrarie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations)
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17576:76"/>
bred most perillous disturbances of State, and of no small consequent in those parts. For in the yeere MLXII. when <hi>Otho</hi> succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his brother <hi>William</hi> in the Marquisat of <hi>Turingia, Sigifrid</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Mentz</hi> denied him the relieuing of his Fiefs held of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoprique, vnlesse hee would giue him all the Tenths of his Demesnes, and compell all the Tenants of his Marqusat to doe the like. This was exceedingly distasted by the <hi>Turingians,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that they openly profest, they would sooner lose their liues, <hi>quàm patrum suorum legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima amittere</hi>; that is, then part with their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestrell right of detaining, or disposition of Tithes, according to their vse, either of Infeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations or Appropriations. so you must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie vnderstand it; and other passages in the Author (<hi>Lambert</hi> of <hi>Schaffnaburg,</hi> then liuing, who relates it) make that sense of it plaine. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was this <hi>Otho,</hi> for as much as in him lay, wanting to the Archbishops request. But in the yeere MLXVII. vpon his death, hee left ioy enough to his countrey men, in regard of that his yeelding about the Tenths, which none of his ancestors had giuen example of. but in him it was the chiefe Seminarie, as the Monke sayes, of the many calamities suffered in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Warre of that time. Great disputation of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists followed some six yeeres after, in a Councell held, about this Episcopall right, in

And whereas they commonly suppose, that all these ancient feudall Tithes were at first spirituall, and transferred from Church-men (at the request of Princes) into Lay hands, and since wrongfully detained; surely it is an error. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any ancient warrant sufficient for it: many of them were doubtlesse created by Lay mens Grants, as Rents-charge, Estouers, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baries, and the like are. Who can doubt of it,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17576:78"/>
that obserues but alone this Canon <hi>Prohibemus?</hi> Whence also may be strongly inferd, that the greater number of Infeudations were through Grants made by Lay men to Lay men, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations were, at their pleasure, made to Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. for what is there only forbidden by the Councell, may be thought the greatest and most preiudiciall practice of the time against the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Clergie. Neither is any prouision there made against the other kind of Infeudati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which passe Tithes from Church-men. And although the words <hi>&amp; Ecclesiae non reddiderit,</hi> in the Canon (and in the bodie of the same Councell, in <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Houeden</hi>) seeme to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as if it had been made for such Tithes as had been taken from the Church; yet indeed, the truer reading is <hi>tradiderit,</hi> as appears in the bodie of that Councell first fully publisht out of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> in the last Tome of the Generall Councells printed at <hi>Rome</hi> by command of the present Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fift; wherewith agrees o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Editions, but of lesse authoritie. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps also some old Infeodations were made by Lay Patrons in the vacancie of their Churches, by the same challenged right as they alone made Appropriations. For, as by our common Law, the Patron and the Bishop may in the time of vacancie dispose of the Endowments (as by the Canon Law also, if the Chapters consent, or the Popes, be had;) so in those elder times, vpon
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17576:79"/>
equall reason, when the Patron had the only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and interest of the Church (as is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die shewd) he alone sometimes granted any part, at his choise, it seems, to Lay or Clergie men.

So that the chiefest difference twixt the Laitie and Clergie herein came to be, who should dispose or conuey the Tenths (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they varied also about Inuestitures) not what persons (sauing in the vse of Infeoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) might haue a perpetuall right in them. and in that difference the Clergie yeelded so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in receiuing, allowing and confirming arbitrarie conueyances (as is before shewd) of Tithes, no otherwise then as of Houses or Glebe, to Monks, Nunnes, or Churches farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant; that if they held them due to the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and Parochiall Minister (were he Bishop or other) by the <hi>Diuine morall Law,</hi> they did in this no lesse then commit against their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and exercise a kind of continuall and fearfull sacrilege. And indeed it appears that it was expresly held against the <hi>Diuine Law,</hi> to conuey Tithes to any other Church then where the owner vsed most commonly to receiue his soules food. For the Clergie in a Petition to the Emperor <hi>Lewes</hi> the second, in the Councell of <hi>Pauia</hi> in DCCC.LV. confidently affirmed that it was generally taken, that such a conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to another Church <hi>pro libitu</hi> was aswell <hi>diuinae</hi>

Neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was the Churches right (what euer it were) to her Tithes properly diminished by such Grants. for if, at this day, the owner
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17576:85"/>
grant the tenth sheaf of lands titheable, to a Lay man, may not the Grant be good, as a Charge out of the land? and yet the Church there hath her right as before. But the truth, it seems, was, that in those elder times, Lay men that had created a Tenth into Lay hands, rarely, or not at all, paid any to the Church; and those Infeodations, once made, gaue them greater pretence, of with-holding what the Church demanded: as if it had been enough to say, they must not, could not, pay two Tenths out of their land; and that if a Tenth were once created to any man, nothing els might be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vnder the like name. The same may bee thought on in Consecrations to Monasteries. For if Tithes had been held generally due and paid parochially (as now) then cleerly, although a Lay man had granted a Tenth to another Church or Monasterie, what other soeuer had been due parochially, had, <note n="l" place="margin">Vide, si placet, 44. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>sol.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 44. <hi>Assis. pl.</hi> 25.</note> notwithstanding the Grant, still remaind payable to the Parson.

They may, as they will, vnderstand it by iudiciall application. but you may, at least, doubt still, that the Historicall vnderstanding of it, is to be had out of arbitrarie Consecrations before practiced. And it was euen equall to ordaine, that Lay men should not arbitrarily consecrate, and that they should not consecrate without assent of the Bishop; euery Bishop (I think) being supposed a carefull obseruer of the former Canons, which would haue induced pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall right to Tithes, and generall payment. So that what in this kind might not be done without his assent, was conceiud as likely to be neuer done to the Churches preiudice.

                     <hi>Couuaruuias</hi>; so, some others. But few enough are of this opinion. All that are of it, make no doubt of the right of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes (prouided alwayes, that a sufficient reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue be possessed by the Minister) but allow the payment of them to be diminished or taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by Custome or Prescription. But they are generally against the possession of <hi>Feudall Tithes</hi> held by Lay men (which they suppose, but false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to haue all had beginning from the Church) although Infeodated before the Councell of <hi>Lateran.</hi> Yet indeed some of them expresse an allowance of them; but that is rather in ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17576:98"/>
common Laws with their Canons, then wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as Canonists. The common Laws of all Nations (where feudall Tithes are; and I thinke certainly, in all Christian Nations feudall Tithes at this day are found) allow them now, and suffer the Canons to haue no power ouer them. And thence is it (lest they should grossely determine against such possessions as the Church anciently, as well as the Laitie, had by Infeodations setled, and Posteritie still maintaind) that some receiue into their Conclusions an admittance of what their own profession abhorres. Which may not be amisse said also of such of them as maintaine a Custome in the <hi>quota,</hi> or the like. For that is done rather by striuing to conforme the Canons to the common Laws, or secular Constitutions of the State where they liue (as our Ciuilians, in the practice of the ancient Canon Law, do here also) then by iudging according to the bodie of the Canons, that regularly allow no sufficient exception against parochiall payment of the whole prediall Tenth, but only Papall autoritie, or a Title canonically setled in some other Church. And the better to make these Infeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations stand with their opinions, they haue also a vsuall distinction of <hi>Ius percipiendi,</hi> and <hi>fructus Decimarum.</hi> The <hi>Ius percipiendi,</hi> they say, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be transferd, nor euer was, by the old Infeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, because euery lay man is incapable of it. but the <hi>fructus Decimarum</hi> only, as they teach, is
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17576:99"/>
what passed, and is still possessed, in considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the possessors should defend the Church from Heretiques and Tyrannie. The summe of what the old Canons haue, both against ancient and new Infeodations, is in the former Chapter noted; and according to them, how that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will hold, I see not. But, among them, great opinion is also, that all Feudall Tithes are to be restored to the Church, and that he which holds them, may not lawfully passe them ouer to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lay man; but may only, with assent of the Bishop, giue them to some Church. <hi>Nec multum refert quae Ecclesia habeat dummodo extirpentur à Laico,</hi> as <hi>Panormitan</hi> sayes. And to this, they abuse that Canon <hi>Prohibemus,</hi> of the Councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> that was not indeed made against Tithes then infeodated, but only against new Infeodations, as Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth there well teaches.

Morall Law, the Euangelicall Priesthood haue a right to Tithes, as to their Inheritance, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall degree, as the Lay man hath to his Nine; or if they haue them only as by human Positiue Law, and so giuen them for their spiritual labor? that is, in brief, Whether by originall distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Iustice, or by commutatiue, they are paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? although, in the Opinion which wee shall here make the third, all Positiue or human Law be, for the most part, neglected; whereof, more presently. But in that (which we here make the first of those three Opinions) it hath been held, that the Tenth considered <hi>quoad quotam partem,</hi> or, as it is, a determined part, and denoted from that number, is due only by Law Positiue and Ecclesiasticall; but, <hi>quoad substantiam suam,</hi> or <hi>Cleri sustentationem,</hi> or in regard to it, as it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes a necessary or competent part of the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Clergie, that is due by the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Morall Law.</hi> And to the purpose of this distinction, they interpret the Leuiticall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Tithes; and deliuer that <hi>quoad substantiam suam,</hi> or as it was generally for the maintenance of the Minsterie in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, it is <hi>Morall</hi> or <hi>Naturall,</hi> there being (according to consideration of it so farre) the very Character of it writen in the Tables of mens hearts; that is, that Spirituall Laborers are to be rewarded with temporall bountie, as euery laborer is worthie of his hire.

quotam partem,</hi> it is, they say, a Iudiciall (or Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall, as some will) and that it hath been brought into the Law of the Gospell by Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastique Doctrine &amp; Constitutions (both which we haue before related) proceeding from it only <hi>per vim eius exemplarem,</hi> or by imitation of the <hi>Iewish</hi> state, ordered by the Almightie; and not in that regard <hi>per vim obligatiuam,</hi> or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing force of it vnder the Gospell.

For <hi>quoad substantiam Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi> or <hi>Decimam sustentationis,</hi> as they call it, or, as the laborer is worthie of his hire, both are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually due.

In summe, by this opinion, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of payment of lesse, of nothing, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ciuill Titles, that haue force against Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastique Law Positiue, are allowd, so long as the maintenance of the Minister be otherwise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent. Both failing, then is that defect to be supplied (notwithstanding any Ciuill excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) due by the Diuine, Naturall, or Morall Law; which, inscribd in all hearts, admonishes, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is due to euery laborer; much more to him of the Spirituall Haruest. Other questions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Tithes are disputed in the Schoolmen. but it is not hard to coniecture, how the most are to be determined (according to them) by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of this alone; therefore I omit them.

                  <p>The second Opinion in Diuinitie, is of those, that (hauing their first ground out of the determination of the Schoolemen) held Tithes to be <hi>meere Almes,</hi> and not to be paid to the Ministers of the Gospel by any Parochiall right, as a necessarie dutie to the Euangelicall Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but that they might be retained and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of at the owners will; especially if the Pastor <note n="y" place="margin">See <hi>Wicleues complunt to the K. and Parliament artic.</hi> 3.</note> well performed not his function.

The <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans</hi> especially (who began both about the yeer M.CC.X. and had in their Monasteries store enough of Schoolmen) made it a gainfull Doctrine to teach Lay men, that they were not bound to pay their Tithes to their Ministers, as to whom, by any Law of God, that portion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily belonged. For when the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had preceded, by which the <hi>quota</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, not to be due <hi>Iure diuino,</hi> they of this side neglecting (for the most part) the positiue and human Laws made for them, and regarding only the expresse Law of God, taught them due only as Almes, or as what <hi>debito charitatis,</hi> not <hi>debito iustitiae,</hi> was to be dispensed.

in the <hi>Leuitical</hi> commandements of Tithes for their most sufficient autoritie.

               <p>MOst of the <hi>English Laws, Constitutions,</hi> and <hi>Bills in Parliament,</hi> that are reserud to this place and here collected, were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally writen in <hi>Saxon, Latin,</hi> or <hi>French.</hi> and the <hi>Saxon,</hi> for the most part, were anciently (but it seems since the <hi>Norman</hi> conquest) turnd into a barbarous latin that yet better shews their meaning then a purer.

vnderstanding it. But in regard the old <hi>Saxon</hi> is known at all to few, and that hardly any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter interpretation of the Laws writen in that language can be then the old barbarous Latin, I haue ioined alwaies (where it might be) both the <hi>Saxon</hi> and the <hi>Translation.</hi> To haue left out the originall, had preuented some freedom of the Readers iudgement, and tied it to the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators. to haue added no translation, had been as a purpose to haue troubled euen the fittest Readers with a strange tongue; which also to haue otherwise interpreted, had been but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie them the help of those Ancients (that had better means to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> know the interpretation of those Laws) and so make them looke only as through spectacles of mine new made.

For if <hi>Parochiae</hi> be here meant only for such as were assigned Limits for those which were sent arbitrarily from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, out of the number of his Chaplains, or his <hi>Clerus,</hi> residing for the most part, in those elder times, with him at his Bishoprique; then cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Honorius</hi> was not the first that made diuision of them. Such kind of <hi>Parochiae</hi> are euen neere as ancient as Bishopriques; and questionlesse, in <hi>Augustines</hi> time. how could otherwise, Gods Seruice be orderly had in the Infancie of the Church? And when euer seuerall Churches for Christian Seruice, or other places for holy As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, began, then began such <hi>Parochiae.</hi> And that Churches were built here before <hi>Honorius</hi> his time, is before manifested.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:17576:149"/>
receiud from the Parishioners (due only to the Minister of that Church) as of the Incumbents function and residence; how will that stand with the communitie of Ecclesiastique profits, and the Bishops and his Clergies liuing together, that may be without much difficultie discouered out of <hi>Bede,</hi> to haue continued after <hi>Honorius</hi> also?

And the truth is, that it may be said properly enough, that <hi>Honorius</hi> was the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:17576:150"/>
first vnder whom his Prouince was diuided into such <hi>Parochiae,</hi> or Bishopriques. that is, No other Bishopriques (except <hi>Canterburie, London,</hi> and <hi>Rochester</hi>) were in his Prouince vntill his time; those three being almost of one antiquitie. But vnder him, <hi>Byrinus</hi> was made first Bishop of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> and had his See or Bisceop setle (as they calld it) at <hi>Dorchester,</hi> and <hi>Foelix</hi> the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gugnone</hi> was likewise ordaind first Bishop of the <hi>East-Angles</hi> at <hi>Dunwich.</hi> Which two Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in regard the like had not been in this Prouince of <hi>Canterburie</hi> from <hi>Augustines</hi> time till this <hi>Honorius,</hi> were perhaps the cause why it might be related, that <hi>Honorius primus Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam suam in Parochias diuisit.</hi> Which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were to be conceiud of such Parishes as at this day wee call by that name, yet could not extend to all his Prouince. For not till long after his time, was Christianitie receiud in the Kingdome of <hi>Sussex,</hi> which was first conuerted by <hi>Wilfrid,</hi> first Bishop of <hi>Selsey,</hi> in the yeere D.C.LXXIX. Hitherto then, for aught can out of ancient Moniments be proued, no Limits Parochiall, in regard of the profits to be receiud from the Parishioners, and spent by this or that Minister only, were assigned. But the ancient course of a kind of communitie of all profits of the Diocese, with the Bishop and his Clergie, remaind still in vse. Neither was the interest of many Churches, it seems, as yet here in any Lay-founders.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:17576:150"/>
But the Bishops, as I thinke, had both the interest and gouernance of the Churches built by the King, and tooke care for building new in their owne endowments, and hallowing old ones, that had been either prophaned since Christian Seruice vsed in them among the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> or formerly consecrated only to Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme. So may you vnderstand that of <hi>Byrinus,</hi> first Bishop of <hi>Dorchester.

                  <p>But afterward, when deuotion grew fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and most Lay men, of faire estate, desired the Countrey-residence of some Chaplains, that might be alwaies readie for Christian instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among them, their Families, and adioyning Tenants; Oratories and Churches began to be built by them also: and being hallowed by the Bishops, were endowed with peculiar mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from the Founders, for the Incumbents that should there only reside.

Neither was it won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Bishops should giue way to such restraint. for had they denied that to Lay foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they had giuen no small cause also of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining their deuotion. Euery man, question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, would haue been the vnwillinger to haue specially endowd the Church, founded for the holy vse chiefely of him, his Familie, and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, if withall he might not haue had the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to haue giuen his Incumbent, there resident, a speciall and seuerall maintenance; which could not haue been, had the former communitie of the Clergies reuenue still remained. Out of these Lay foundations chiefely, doubtlesse came those kind of Parishes, which at this day are in euery Diocese. their differences in quantitie being ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally out of the difference of the seuerall Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits of the Demesnes or Territories possessed by the Founders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And after such time as vpon Lay foundations, Churches had their profits so limited to their Incumbents, no doubt can be, but that the Bishops, in their Prebends, or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowsons of Parishes, both in Cities and in the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:17576:151"/>
Countrey, formerly limited only in regard of the Ministers Function, restraind also the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of euery of their seuerall Churches, to the Incumbents; that so a vniformitie might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in that innouation of Parochiall right.

But, in that of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars</hi> ealden Minstre, it is plain that although Minstre specially denote a Monasterie, yet all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parish Mother Churches are vnderstood by it. and indeed dyric and Minstre are frequent, as Synonomies in the <hi>Saxon</hi> moniments. But as the first part of his Law that giues all Tithes to the Mother Church of euery Parish, meant in them a Parochiall right to Incumbents, so also the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part, that permits a third portion of the Founders Tithes to be setled in a Church new built, wherto the right of Sepulture is annexed, makes a dispensation for a Parishioner that would build such a Church in his Bocland or land

possessed <hi>optimo iure,</hi> or as inheritance deriued from a Charter of feoffment.

                  <p>For the practice of payment among Christians, both <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi>; might wee beleeue the common tale of that <hi>Augustine,</hi> the first Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> Prouince, his comming to <hi>Cometon</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire,</hi> and doing a most strange miracle there, touching the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of the Doctrine of due payment of Tithes, wee should haue as certain and expresse
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:17576:157"/>
autoritie for the ancient practice of such pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as any other Church in Christendome can produce. But as the tale is, you shall haue it, and then censure it. About the yeer (they say) DC. <hi>Augustine</hi> comming to preach at <hi>Cometon,</hi> the Priest of the place makes complaint to him, that the Lord of the Mannor hauing been often admonished by him, would yet pay him no Tithes. <hi>Augustine</hi> questioning the Lord about that default in deuotion; hee stoutly answered, That the tenth Sheaf doubtlesse was his that had interest in the nine, and therefore would pay none. Presently <hi>Augustine</hi> denounces him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, and turning to the Altar to say Masse, publiquely forbad, that any excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat person should be present at it, when sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a dead Corps, that had been buried at the Church doore, arose (pardon me for relating it) and departed out of the limits of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, standing still without, while the Masse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. Which ended, <hi>Augustine</hi> comes to this liuing-dead, and charges him in the name of the Lord God to declare who hee was. Hee tells him, that in the time of the <hi>British</hi> State he was <hi>huius villae Patronus,</hi> and although he had been often vrged by the Doctrine of the Priest to pay his Tithes, yet he neuer could be brought to it; for which he died, he sayes, excommunicat, and was carried to Hell. <hi>Augustine</hi> desired to know where the Priest that excommunicated him, was
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:17576:158"/>
buried. this dead shewed him the place; where hee makes an inuocation of the dead Priest, and bids him arise also, because they wanted his help. The Priest rises. <hi>Augustine</hi> askes him, if he knew that other that was risen. he tells him, yes; but wishes he had neuer known him. for (saith hee) he was in all things euer aduerse to the Church, a detainer of his Tithes, and a great sinner to his death, and therefore I excommunicated him. But <hi>Augustine</hi> publiquely declares, that it was fit mercie should be vsed towards him, and that he had sufferd long in Hell for his offence (you must suppose, I thinke, the Autor meant Purgatorie) wherefore hee giues him absolution, and sends him to his graue, where hee fell againe into dust and ashes. Hee gone, the Priest new risen, tells, that his Corps had lien there aboue C.LXX. yeers; and <hi>Augustine</hi> would gladly haue had him continue vpon earth againe, for instruction of Soules, but could not thereto entreat him. So he also returns to his former lodging. The Lord of the Town standing by all this while, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, was now demanded if hee would pay his Tithes; but he presently fell down at <hi>Augustines</hi> feet, weeping and confessing his offence; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing pardon, became all his life time a follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Augustines.</hi> Had this Legend truth in it, who could doubt, but that payment of Tithes was in practice in the Infancie of the <hi>British</hi> Church? The Priest that rose here from the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:17576:158"/>
dead, liud (if he euer liud) about CCC.XXX. after Christ, and would not surely haue so taxed the Lord of this Mannor only, if the payment had not been vsually among other good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans here, not taught only, but performed also. Neither need I admonish much of the autoritie of it. the whole course of it directs you how to smell out the originall. Beside the common Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend of our Saints, it is in some Volumes put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, for a most obseruable Moniment. and I found it bound vp at the end of the Ms. life of <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> writen by <hi>Iohn de Grandisono.</hi> and it remains in the publique Librarie of <hi>Oxford.</hi> There also you haue it related in <hi>Ioannes Anglicus</hi>

But, to leaue such testimonie, no doubt can be, but that some practice of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was here vsed very anciently, which (beside the deuotion to be supposed in Christians, and the Doctrine of ancient Fathers, which, verie likely, wrought here as in other Western Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) might be collected, by good probabilitie,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:17576:159"/>
out of those Laws alone of the <hi>Saxon</hi> times which questionlesse were not without some ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, being so often renewd.

But what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer may be out of these testimonies concluded, it is noted among the Laws attributed to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Confessor, that what through the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of deuotion, what through the neglect of demanding Tithes by the Clergie, that were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:17576:160"/>
grown very rich in reall endowments, the practice of paiment of them was much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished. <hi>Sed postea instinctu diaboli</hi> (are the words which follow immediatly what is before in the Chapter of Laws §. XIII.) <q>
                        <hi>multi Decimam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuerunt, &amp; Sacerdotes locupletes negligentes non curabant inire laborem ad per quirendas eas, eo quod sufficienter habebant suae necessaria vitae.

                     </q> but we are not sure that this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Law is as ancient as the Confessor. I think it indeed rather of somewhat later time. yet doubtlesse the generall practice of paiment according to those ancient Laws, howeuer it might be in elder times, was about the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest, much discontinued, which may be specially obserued out of that book of <hi>Domes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> (the originall Copie whereof yet remains in the Receipt of the Exchequer) in which the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions and Reuenues both of the Clergie and Laitie were accounted and valued, by the othes of Enquests taken in euery Countie vpon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and so returned thither about the end of the Conquerors raign. There, frequently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, Churches are mentioned by the words of <hi>Ibi Ecclesia &amp; Presbyter,</hi> or such like; and how many Carues or Hides of land, how many villans, and other endowments and reuenues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them, are reckond, with their values.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17576:161"/>
But very rarely any Tithes among those Church reuenues are there found. if none at all had been namd, it might haue been thought that they had been omitted as a more sacred profit, then was fit to be taxed in such a Description. But some, although very few, occurre in it. as vnder <hi>Terra Osberni Episcopi</hi> in <hi>Boseham</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> you may there find that <hi>Decimam Ecclesiae Clerici tenent, &amp; valet</hi> XL<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. where the lest value of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is made at XL<hi rend="sup">li</hi>. <hi>per annum.</hi> in <hi>Hampshire</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Terra Osberni Episcopi,</hi> you read <hi>Ecclesia S.

Parochiall right, in the practice of those times, which hath to this day continued. neither is it at all necessarie to adde more for the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme continuance of it.

Which yet must be so vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in the case of Lay men, that Custome or Prescription founded in their possessions as Lay, cannot wholly discharge the Tithe, or be <hi>de non Decimando,</hi> but may well be <hi>de modo</hi> only; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is it in the case of spiritual persons, that may by the common Law be by Prescription wholly, discharged and prescribe <hi>de non Decimando.</hi> And this is regularly cleer Law. But at what time this Parochiall and common right became first setled with vs in practice, is not so cleerly known. and though those Decretals, before cited, suppose it a thing of custom here in <hi>Henry</hi> the II. his time, yet if credit might be giuen to the report of those <hi>English</hi> Monks, which (as wee haue before related) referd the ordaining of Parochiall right in Tithes to the Generall Councell of <hi>Lions,</hi> held vnder <hi>Gregorie</hi> the tenth, then wee might conclude the right of it no ancienter then about the beginning of our <hi>Edward</hi> the first. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:17576:165"/>
they meant, it is certaine, that some, both Synodall and secular Lawes of this Kingdome, had, before that time, ordained this right. Yet indeed it will be found, that the Practice of it here (as also in other Countries) was not setled till some M.CC. yeers after Christ, or, at lest, was, for many yeers before, &amp; some after, discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. Which may partly be collected out of that Decretall of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, sent into this Kingdome, and dated in the <hi>Lateran</hi>; which is before at large in the Chapter of Laws, §. XXIII. For howeuer the recitals are in those of <hi>Alexander</hi> the third (the one speaking of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralis institutio</hi> for Parochiall payment, which, as it may denote common custome, so also may be vnderstood for some Law of the Kingdome, as that of <hi>Edgars, Knouts,</hi> the Confessors, or some other before related; the other, of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueuerint Ecclesijs quibus debentur,</hi> which doth not of necessitie include a generall practice of Parochiall payment, but may as well denote the dutie that comes from arbitrarie Consecrations; of which, in the next Chapter) it is most certain, that before about the yeer M.CC. after Christ, that is, about the time of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> it was most commonly practised by the Laitie, to make arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie Consecrations of the Tithes of their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions to what Monasterie or Church they would, sometimes giuing halfe, sometimes a third part, and at their pleasure all, in perpetuall
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:17576:166"/>
right, or otherwise, according to the nature of those Consecrations in other Countries; of which, enough is before related. Neither doth expresse testimonie hereof want in that Decretall of <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, made against these kind of arbitrarie Consecrations. <hi>Multi</hi> (saith hee) <hi>in Diocesi tua</hi> (that is the Prouince of <hi>Canterburie) Decimas suas pro sua distribuunt voluntate.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may you vnderstand it, as if it had bin done by the waiward opposition of some only against the receiud and allowd Laws of the Kingdome. For notwithstanding all those Ordinances, both Secular and Synodall, anciently here made for due payment, it is cleer, that in the time before about that <hi>Innocent,</hi> it was not only vsuall, in fact, for Lay men to conuey the right of their Tithes, as Rents-charge, or the like, to what Church or Monasterie they made choice of, but by the course and practice of the Law also of that time (both Common and Canon, as it was here in vse) such conueyances were cleerly good, and what was through them so acquired, was continually, and is to this day (except some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which either the Popes autoritie of later time, or new Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>positions or Grants, or the like, haue altered) enioyed by the Churches, that, yet remaining, had portions so anciently giuen them, or by the King or his Grantees of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated Tithes; very many of which, had their chiefe originall from those arbitrarie Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:17576:166"/>
(which you may well call Appropriations of Tithes) and not from the appropriating only of Parish Churches, as some out of grosse igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, with too much confidence, deliuer. But thereof you may see more in the examples of the next Chapter. where, for most apparant proofe of the practice of arbitrarie Consecrations in those times, Moniments enough are collected. This arbitrarie disposition, vsed by the Laitie as well <hi>de iure</hi> (as the Positiue Law, then receiued and practiced, was) as <hi>de facto,</hi> is that which <hi>Wicclef</hi> rememberd in his complaint to the King and Parlament vnder <hi>Richard</hi> the second.

Ante illud Concilium benè potuerunt Laici Decimas in feudum retinere &amp; eas alteri Ecclesiae vel Monasterio dare; non tamen post tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus dicti Concilij.</hi> But if those which with vs talk here of the Councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> meane that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Alexvnder</hi> the third, and apply it generally to arbitrarie Consecrations of new Tithes, not feudall, I doubt they are much neerer the true meaning of that Councell then any of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists. especially while they speake of this Kingdome. for arbitrarie Consecrations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore about the time of that Councell are found here infinite, as presently shall be shewd. But of ancient feudall Tithes (howeuer they were common in other States) scarce any mention at all or tast is with vs. but thereof more in the XIII. Chapter. And, it may be, that when, from the Canonists, some of our Lawiers had learned that feudall Tithes might haue been conueied before that Councell arbitrarily by the owner; and saw withall that scarce any signe was of feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Tithes in this Kingdom, yet an abundance of old arbitrarie Consecrations, the vse whereof ceased about the time of the Councell; in the words of it no regard or mention being had of feudall but only Tithes in generall; they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (who sees enough why they might not?) that before that Councell euery man might haue ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarily disposed of his tithes. that is such tithes as were not formerly setled by any ciuill Title.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:17576:168"/>
But if this will not be allowd for the Law of change of those arbitarie conueiances; why may it not first be that <hi>Parning</hi> by his <hi>Constitution de nouelle fait per le Pape,</hi> meant that <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>Quam vide supr. cap.</hi> 8. §. 23.</note> of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, sent to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> in King <hi>Iohns</hi> time (and perhaps it was soon after receiud into the Prouince of <hi>York</hi> either by imitation or through the power Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, which the Archbishop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly exercised through the whole Kingdome) to command a Parochiall payment? For also by the name of a Constitution newly made by the Pope, some such thing rather then a Canon of a generall Councell, is perhaps denoted. And then why might it not happen that the Decretal of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the third, bearing date in the Church of <hi>Lateran</hi> should be thence denominated, and that afterward those which truly vnderstanding it, called it therefore a <hi>Lateran</hi> Constitution, gaue cause of mistaking to others that took it for a Constitution of a generall Councell of <hi>Lateran?</hi> especially too because it was about the time of the generall Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> (held vnder the same Pope that sent it) of which more notice hath been taken in our Law then of any other of that name. and indeed he that affirms that before the Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> Lay owners might haue disposed their Tithes, <hi>cuicunque Ecclesiae se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum meliorem deuotionem,</hi> as <hi>Dyers</hi> words are, speaks true enough, if his words may receiue
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:17576:168"/>
this easie interpretation. that is, that till about that Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> they might haue done so; not that the Councell vnder Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> restraind it, but that either the next Councell of <hi>Lateran</hi> before, that is vnder <hi>Alexand.</hi> the III. or the Pope by a Constitution, receiued here from <hi>Rome</hi> and dated in the Church of <hi>Lateran,</hi> about the time of that Councel of the yeer M.CC.XV. ordaind the contrarie. so that in this last way the name of the Councell may be a note only of the time about which it was restraind, not of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie whence it was forbidden. Perhaps those Canons of Pluralities, of Exemptions, of the three orders, and some such more which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiud from that Councell vnder <hi>Innocent,</hi> were brought into <hi>England</hi> at once with this Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Epistle; and if so, then also it was no more strange to haue the Decretall afterward titled by the name of a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitution of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, then it happend in the denomination of the Statuts of <hi>Aide de Roy</hi> and <hi>Voucher,</hi> made in 4. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. euery of which are stiled by the name of <hi>Statutum de Bigamis.</hi> yet only one Law <hi>de Biga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> receiud out of the generall Councell of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> is among those Statuts; and that is euen as much a stranger to the rest of the Constitutions bearing the same name with it, as Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents</hi> Decretall was to the whole Councell of <hi>Lateran.</hi> Howeuer, it is most cleer (let froward ignorance as it can continue to oppose the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:17576:169"/>
that for CC. yeers at lest before about the time of the Councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> held vnder the same Pope, arbitrarie Consecrations of Tithes with vs were frequent, and practiced aswell of positiue right (if wee may take that for right, in things subiect to human disposition, which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall consent of the state allowd; as no man that knows what makes a positiue right, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie) as of fact; which because they are best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiud of by the particular testimonies and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of them, in the following Chapter manie shall be transcribed; that are all (except one or two in the Prouince of <hi>Yorke</hi>; neither is it likely that in euery place here, and by euery man the intent of that Constitution was suddenly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and perhaps also it was not so soon alterd in <hi>York</hi> Prouince as in this of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in regard that the Decretall was sent only to <hi>Canterburie</hi> Prouince) of the time before that Decretall and taken out of the most choice and authentique moniments, that may afford help to the disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this point so little, so not at all vulgarly or indeed any where publiquely discouered.</p>

And for the example of the Tithes of <hi>Offington,</hi> the words of it are most obseruable also. <q>Eodem anno (<hi>sayes the Monke that wrote it</hi>) cum venisset Abbas <hi>Faritius</hi> in vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam suam <hi>Offentunam</hi> vt opus Ecclesiae quod ibi lapideum à fundamento inchoauerat ad perfectum determinaret, congregauerunt se homines sui ex eadem villa &amp; obtulerunt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni deuotione &amp; concessione Decimam suam totius villae eiusdem, S.

And a confirmation is there also by <hi>William S.

                  <p>The Churches of <hi>Warberton</hi> and <hi>Bernham</hi> and the rest before named with others, were, with the belonging Tithes, appropriated to the Priorie, but the Tithes alone of <hi>Thadeham</hi> and

What can the intent of this be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then that the Bishop, the King, and manie other Grandes of the Kingdome, did vsually grant or collate the Tithes of their Demesnes; which, because they were so grantable at the owners will, were (by the meaning of this Writ)
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:17576:198"/>
exempted from the Spirituall Iurisdiction. But thereof more anon. Perhaps the Writ is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly to be vnderstood of Tithes collated in like sort as a Church; so that he which collated them, had <hi>aduocationem Decimarum</hi> (which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares also in the <hi>Register</hi>) as any other confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Church, had <hi>Ecclesiae aduocationem.</hi> If not so; whence could the collation of these Tithes haue originall, sauing only from the making them seuerally a kind of Benefice (vnder the name of <hi>Decimae seperatae,</hi> that is, annext to no Church, as the Marginall note in the <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> well calls them) by arbitrarie Grant at first of the owner, no otherwise then a Church was made a Benefice to be bestowd, by the arbitrarie Ordinance of the Patron, at the foundation? Cleerly, had not the vse of conueyance of Tithes seuerally by Grant, preceded in practice, it could not haue been, that <hi>Quamplures magnate regni</hi> (as the Writ sayes) might <hi>Decimas liberè conferre in dominicis suis.</hi> Tithes alone could neuer haue been collated like a Benefice, had they not been first founded or created as a Benefice. And the Writ might seeme indeed to beare euen the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the time wherein that vse of arbitrarie Grants of Tithes was known, as of common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; which I vnderstand to be about King <hi>Iohns</hi> time; and that, before the Popes Decretalls, or other autoritie, had taken away the Lay-mens challenged libertie of granting Tithes seuerally,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:17576:199"/>
according to the former example. And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might that coniecture hold, because also the Sigle expressing the Bishops name, is H. which by all likelyhood denotes <hi>Hugh</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Wells,</hi> being L. Chancellor to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Lincolne.</hi> But it may be also, that it was had of later time, and at the suit of <hi>Henrie</hi> of <hi>Lexinton,</hi> made Bishop of <hi>Lincolne</hi> in 38. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and that, after Parochiall right was more setled. For notwithstanding the setling of it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Tithes then payable <hi>de iure communi</hi> to the Parish-Rector, yet it is certaine, that the former Grants (what through generall Confirmations from <hi>Rome,</hi> what through the Lay mens standing vpon their Patronages of Tithes, and vpon the Grantees acknowledgement of their first deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in such Consecrations) still continued, and were subiect (in case the <hi>Aduocatio Decimarum</hi> might come in question) to such a Prohibition, vntill some alteration was therein made, as anon shall be shewed, where wee speake of the ancient vse of the Writ of <hi>Indicauit.</hi> But of what time soeuer the Writ was, it is plain, that the ground of it must come from that vse of arbitrarie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations of Tithes, which seuerally also (as in it is supposed) made sometimes a kind of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that might be collated at the will of those who were owners of the Land whence the Tithes were payable. How could Tithes seuerally be collated by any Grandes, but from such origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

&amp;c. ibidem Deo seruientibus &amp;c.</hi> according to what is before noted of other Countries.

For speciall exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of such ancient Appropriations, you may see the recitalls of the Charters of King <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulph,</hi> King <hi>Beored,</hi> and King <hi>Edred,</hi> made to the Abbey of <hi>Crowland,</hi> and inserted in <hi>Ingulphus.</hi> But after the <hi>Normans,</hi> in Appropriations, most commonly, the Church is exprest, <hi>Vna cum De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cima</hi> (that is, the Tithe annext or consecrated to it) <hi>in annona,</hi> or in other kind, and the places sometimes are named where the encrease of the Tithe grew. Such examples are very obuious, especially in the Chartularies of <hi>Abingdon</hi> and <hi>Rochester.</hi> And, as is before noted, the most common intent (allowd also by Canonicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, which sometime but rarely was added in those elder ages) was, that the Corporation whereto the Appropriation was made, should put Clerks or Vicars in the Churches so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed to them, which were to answer to them

Here it appears (it seems) by the iudgement of the Kings Iustices, that the Patron had such interest in those times, that he might alone without grant of the Encumbent (who came in by his Institution and Inuestiture) or confirmation of the Bishop, charge the church

the Bishops Institution is spoken of, as cleerely necessarie, according to the Canons, and noted with <hi>Episcopus solus honores dare potest</hi>; which, you must remember, was writen by one that was feruent for the Canons, and had also writen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>auitae consuetudines</hi> or common Laws of that time.

Neither till about that time can it be found, that the more common practice of Lay mens Inuesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ceased. Nor was the Bishops Institution presently and vniformely thence vsed, as of later ages. The autoritie of the Clergie had by that time taken away the vse of Lay mens Inuestitures.

                  <p>FRom those arbitrarie Consecrations, and frequent Appropriations of Tithes (whereof we haue hitherto made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to Monasteries or other Religious Places, as Colleges of Regulars, Chantries and Free-Chappels, came the present and common Infeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of them into Lay hands, which began in the age of our Fathers. For, the Portions of Tithes conueied to them out of Closes, parts of Mannors, and whole Demesnes, by the owners, together with the Tithes granted and possessed with appropriated Churches, were first by the Statut of Dissolution of Monasteries in 31. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and by that other of 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. giuen to the Crown, and from thence granted to Lay men, whose Posteritie or Assignees to this day hold them with like limitation of estate, as they do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enheritances of Lands or Rents. and, for
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:17576:219"/>
them, haue like remedie by the Statut of 32. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. by reall action as <hi>Assise, Dower,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther originals, as for Lands, Rents, or other Lay possessions by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Law they might haue. But although in other States these Infeodations or Conueiances of the perpetuall right of Tithes to Lay men, be very ancient and frequent also; yet no such certain or obuious testimonie of their antiquitie, is in the moniments of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as can enough assure vs that they were before the Statut of Dissolutions in any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vse here. But some were, and, for aught appears in the practice of the time, many more might equally haue been. And what scruple was there but that long before the generall dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Monasteries, <hi>Henrie</hi> the fift might (by the Law of the Kingdom) haue made Infeodations into Lay hands (as <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight did) of all Tithes belonging <note n="a" place="margin">

                     </note> at his pleasure, no otherwise then of other Lay possessions. By the way, we vnderstand, in these Infeodations, by the name of Lay men, only such as were not either in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or professed in Religion. for otherwise all the possessions of Tithes enioied by Nunnes and the like, that were indeed Lay (though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called so) might be comprehended vnder
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:17576:219"/>
the name of Infeodations. But, that some were here; obserue that of <hi>Odo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bayeux</hi> and Earle of <hi>Kent,</hi> which is before cited out of the liues of the Abbots of S. <hi>Augustines</hi> in <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie.</hi> The words are, <hi>Decimas aliquas quas mei fideles habebant &amp;c.</hi> What can that be, according to the words, other then Tithes that were in the hands of some of his Tenants? You may adde that of <hi>Robert S. Iohn</hi> cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of the Book of <hi>Bosgraue,</hi> where he had, by the gift of his brother <hi>William,</hi> certain Tithes, which he gaue to the Priorie, for maintenance of a fourteenth Monk. And obserue the rest of the Deed there. So out of the Book of <hi>Osney</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears before, that <hi>Decimatio</hi> Nicholai <hi>de</hi> Stode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>quam Fromundus (Capellanus) tenebat</hi> is granted by <hi>D'Oilly.</hi> Had not <hi>D'Oilly</hi> this from <hi>Stodeham?</hi> Or was <hi>Stodeham</hi> here one of his Bailifes or Fermors, whose Tithe he graunted as Lord or according to couenant with the Lessee? Other such occurre sometimes. And perhaps, <hi>Decimae hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meorum,</hi> &amp; the like granted, may suppose a title possessed in the Tithes by the Lay grantor.

That, and other like to it, might begin vpon reall compositions, and so the Tithes be deriued out of the Church. But regularly, I thinke, at this day no kind of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feodation is here allowable in Lay mans making title to a perpetuall right of Tithes (except only by the later Statuts of Dissolutions) vnlesse it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be deriued from some old Graunt of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from the Parson, Patron, and Ordinarie, (in which case, hee to whom the Infeudation should be made, could haue it only as a Lay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit issuing out of the discharged land) or ioyned with a Consideration to be giuen for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the Parson, by him that receiues them; and this either from time immemoriall, or by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient composition. So I take the meaning of our reuerend Iudges to haue been touching this point. In summe then we may affirme, that some such ancient Infeodations haue been in <hi>England</hi> as in other States; but, that of later time none are allowable (if deriued from <note n="e" place="margin">Vide <hi>in d.

vnlesse they bee anciently deriued out of the Church first by discharge, or appeare to be but as a Reward giuen in pernancie, or as Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a Pension or other competent Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance yeerely payable to the Parson.

<pb n="400" facs="tcp:17576:221"/>
from a good Ciuill and Canon Lawier, that had been present at the Disputation of the point, in a case happening between a Religious house and a Parson, for Tithes in the Parsons Parish, who claimed them <hi>iure communi,</hi> that the Aduocat for the Religious house being put to make a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall title against the Parsons common right, told the Court a long storie of Easterne holy Warres about <hi>Pipins</hi> time; and interposed som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of <hi>Charles Martell</hi>; and concluded, that the Pope and the Church euery where graunted, in reward to the Christian Princes, for their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, Knights, and Gentlemen, that spent their blouds, labours, and estates in those Warres, the priuiledge of arbitrarie disposition of the Tithes of their lands; by reason of which Graunt, they afterward made not only Arbitrarie Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them, but also Infeodations into Lay hands, according as the common opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Canonists is too confidently receiued at this day. Then he tells vs that before remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd, of the Tithes in <hi>Bampton,</hi> and cites some texts out of the Decretalls, that touch Infeoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Next he relates, that among the Princes of the holy Warre, about <hi>Martell</hi> and <hi>Pipins</hi> time, the Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> was a speciall one, whence hee had also that priuiledge touching Tithes, <hi>pro se ac suis,</hi> as the words are. And lastly (to bring it into <hi>England</hi>) hee thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, <hi>Et cum Dux Normanniae</hi> Willielmus <hi>ad
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:17576:221"/>

For what touches <hi>Martell</hi> and his time generally, enough alreadie is said. And see but what a bold ignorance here was, to tell vs, that the Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> was one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test (<hi>personis Regum exceptis,</hi> as his Language is) that went in the holy Warre <hi>in succursum Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae Romanae,</hi> in those times of <hi>Pipin</hi> and <hi>Martell?</hi> I would he durst haue told vs also who had then been Duke of <hi>Normandie.</hi> Neither that title of Dignitie, nor that name of the Countrey, were, till about CL. yeers after <hi>Martell,</hi> at all known. The Territorie being then vnder the <hi>French</hi> Kings, who long after gaue it to the <hi>Normans,</hi> and erected it into a Dukedome. Indeed the Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> had good place in the later holy Warres, about M.XCV. but did not that make this Aduocat say, that the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie</hi> was a speciall Prince in the other also of <hi>Martell's</hi> time? Such of the later midle times stand not much vpon the mingling of Stories, that differ in themselues euen many whole ages. Besides, he tells vs of strange Princes names of
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:17576:222"/>
the East, that made the Warre against the Church. Plainly, the most pretended cause of the rest that erre herein as much as hee doth, is the <hi>Saracenicall</hi> Warre in <hi>Martell's</hi> time, and that out of <hi>Spain,</hi> not from the East. And had it been so vnder <hi>Martell's</hi> time, as it is vsually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmd; what had that been to <hi>England?</hi> But you see his prouidence for that matter, where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riues it from the Duke of <hi>Normandie.</hi> But what though there had been some such Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie,</hi> whose Successor had afterward either conquered or enherited <hi>England?</hi> had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the old supposed priuiledge of retaining or disposing of Tithes, been thence communicated to his subiects of <hi>England?</hi> and that to the losse of the Church here, that neuer could haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten good by the supposed cause of the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? All the Canon and Ciuill Law that the Aduocat had, could neuer haue proued such a consequent. It will still remaine most probable, if not cleere, that what Infeodations were in <hi>England,</hi> had their originall as well out of the right of arbitrarie disposition of Tithes challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Laitie, without the grant of the Pope or Church, as out of Compositions or Conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances from the Clergie; according as in other States. For no sufficient Storie, no credible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niment, no Passage, or Testimonie of worth, can iustifie that generall right of retainer or disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to haue been giuen by the Clergie, or Pope,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:17576:222"/>
vpon any cause whatsoeuer; though the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists and others that follow them, cry against it, <hi>vsque ad rauim.</hi> The vse of Infeodations, before those later holy Warres, we haue alreadie shewd.

Beside these discharges, some may here expect that part of our Laws, which with vs (as the <hi>Philippine</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Carolines</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>) discharge some things from payment of Tithes, and seem to permit some customs <hi>de non Decimando.</hi> But for that matter; so much as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consideration was thought fit to be sparingly said of it, is referd to the passages in the next Chapter, that touches ancient prohibitions <hi>de non Decimando.</hi> Neither indeed doth that part of our <hi>English</hi> customs belong to the title of Exemption or Discharge. for Exemption and Discharge are properly singular rights to this or that person or Land, and against the currant of the practiced Law. but those things touching which any such prohibitions <hi>de non &amp;c.</hi> by our Law should be granted, are supposed generally according to the reasons and practice of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> of their own nature, not tithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

His words are: <hi>Si contentio fuerit inter Rectores de aliquibus Decimis quae aestimari possunt vsque ad quartam, quintam, vel sextam partem aduocationis, vltra quam par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem non extenditur prohibitio vt videtur, tunc fiat Iudicibus</hi> (Ecclesiasticis) <hi>Prohibitio in hac forma.

                  <p>Of Writs of <hi>Scire facias,</hi> graunted to call men to answer in the Chancerie for Tithes, sufficient testimonie is in the Statute made for the Clergie in 18. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Item que per la ou briefs</hi> (so are the words) <hi>de</hi> Scire facias <hi>eient este grantez a garnir Prelates, Religieuses, &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres Clerks a respondre des Dismes en nostre Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellarie &amp; a monstre s'ils eient riens pur eux ou sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chent riens dire pur quoy tielx Dismes a les de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandants ne deuient estre restituees &amp; a responder auxibien a nou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="435" facs="tcp:17576:238"/>
of further declaration of that vse before the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. But out of good ground you may conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that in these Three speciall cases, Writs of <hi>Scire facias</hi> were grantable anciently for Tithes, and that in those times, before the Statut; either vpon the title of the demandant, first found by <hi>Inquest,</hi> to the Tithes, or returnd by the Shirife; or out of <hi>Fines,</hi> it seemes, leuied of Tithes; or vpon <hi>Patents</hi> of Tithes legally graunted by the King, when, against the Grant, any Clergie man by the Canon Law took them from the Patentee. Of all these, there is faire proof enough. But the third (it seems) hath principall reference to that Statute, as shall anon be shewed. For the course of taking an <hi>Inquest</hi> by commission, which being returnd, might be sufficient ground for a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> it appeares in <hi>Escaet.</hi> 8. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>numer.</hi> 67. that a commission was sent to <hi>Adam</hi> of <hi>Euering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Steward of the Forest of <hi>Shirewood,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire by Oath of the Foresters and Verderors, whether the Priors of <hi>Lenton</hi> had vsed to haue all Tithes of the Kings Venison, taken in the Countie of <hi>Notingham,</hi> which they claimed <hi>per Cartas quorundam praedecessorum &amp;c.</hi> And in the Inquisition returned, it is found, that they had vsed to haue it, and that first by the Grant of <note n="p" place="margin">Videsis <hi>Rot.

               <p>But one thing more here by the way.

Neither haue I giuen his words alone &amp; then my own Glosse (as many haue done too often, and that in things of the nature of this subiect, and so haue deceiud their credulous Readers) but I haue carefully and shortly exprest also the occasion of his passages; and so, that an vnderstanding Reader may collect as much out of them as he might do if he had the whole context of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> by him.

For (saith he) they shall find them also cursed that are not Circumcised, and them cursed that pay not Tithes, and them cursed that offer not at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Let any man now consider if this Bishop that was least vnacquainted with the customes of the Christian Church, vnderstood not cleerly that no necessarie or knowne vse of paiment, was among Christians in his time, of Tithes, no more then of Circumcision, or offering at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Doth he not plainly reckon it as a thing not only not in Christian vse, but euen equalls it with what was certainly abrogated? is not his Obiection shortly thus? Why do you not obserue Circumcision and Tithing, and Offerings also at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which are all subiect to the like curse? and because some kind of Offerings indeed were in vse among Christians, therefore in the Obiection he prouidently ties them to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But of Tithing he speakes as generally as of Circumcision.

Why? because then notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Canons, no <hi>ius commune,</hi> no Parochiall right of Tithes was setled or admitted in the practice of the Laitie.

And doubtlesse also, after such time as the Clergie saw that the Canons, made for Parochiall right of Tithes, had gotten force, and that the former creations or grants of Tithes by Lay men (which were indeed practiced agianst many Canons both Papall and Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall) were, by that name of Lay-mens grants, creations or consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, declared vtterly void by the Pope and his Canon Law, although confirmed by whomsoeuer; such of them as had originally no other true titles to Tithes so commonly consecrated by Lay men, subtilly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the next foure hundred yeers, left off the pretence of their Lay grantors bountie (especially if the Grantor had been a common person) and betook themselues only to prescription <note n="f" place="margin">

Remember also their erecting of Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall Chappells within the larger Territories, out of which they had portions. plainly, the erecting of such Chappells for Parish Churches (the Cure being there serued by some Monke or Vicar, instituted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the presentation of them which had the granted portions) made those portions at length also in many places be reputed for Parochiall Tithes, due in regard of those Parochiall Chappells.

time of <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, especially in the Lieger books of <hi>Reading, Osney,</hi> and <hi>Pipewell.</hi> but in none of them euer any deriud from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations. Neither indeed, in that ancientest Formularie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law (I mean <hi>Durand,</hi> that liued about CCC.L. yeers since) is any other Libell for Tithes, then such as make the Title Canonicall. None that touches Lay consecrations; which diuers yeers before his time became as much concealed in legall proceedings of the Canon Law, as they had been in the more ancient times desired and hunted after by such as were enricht by them. This of arbitarie Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I presume, is like strange Doctrine to most men. it may well be. for the truth of it, I think, was neuer before so much as pointed at by any that hath writen of any part of our subiect. But I doubt not but euery vnderstanding Reader will think these things here now shortly noted on them to deserue his consideration, which I desire him also to referre to the XI. Chapter. and also let him apply to them the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions toucht presently in Appropriations.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Appropriations</hi> which are in the 3. §. they consisted (as you see there &amp; in the XII. Chapter) for the purpose, either in conueying <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Churches appropriated with Tithes</hi> setled in them somtimes by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of paiment, sometimes by Consecrations, or by both; or of <hi>Churches that were then appropriated when</hi> (according to the vse of the time) <hi>none or few Tithes were paid</hi> to them, yet afterward in the hands of the Monks or such like, when the Canons for paiment of Tithes came into force, got Parochiall paiment to be made to them; or thirdly in passing of Tithes formerly created and in <hi>esse.</hi> So that as by <hi>Consecrations,</hi> Tithes newly created, were setled in Monasteries and the like, so, by <hi>Appropriations,</hi> Churches with Tithes in <hi>esse,</hi> or with the pretended right to them, and Tithes alone (but formerly in <hi>esse</hi>) were conueid to them. The whole Appropriation of Tithes with Churches or Churches alone (we shew) in that ancienter time was made by the Patron. The Churches with Tithes (by the name of <hi>Ecclesia cum De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimis,</hi> when Tithes were paid to it) was in point of interest giuen by him. And many more Churches haue been so appropriated, then by the later and more known course. Neither, I think, haue many new Appropriations been since made. not many in regard of the number of the other. But deserues not this then another kind of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then is commonly dreamt on, among them which make Tithes due by the Diuine Morall Law to the Euangelicall Priesthood? if they be so; what had the Patron as Patron (were he either Temporall or Spirituall) to doe with them in conueying them to Monks, Friers, Nunnes, poor people in Hospitals? none of these, by that name, are of the Priesthood. and that way, they were so equally due to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring Priesthood before the Patrons title to the Church, that what euer he could do after he were Patron (although also his act were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmd by whom you will) could not at all, it seems, touch them, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:17576:256"/>
them from him that should afterward exercise the spirituall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church. Consider Tithes so due; and how could any Monasterie deriue to it selfe any Title to that selfe same Tithe that was so due to the Priesthood? And if it had not the selfe same Tithe, but by prescription or other ciuill Title, hauing the glebe of a Church had also a profit by the name of Tithe as annext to the Church, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then other Lay endowments (for no man can doubt but that any kind of persons may inioy a profit vnder the name of Tithe or Tenth, aswell as a Rent of the Ninth part or of the Eleuenth) who then is it that now detains the Tithe due by the Diuine Morall Law, in cases of Appropriations? doth the Monasterie, or those which haue such appropriated Tithes by conueyance from it? or rather doth not the Parishioner, that is bound to whatsoeuer is by that Law due, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he pay neuer so many other Tenths due only by some ciuill Title? or by that Opinion, is not he that receiues the appropriated Tithe bound to pay a Tenth of it to the Minister, and the Parishioner a Tenth of his Nine parts. I affirme nothing here. it is no place for me to do it. But let these things be first considerable to euery one that talks of Appropriations, and concludes Tithes due <hi>iure diuino morali.</hi> And, for Lay mens right to the appropriated Tithes (that is, such as did either vest in the Monasteries by Appropriations, or at least haue been enioied by reason of them) let him examine it rather thus: may that which either Grant or Prescription, or other ciuill Title once setled and so euen consecrated to God and holy vses, although abusd, be afterward prophaned to Lay hands? But it is a grosse error to make it cleer as many do, that if Tithes be not due to the Priesthood <hi>iure diuino morali,</hi> then Appropriated Tithes may be still possessed with good conscience by Lay men; and that if otherwise, then they may not. For though they be not due so; yet is the consecration of them in the Appropriation, nothing? for if they be not due so, then it will be cleer, I think, to all, that they might passe in the Appropriation, as other things, subiect to the Titles of humane and positiue Law. The many execrations annext to the deeds of conueyance of them, and pourd forth against such as should d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Valete.</hi> It seems he was in some confidence, that because he was a Bishop, he might make them beleeue any thing of the Patriarchs and the Apostles. and you may see he loued the profit of the Tithes so well, that he would not stand vpon any vnlucky venturing his credit in Diuinitie, or vpon offering a plain falshood, in writing for them. For though they were due generally as he would haue them, yet how would he haue proued that all the Patriarchs and all that were by faith as the sonnes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> paid them? or that thereby they all had gaind <hi>praemia aeterna?</hi> and whence could he haue iustified it, that the Apostles ordaind that they should be paid? it may be therein he meant the Constitutions of the Apostles, of which enough before. if he did, how could he haue strengthened their autoritie? But they to whom he sent remaind still as farre from obedience as the historicall part of his Letter was from truth. And the truth was, he could by no means get any Tithes of them. But for that (in this §.) of Episcopall right, or the right of the Euangelicall Priesthood, so much pretended against Tithes enioied by Monks, that were indeed Lay men, howeuer reputed as a kind of part of the Clergie; it seems that in those daies the Bishops and Priests often stood so much on it, and so much and so often labourd
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:17576:257"/>
against Consecrated &amp; Appropriated Tithes, possessed by the Monks (for they knew it was to no purpose to vrge the Lay owners, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had giuen Tithe by consecration would giue no more to any of them) that the most common place which in their Synods and Sermons they dealt on, was the right of Tithes, as due to the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. and in so much also and so vntimely was that common place v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that there talking of it was become a Prouerb to denote their frequent going from the matter. as if most vsually they fell into that, when they should haue talkt of something else.

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For there is no doubt but the Bishops and Priests obiected the name of <hi>Laici</hi> to the Monks here; and so was it fit, in the relation, to name them. and it was no wonder that the common people (whose bountie, in bestowing of Tithes on Monks, should thus haue turnd to nothing) so fiercely opposed them. If you vnderstand <hi>Laicis</hi> by it selfe here, then it may denote the arbitrarie detaining or disposing of Tithes by meer Lay men, which, I must confesse, <hi>Abbo</hi> and his Monks and all other Monks whatsoeuer had some reason to withstand. for they gaind much by it. But, I doubt, it cannot haue reference to Lay Infeodations. For as yet I could neuer see the least testimonie of an Infeodation of Tithes vntill many yeers after <hi>Abbo's</hi> time. it might perhaps denote them also. but I dare not cleerly affirm or denie here.</p>
               <p>The 4. §. is of ancient <hi>Infeodations</hi> of Tithes.

Neither was it anciently so interpreted by the Canonists. but in the other, that is, touching new creations of Feudall Tithes (in preiudice of the Church) by Lay men to Lay men, it hath been euer admitted, and is in practice both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> and what better interpretation of it can be then the continuall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice vpon it since the making of it? and so how can it then be supposd but that Lay men before were chiefly the originall Autors of them?

Had they not come from the Church, they say, then had the Tithes themselues, which are now possessed by Lay men through Infeodations, paid Tithes also to the Church by reason of the many Canons made for paiment out of all yeerly increase. But this reason cleerly moues nothing. for the selfe same might haue been obiected against the known beginning of Tithes created and consecrated to Monasteries by Lay men. plainly by the Canons, notwithstanding such consecration, the Parochiall right to the Euangelicall Priesthood could not be diminished. and by them also, aswell a Tithe out of the Tithe consecrated, as out of the Nine parts of the Parishioner, might, for aught can be proued against it, be demanded by the Parish Rector.
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:17576:258"/>
But wee see cleerly both the originall of those consecrations to haue been from Lay men; and also that no Tithe was or is paid either out of them or out of the rest of the profits of the Nine parts. How then can the other argument touching Infeodations better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude here? beside it insists vpon Canons. and would conclude practice from Law. which course of proofe, vsd by most men that write of these things, is grosse and ridiculous. For who euer but indifferently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues the storie of the elder time together with the Laws, shall soon find that in the Canon Law especially, an argument from <hi>debere fieri</hi> to <hi>factum esse,</hi> is scarce so sound as that so hist at among children, <hi>à posse ad esse.</hi> The truth seemes to be, that both in <hi>Consecrations,</hi> and <hi>Infeodations,</hi> and <hi>Appropriations</hi> of Tithes, there was not any other thing thought on then the name of Tithe, and the right of Tithes generally due to the Church; as if euery thing being the Tenth, and by that name as it were specificated, were presently the Clergies. so that whatsoeuer was by that name giuen away to meer Lay men or to Monasteries by new creation in either Consecrations or Infeoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was, it seemes, taken alwaies to be the selfe same indiuiduall Tithe which was supposd due to the Clergie. which also doubtlesse was a cause why many Infeodations hauing originall only from Lay men, were falsly supposed to haue first come from the Church. for how easie was it that that which out of its own name only of <hi>Decima</hi> was presently taken as to be due to the Church, should be titled an Ecclesiastique right, and then in the passages of them which would haue had it so, be reckond among such things as the Church had a title to by a former possession? and cleerly many of the Laitie also could not but be very inclinable to that opinion. for so long as that held it is likely they resolud they needed not to pay any more to the Church. for when the Church would not keepe the feudall Tithes when it had them (they thought it once had them al) they conceiued doubtlesse there was no reason why they should pay it any more or other Tithes. Thus perhaps vpon diuers grounds and causes, both the Laitie &amp; Clergie deceiud themselues in thinking of the originall of these Infeodations. But herein that which we haue toucht before to be considered in Consecrations and Appropriations is also consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. for what could such Infeodations by Lay men to Lay men, hurt the right of tithes which was in the Priesthood? especially if due either <hi>iure diuino morali,</hi> or by any positiue Law ancienter then the Infeodation. But we haue not affirmd, that no Infeodations came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally from the Church.

is euery where almost to be met withal in <hi>England,</hi> that you shal haue it affirmd for cleer that <hi>al other States are gouernd only by the Ciuil Law.</hi> Indeed, if they which say so, vnderstood <hi>Ciuill</hi> for that which is the <hi>Ius Ciuile</hi> of euery singular State, it were but the same to talk of <hi>Ciuill</hi> and <hi>Common Law.</hi> For the <hi>Common Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi> also is the <hi>Ius Ciuile Anglorum.</hi> But it is euen with one mouth pretended vsually, that the Body of the <hi>Imperialls,</hi> read and profest in the Vniuersities, is the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Law, that gouernes (as they say) all other States. But this, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer receiued through lazie Ignorance, is so farre from Truth, that indeed no Nation in the world is gouerned by them. For whersoeuer they are supposed to gouerne (let the briefe cleering of so common an error, get pardon for the digression) it must be taken, that they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gourne by their <hi>owne originall autoritie,</hi> as they are Imperialls, or from their <hi>being receiued for Laws into other States,</hi> which are not in that first way subiect to them. According to that first way; only the <hi>Empire</hi> and perhaps a good part of <hi>Italie,</hi> should be ruled by them. But it is plaine, that for the most part, the disposition of Inheritances, punishing of Crimes, course of Proceedings, Dowers, Testaments, and such other, which are of greatest moment vnder the Legall rule, are euen in those States, where, by reason of their first Institution, they retaine a kind of autoritie, ordered by most various Customes and new Statutes of seuerall Prouinces and Cities, so differing from those old Imperialls; that the whole face and course of them is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly changed in practice. This is plaine to euery one, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues but the diuers Customes and Ordinances of the States subiect to the <hi>Empire</hi>; the <hi>Ius Camerale</hi> collected by <hi>Petrus Denaisius</hi>; the <hi>Nemesis Karulina,</hi> as it is set forth by <hi>Georgius Romus</hi>; and the many published Decisions or Reports both of the <hi>Imperiall Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and the <hi>Rota's</hi> of <hi>Rome, Naples, Piemont, Mantua, Genoa, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi> and other parts of the Territorie of <hi>Italie.</hi> You shall find those Decisions, in matters of greatest moment, most commonly grounded on Customarie Law, or later Constitutions. So, that to affirme, that in these places the old Imperialls, or that Ciuill Law (as they call it) gouernes, is as if (for example) an equall ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance shuld tel vs, that <hi>Spain</hi> were gouerned only by <hi>Alfonso's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidas,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> only by <hi>Malcolms</hi> Laws or the <hi>Quoniam Attachia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta</hi>; or that in the time of the old Emperors the <hi>Roman</hi> State had been alwaies gouerned only by the XII.

For the suits for them in the Spirituall Courts either were all grounded vpon the Canons; or the common right of Tithes was now supposed in the Libell as a knowne dutie to the Clergie, without secular Law. It may soon be apprehended, that it was much lesse difficult about that time, then any other, for the Popes and their Canon Laws to gaine more obedience among sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and execute more autoritie ouer Lay possessions, when also they so easily vsurpt power ouer supreme Princes, which yeelded to them.

Therefore it was not without reason on their side<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at such time as they saw the Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie of Decretals and of the Canons grew most dreadfull to Prince and subiect, that they should vrge this on to a continuing practice, and that with execution of the raigning Censures of the Church. Hence haue the Canons, in this point, hitherto here continued, and haue been and are binding Ecclesiastique Lawes, sauing wherein the later expresse Laws of the Kingdome crosse them.

For doubtlesse, the Canon Laws were here vsed and practiced as farre forth as the Clergie could make the Laitie subiect to them.

Which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse is otherwise. If on the other side we vnderstand the <hi>Imperialls</hi> (Copies of which indeed might well be at that very time brought as a noueltie hither; for they were then newly found; and plainly in <hi>Henrie</hi> the seconds time, they were here in the hands of the more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Scholers, as you may see by <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Chartres</hi> his citing of them) how then is that true which he presenly after saies of the encreasing power and force of those <hi>Leges Romanae? Sed,</hi> saith he, <hi>Deo faciente eò magis virtus legis inualuit quo eam amplius nitebatur impietas infirmare.</hi> What force or power at all had the Imperiall here afterward? where is any signe of it? But the obiection against that which might proue them not to haue been the <hi>Canon Laws,</hi> may not difficultly perhaps be answered. It is true that the Canons of <hi>Rome</hi> were here before, and read, and partly practiced in the Church. But diuers Collections were of them about this age of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> and perhaps some later and larger Collection might be brought hither by Archbishop <hi>Theobald,</hi> or some of his Clergie, which are vnderstood, I think, in that <hi>Domus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerabilis Patris Theobaldi.</hi> He himselfe perhaps might bring <hi>Iuo's</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree (when he came from <hi>Rome</hi> in 3. of King <hi>Stephen</hi>) and endeuour the strict practice of it here; which the King and the Lay subiect had reason enough to dislike) or some of his Clergie might perhaps after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bring in <hi>Gratians</hi> Decree, that was both compild by <hi>Gratian</hi> and confirmd by Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the third, about ten yeers before <hi>Theobalds</hi> death, that is, about 16. of King <hi>Stephen.</hi> And this way those words of <hi>Legis virtus inualuit,</hi> may haue their truth. For howeuer that opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the Canon Law were, it is most certain that this first part of the body of it (the Decree) was presently vpon the first publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in vse in <hi>England,</hi> and familiarly cited by such Diuines as talk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
