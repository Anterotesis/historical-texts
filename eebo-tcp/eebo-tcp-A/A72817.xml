         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ To the Right Honourable Aſſembly of the Commons Houſe of Parliament.</head>
            <head type="sub">The Reaſons mouing the Hot-preſſers to draw themſelues into an orderly forme of gouernement vnder his Maieſties gracious protection.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, the extreame multitude of Suites by ordinarie Informers: For that euerie Tearme ſome of vs were ſerued with Writs of Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both out of the Cheecker, Common-pleas and Crowne Office, ſo that ſome times it coſt vs three or foure pounds a Tearme; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes more.</p>
            <p>Againe, for that ſome Informers of the Citie, or Officers of the Citie, oftentimes meete with ſome of our Merchants Goods, as they carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them home, ſeized them to his Maieſties vſe, and take them from our Seruants: oftentimes eight or ten pounds worth at one inſtant and more, beſides many other troubles that we by them were put to.</p>
            <p>Then the Citie being exſtreamely bent againſt vs, vpon their Acts of Common Councell, which were againſt the vſe of the Hot-preſſes in London, and the Liberties thereof, in reſpect of the danger of Fire by them. The firſt Act to pay fiue pounds for euerie Moneth it was vſed. The ſecond Act, to pay fiue pounds for euery time it was vſed within London or the Liberties thereof.</p>
            <p>Vpon theſe Acts we were exſtreamely troubled and vexed, not onely by the Lord Maior of the Citie, but alſo by the Informers belonging to the Chamber of London: And being therein ouerthrowne in triall of Law in the Citie, were inforced ſome of vs to pay the vttermoſt penny we were condemned in. And not onely ſo, but were much more vexed and troubled, by binding vs ouer to anſwere the ſame at the Seſſions of Peace at the Guild Hall, to our great charge and exſpences.</p>
            <p>Theſe were ſome part of the cauſes that mooued vs to ſeeke for reliefe, vnder his Maieſties gracious protection for our ſetled Gouernement, and redreſſe in our Trade, with many other grieuances as followeth.</p>
            <p>FOr that diuers men of ſeuerall Trades, haue vnconſcionably entred into the Trade of Preſſing, within theſe foure yeeres or there about, and ſome within leſſe then two yeeres, by ſome ſiniſter meanes haue intiſed our Seruants and Iourneymen: whereby they haue gotten ſome skill and exſperience, by which ſiniſter meanes, they haue robbed vs of our Profeſſion, to the vtter vndoing of vs our Wiues and Families for euer, being at the leaſt in number (in and about the Citie) three hundred Perſons: And not only ſo, but when they had gotten ſome experience from our Seruants: They vnconſcionably turned them out of doores, to let them ſhift for them ſelues, which tends not onely to their vndoing, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ours. For they vſing many Trades, and ingroſſing diuers Commodities to themſelues, haue gotten alſo the chiefeſt part of the Worke within the Citie of London and Liberties thereof into their hands, to the vtter ruine and vndoing of a number of poore people, their Wiues and Families.</p>
            <p>The principall of theſe Enterlopers, be Packers, Rich-men and of good eſtates, which takes vpon them the benefit of many Trades. Firſt, in the dreſſing of Clothes, taking vpon them to Dreſſe and Sheare them Marchant like, as they ought to doe: But they carrie them Rooffe in the Woole to the Dyers without Dreſſing, and after Dying, drie them, and ſo Preſſe them: All which defects, the Hot-preſſe couers in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Houſes, to the great diſgrace of Clothing and Preſſing, and hath beene a great hinderance to his Maieſtie in his Cuſtomes.</p>
            <p>They alſo make benefit by Dying as will appeare. They keepe and make benefit by Hot-preſſes. They be Factors, and ſo reape benefit,</p>
            <p>And ſome of theſe Packers be Marchants alſo.</p>
            <list>
               <head>Others there be, that haue vnconſcionably intruded themſelues into the Art of Preſſing, as followeth.</head>
               <item>Some Mercers.</item>
               <item>Some Goldſmiths.</item>
               <item>Some Stocking-ſellers.</item>
               <item>Some Groſſers.</item>
               <item>Some Vintners.</item>
               <item>Some Brokers.</item>
               <item>Some Shoomakers.</item>
               <item>Some Ioyners.</item>
            </list>
            <p>All theſe hauing other Trades, haue Enterloped into the Art and myſterie of Hot-preſſing: hauing gotten as aboueſaid by ſiniſter meanes, an in-ſight and knowledge of the Art of Proſſing, within theſe foure yeares, or there abouts, the moſt part of them leſſe then within theſe two or three yeeres.</p>
            <p>More humbly ſheweth, that a Stranger in London (by name <hi>Burgman</hi>) within theſe three yeeres or there about, hauing gotten exſperience by theſe Enterloping Preſſors, is of late departed to Amſterdam in Holland, and there haue gotten to himſelfe a Preuiledge by Pattent: That no man ſhall vſe the Art of Preſſing there, but he and his Aſſignes for ſeuen yeeres, and hath to that end put in vſe twentie Hot-preſſes, prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting thereby all ſuch Perpetuanies, or any other commodities, Preſt in the Hot-preſſe here in England, tranſported thither by way of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe: Seiſing and Forfeiting them, the one halfe thereof to the States of the Countrie, and one other part to the poore, and the third part to the Seiſure and himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Thus our Trade or Myſterie of Hot-preſſing, whereon our liuing wholly dependeth, hauing no other Trade or meanes: is by theſe Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopers vtterly taken from vs, ſo that a great number of vs, our Wiues and Children are like to periſh. Wherefore we humbly craue this Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Aſſembly of high Court of Parliament, to commiſſerate our lamentable eſtates, by taking ſuch good Order therein, as by your good Honours ſhall be thought fitteſt, both for redreſſe in the former abuſes, and for your Petitioners reliefe.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Reaſons which cauſed vs to haue a ſetled Gouernment, according to his Maieſties directions, be theſe as followeth.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, that there were groſſe abuſes daily vſed and practiſed, by ſome Enterlopers and others: tending not onely to the hurt of the Merchant, but the diſcredit and ouerthrow of Clothing in forraine parts; the ruine and vndoing of a Common-wealth. Oftentimes abuſing the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants goods, by cutting of Remnants of Perpetuanies, ſome times two yards, ſometimes more, ſomtime leſſe: Others by Burning, Scorching, taking away the Colour cleane. And being thus vnconſcionably done and abuſed, they make them vp in Tillets and Packe them away: which tends to the great abuſe and ſcandall of this our Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being well wayed and conſidered of vs, cauſed vs to ſeeke the meanes, to redreſſe theſe ſoule abuſes, which we preſently put in vſe, ſetling our ſelues in one place, by a ſpeciall direction from his Maieſtie, to the Lord Maior of London, and being there ſetled, we forthwith made choyſe of foure men weekely to view, and looke ouer euery mans worke, to be well and workman-like done, and warrantable according to an article of his Maieſties priuie Seale. And in this good courſe we went cheerfully on, with much good comfort to our ſelues and to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, vntill theſe troubleſome Enterlopers, repining at his Maieſties good and orderly Gouernement: Vexing and troubling vs contrarie to his Maieſties Grant. Wherefore for redreſſe, we humbly ſubmit our ſelues, to this Honorable Aſſembly of this high Court of Parliament: And your Petitioners, with their Wiues and Families will euer pray, &amp;c.</p>
