            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SERMON FOR THE Reformation of Manners.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ROM. xiii. 4.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>For he is the Minister of God, to thee for Goodâ€”</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Temper of this our present Assembly ought to be not only <hi>serious,</hi> but also <hi>mournful:</hi> For the occasion it hath reference to, is both very <hi>important,</hi> and most <hi>deplorable,</hi> and requires to be attended to, as with very intense <hi>Consideration,</hi> so with deep <hi>sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> Even <hi>Rivers of Tears running down our Eyes,</hi> as the words are, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.136. could not more than equal the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93192:3"/>
of the Case, <hi>i. e.</hi> the same <hi>there</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; <hi>because Men</hi> (as is meant by the Indefinite <hi>they) kept not God's Law.</hi> That there should be such Disorders in the Intellectual World! That Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures should be so degenerate, that 'tis become hardly accountable why they are called so! They are said to be Constituted and Distinguish'd by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but disdain to be govern'd by it, accounting their <hi>Senses</hi> and their <hi>Vices,</hi> their better and wiser Directors.</p>
            <p>WITH <hi>us</hi> the Case is yet worse! that in a <hi>Christian</hi> City and Kingdom, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies of Wickedness are so high, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuate at such a rate, and so daringly assault Heaven, that the Rigor of Laws, the Severity of Penalties, the Vigilancy and Justice of Magistrates, with the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous assisting Diligence of all Good Men, in their several Stations, are more <hi>necessary</hi> than <hi>sufficient</hi> to repress them.</p>
            <p>THE same <hi>Considerations</hi> that should excite our <hi>Zeal,</hi> ought also to influence our <hi>Grief</hi>; and the more apparently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary it is, that all possible Endeavours be used for Redress, and the stronger and more convictive Arguments can be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93192:3"/>
brought to evince it, the deeper sense we ought to have of the Evils that create this Necessity, and the more feelingly we should lament them.</p>
            <p>AND if this be the Temper of <hi>this Assembly</hi> and of <hi>all other,</hi> upon <hi>this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,</hi> this would give us Measures, and set us right, as to the whole Business of such a Season. No Body will then think it should be the Business of the Sermon, to please curious Ears, or of the Hearers to criticize upon the Sermon, or that it ought to be my present Business to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement the Worthy Persons that have Associated on this Account, how lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soever their Undertaking is. But it will be the common agreed Business of us all, to take to Heart the sad Exigency of the Case, to be suitably affected with it, and quickned to what shall appear to be our Duty in reference thereto.</p>
            <p>AND tho the Words I have read do more directly respect the <hi>Part</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Rulers,</hi> yet since there is that Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between them <hi>that Govern,</hi> and those that are <hi>under Government,</hi> that the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>the one,</hi> will plainly imply, and connote the Duty of <hi>the other.</hi> I shall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93192:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>so</hi> consider the Words, as they may have <hi>a direct,</hi> or <hi>collateral</hi> Reference to all sorts of Hearers; and do point out the Duty, as well of them <hi>that live under Government,</hi> as of them <hi>that Govern.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are therefore to take notice, that the Text admits, either of an <hi>Absolute</hi> Consideration, or a <hi>Relative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>ABSOLUTELY</hi> considered, 'tis an <hi>Assertion</hi>;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>RELATIVELY,</hi> it is an <hi>Argument.</hi> As the Introductive Particle, <hi>for,</hi> shews.</p>
            <p n="1">1. FOR the Absolute Consideration of the Words, as they are an <hi>Assertion,</hi> we are to see what they assert. The Person spoken of under the Term <hi>He,</hi> is <hi>any Ruler, Supream</hi> or <hi>Subordinate,</hi> as in that parallel Text, which we may take for a Comment upon this, is exprest, 1 Pet. 2.13, 14. <hi>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's sake, whether to the King as Supream, or to Governours sent by him, for the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Evil Doers, and for the Praise of them that do well.</hi> The Words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93192:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, used in this Context admit of the same extent. So among others, that great Man <hi>Grotius</hi> understands this place also, not only of <hi>Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but whosoever are</hi> the <hi>Tutores status publici,</hi> (borrowing that Expression from <hi>Seneca) any that are to take care of the Publick State, by whatsoever Name they are designed.</hi> Indefinitely, <hi>any Magistrate whatsoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT which is said of such a one, contains an account of</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Original,</hi> and</p>
            <p>THE <hi>End</hi> of his Office and Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Original of it,</hi> that he is <hi>the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of God,</hi> which signifies he is, <hi>as such,</hi> to act only by <hi>his</hi> Authority, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from him, as V. 1. <hi>There is no Power but from God, and the Powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> Which also implies, that such Power is to be used <hi>for</hi> God. And that consequently God is to be the Ruler's <hi>first</hi> and <hi>last:</hi> And he is to be Subordinate to God, both as his <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>End.</hi> Acting by <hi>his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> he is by consequence to act <hi>for his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93192:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Interest.</hi> His <hi>Minister,</hi> or Servant is to serve him.</p>
            <p>BUT besides what is thus <hi>imply'd</hi> of the <hi>General and Vltimate End</hi> of the Magistrates Power, in what is more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly said of the Original of it; we have also a more explicit account of</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE End of it,</hi> viz. the <hi>next,</hi> and more particular End, which is twofold. The <hi>End for whom,</hi> indefinitely exprest. For <hi>thee, i. e.</hi> for every, or any one that lives under Government; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the whole governed Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For all the Parts make up the whole. And further we have</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE End for what,</hi> viz. for <hi>Good,</hi> the Good of each Individual, and of the whole Community, as comprehending all the Individuals. Thus we see what the Words contain <hi>absolutely considered,</hi> as they are an <hi>Assertion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. WE are to consider them <hi>relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> as they are <hi>an Argument.</hi> So the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, <hi>for,</hi> shews their <hi>Relation,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us backward, where we shall see <hi>what they argue.</hi> And we find they are brought in to enforce the Duty before enjoyn'd, which is twofold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:93192:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>PRIMARY,</hi> and more principal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CONSEQVENTIAL,</hi> deduced from the former.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE primary Duty is <hi>that</hi> V. 1. <hi>Let every Soul be subject to the higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> or to the Powers that are above us. Some blame the comparative Expression, <hi>sublimioribus,</hi> higher, for which there is no pretence, from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, that only signifies the Powers mention'd, to <hi>be over</hi> us, whether in an higher or lower degree. Let them be less or more above us, <hi>we are to be subject to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. THE Subsequent Duty is double,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT they <hi>are not to be resisted.</hi> A <hi>Doctrine</hi> which from the <hi>Terms of the Context</hi> is capable of being <hi>so stated,</hi> as neither to be just matter of Reproach or Scandal to the Wise and Good, nor of Sport and Laughter to another sort of Men. But that is not my present Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT <hi>they are not to be</hi> (unduly) <hi>dreaded,</hi> or apprehended <hi>as a Terrour, i.e.</hi> not otherwise, than (in the design of their appointment) they are so, <hi>viz.</hi> to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93192:6"/>
               <hi>Evil Works,</hi> and the Workers of them, <hi>not to the good,</hi> V. 3. A fear of Reverence is indeed due from all <hi>to their Character,</hi> and the <hi>Dignity of their Station:</hi> A <hi>filial</hi> fear, <hi>that</hi> of Children, for they are the <hi>Fathers of their Country</hi>; not a <hi>Servile,</hi> or <hi>that</hi> of Slaves, except from such as are so; <hi>Evil Doers,</hi> who are Slaves of the vilest and more ignoble sort; <hi>to their own Lusts,</hi> that inslave their Minds, which might otherwise enjoy the most Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Liberty, under the meanest and more oppressive <hi>external</hi> Servitude.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Text,</hi> according <hi>to its immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Reference,</hi> is but an amplification of the Reason alledg'd, Why the Magistrate is not to be look'd upon with Terrour and Affright, by any but such as resolve upon a profligately wicked course of Life, not by such as intend only a course of well-doing. <hi>For,</hi> if thou be such, <hi>he is the Minister of God to thee for good.</hi> His Sword is only formidable when it fetches its Blow from above, when it is <hi>bathed in Heaven,</hi> as we may borrow the words, <hi>Isa.</hi> 34.5. when it is weilded according to Divine Appointment, and <hi>God</hi> and <hi>he</hi> concur in the same stroak.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93192:6"/>
When it is otherwise, 'tis true that the Fallible or Unrighteous <hi>Humane Ruler,</hi> may for well doing afflict thee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in do thee wrong, but he can do thee no hurt, even tho the Stroak were Mortal, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4. for our Lord forbids the fear of what is no worse. So said <hi>Socrates</hi> of them that Persecuted him to Death, <hi>They can kill me, but cannot hurt me. Who is it that can harm you</hi> (saith a great <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) if ye be Followers of that which is good,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.13. And 'tis added, V. 14. <hi>If ye suffer for Righteousness sake, happy are ye</hi>â€”And hath any Man reason to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of being happy?</p>
            <p>BUT tho this be the more immediate reference of these words [<hi>He is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of God to thee for good</hi>] and is <hi>therefore</hi> [not to be <hi>unduly feared,</hi>] they do yet ultimately and more principally respect the <hi>grand Precept</hi> first laid down, of <hi>being subject to the Powers over us.</hi> Which is evident, for that <hi>upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ground,</hi> and the intervening Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which further illustrate it, this <hi>same Precept</hi> is resumed and prest upon <hi>Conscience,</hi> and a <hi>necessity</hi> is put upon it, on the same account, <hi>viz.</hi> that because the

Magistrate, <hi>is the Minister of God for good</hi>; and is to be a <hi>Terror to Evil-doers,</hi> and hath <hi>a Sword</hi> put into his Hands for that purpose, which he is not <hi>to bear in vain,</hi> but must be the Minister of God <hi>in this kind,</hi> viz. as a <hi>Revenger,</hi> to <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Wrath, upon such as do evil.</hi> That <hi>therefore</hi> we <hi>must needs</hi> be Subject, and that <hi>not only for Wrath,</hi> but also <hi>for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is therefore the <hi>principal relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of these words <hi>viz.</hi> as an <hi>Argument</hi> to prove that <hi>he,</hi> the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> is <hi>the Minister of God to us for good</hi>; that <hi>therefore</hi> we ought not only not to <hi>resist him,</hi> when he is doing his Duty, nor be <hi>afraid of him</hi> when we are but doing ours; but that we also ought <hi>to be subject to him</hi>; and that, not only that we may <hi>escape Wrath,</hi> but that we may <hi>satisfie Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is therefore the <hi>Relation,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording whereto we shall consider these words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>AS they are an Argument to inforce the required Subjection.</hi>

This without straining, carries the sense yet higher.</p>
            <p>AND whereas <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> is a word of known Military import, and signifies the Order of an Army formed for Battle, wherein every one knows his own Rank, Place and Station, 'tis as if it were said, Take

This was the just Claim and Demand of that excellent Prince, Psal. 94.16. <hi>Who will rise up for me against the Evil-doers, and stand up for me against the Workers of Iniquity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS according to <hi>Lexicographers</hi> of good note, is the import of that word, which we lay such weight upon, and accordingly very valuable <hi>Expositors</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this place.</p>
            <p>BY this time therefore you may see what Place and Order these Words I pitch'd upon have in the <hi>Series</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> Discourse; and thereupon what <hi>aspect</hi> they have upon the design for which we are met.

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:93192:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>THAT for this Reason, and under this Notion, as the Magistrate is to be a Terror to them that do evil, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God's Minister for good to them over whom he is set. It belongs to every Soul, or to all Persons under his Government, to be each one in his Station, and according to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, actively and with their own design, Subordinate and Subservient to him herein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN speaking to this I shall shew.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>THAT the Magistrate is God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, upon the mention'd account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>THAT therefore such Duty is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon all that live under Government.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> whereof is a <hi>Doctrinal Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi>; The <hi>other</hi> the <hi>Vse of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT the Magistrate is the Minister of God, for the Good of them over whom he is set. This we are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by parts.</p>
            <p>THAT 1. He is <hi>God's Minister.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of none can doubt, who doubt or deny
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93192:9"/>
not the <hi>Being</hi> of God. His being God's Minister signifies his deriving his Power from him. Who else can be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Power,</hi> but he who is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Being? 'Tis true, the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power</hi> hath not been always derived the <hi>same way</hi>; but it hath been always from the same Fountain. When God was pleased to have a People within a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar sort of inclosure, more especially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to himself, he was very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in signifying his Will concerning all <hi>Material Things</hi> that concern'd their <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT the <hi>Form of it</hi> should be.</p>
            <p>WHAT <hi>Persons</hi> should govern; or <hi>in what way</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern should descend and be convey'd to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WHAT Laws</hi> they should be govern'd by.</p>
            <p>WHAT <hi>the Methods</hi> should be <hi>of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning</hi> according to those <hi>Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>SINCE,</hi> it is very evident, much is left to the prudence of Men, always to be directed by general Rules of Equity, and, <hi>as these allow,</hi> by <hi>immediate Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> of his own Providence. I resolve
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93192:9"/>
this Discourse shall be involv'd in no Controversies; And therefore shall not determine, nor go about to dispute, as to what is so left, how much or how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that may be. But it is plain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable that the <hi>Governing Power</hi> he reserves and claims to himself, <hi>i. e.</hi> not to <hi>exercise</hi> it himself, immediately, <hi>in a Political way,</hi> but to <hi>communicate</hi> and transmit it to them that shall. So that in what way soever it is deriv'd to this or that Person, or under whatsoever form, <hi>the conferring of</hi> it he makes his <hi>own Act,</hi> as we find it said to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan. 2.37. <hi>The God of Heaven hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee a Kingdom.</hi> And he is told, c. 4.32. <hi>The most High ruleth in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of Men, and giveth them to whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND so much you see is in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text asserted to him over and over.</p>
            <p>TWO Things are plain in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT it is the Mind of God there should be such a thing as Magistracy and Government in this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND again, <hi>That Men shall be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Men; by some of other of themselves</hi>;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93192:10"/>
who shall be, as the Text <hi>speaks, God's Ministers.</hi> As <hi>he</hi> is <hi>the Original</hi> of the Governing Power, <hi>the Administration</hi> shall be <hi>in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND of the Mind of God in <hi>both these</hi> there is sufficient Indication <hi>by the very Law of Nature.</hi> How is it conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able such Sentiments should be so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, if they were not from a common Cause? He seems to me to have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd well <hi>if it be considered in what way the Course of Nature is now continued, and by whom all things consist,</hi> that makes the <hi>Governing Power</hi> to be <hi>from God,</hi>
               <note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Suar. de Leg. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>as the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> And that tho Government <hi>as it is such and such</hi> be <hi>juris humani,</hi> it is <hi>juris divini, absolutely consider'd,</hi> or <hi>as it is Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT was most apparently a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, when he Peopled this World with such a sort of Creatures <hi>as Man,</hi> to provide for the maintaining of common Order among them, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Government were but a <hi>Turba,</hi> a <hi>Colluvies,</hi> as a noted <hi>Heathen</hi> speaks on a different account, a <hi>Rout of Men.</hi> Had Man continued in unstained Innocency,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93192:10"/>
'tis concluded on all Hands there must have been a Government among them, <hi>i. e.</hi> not <hi>Punitive</hi> or <hi>Coercive</hi> for which there could have been no occasion, but directive, and conservative of <hi>Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Inferiority,</hi> as it is also even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Angels of Heaven,</hi> where are no inordinate Dispositions to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest. Much more is Government in the severer Parts of it, necessary for lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Man on Earth</hi>; the <hi>making</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictive Laws, and <hi>Governing</hi> by them. And,</p>
            <p>THAT God should design the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Men By Men, was also most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable <hi>to the Perfections of his Nature,</hi> especially his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and his <hi>Goodness,</hi> considered in Comparison to the <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this our present State.</hi> When the Government over <hi>Israel</hi> was a <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> God used the <hi>Ministry of Men</hi> in the Management of it.</p>
            <p>THAT it should be his ordinary sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Course to govern by <hi>Voices</hi> or <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or by frightful Appearances such as <hi>those on Mount</hi> Sinai, had been very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle suitable to this our State of Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as his accurate Wisdom we find hath
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93192:11"/>
determin'd. And was less agreeable to his <hi>Benignity</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> which would not amazingly <hi>terrifie,</hi> where he design'd more gently to <hi>admonish</hi> and <hi>instruct.</hi> Hence had he regard to their frailty who so passionately supplicated, <hi>Let not God speak to us lest we die.</hi> And this his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate goodness we are led to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being next to treat of the End of this his <hi>Constitution, viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT the <hi>Magistrate is God's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to Men for their Good.</hi> Next to the sweet <hi>Airs</hi> and <hi>Breathings</hi> of the Gospel it self, Where have we a kinder or more significant discovery of <hi>God's good Will to Men!</hi> Here we are <hi>to stay and wonder,</hi> not to <hi>Assent</hi> only but <hi>Admire!</hi> To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the World in a Revolt! The Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers on Earth in Arms against Heaven! And the Counsels that are taken above are <hi>how to do them good!</hi> How God-like is this! How suitable to magnificent Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! Or beneficent Greatness! Being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from hurt by their impotent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; and when Revenge was so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; to study not only not to Harm them; nor also how they might less harm and mischief themselves, but how
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93192:11"/>
to <hi>do them good!</hi> This was every way Great, and most suitable to the greatness of God, wherein it falls into Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with so immense and absolute Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as doth beyond what any Created Mind would <hi>ask or think.</hi> This imports not <hi>implacableness,</hi> or <hi>destructive Design</hi> towards the <hi>generality of Mankind,</hi> but great Benignity even <hi>to every Soul</hi> in as full extent as the Command runs <hi>to be subject to the higher Powers.</hi> This is we find <hi>another Medium</hi> by which God <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies,</hi> or <hi>leaves not himself without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> besides what we have elsewhere, <hi>that he gives Men Rain from Heaven and fruitful Seasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE most compassionate Eye of God beholds Men under the Power of vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inclination, bent upon destructive Ways; whereas by the course of Nature, which he hath fix't, he should give them ordinarily competent Time, as he hath given them Breath and Being and all Things, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. That they might <hi>seek after him and labour to feel and find him out</hi>; They live in a contemptuous neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of him, and are Cruel to themselves, oft shorten their own Time, live too fast,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93192:12"/>
and make too much haste to dig their own Graves, and turn their Habitation into a Charnel-house; yea even bury themselves alive in stupifying Sensuality and Vice, He though provok't hastens not their Destruction more, by sudden Revenge. He animadverts not upon them by Flames, and Thunderbolts, nor amazes them by astonishing appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. <hi>His Terrors make them not afraid.</hi> He only cloths some from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with his Authority, who shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the Stage with them, as <hi>Gods among Men,</hi> resembling themselves in humane Nature, and God in Power, as they should in other Godlike Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; if Men would so far co-operate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their own welfare as they ought; that by such gentler Methods some stop might be put to the Stream, and Flood of Miseries wherewith otherwise unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained Wickedness is continually ready to deluge the World.</p>
            <p>THE Magistrate is herein an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Good, and of <hi>Wrath</hi> at once. These two Things disagree not, to be <hi>a Minister for Good,</hi> and <hi>to execute Wrath.</hi> This <hi>latter</hi> is said in Conformity to vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93192:12"/>
Apprehension. Because when Men afflict one another, 'tis usually the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Wrath, when a <hi>fixt,</hi> though <hi>most sedate and calm Resolution to Punish,</hi> hath the <hi>same Effect,</hi> this <hi>most different Cause</hi> is call'd by the <hi>same Name.</hi> In this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion is <hi>Wrath</hi> ascrib'd to God, the most <hi>serene</hi> and <hi>dispassionate of all Beings.</hi> And hence, they who represent him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men <hi>in Authority,</hi> ought in this respect to be <hi>God-like</hi> too. <hi>Magistratus non debet irasci. Judges</hi> (as <hi>Cicero</hi> most aptly speaks) ought to be <hi>Legum similes, like the Laws themselves,</hi> which are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by no Passion, are angry with no Man, but keep one steady Tenor, so as neither to despite an Enemy, nor indulge a Friend. <hi>To this Temper</hi> it well agrees, to <hi>design good</hi> (as in lancing a Tumor) where one <hi>does a present Hurt.</hi> Two ways may Punishment be a proper and apt, tho it be not always an effectual means of <hi>doing good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. AS it may work <hi>the good</hi> of the <hi>Offenders</hi> themselves. To which it hath <hi>in it self,</hi> a tendency, if the Disease be not so strong and stubborn as to defie the Remedy. As it puts them upon refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93192:13"/>
and should awaken in them their considering Power.</p>
            <p>AS in the Matter of Treason against a Rightful Power, <hi>Deliberasse est desci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visse,</hi> to deliberate whether to be Loyal, or no, is to Revolt. So it is in the Just and Glorious Rupture that is to be made of the <hi>Bonds of Vice,</hi> whereby Men are held <hi>as Slaves</hi> under the <hi>Vsurped Power</hi> of the Devils Kingdom. If once they come duly to consider, they will disdain so vile a Servitude. When they meet with a <hi>Check</hi> in their way, it may occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to <hi>check themselves,</hi> and <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ways.</hi> No external means do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good to the Minds of Men otherwise than as they themselves are engag'd, drawn in and made Parties, in some sense, <hi>against,</hi> but (as we are compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in an higher and nobler sense) <hi>for</hi> our selves. <hi>This</hi> comes in, as <hi>one,</hi> among <hi>external Means</hi> of <hi>that kind,</hi> as do give <hi>some present Vneasiness,</hi> but in order <hi>to after Advantage.</hi> It <hi>afflicts</hi> 'tis true, and <hi>no Affliction is, for the present Joyous, but Grievous,</hi> but yields <hi>afterwards, a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fruit.</hi> When the Magistrates Power is call'd <hi>a Sword,</hi> it signifies its business is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93192:13"/>
               <hi>to wound</hi>; but as Wounds are <hi>generally painful, some</hi> are <hi>Sanative, healing Wounds,</hi> and so are <hi>these</hi> designed, and apt to be. They vex a while, but <hi>vexatio dat intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectum.</hi> It rouzes the Understanding, and is most apt to do so <hi>to good purpose,</hi> in plain and undisputed Cases; And where there is no pretence for Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Cause one suffers for.</p>
            <p>WHERE indeed a <hi>formed and fixed Judgment of Conscience,</hi> once hath place, for the practice which exposes a Man to suffering, Mulcts, and Prisons, Gibbets, and Faggots, are very improper means of Illumination; or of <hi>publick Vtility,</hi> if the <hi>Civil Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Substance of Religion</hi> be not hurt by such practice. And the Sincerity of that <hi>Conscience</hi> is much to be suspected, that is ever altered by such Methods. But no Man will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it is against his Conscience, <hi>not to be Drunk,</hi> not <hi>to Debauch,</hi> or to be <hi>Sober, Chaste</hi> and <hi>Vertuous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore a Man's Way lies open to that Consideration which is most imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to influence his Practice, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a lewd, and begin a regular good Course. He needs not be detain'd with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93192:14"/>
any subtle Disputes, or be put to solve perplext Doubts, or answer specious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Objections. It is obvious to him to bethink himself, <q>What a strange sort of anomalous Creature am I become; whom the <hi>Law of mine own Nature</hi> remonstrates against? How degenerate a thing! that have forsaken my <hi>own Noble Order of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Creatures, to herd with Brutes!</hi>
               </q> That have made my self unfit for <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society,</hi> otherwise than as one that must bear a Mark, wear a disgraceful <hi>Scar</hi> from the <hi>wound of a Sword,</hi> not that of a <hi>Publick Enemy,</hi> or my <hi>own,</hi> but a <hi>Sword</hi> drawn in defence of the Sacred <hi>Rights of God,</hi> and to vindicate the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Mankind!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND hereupon, if the Crime be not Capital, with the concurrent use of <hi>other appointed Means,</hi> and the <hi>Blessing of God</hi> upon all (from whence only the good Issue can be hoped for) may a vicious Person be so reclaimed, as to become of great Use in the World. Yea, and if the <hi>Crime be Capital,</hi> such as that the Criminal survives not the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Sword of Justice must cut
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93192:14"/>
him off from the Land of the Living; our Charity will not let us doubt but there have been Instances wherein a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>Arraignment,</hi> and the <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> have been the blest effectual means to the Offendors, of their escaping the more terrible Sentence, and of obtaining Eternal Life. But however, tho the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of Civil Justice</hi> doth often fail of its most desirable effects, <hi>as to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Persons</hi> that suffer it (as even the Ministration of the Gospel of Grace proves also ineffectual to many.)

IT is not only <hi>apt,</hi> but <hi>effectual</hi> to do much Good to others, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to the Community. <hi>Punishment</hi> is justly said <hi>To be in its proper Design Medicinal to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents: Yet not always in the event</hi> 
               <note n="*" rend="inter">Aquin. <hi>Sum.</hi> 1, 2<hi>dae. q.</hi> 87.</note>. But the <hi>Common Good,</hi> it may serve, when Contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Offendors perish under the deserved infliction of it. This was the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd by the <hi>Righteous Judge of all the Earth,</hi> when he gave so <hi>particular Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> how to punish Offendors in such and such kinds, that <hi>Others might hear and fear and do no more so wickedly.</hi> And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93192:15"/>
in all equal Government, 'tis the Design of Poenal Laws that <hi>The Terror might reach to all, the Punishment it self, but to a few.</hi> And when the utmost Endeavours that can be used, shall have had that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Success to reduce a <hi>vast number</hi> of Offenders to a <hi>Paucity,</hi> we should rejoyce to see that there needed to be but <hi>few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> made in such kinds.</p>
            <p>IN the mean time, where this <hi>Sword of the Lord,</hi> in the hands of His Ministers of Justice, is unsheathed, and used ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exigency of the Case, it is an apt and likely Means to have an Happy Effect for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, both as it</p>
            <p>MAY put a stop to the prevailing Wickedness of Men, and</p>
            <p>MAY avert from a Nation the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked Wrath of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. AS it may give some Check to the <hi>Daringness</hi> and <hi>Triumph</hi> of <hi>Vnrebuked Wickedness,</hi> which indeed, naturally carries in it a Pusillanimous Meanness, and a vile abjection of Mind, so as no where to insult, but where it meets, in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93192:15"/>
those who should oppose it, a timorous fainting and succumbency. It so far resembles the Devil, whose Off-spring it is, that <hi>being resisted it flees.</hi> When Men find that while they <hi>dare</hi> to affront the Universal Ruler, and offer Indignities to His Throne; there are those, that, cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with His Authority, and bearing His Character, <hi>dare</hi> to vindicate the Injury: When they feel the smart and cost of open Wickedness, it will, no doubt, become at least, less open, and seek clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser corners. <hi>They</hi> will not long hold up the head, in so hopeless and deplorate a Cause, that can afford them no support, no relief to their abject sinking Spirits, in suffering for it. What encouraging <hi>Testimony of Conscience</hi> can they have, that not only act from <hi>No Direction of Conscience,</hi> but in <hi>Defiance of it? What God</hi> can they hope, will reward their Sufferings which they incur <hi>by highest Contempt of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND if such <hi>gross Immoralities</hi> be somewhat generally Redrest, as more directly fall under the Magistrates Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion, how great a <hi>Common Good</hi> must it infer, inasmuch as <hi>those</hi> Evils, in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93192:16"/>
               <hi>their own nature,</hi> tend to the detriment, decay, and ruine of a People where they prevail?</p>
            <p>THEY darken the Glory of a <hi>Nation</hi> which how great a Lustre hath it cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the World, from the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Spartans,</hi> and other civilized People! when their <hi>Sumptuary,</hi> and other <hi>Laws,</hi> were strictly observed, that represt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Excesses; And when Temperance, Frugality, Industry, Justice, Fidelity, and consequently Fortitude and all other Vertues excell'd, and were conspicuous among them. It were a great thing we should have to transmit to Posterity, might we see <hi>England</hi> recover its former, or arrive to the further Glory which it is to be hoped it may acquire in these kinds!</p>
            <p>YEA and the <hi>Vices</hi> which are endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be redrest, are such as not only prejudice the <hi>Reputation,</hi> but the <hi>real Welfare</hi> of any Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PROFANE Swearing</hi> tends gradually to take away the Reverence of <hi>an Oath</hi>; which, where it is lost, what becomes of Humane Society?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:93192:16"/>AND <hi>more Sensual Vices,</hi> tend to make us an Effeminate Mean-spirited, a Desident, Lazy, Slothful, Unhealthful People, useless to the Glorious Prince, and excellent Government we live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, neither fit to endure the <hi>Hardships,</hi> or encounter the <hi>Hazards of War,</hi> nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our selves to the <hi>Business,</hi> or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the <hi>Labours</hi> that belong to a <hi>State of Peace,</hi> and do consequently tend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon us a deplorable, but unpitied <hi>Poverty</hi>; and (which all will pretend to abhor) <hi>Slavery</hi> at length. For they are most unfit for an Ingenuous, Free sort of Government, or to be otherwise go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned than as <hi>Slaves</hi> or <hi>Brutes</hi>; who have learnt nothing of <hi>Self-Government,</hi> and are at the next step of being <hi>Slaves to other Men,</hi> who have first made <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Slaves to their own Vitious Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Thus are <hi>such</hi> liable to all sorts of <hi>Temporal</hi> Calamities and Miseries in <hi>this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES, what is of so far more tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous import, that the same vile and stupifying Lusts, tend to infer an utter Indisposition to comport with, or attend to the Glorious Gospel of the Blessed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93192:17"/>
God, and so to ruine Mens hopes for the <hi>other World,</hi> and make their Case un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably worse, in the Judgment of the Great Day, than theirs of <hi>Tyre</hi> or <hi>Sidon, Sodom,</hi> or <hi>Gomorrha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT how much may a Just, Prudent, Well-tempered Vigilancy and Severity do, towards the prevention of all this? And so much the more, by how much Publick Animadversions, shall render the things Men incur Punishment for, not only in common Estimate, <hi>Vnrighteous,</hi> but <hi>Ignominious</hi> things.</p>
            <p>THAT Principle of <hi>Shame</hi> in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, if by proper Applications it were endeavoured to be wrought <hi>upon,</hi> would contribute more to the reforming a Vitious World, than most other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods that have ever been tried to that purpose. 'Tis a <hi>tender Passion,</hi> of quick, and most acute sense. Things that are thought Opprobrious, have so sensible a pungency with them, that (tho all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are not herein alike) many that can <hi>feel</hi> little else, reckon <hi>a Disgrace,</hi> an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable</hi> thing. And I little doubt but if Punishments for <hi>grosser Vices,</hi> were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93192:17"/>
more attempered to this Principle, they would have much more effect.</p>
            <p>THIS hath been too much apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Vsurping God of this World.</hi> This <hi>Engine</hi> he hath made it his business to turn, and manage to the contrary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to <hi>drive</hi> or <hi>keep</hi> serious <hi>Religion</hi> out of the World, yea to make Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd of being <hi>Sober, Temperate</hi> and <hi>Regular</hi> in their Conversation, lest they should also be thought <hi>Religious,</hi> and to have any thing of the Fear of God in them, and make them <hi>Debauch,</hi> to save their Reputation.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And so inseparable is the connexion between <hi>being Wicked</hi> and being <hi>Misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> that whatsoever molestation and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness tends to extinguish Dispositions to Wickedness, ought to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed given with very <hi>Merciful</hi> Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>IT is no improbable Discourse which an <hi>Ingenious Modern Writer,</hi> 
               <note n="*" rend="inter">Dr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say.</hi>
               </note> hath to this purpose, (for I pretend not to give his words, not having the Book now at hand) that tho the Drowning of the World was great Severity to them who did then Inhabit it, yet it was an act of Mercy to Mankind. For hereby (he reckon'd) the former more Luxuriant Fertility of the Earth, was so far reduc'd and check'd, as not, so spontaneously, to afford Nutriment to Vice; that Men in after time, must hereby be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to Labour and Industry, and made more considerate, and capable of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93192:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thoughts; and that when also they should find their time by this Change of the State of the World natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally contracted within narrower limits, they would be more awakened to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and mind any Overtures, should be, in following time, made to them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their attaining a better State in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World; and consequently the more susceptible of the Gospel, in the proper season thereof.</p>
            <p>IF God were severe with so merciful Intentions, what lies within the compass of <hi>these Ministers of his Justice,</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Common Good,</hi> ought certainly to be endeavoured; in imitation of him, whom they represent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Administration of <hi>Punitive Justice,</hi> when the Occasion requires it, tends also to the <hi>Common Good,</hi> as it may contribute towards the appeasing of God's Anger against a Sinful People, and the turning it away from them.</p>
            <p>WHAT may be collected from that Noble Instance of <hi>Phinehas</hi>'s Heroical Zeal, upon which a raging Plague was stay'd, compar'd with the Effect which <hi>Ahab</hi>'s <hi>Humiliation,</hi> and <hi>Nineveh</hi>'s <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>

had in averting Temporal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, would signifie not a little to this purpose.</p>
            <p>BUT I must pass to the </p>
            <p>
               <hi>SECOND Head of Discourse <hi>propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> viz. <hi>To</hi> argue and enforce from hence the Duty incumbent upon all, under Government, as their several Stations and Capacities can admit, to be, in due Subordination, assisting and serviceable to the Magistrate, as in executing Punitive Justice, <hi>he is the</hi> Minister of God for good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND this (as hath been said) is to be the <hi>Vse</hi> of the former part of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which will answer the Design of the Apostles Discourse, and agree to the natural Order of the Things discoursed in this Context. For [<hi>the Magistrate is the Minister of God for Good, to us</hi>] is a <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And [Let <hi>every Soul be subject or subordinate to him,</hi> accordingly] an <hi>Exhortation</hi> which was at first propos'd, and is afterward resumed and prest, V. 5. as of <hi>absolute necessity from that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:93192:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>WHEREFORE <hi>'tis necessary that we be,</hi> or <hi>we must needs be subject.</hi> There is an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> put upon it, a cogent inelucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Necessity,</hi> arising even from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> from this <hi>Doctrinal Assertion</hi> as it is propos'd, and as it is afterward applied to this Purpose, we are not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spens'd with in the Case, but we must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one do our parts, <hi>in Subordination to the Magistrate,</hi> and that not only <hi>for Wrath,</hi> but for <hi>Conscience sake.</hi> We shall therefore shew,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>WHAT Duty we who are in private Capacities are exhorted to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>SHEW the Strength of the Apostles Argument, as it is propos'd in the Text, and amplify'd in what follows, to engage us to that Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FIRST, For the Duty we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to, that we may understand what it is, I shall only premise some few plain things, and then leave it to your selves to judge, and conclude what it is, and cannot but be.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT is plain, <hi>private Persons</hi> are not to do the <hi>Magistrates part,</hi> are not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93192:20"/>
his Office, or usurp his Authority, they are to act but in Subordination to him, as their Charge given them plainly imports.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THEY are not only <hi>not to oppose him.</hi> As the <hi>former</hi> would be <hi>too much, this</hi> would be <hi>too little.</hi> The Arguments us'd to enforce it, import much more. What because he is the <hi>Minister of God for good,</hi> and <hi>to me,</hi> Am I therefore on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to oppose him? Can it be thought there should be such an <hi>apparatus</hi> of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to draw from it so faint and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute an Inference? Ought not every Man so far to reverence God's Authority as to endeavour it may not lose its design? And ought not <hi>every Man</hi> to co-operate to a <hi>Common Good,</hi> wherein <hi>each Man</hi> claims a part?</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is not only to save my self from Punishment, by not doing the Evil which would expose me to the stroke of the Sword. For <hi>my Duty,</hi> I am to do, not only for <hi>Wrath,</hi> but for <hi>Conscience</hi> sake, which plainly respects God and his <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> and <hi>Interest,</hi> which I am to <hi>Obey</hi> and <hi>Serve.</hi> And I am to endeavour not only that <hi>he may not be a Terrour to me,</hi> as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93192:20"/>
an Evil-doer, but that <hi>he may be a Terror</hi> to them that are such.</p>
            <p n="4">4. SOMEWHAT positive is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly carried in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, to <hi>subject or subordinate my self to</hi> him, under this very notion, <hi>as the Minister of God for good.</hi> Is this doing nothing?</p>
            <p>HE is plainly said to be the Minister of God for good, under this special No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>as he is the Administrator of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Justice,</hi> viz. as he bears the Sword, and is to be a Terrour <hi>to Evil-doers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I AM so to <hi>subordinate my self,</hi> as that <hi>herein</hi> he may effectually serve the End of his Office, and not <hi>bear the Sword in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW upon all this, judge you your selves what is it that is left to be my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a private Capacity, that is <hi>less than the Magistrates part; more</hi> than the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Negatives, and yet <hi>so much,</hi> as whereby I am to take care to my utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, that <hi>he</hi> may <hi>do good</hi> in his Office of punishing Wickedness? So as that <hi>his doing his Duty</hi> must some way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon <hi>my doing mine,</hi> and be the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of it, or of <hi>theirs</hi> who are in like
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93192:21"/>
Circumstances, and so but under the same common Obligation with me, so that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily his Duty cannot be done, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any care or concern of <hi>theirs</hi> or <hi>mine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT, I say, can it be less <hi>than to bring punishable Matters under his Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>OTHERWISE,</hi> if no Obligation lie upon private Persons, to this purpose, he will only be to punish such Wickedness as he beholds with his own Eyes. And then how narrow will his Precinct be? What Multitudes of Magistrates must there then be? And what a Monster thereupon would the <hi>Body Politick</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come!</p>
            <p>BUT here if any Man ask me the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion (because what is to be done herein is to be done for <hi>Conscience sake) am I bound in Conscience to discover to a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate all the Evil that I know by any Man that is justly punishable by Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO this I shall only at present say, That <hi>Cases of Conscience</hi> can only be with Judgment resolv'd <hi>in Hypothesi,</hi> and with application to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Person, when material Circumstances, relating thereto,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93192:21"/>
are distinctly known. I must have clear grounds if I will conceal such a Man's punishable Fault, upon which I may judge, that more good is likely to be done to his Soul, that the Honour of God and the Publick Good, will be more served by the <hi>Concealment,</hi> than by the <hi>Discovery,</hi> and the Government not hurt, or endangered.</p>
            <p>BUT if the <hi>Crime</hi> be such as is <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> and imports <hi>Contempt of God and his Laws,</hi> and in reference whereto, the Offender expresses more shame of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment than of the Fault, and I will yet, upon private Respects, to <hi>him</hi> or <hi>my self,</hi> conceal it, I shall herein while I pretend Conscience in the Case, <hi>cheat</hi> my Conscience and not <hi>satisfie</hi> it.</p>
            <p>AND I add in reference to this Case. Let any Man that would exempt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science from any sense of Obligation to endeavour the Punishment of Offenders in the mention'd kinds, take great care he do not ground his Concealment upon other, <hi>than very peculiar grounds,</hi> or <hi>not common</hi> to him, <hi>with any other Man in a like Case.</hi> Is it because such a one is my <hi>Friend?</hi> Or he may bear me a Grudge?
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93192:22"/>
Or I may lose his Custom, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> These are things so common, that guiding my self by such Measures, is both to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw <hi>Magistracy</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> too.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, therefore, what is ordinarily a private Man's Duty in such cases, is sufficiently evident.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, Let us see the force of the Apostles Arguings to engage us to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> as he is <hi>the Dispenser of Punitive Justice,</hi> is <hi>God's Minister.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Authority of God,</hi> that he is invested with. He <hi>hears a Sword,</hi> which God hath put into his Hand. Is that Authority to be eluded, and made to signifie nothing? Is that Sword to be born in vain? What an awe should this lay upon our Spirits? It is therefore to be serv'd <hi>for Conscience sake, which</hi> hath principal reference to God.</p>
            <p>WE need not here dispute whether <hi>Humane Laws bind Conscience.</hi> No doubt they do, when they have an antecedent Reason or Goodness. If Men command what God forbids, the Apostles make their appeal to <hi>Enemies</hi> as <hi>Judges whom
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93192:22"/>
they were to obey.</hi> He is the <hi>Minister</hi> of God <hi>for good,</hi> not for <hi>hurt,</hi> or for <hi>no good.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>perverting</hi> of God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to do mischief by the pretence of it, a <hi>debasing</hi> it, to trifle with it.</p>
            <p>BUT the Question is out of Doors, when Humane Laws are but Subsidiary to Divine, and enjoyn the same thing. And as that celebrated Saying of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> is applied by him to the former Case of a supposed Contradiction of <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consuls Command to the Emperor's</hi> for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying the Inferiour, 'tis <hi>equally appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,</hi> as fortifying the Obligation, <hi>to obey both,</hi> when they are <hi>co-incident.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND this Consideration can be insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant with none but such as say in their Hearts, There is <hi>no God,</hi> that think this World hath no <hi>Vniversal Sovereign Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> or <hi>no Lord</hi> over it; and it might as well be supposed to have <hi>no Intelligent Maker,</hi> to have become what it is <hi>by Chance.</hi> An Imagination which the most Vicious that make any use of Thoughts, begin to be asham'd of, and have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought fit to quit the absurd Name of <hi>Atheist,</hi> for the <hi>more accountable,</hi> as well as <hi>more convenient</hi> Name of <hi>Deist.</hi>

            <p>IF any of themselves had power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make such another sort of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and furnish him with Faculties ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of such Acquisitions and Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only to fetch a few Turns in the World, and form Plots and Projects in it, that must, with himself, shortly come to nothing; they would have little

cause to boast of the Performance: They would have cause to be asham'd of it. To use so <hi>unconceivable a Power,</hi> only to play Tricks, that neither themselves, nor any one else should ever be <hi>the better</hi> for! And tho they might, hereby, a while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse the World, they would gain little Reputation of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or <hi>Goodness</hi> above other Men, by being the Authors of so useless a Design, that would <hi>at length</hi> appear to have nothing of Design in it. For finally <hi>it terminates</hi> in mere <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the Great God hath not left himself <hi>without Witness.</hi> The Illustrious Characters of his Godhead shine every where. He doth insist upon, and will assert his <hi>Rights</hi> in this Lower World. 'Tis a part of his <hi>Creation,</hi> tho a meaner part. He <hi>Rules</hi> in the Kingdoms of Men, and he <hi>that Rules</hi> will <hi>Judge.</hi> The Jests and Laughter of Fools, will <hi>not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> his Throne. They that have <hi>taught themselves to turn</hi> his <hi>Laws,</hi> and the whole Frame of his <hi>Government</hi> over the World into Ridicule; because 'tis to be hoped <hi>they</hi> do not use to laugh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, should be advised <hi>by a Wise and

            <p>AND if his <hi>Throne</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> are as insolently as they are vainly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted against by many, and the most connive, we shall all be taken for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of Rebels against our Rightful Lord. It will be an <hi>heavy addition,</hi> to be <hi>partakers of other Mens sins,</hi> when every one hath more than enough of his own.</p>
            <p>LET me ask, Would you not dread to be found guilty of Misprision of Treason against the <hi>Government</hi> under which we live? Why doth the Fear of the great God? And the dread of being found Accomplices against him, <hi>signifie less</hi> with us?</p>
            <p>AND what means it, that the Charge of Punishing great Offenders is given to the Community <hi>thou,</hi> every individual, as in the Text, <hi>thee,</hi> all the individuals
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93192:24"/>

No, but that it was not to be supposed, that so horrid Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties could long escape unpunish'd, but <hi>by the Peoples,</hi> as well as the <hi>Magistrates, neglect,</hi> upon which <hi>all</hi> would be taken as <hi>Conspirators</hi> against the <hi>great Lord of all.</hi>

               <hi>but he is worthy of double Honour that prevents it. And he that assists the Magistrate in Punishing it, is most Honourable, and far excels all his other Citizens.</hi> So far were they from thinking it an Ignominious Thing, to bring Offenders to Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and especially for Impieties, or whatsoever signified a Contempt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:93192:25"/>
Shall we reckon the True and Living God to deserve from us, less regard to <hi>his Violated Honour?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Common Good,</hi> which in this way we are to promote, is <hi>so common,</hi> as all <hi>Good Men</hi> can, without scruple, concur in the design. And Blessed be God, they so generally do so.</p>
            <p>WE have the greatest Encouragement hereto by considering the <hi>Immediate Fountain</hi> of the Magistrates <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> our Glorious <hi>and ever Blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer and Lord,</hi> to whom <hi>all Power is given in Heaven and Earth, by whom Kings Reign, who is Head of all Things to the Church,</hi> and through whom, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goodness flows towards a <hi>lost World.</hi> This infers an Obligation upon all that bear the Christian Name, to serve the proper ends of <hi>this branch of his Power,</hi> as they have, in general, to acknowledge him <hi>for Lord and Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY who, therefore, make it their Business to promote this Design do not, <hi>herein,</hi> serve the Interest of <hi>a Party,</hi> but the Interest of the <hi>Vniversal Ruler,</hi> of <hi>our Blessed Redeemer,</hi> and of <hi>Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:93192:26"/>AND they who are agreed, with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere minds, upon so great and important an End, as the serving <hi>this most compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive Interest,</hi> are <hi>agreed</hi> in a greater Thing than they can <hi>differ</hi> in. To differ about a <hi>Ceremony</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> or a <hi>set of words,</hi> is but a Triffle, compar'd with being <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed</hi> in <hi>absolute devotedness</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and in a design, as far as in them lies, of <hi>doing good to all.</hi> An <hi>Agreement</hi> in <hi>Substantial Godliness and Christianity,</hi> in <hi>humility, meekness, self-denial,</hi> in <hi>single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of heart, benignity, charity, entire love to sincere Christians,</hi> as such, in universal love to Mankind, and in a design of doing all the good we can in the world, notwithstanding such go under <hi>different denominations,</hi> and <hi>do</hi> differ in so Minute Things, is the most <hi>Valuable Agreement</hi> that can be among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <p>THEY that are thus agreed, <hi>are more one,</hi> and <hi>do less differ</hi> in the Temper and Complexion of their minds, from one another, than they who are never so much <hi>agreed</hi> in being <hi>for</hi> or <hi>against</hi> this or that External <hi>form,</hi> or <hi>mode</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>; but are full of Envy, Wrath,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:93192:26"/>
Malice, Bitterness, Falshood, <hi>do differ from them all,</hi> and from <hi>all good Men.</hi> And I doubt not, when <hi>God</hi>'s time comes of <hi>Favouring</hi> Zion, we shall have <hi>Churches</hi> constituted by congregating what is of <hi>one kind,</hi> such as (for the main) are of <hi>one mind, spirit, character,</hi> and <hi>temper,</hi> and severing whatsoever is of a <hi>different kind,</hi> and quite alien hereto. And cease to have them constituted by <hi>what is unnecessary,</hi> much less by what is <hi>inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent</hi> with their very Being. <hi>Pride, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Vain glory,</hi> and a <hi>Terrene Spirit,</hi> with carnal <hi>Self-design,</hi> will not always prevent this. Heaven will grow too big for this Earth! And the <hi>Powers of the World to come,</hi> for those <hi>of this present evil World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN the mean time let us draw as near one another as we can. And particularly unite in the most Vigorous Endeavour of carrying on <hi>this Excellent Design,</hi> which is now before us. And let it be with a <hi>Temper of Mind,</hi> agreeing with <hi>God's kind design</hi> towards Men, in appointing the Magistrate <hi>to be his Minister to them,</hi> i. e. for the <hi>doing them good.</hi> Let it be with minds, <hi>full of all Goodness,</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the <hi>Original First Good,</hi> from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:93192:27"/>
whom, <hi>as such,</hi> this <hi>Constitution</hi> proceeds. Despond not, as apprehending <hi>the stream is too strong, and there is no good to be done.</hi> That is to yield the day to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Wickedness. It is to give <hi>Vice</hi> the <hi>Legislature,</hi> to let it be the <hi>Law of the Age,</hi> and govern the World: And it is to give up our selves and our Nation, to perish, as a lost People. <hi>Let us not be lost, before we are lost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MUCH <hi>Good</hi> hath been done in this kind heretofore.
