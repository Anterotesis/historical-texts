            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO A PAPER ENTITULED THE CASE Of the Proteſtant DISSENTERS Of <hi>IRELAND,</hi> In Reference to a BILL of Indulgence, Repreſented and Argued.</head>
            <p>THERE being a Paper lately Publiſh't, Intitul'd, <hi>The Caſe of the Proteſtant Diſſenters of</hi> Ireland, <hi>in Reference to a Bill of Indulgence, Repreſented, and Argued.</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that tho, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has truly <hi>Repreſented</hi> the Deſires of the Diſſenting Proteſtants among us, yet he has weakly <hi>Argued</hi> for the granting of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Deſires</hi> of the Diſſenting Proteſtants, he Compriſes in theſe Two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; Firſt, that <hi>by a Bill of Indulgence a full Security for the free Exerciſe of Religion according to their Conſciences may be given them.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That there be no ſuch Clauſes annex't to it, as may Diſable 'em from Serving their King, and their Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe <hi>Deſires,</hi> I believe there are few or none but will agree to ſecure to 'em by Law, the Free Exerciſe of their Religion, tho 'tis plain, the Authors Arguments do not evince the neceſſity of it, as may appear by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Conſideration of 'em. The firſt of which is this, That ſince <hi>our Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> conſiſts in the <hi>Number</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> this Bill will promote both, by <hi>drawing Proteſtant Diſſenters from abroad,</hi> and by <hi>Uniting</hi> thoſe at home, and by ſecuring their <hi>Affections</hi> to the <hi>Government,</hi> that grants 'em this <hi>Indulgence.</hi> Now to this, I anſwer:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That this Indulgence will tend rather to the multiplicity of Sects, than to the increaſe of the Number of Proteſtants, and will moſt ſucceſsfully promote thoſe very Deſigns, which our Author vainly imagins it the beſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to obſtruct; For a general Indulgence has always prov'd inſtrumental to the advancing the Popiſh Intereſt among us, and has therefore been vigorouſly promoted by Popiſh Emiſſaries in <hi>England,</hi> and that by expreſs Orders from their Superiors abroad, who have Experimentally found it to be the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual method of Introducing Popery into a Country, and have expended ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Conſiderable ſums of Money, for the purchaſe of Tolerations to Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>Before I reply to what is ſaid, concerning <hi>drawing over Proteſtant Diſſenters from abroad,</hi> by this <hi>Bill of Indulgence;</hi> I ſhall propoſe this Queſtion, whether the Granting Liberty of Conſcience, with the Sacramental Teſt, will not be as effectual to the Peopling of this Kingdom with Engliſh Conformiſts, as a general Toleration, without reſtrictive Clauſes to the planting of it with <hi>Scotch Diſſenters?</hi> But to return, I preſume by what the Author ſays, concerning
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38151:2"/>
               <hi>drawing over Proteſtant Diſſenters from abroad;</hi> he cannot mean Foreigners, becauſe he acknowledges them to be provided for, by an Act paſt the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in their Favour. He muſt therefore wholly, or more eſpecially deſign the Diſſenting Proteſtants of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Now in Reference to theſe, I leave it to the ſerious Conſideration of every judicious, and impartial Reader, Firſt, whether that Sect among 'em, whoſe violent Principles have unqualified 'em for Indulgence there ſhould be Tolerated here? Can we Reaſonably expect, that thoſe who are ſo Turbulent in their own Countrey, ſhou'd be quiet in ours? Or that by their being Tranſplanted into another Soil, and by a kind and <hi>Indulgent</hi> Cultivation of them, we may <hi>gather Figs</hi> off this ſharpeſt ſort of <hi>Thiſtles?</hi> Secondly, whether the Free and Publick exerciſe of Religion ſhould be <hi>Indulg'd</hi> to others of them, who have publickly Declar'd our Church Government to be Antichriſtian, and have ſolemnly ſworn to Extirpate Prelacy? Thirdly, whether thoſe that are the moſt moderate among 'em, can with Reaſon expect, but that <hi>with the ſame meaſure they have Meted to their Brethren,</hi> the Epiſcopal Clergy in their own Countrey, <hi>it ſhould be meaſur'd to them again,</hi> when they come to ſettle in this Kingdom? So that if any <hi>Indulgence</hi> be granted, 'tis purely the Reſult of our own Charitable Inclinations, and a plain Evidence to the World, that our juſt Reſentments of their Severity to others, has not Alienated our affections from them.</p>
            <p>Neither will this <hi>Indulgence</hi> probably tend to the <hi>Uniting</hi> of Proteſtants at home, as is too fully prov'd by Experience in <hi>England;</hi> where the preſent To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration has not had that good effect; neither can we in Reaſon expect it ſhould be more Succeſsful here; for if it equally extend to all Parties and Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Proteſtant Diſſenters, their mutual jealouſies of one another, and their Reſpective endeavours to propagate their Opinions, and to promote their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Intereſts, will naturally create great Heats and Animoſities; but if the benefit of the <hi>Indulgence</hi> be unequally diſtributed, it will be ſo far from being a means of ſupporting, that it will conſiderably weaken the Government by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging all, but thoſe that are particularly Encourag'd, and Careſs'd by it.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, as <hi>this Indulgence is not Neceſſary for the common Proteſtant Intereſt in this Kingdom;</hi> ſo neither is it ſo <hi>highly reaſonable,</hi> as the Author pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, as may appear, by a particular Conſideration of the Arguments he makes uſe of to prove it. For firſt, as <hi>the early Zeal of the Diſſenters, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of this Government, may Intitle 'em to its Protection,</hi> ſo it can't be deny'd but that they have enjoy'd it ever ſince the Revolution, and have Receiv'd more than ordinary marks of Royal Favour, partly by the free Liberty that is granted 'em throughout the Kingdom, for the publick Exerciſe of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and for the Building of Meeting Houſes, even in Corporate Towns; as alſo by his Majeſties bounty, in allowing Yearly hitherto a conſiderable Sum for the maintenance of their Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there ſeems to be more than ordinary Reaſon to make an Act in behalf of Foreign Proteſtants, becauſe they are found by experience to have more favourable Thoughts of; and more forward Inclinations to our Church-Government and Worſhip, than others have. And beſides, 'tis Obſervable, that the free Exerciſe of Religion, which was granted 'em by the late Act, was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue but for ſeven Years, in which time it was ſuppos'd they might Learn our Language, and be Inſtructed in the Principles and Worſhip of the Eſtabliſh't Church, and 'twas with good Reaſon hop't that after the Expiration of that Term. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ey would declare themſelves Members of our Communion. And I'me credibly Inform'd, that of Eleven Congregations of Foreign Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>London,</hi> there are Nine Conformiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:38151:2"/>
Thirdly, The Papiſts are not in equal circumſtances of publick Favour with our Diſſenting Brethren; for as the Liberty they have in the Exerciſe of their Religion, was extorted from the Government, by the preſſing neceſſity of publick Affairs, ſo it is not confirm'd to them by any Act of Parliament, as this Indulgence is expected, and I ſuppoſe, deſign'd to be to the Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>And Fourthly, the experience that our Diſſenting Brethren have had of our Tenderneſs towards them heretofore, is a ſufficient Argument and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to 'em of our future Kindneſs; for we conſider our mutual Agreement in the ſame Articles of Faith, and are glad this Author is pleas'd to declare, That the ſuppreſſing of Proteſtant Diſſenters, by the ſtrict execution of Penal Laws, is <hi>a Practice that has a juſt Odium left upon it;</hi> but are ſorry, That <hi>the juſt Odium left upon it</hi> among us, ſhould be wholly confin'd to us, and that this Practice ſhould have no Cenſure, nor Reflection caſt upon it among our Neighbours: And 'tis ſtrange, that the Author ſhould ſay, that there is ſo <hi>apparent a contrariety in it, to the mild and merciful Genius of our Holy Religion,</hi> ſeeing he can't but know the time when it was an avow'd Doctrine, and a General Practice among the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independants,</hi> to bar the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the Free Exerciſe of Divine Worſhip ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Conſciences: And 'tis as ſtrange, that this Practice ſhould be <hi>ſo apparently contrary to our Holy Religion,</hi> and have ſo <hi>miſchievous Effects upon the publick Peace</hi> here in this Kingdom, and yet be thought ſo great an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a truly Chriſtian Zeal, and ſo effectual an Inſtrument of publick Good in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and how poſſibly can our Author <hi>hope, That all Proteſtants are in this Point come to a better Temper, than to gratifie their Enemies by Ruining their Brethren,</hi> when there is ſo plain a Demonſtration of the contrary; unleſs he be of Opinion, that what is accounted a Warm and Sanguine Temper of Religion there, is to be eſteem'd the raging Heat of a <hi>malignant</hi> Feavor here.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, as concerning the eſtabliſhing Toleration by a Law; the Reaſon why ſome may be againſt it, is not (as our Author do's invidiouſly inſinuate) that they wait for <hi>a more favourable opportunity of Reviving the former Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> but that they may ſtill have it in their Power to ſhew their Tenderneſs to their Diſſenting Brethren, and may prevent, or repreſs the miſdemeanors that ſome Nonconformiſts may poſſibly be Guilty of, if they had a Legal Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as alſo, that they may ſecure the Eſtabliſhed Religion they profeſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dangerous Conſequences they fear from a General Indulgence.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, as to what he ſays concerning His Majeſties Declaration, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire this Author to conſider more ſeriouſly, whether there be not ſome others in the Three Kingdoms beſides the Proteſtant Diſſenters of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to whom <hi>One great end of His Majeſties Declaration is yet unaccompliſh'd)</hi> and whether there be <hi>a Law made to cover</hi> the Proteſtant Epiſcopal Clergy in <hi>Scotland, from Perſecution on the Account of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which it may plainly be perceiv'd, That 'tis not by force of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Arguments for the Neceſſity, or Reaſonableneſs of Toleration, but pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in compliance to the importunate Deſires of our Diſſenting Brethren, that the Members of the Eſtabliſh'd Church are inclin'd to grant 'em a General and Legal Indulgence, as Parents do often humour their Children, in giving 'em thoſe things they eagerly deſire, which tho' pleaſant to their Pallates, are yet many times prejudicial to their Health,</p>
            <p>And now, I proceed to the Second Deſire of the Proteſtant Diſſenters, which is, <hi>That there may be no ſuch Clauſes annext to this Bill, as would diſable 'em from ſerving their King and their Country;</hi> which in plain terms is no more than this; That whereas the Eaſe to Tender Conſciences was the only thing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38151:3"/>
they formerly deſir'd; they now Claim it as their due, to be admitted alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Honourable and Profitable Employments, and without theſe, whatever Eaſe may be given to their Conſciences, 'tis to be fear'd they will have no quiet in their Minds.</p>
            <p>But let us hear our Authors Auguments for granting this Bill of Indulgence, without a Sacramental Teſt annext. Firſt he tells us, That <hi>the Sacrament Teſt in</hi> England <hi>was chiefly deſign'd againſt Papiſts,</hi> but 'tis alſo plain, it was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters too; for tho' none but the former be mention'd in the Title, yet the latter are included in the Body of the Act; and if the Zeal of the Engliſh Diſſenters againſt Popery in the late times has not exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them from a Sacramental Teſt; our Diſſenting Brethren in this Kingdom, cannot with Modeſty expect, that their late Services ſhould Intitle them to any ſuch Immunities.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He tells us <hi>ſuch a Teſt for diſabling Proteſtant Diſſenters for any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service, is againſt the common Proteſtant Intereſt of</hi> Ireland. <hi>Our Circumſtances indeed vaſtly differ,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>from thoſe of</hi> England, for here the Eſtabliſhed Church is more in Danger than there, by the Proteſtant Diſſenters, as well as by <hi>the common Enemy:</hi> In <hi>England</hi> one unmixt People does compoſe the main body of the Nation, which continues ſtill the ſame; but here we are made up of ſeveral Nations, and there is a daily Acceſſion of great Numbers from a Neighbouring Country, of whom the meaner ſort, are generally of a different Communion from the Eſtabliſh'd Church. Tho' the Nobility and Gentry, (to their great praiſe be it ſpoken) are generaly Conformiſts. 'Tis poſſible inded, as he Obſerves That <hi>the Iriſh may be more Numerous, if there ſhould be a General Peace,</hi> and I may add, That 'tis highly probable, that the Papiſts will grow much more Numerous, if there ſhould be a <hi>General Indulgence;</hi> and therefore, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our Authors Opinion, we cannot think it Reaſonable <hi>to give the Proteſtant Intereſt a wider Baſſis</hi> here, than it has in <hi>Holland</hi> (which is a Place of greateſt Liberty in Matters of Religion) where all Proteſtants are not equally capable of Employments without Religious Teſts. As to what he ſays, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Danger of a future Rebellion, we hope, that by the late Acts of Parliament made againſt the Papiſts, and the diligence of the Magiſtrates in putting them in Execution, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> may be diſabled for any New Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; or if we ſhould fall into the ſame unhappy Circumſtances that we have been lately in, we have Reaſon to believe, Notwithſtanding the Authors diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious Repreſentation of the Temper of the Diſſenters (wherein he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, that the excluding them from publick Offices, would incline 'em in future Dangers to deſert the publick Service (the foreboding of which ſeems equivalent to an Advice to them, and a Menace to us) Notwithſtanding this, I ſay, we have Reaſon to believe, that the Conſideration of the common Safety, and their Gratitude for their Indulgence, which they now expect, would engage 'em to ſhew an <hi>equal Zeal</hi> to what they did before, tho' they ſhould not be wholly on <hi>equal Terms</hi> with us, ſince they could not reaſonably hope for ſo kind a Treatment from the Papiſts, as they have had from us,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To what the Author ſays, to prove, That <hi>it does not ſeem agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Judgment of the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>that any ſuch Teſt ſhould be impos'd here;</hi> I anſwer, That as the Subſtituting <hi>the New Oaths,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration or <hi>Teſt againſt Popery</hi> inſtead of the Oath of Supremacy did not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal the Statute that enjoyns the Sacrament Teſt in <hi>England;</hi> ſo neither can it with the leaſt ſhadow of Reaſon be alledged, That the Engliſh Act for the Abrogating the Oath of Supremacy in <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. ought to be conſtrued as intended, to prevent the impoſing of it here, in caſe a General Indulgence ſhould be Granted to the Proteſtant Diſſenters in this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:38151:3"/>
Fourthly, To the firſt Argument produc'd by the Author, to prove <hi>a Sacrament Teſt to be as unreaſonable as 'tis dangerous;</hi> Viz. <hi>That it will put the Proteſtant Diſſenters into worſe Circumſtances, than they are in at preſent;</hi> I may with great Juſtice and Reaſon, Reply, that whatever <hi>hardſhips</hi> the Diſſenters may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, they ſhould be under by thoſe Reſtrictions; I am ſure the Members of the Eſtabliſh'd Church would be in far <hi>worſe Circumſtances than they now are in,</hi> if an Indulgence ſhould be Granted without thoſe <hi>Clauſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, 'Tis too Notorious to be denied, That the Conformiſts at <hi>Sligo,</hi> and <hi>Crum,</hi> at <hi>Inniskillen</hi> and <hi>Derry,</hi> did appear at leaſt as early, and Act as Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly for this Government as the Diſſenters; and conſequently the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts will have Reaſon to think themſelves ſeverely dealt with, if no other way can be found of Rewarding the Services of the former, without the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent hazarding the moſt valuable Rights of the latter, by Granting the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters ſuch an Indulgence, and by admitting them into ſuch Offices as may give 'em Power and Opportunity to alter the whole Frame of the preſent Church Government.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As to what is ſaid concerning <hi>the Sacraments not being a fit Teſt of Admiſſion into Offices;</hi> I obſerve, Firſt, that the Arguments he makes uſe of in this matter, are much the ſame with thoſe that were urg'd in the late Reign, for the taking off the Penal Laws and Teſt. Secondly, I anſwer more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly. That by this Sacramental Teſt, we do not proſtitute that Holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution <hi>to mean</hi> and <hi>worldly Purpoſes,</hi> as our Author inſinuates; but Religion being the great Band of Humane Society, 'tis highly Reaſonable, that thoſe Perſons ſhould be Rewarded, as well as Intruſted with Employments in the State that give the greateſt Evidences of their Piety to Almighty God; And if this Argument of our Authors be valid, 'twill not only conclude againſt this but all other <hi>Religious Teſts;</hi> and then the moſt Scandalous Neglects of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Duties, muſt not be accounted a ſufficient Bar to an <hi>Admiſſion</hi> into the moſt conſiderable <hi>Offices,</hi> for fear of <hi>Proſtituting</hi> the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Divine Worſhip, and of <hi>Driving</hi> Unworthy Perſons to a participation of thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Myſteries; And if, as our Author ſays, the <hi>Intereſt of Religion is very little concerned</hi> in the <hi>Poſture of Receiving the Holy Sacrament;</hi> why ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſon ſeperate from the Communion of the Eſtabliſh'd Church, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that which our Author is pleas'd to call a <hi>Trivial Matter,</hi> and a <hi>Trifle:</hi> But if any Man refuſe to give the State ſo <hi>Trivial</hi> and inconſiderable a Mark of his Complyance to its <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Injunctions:</hi> There is no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſuch an one ſhould be intruſted with the Management of the <hi>Civil and Military Offices,</hi> or that they ſhould be eſteemed ſuch <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Perſons,</hi> that it ſhould be thought the Intereſt of the <hi>Government to comprehend 'em.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Caſe that our Author puts of <hi>a Man endued with Eminent Wiſdom; Integrity,</hi> &amp;c. is ſcarcely to be be ſuppos'd; for no Man ſurely, that deſerves that Character, will unqualifie himſelf to ſerve his King, his Countrey, and his Temporal Intereſt too, by refuſing to Receive the Holy Sacrament in ſuch a Poſture, which our Author acknowledges, is <hi>more expreſſive of our Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to our Saviour,</hi> than that which is in Uſe among the Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>However, as a Reward to thoſe that have been more than ordinarily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their Services to His Majeſty, and are now in any Civil, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Employment, it may perhaps be thought convenient, that Perſons ſo Qualified, may be excepted as Nominees, and hold their Offices, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Refuſal of the Sacramental Teſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:38151:4"/>
Laſtly, whereas our Author ſays, that the <hi>Eſtabliſh't Church will be no way indanger'd by the Indulgence</hi> he is pleading for, I anſwer that tho' the Honours and Revenues of the Clergy are now ſecur'd to 'em, yet we cannot foreſee the Difficulties the Conforming Clergy may poſſibly conteſt with, in aſſerting the Rites of the Church, if Nonconformiſts were Qualified for Civil Offices; and beſides, we are far leſs concern'd for the ſecurity of our Temporal Intereſt, than for the Eſtabliſhment of our Antient, Holy and Peaceable Religion.</p>
            <p>I am far from detracting from the good Services which the Diſſenters did the King and the Nation, in being joynt Inſtruments with the Conformiſts in the Preſervation of <hi>Derry</hi> and <hi>Inniskillin;</hi> nor would I exclude 'em from <hi>a Capacity of concurring to preſerve their Country again.</hi> But as in the late Troubles common Safety, and the publick Intereſt of the Nation did oblige 'em to take up Arms, ſo if a like juncture ſhould happen, (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) they may be in the ſame Circumſtances to ſerve their King and Country as before, tho' they be not Legally qualified for Offices, by a General and Unlimited Indulgence.</p>
            <p>As to the Authors Commendations of the Peaceable Temper of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters of this Kingdom, it is to be Obſerved, That they have not had the ſame opportunities of diſcovering their <hi>unpeaceable Turbulency towards their Neighbours,</hi> as their Brethren in <hi>Scotland</hi> at preſent have, or of <hi>expreſſing their Diſſatisfaction to the Government,</hi> as both they and the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> have formerly had; but if ever they ſhould be in the like Circumſtances here, we have no great Reaſon to expect much more favourable Uſage, nor the Government a more Dutiful Obedience from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good Nature and common Prudence</hi> will indeed direct us to provide for our own <hi>Security,</hi> by condeſcending to all the Reaſonable Requeſts of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting <hi>Friends;</hi> but no Motives ought to prevail on us, to make ſuch Large Conceſſions to them, as will in all probability ſhake the very Foundations of the Eſtabliſh'd Church.</p>
