            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THese Commodities being then but Newly brought into Use in our Nation, the Parliament laid the Tax not upon the
Commodities, but upon the Liquors made from those Commodities.</p>
            <p>When this came to be put in Practice, the Inconveniences appeared: Diligent and Exact <hi>Gageings</hi> were found to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable.</p>
            <p>The places were so many, and the Quantities of Liquors in most places so small, that the Revenue was scarce worth
the charge of constant Attendances, and keeping true Accounts.</p>
            <p>So that no way was left, but making Compositions, whereby either the KING was wronged, or the Subjects grieved,
and all along many of the <hi>Retailers</hi> hath been forced to leave off their Trades (being over-rated.)</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>It is humbly Proposed, that this Excise be Changed into a new Impost.</head>
               <head type="sub">Let the Impost be these:</head>
               <p>UPon a Pound of <hi>Coffee, Ten Pence;</hi> upon a Pound of <hi>Tea, Five Shillings;</hi> upon a Pound of <hi>Chacolet, One Shilling Six
Pence;</hi> upon a Pound of <hi>Cocao-Nut, One Shilling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Pound of <hi>Coffee</hi> will make <hi>Four</hi> Gallons of Liquor; which by the Statutes of <hi>Excise,</hi> must pay <hi>Two Shillings Eight Pence;</hi>
the <hi>Impost</hi> is but <hi>Ten Pence per</hi> Pound weight.</p>
               <p>A Pound of <hi>Tea</hi> will make <hi>Sixteen</hi> Gallons of Liquor; which at <hi>Sixteen Pence per</hi> Gallon <hi>Excise,</hi> is <hi>One Pound One Shilling
Four Pence;</hi> the <hi>Impost</hi> to be <hi>Five Shillings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Pound of <hi>Chacholet</hi> makes <hi>Four</hi> Gallons of Liquor; which at <hi>Sixteen Pence per</hi> Gallon, for the <hi>Excise,</hi> is <hi>Five Shillings
Four Pence;</hi> the <hi>Impost</hi> to be <hi>One Shilling Six Pence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Pound of <hi>Cocao-Nut</hi> makes near <hi>Two</hi> Pound of <hi>Chacholet,</hi> and the <hi>Impost</hi> upon the <hi>Nut,</hi> is to be <hi>One Shilling per</hi> Pound
weight.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>By thus Changing the Excise into an Impost:</head>
               <p>1. The Charge of managment will be saved, being Collected by the Officers of the <hi>Custom-House,</hi> as the small Imposts
upon the same Commodities now is.</p>
               <p>2. The KING cannot be wronged, nor the <hi>Retailers:</hi> For no Man can Pay for more or less than what he really makes
use of.</p>
               <p>3. The Revenue to the KING will be greater, tho' the <hi>Impost</hi> be less than the <hi>Excise:</hi> (this arises from the Charge, Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
and Inequality of mannaging of the <hi>Excise.</hi>)</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Retailers will have sufficient Gain as appears by the following Computation.</head>
                  <p>1. One <hi>Ounce</hi> of <hi>Coffee-powder</hi> makes one <hi>Quart</hi> of Liquor, four <hi>Ounces</hi> makes one <hi>Gallon,</hi> and one <hi>Pound</hi> weight makes
four <hi>Gallons,</hi> which by the <hi>Statute</hi> ought to Pay <hi>two Shillings Eight Pence;</hi> for which is proposed but <hi>Ten Pence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Admit <hi>Coffee-powder</hi> to be worth <hi>Two Shillings Six Pence</hi> per <hi>Pound</hi> weight (which is the top-Price) the adding
<hi>Ten Pence</hi> per <hi>Pound,</hi> makes <hi>Three Shillings Four Pence,</hi> to the <hi>Retailer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. For one <hi>Quarter</hi> of a <hi>Pint</hi> is paid one <hi>Penny;</hi> to one <hi>Quart</hi> is <hi>Eight Dishes,</hi> which is <hi>Eight Pence;</hi> and one <hi>Gallon</hi> is
<hi>Thirty two Dishes,</hi> which is <hi>Two Shillings Eight Pence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. By which it appears that one Pound of <hi>Coffee</hi> at <hi>Three Shillings Four Pence,</hi> makes four <hi>Gallons</hi> of Liquor, which
amounts to <hi>Ten Shillings Eight Pence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Therefore the <hi>Retailer</hi> hath no Reason to complain; for that the profit out of every <hi>Pound</hi> of <hi>Coffee</hi> by him used, is
clear <hi>Seven Shillings Four Pence;</hi> and in <hi>Chacolet</hi> and <hi>Tea,</hi> the same proportion, or rather more.</p>
