            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>IS the greateſt and chiefeſt aim <hi>(Madam)</hi> of moſt men, ſtill to chuſe out the Higheſt, Lovelieſt, and Faireſt Objects as may beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with their Intentions; thus the Pious and Devout are in a perpetual contemplation of Heaven, thinking that the fitteſt place about which they can or ought to buſie their Religious thoughts, the Glories of the one running in a juſt Parallel with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations of the other: Now pardon me <hi>(Madam)</hi> if the Divine Perfections Providence has beſtowod upon You, have made me thus boldly aſpire to Dedicate this Poem to Your Grace, as being the only Perſon with whoſe Nature ſuch Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Hiſtory beſt accords; and I muſt needs alledg too, Your Grace deſerves the Name of Beautiful, and that not only for the Excellent Proportion and Lineaments of Body, as for the Intrinſick Perfections of Your Mind, and Vertues of Your Soul, which are ſo ſweetly joyn'd, that You may juſtly Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, to Your ſelf, the Title of a viſible Divinity: But my greateſt fear is, leſt while I addreſs my ſelf to Your Grace, like a miſtaken Zealot, I ſhould approach the true Deity with a wrong Worſhip.—What was ſaid of <hi>Greece</hi> may be now confirm'd here, <hi>That all their Beauties there could make</hi>

Had Your Grace liv'd in the Old World, You would not only have made an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe that were ſav'd in the Ark, but even have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Deſtruction of the Whole: For ſo pious and ſincere, ſo importunate are all Your Devotions, as what was ſpoke by the two Angels to <hi>Lot,</hi> would have been ſaid to You, That they could not be deſtroy'd ſo long as You was there. Or, like <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> Your Grace muſt have been forc'd to have left the Confines of this World, and in a Cloud of Incenſe flown to Heav'n: Nor need we doubt, but, like her, (being a Star on Earth) You would have made as bright a Conſtellation there. So ſweet and affable is all Your Converſation, ſo univerſal is Your Charity and Bounty, and ſo Charming are Your Smiles, that all who know You muſt admire You, and bleſs themſelves that You are now alive, though in an Age almoſt as bad as that. As it was the general Cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> to preſent their firſt Fruits to Heav'n; ſo I hope Your Grace will pardon this Ambition in me, for laying this my Firſt-born fancy on your Altar, for without Your Protection, I may doubt the

Inſolence of a Cenſorious Age. But ſo long as Your Seraphick Form guards the door of the Ark, I need not fear what the malice of a Hell of Criticks can do againſt it: but rather am aſſur'd by Your Patronage, to view it ſafely ſayling through all their Storms to the happy Mount, where when they are all ſecurely Landed, I ſhall not think them more happy than I am in ſubſcribing my ſelf,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE chiefeſt motive I have in writing this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, is, not that I have any affectation to ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but to excuſe the permiſſion of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Copies of Commendation of my Friends; to whom I muſt ſay as the Orator ſaid to <hi>Q. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius Hortenſius,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Verres,</hi> That let them take which ſide they will, they are ſure to make it the beſt, for by their ingenuity they are able to cauſe that which is deform'd and ugly, to become fair and beautiful; and when I reflect upon my own imperfections (I ingenuouſly confeſs) I even bluſh to read them, and it would be the higheſt arrogance in the World to acknowledg their Character; like a young coy Maiden, I for a time held out their ſuit, but their importunities were ſuch, I, like them, at laſt gave my conſent: And leſt that any ſhould Tax me with Ambition in the Publication of the Poem, I ſhall anſwer in Mr. <hi>Drey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> Words, <hi>That it is impoſſible almoſt for any Writer to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without it.</hi> And make the worſt of it, as one pleaſantly defines it, it is but a gallant madneſs; and though I do acknowledg it, 'tis only in the Abſtract: For I ſhall not, like <hi>Aeſops</hi> Frog, ſwell till I burſt, or like <hi>Lucians Evangelus</hi> pipe ſo long till I fall down dead; nay, this paſſion is ſo predominant, that even the Beaſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are brought within the Liſt; the Hound in catching of the Hare from his fellow; the Hawk in pouncing of his Prey; and the Horſe in running of his Race. Theſe Examples being conſider'd, I am ſo far from judging it a fault, that I think it almoſt a ſin to be without it; then why ſhould man, that Lordly Creature, be aſham'd to acknowledg it, and eſpecially Poets, who are ſomething above the vulgar; nay, ſo much above them, that they are a medium betwixt God and Man:
<pb facs="tcp:99326:7"/>
For as <hi>Plato</hi> ſays—<hi>Non poſſunt canere priuſquam Deo ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>—i. e. Before they are moved with a Divine rapture.</p>
            <p>But here let me make a ſmall digreſſion, for I do not ſpeak this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to my ſelf, but to the Almighty <hi>Apollo's</hi> of the laſt, and this preſent Age; for I might ſleep as many years in <hi>Parnaſſus</hi>'s Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as <hi>Endymion</hi> did in the Cave, before I ſhould reach that Name, though <hi>Heſiod</hi> and <hi>Ennius</hi> are reported, but by one nights ſleeping therein, to become Poets, and the laſt, in his ſleep, fanci'd he receiv'd into his Body <hi>Homers</hi> Soul, and thereupon writ in imitation of him: But how like they were to his, <hi>Horace</hi> excellently well deſcribes.—</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Ennius, &amp; ſapiens, &amp; fortis, &amp; alter Homerus,</l>
               <l>Ut Critici dicunt, leviter curare videtur</l>
               <l>Quo promiſſa cadunt, &amp; ſomnia <hi>Pythagorea.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>But conſidering this preſent Age, and the troubleſome times therein, what ſmall advantage, reward, or reputation can be gained thereby, there would be but ſmall contending for the Bays; ſince too, <hi>Apollo</hi> and the Muſes, who have a long time liv'd in Tranquillity, may, we know not how ſoon, be baniſh'd by the God of War, and ſo be forc'd to throw away the Pen, and like that Worthy <hi>Hero,</hi> of late Memory, <hi>Montroſs</hi> (whoſe Name wants an Epithete) be forc'd to write with the point of the Sword, but I hope not in ſuch a Language as his:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Great, Good and Juſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Though we may ſay with</hi> Martial.</l>
               <l>Frange leves Calamos, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <p>As for the Nature of the Poem, which is Holy, though intermixt with Spirits, yet I have not herein trod in an unknown path, but ſhall procure Authority for what I do; though Doctor Brown declares, In the multiplicity of Writing, Subjects ſo often diſcours'd, confine the imagination, and fix our conceptions unto the Notions of fore-writers, and though it may be allow'd with him, that bye and barren Themes are beſt fitted for invention, yet that does not in the leaſt excuſe imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for Mr. <hi>Dreydon's State of Innocency and Fall of Man,</hi> is of the ſame Nature with this, from whoſe incomparable Piece I drew this rugged draught; and <hi>Milton's Paradiſe Loſt</hi> is full of
<pb facs="tcp:99326:7"/>
the ſame Adornments: Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> too in his <hi>Divine Davideis,</hi> is ſo far from being exempted from the ſame, that he makes them to be the chiefeſt ornaments of his Poem, in which he does not only cauſe the Devil to make a Speech, but even God himſelf, and brings <hi>David</hi> ſinging a Love Song to his Lyre under <hi>Michols</hi> Window, with ſave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral the like imbelliſhments, which are no more to be found fault with, than the Stars for ſpangling Heaven. I ſhall defend but very little of what I have writ, either in vindication of words or phraſes or figures, though it is an eaſie thing to turn Prophet in this caſe, and anticipate Critical Obſervations: For this only reaſon, being I have had but few, and thoſe friends, that have paſs'd their judgments of it, (though I account them the beſt that find moſt faults) yet do what one can, their cenſures will be favourable.</p>
            <p>I muſt deſire the Reader to take notice of theſe few things, that when he meets with any irregular, or as it may ſeem careleſs Lines, that they were not over-ſights; and likewiſe in compariſons, where the thing is compar'd to things that never were: So a Friend finds fault with this Line—<hi>And ſhrink like Parchment in the Fire.</hi>—becauſe, ſays he, there was no ſuch thing as Parchment in the World at that time. Whether there was or no, I ſhall not here diſpute, though without doubt there were many excellent Arts that periſh'd in the Flood, which ſince, by the ingenuity of Man, and accidents, have been renewed: He might likewiſe have as well found fault with theſe, As the word <hi>Hermite, Gally-ſlave,</hi> the compariſon of the Vineyard betwixt <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and many more, which laſt muſt be counted as a Prolepſis, though in truth Wine might be before the Flood, for in the fifth Act I follow the bare Hiſtory of the Scripture, and make him igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the operation of Wine, and <hi>Satan</hi> himſelf to teach the Art, though without doubt drunkenneſs was one of the main ſins of that Age, which brought the Deluge, and that too with Wine; yet however I ſhall authoriſe it by a few Examples: Thus Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi> in his <hi>Fall of Man,</hi> makes <hi>Lucifer</hi> compare his Legions, that lay proſtrate on the Lake, to ſcatter'd Leaves in Autumn.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>———See on the Lake,</l>
               <l>Our Troops, like ſcatter'd leaves in Autumn lie.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>When it is to be ſuppos'd the World was not created, or without doubt no Autumn, ſo that in this caſe (where they make that which ought to
<pb facs="tcp:99326:8"/>

            <p>whereas the <hi>Corinthian</hi> braſs was of much later date. So <hi>v. 622, 659, 660.</hi> and indeed the whole Chorus of the third Act is full of ſuch Anticipations, ſo that many good Criticks reject a great part of it as ſuppoſititious.</p>
            <p>So in the firſt Scene of <hi>Plautus</hi>'s <hi>Amphitryo,</hi> we meet <hi>Soſia</hi> affraid of the <hi>Tres Viri Nocturni,</hi> who with their <hi>Octo Homines,</hi> (mentioned there) were a ſort of Officers at <hi>Rome.</hi> as our Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Watch with us: So <hi>v. 149.</hi> He quibbles upon <hi>Quintus</hi> a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Name, and <hi>v. 252.</hi> He ſwears by <hi>Hercules</hi> before he is born or hardly got; beſides, that thoſe Slaviſh Names, <hi>Soſia</hi> and <hi>Davus,</hi> were younger by many hundred years than <hi>Amphitryo.</hi> Theſe, I hope, are vindications enough for <hi>Anachroniſms;</hi> as for <hi>Hyperboles</hi> I ſhall only ſpeak this, that the bolder they are ſo much the better, and he ſhall gain far more reputation that ſoars high though in danger, than he that follows that plodding Advice; <hi>Medio tutiſſimus,</hi> &amp;c.—</p>
            <p>And though like the <hi>Camelion</hi> they can put on almoſt all colours whatſoever, yet they ſhall never hit the White. And <hi>Horace</hi> does as good as incourage this way of Writing, when he ſays,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Ubi plura nitent in carmine, non ego paucis</l>
               <l>Offendor maculis.—</l>
            </lg>
            <p>for the extravagancy of theſe Figures, as <hi>Hyperboles, Metaphors, Catachreſes,</hi> &amp;c. are certainly the faults he means, as well as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene Lines and overſights in Poems.</p>
            <p>That it may find ſome excuſe for its faults, I ſhall, as ſeveral of our Moderns before me, (whom I believe ſpeak truth) declare the time in which the greateſt part was writ, for I do faithfully proteſt, that the firſt three parts were thought and writ in leſſer time than a week, but being diſappointed by the Printer, (for it ſhould have come out near a Twelve-month ago) I ſince have made a few alterations in it;
<pb facs="tcp:99326:9"/>
the fourth was writ at leiſure times that I ſtole from company; with which I did intend to have ended, being it was ſo full a period: But was perſwaded more for the Number-ſake than the Subject, to add the fifth, for I really thought (as indeed it was) I undertook to build a <hi>Babel,</hi> and conceiv'd it almoſt impoſſible to raiſe ſo many Lines upon ſo ſmall a Foundation, eſpecially to Lake it o're with any gloſs agreeing with <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race.</hi>

                     <l>For Heav'n, againſt the World, proclaims no War.</l>
