            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Ntrue reportes and ſclaunders can neither giue falſehoode any credite among the wiſe, nor diſgrace the due eſtimation of the trueth. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, it ſeemeth there are ſome, which hope it will turne them to no ſmall aduauntage, if to other their ſecrete and wicked practiſes, they ioyne a ſleyght of ill ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king &amp; of ſclaundering the writings, the godly ſayings, the life and the death of thoſe, whome it hath pleaſed God to vſe to the ſetting forth of his Goſpel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to the great comfort of his people.</p>
            <p>Among others, vpon whom this hath bene practiſed, they haue made ſome eſpeciall choice of the late <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Salisburie,</hi> a man of famous memorie, whoſe life and death is truely and ſyncerely written by <hi>M. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour Humfrey.</hi> Howſoeuer they dealt vncharitably with him in his life, Chriſtian and godly diſcretion would they ſhould ſpare to reproche the dead. Or, if not ſo, yet
<pb facs="tcp:8193:3"/>
in wiſedome they might foreſee, that when matters are called to tryall, ſuch things cannot paſſe for currant &amp; lawfull, wherof ſome due proofe hath not bene yeelded.</p>
            <p>Yet, as though the diſcredit of that one man (who in great humilitie did acknowledge himſelfe inferiour to many godly fathers then liuing in this Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) were ynough for them to ouerthrowe all that whole worke, which the Almightie God hath by his right hand and ſtrong arme eſtabliſhed: they deliuer by tradition certaine falſe obſeruations, of his either ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or negligent, or wilfull and malicious gathering, and abuſing the holy Scriptures of God, and the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writings of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>It is a harde thing for him that ſpeaketh much, to ſpeake nothing worthy iuſt reprehenſion. But it is much harder to eſcape the reprehenſion of corrupt Iudges, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen when he ſhal ſpeake moſt vprightly. His defence is abroade, publiſhed by himſelfe. And, notwithſtanding the endeuour of a learned aduerſarie was to empeache it: yet by his laſt and a moderate anſwere, he auouched it good, and approued his plaine and ſyncere dealing to the conſciences of all men.</p>
            <p>Whom it may pleaſe to vnderſtande, after what ſort he prepared himſelfe to the accompliſhment of thoſe two notable bookes, of the defence of the Apologie, and the Replie, which are as two double Canons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the battery of errour and ſuperſtition, muſt needes confeſſe his diligence, and reuerent procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in ſuch cauſe, to haue bene ſuch, as for which he may well be compared with any, whomſoeuer the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or this preſent age, hath thought therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie commendation. For, beſides his aduiſed obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ſuch things, as in the aduerſaries bookes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued anſwere: and, beſides that he diſpoſed a ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and full collection of ſuch matter, as he would vſe for the diſproofe of the ſame, the which he conceiued in ſhort notes: this may be a notable teſtimonie, that
<pb facs="tcp:8193:3"/>
he had purpoſe to ſet downe the aucthorities out of the Fathers, and the quotations, truely and playnely: whereas in times before, hee had gathered ſundrie bookes of common places out of the Greeke, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and later writers, he did peruſe a freſh the authors themſelues, and made euery where in them ſpeciall markes, for the difference of ſuch places, whereofhee made choyce. Thoſe were all drawen forth, and layde to their themes by certeine ſcholers, who wrote them out by ſuch direction, as he had giuen vnto them. So re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent regard had he to do the worke of the Lord, and to defend the trueth faithfully.</p>
            <p>With like reuerence alſo did he in all places where he was occaſioned to preach, handle the word of God. Albeit his giftes of reading, and vnderſtanding, &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie were great, yet it appeareth he did ſeldome, or neuer deliuer any expoſition vpon any peece of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, before any Congregation in the meaneſt pariſh of the countrie, but vpon diligent ſtudie, and whereof he drewe his notes. In this his care, Gods prouidence wrought mercifully for his Church, that ſo there might be ſome way to deliuer in common vnto all, the fruites of thoſe godly trauailes, which he gaue forth to ſome one eſpeciall part of the Church. Hereby it is, that theſe his Sermons preached before her Maieſtie, and at Paules croſſe, come nowe to the reading of all ſuch, before whome they were once ſpoken: to ſeeke that of them in true practiſe of Chriſtian religion, for which they were in their times vttered. Why I make choyce of theſe, among ſo many, ſo excellent his ſermons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in thoſe places, if any be curious to aske, let him aduiſedly conſider the ſtate of Gods Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs in theſe dayes, and beſtowe his paynes to reade theſe, which are offered to his Chriſtian iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and then make to himſelfe a charitable anſwere. And if at ſuch ſeuerall times as that reuerende father, in the feare of God, moued his petitions before the
<pb facs="tcp:8193:4"/>
conſcience either of her highneſſe, or of your honors, or of any others, the good children and ſeruantes of God, he were ſo well acquitted, that he was thought to ſpeake vprightly in true zeale, for the aduauncement of Gods glorie, and like a wiſe buylder of the houſe of God: no doubt, in this rehearſall of them altogether, they ſhall worke that wholſome effect, if through the aſſiſtance of Gods holy ſpirite, they be conſidered now with as great diligence, as hee was then heard with good attention.</p>
            <p>Your honours haue wel declared, that you meaſured not your louing affection to him by the ſhort terme of his life: which giueth great hope that his humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtes, ſo many as are to craue ayde and furtherance of aucthoritie, ſhall in good time be preferred. They are ſuch, as ſhew how deſirous he was to ſee the peace and proſperitie of Ieruſalem, and that the kingdome of God might neuer againe be taken away from vs. He ſheweth what thinges they are, by which this may bee brought to paſſe: that among all the meanes which mans wiſedome can prouide, next to the high meanes of princely authoritie, the chiefeſt is, that all particular Churches may bee furniſhed with ſufficient, learned, and godly Miniſters: and therefore that tender &amp; due care be had, to encreaſe the nomber of them. Their ſeruice is moſt needeful in the ouerthrowe of Iericho, the citie which God will haue deſtroyed: and in the buylding vp vnto God his Temple at Ieruſalem. The care which Magiſtrates take hereof, and that laborers may be ſent into the Lordes harueſt, which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende the cauſe of Chriſt againſt thoſe which charge the Goſpel to be hereſie, and that the things which he hath done for vs, are wrought by the power of Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub: and which as good watchmen attending their warde, may ſtirre vp the people to knowe the ſeaſon, that the night is paſſed, and the day is come, that it is time to caſt away the workes of darkeneſſe, and to put
<pb facs="tcp:8193:4"/>
on the armour of light: ſhall witneſſe for them, what zeale they beare to the houſe of God. If the miniſters be mindefull to perfourme their duetie: if the Lordes harueſt be not neglected: if the defence for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel finde vpright Iudges: if all that giue outward ſhew of zeale be in deede zealous, and worke the fruites of zeale: what hope may they of Iericho haue, that their curſed dwellings ſhal ſtand? or why ſhall Iſrael miſtruſt that the Temple of God ſhall not receiue againe the former and perfect beautie?</p>
            <p>Nowe, becauſe euery where in theſe ſermons hee commendeth the neceſſary vſe of godly learning, and is an humble ſuter for patronage thereof: I can not but preſent them vnto your honours, our patrones, and fathers, &amp; right honourable Chauncelours of both the Vniuerſities: that ſeeing the benefite of this your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious protection, hath, and doeth, and ſhall reache it ſelfe ſo farre, to do ſo much good to the whole Church of God: you may at home and with your ſelues reioyce in the comfort of a good conſcience, for the manifold fruites of your fauour beſtowed in ſuch ſort, and all that haue the loue of the trueth, may earneſtly praye vnto God for your honours, that he will continue his goodneſſe towardes you, and giue you long and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous dayes in this life, and after, a ioyfull enterance into his glorie.</p>

               <hi>none other goddes before my face, thou ſhalt make thee no grauen image &amp;c.</hi> Theſe are playne woordes: theſe are the woordes which our Lord GOD hath ſpoken. Some tymes he expreſſed his holy will, not in words, or viſions, or in ſuch ſort as I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but onely by ſome myſticall or ſecret Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory, by ſome deede which the people ſawe done before their eyes: of which kynd is this which we haue now to conſider. Therefore <note place="margin">Eſai. 5.</note> hath God ſayde by the Prophet, <hi>What coulde I haue done any more to my vineyard, that I haue not done vnto it? What ſhoulde I doe, but it hath byn done? What ſhoulde I ſay, but it hath been ſayde? what war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhoulde I giue, but it hath byn giuen? I haue byn carefull for my people, that they ſhoulde repent and turne to me, that all Iſrael ſhoulde be ſaued. If they periſh, I am free from their deſtruction they periſhe in their owne wilfulneſſe, they haue none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now touching an Allegory, whereof we
<pb facs="tcp:8193:7"/>
are at this preſent to ſay: God opened his minde ſometimes not by wordes, but by ſome notable kinde of deede: and the people heard GOD ſpeak vnto them not with their eares, but with their eyes. The people of Iſrael as they were paſſing through the wilderneſſe, lacked water to drinke, and were like to periſhe, there ſtood a mighty great Rocke of harde ſtone whiche Moſes ſmote with his rodde, it opened and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out a great ſtreame of water, the whole people dranke of it, and was refreſhed: the ſame people being likewiſe in the ſame wilderneſſe vtterly voyde of bread, and all other ſubſtenance, was like to famiſh, God ſent them <hi>Manna</hi> from heauen aboue, they gathered it, they ground it, and they ate of it: it was ſweet and delicate, and full of comfort.</p>
            <p>This was an Allegorie, that is to ſay, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and myſticall kinde of vtterance. For, by this <hi>Manna,</hi> and by this Rocke, the people was ledde to vnderſtand and thinke on that bread and that water that ſhould come from heauen. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Rocke was Chriſt:</hi> his ſide was clouen, his blood iſſued out, it is a water ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <note place="margin">

                  </gap>. Cor. 10.</note> vp into euerlaſting life, we drink of it, and liue for euer.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe that <hi>Manna</hi> was the bodie of Chriſt, the people did eate of it, and liued by it. Chriſt had not yet taken vppon him a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:8193:7"/>
bodye, yet they did eate his bodie: he had not yet ſhedde his blood, yet they dranke his blood. <hi>Saint Paule</hi> ſaith, <hi>all did eate the ſame</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> 
               <hi>ſpirituall meate,</hi> that is, the body of Chriſt: <hi>and all did drinke of the ſame ſpirituall drinke:</hi> that is, the blood of Chriſt, and that as verily and as truely as we doe nowe, and who ſo euer then did ſo eate Chriſt, liued for euer, not becauſe the rocke was turned into his fleſh, or the water into his blood: it was an Allegory, as al other Sacramentes be: the people hereby was taught to conſider of other things.</p>
            <p>When the people was ſtrong with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentes in the wilderneſſe, and were ſwollen, and heaued vp, and periſhed in the wilderneſſe without hope of cure, <hi>Moſes</hi> erected vp a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſerpent vppon a pole: the people beheld it, their anguiſh abated, their ſwelling ſlaked, and they were healed: Chriſt was this ſerpent, he was lifted vpon the croſſe, who ſo truſteth in him ſhal neuer be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>In certaine of their ſacrifices they had a Lambe, they ſtickte him, they killed him, and made ſacrifice of him, this Lambe was Chriſt the Sonne of GOD, he was killed, ſtickt, and made a ſweete ſmelling Sacrifice for our ſinnes. Of him ſayeth God himſelfe, <hi>This is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> 
               <hi>my beloued Sonne in whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8193:8"/>
Of him ſaith <hi>Iohn, Beholde the Lambe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ihon. 1.</note> 
               <hi>of God, which taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi> Of him <hi>Saint Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>among men there is none other name giuen vnder</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Actes. 4.</note> 
               <hi>heauen, whereby we muſt be ſaued.</hi> In his righteouſneſſe onely we are receyued as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, his blood clenſeth vs from all ſinne, there is no other ſacrifice wherewith we may be reconciled to GOD our heauenly Father: all theſe were Allegories, that is to ſay, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reſemblaunces and ſignifications of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete matters. That ſtriking of the Rocke, that feeding vppon <hi>Manna,</hi> that lifting vp of the Serpent, that killing of the Lambe, were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne myſticall kinds of ſpeaking. And let no man thinke theſe things are impertinent or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the purpoſe: they are incident vnto the matter, and grow neceſſarily of the things we haue to ſpeake of.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ioſuah</hi> that noble and worthy Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne by Gods ſpeciall conducte had paſt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the water of Iorden, and taken poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Lande of Canaan, a Land flowing with mylke and hony, there to plant the people of Iſrael according to the promiſes that GOD had made them: the Citizens of <hi>Hiericho</hi> that ſtoode in the frontiers of the Countrey, rampyred their wall, and placed their artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and appoynted them ſelues to reſiſt him,
<pb facs="tcp:8193:8"/>
and to withſtand his force. To aſſault this City, Ioſuah practiſed a ſtraunge kynd of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. He commaunded that the Arke of Gods Maieſty ſhoulde be carried reuerently about the Walles ſeuen dayes together, and that the whole hoſte in armour ſhoulde goe before it: that after them ſhoulde followe ſeuen Prieſtes with ſeuen Trumpets: that all the reſt of the people ſhoulde followe after the Arke: and that thus they ſhould doe euery day once. The ſeuenth day he encreaſed their labour, and bade them to goe about ſeuen times in like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The people within laughed them to ſcorne to ſee their folly. At the ſeuenth and laſt turne, Ioſuah commaunded them all to make a ſhowte. Straight way after ſo long ſilence, they lifted vp their voyces, and ſhowted with a greate ſhowte, ſo many hundred thouſands of men, women, and children: the Trumpets blewe in euery corner, the whole Heauen and earth was ful of their noyſe, and the Wall fell downe flat.</p>
            <p>Here let vs conſider, and glorifie the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God: there was neyther mine, nor ramme, nor other engine, nor warlike force, nor world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pollicy practiſed: onely at this roare and ſounde of Trumpets, and voyces of men, the rampyers were broken, the walles fell downe,
<pb facs="tcp:8193:9"/>
and ſunke, and were made euen with the grounde: the Souldiers went ouer and ſlewe without mercy, man, woman, and child, and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and whatſoeuer creature they found before them, they fired the citie, and conſumed it, and burnt it to aſhes.</p>
            <p>Then Ioſhua ſware at that time, ſaying, Curſed be the man before the Lorde, whoſoeuer hence foorth ſhall take in hande to reſtore this City of <hi>Hiericho:</hi> let him lay the foundation thereof in the death of his eldeſt ſonne, and in the death of his youngeſt childe let him cloſe vp and finiſhe the gates: let him neuer more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the fruite of his bodie, but let him liue as a manne accurſed in the middes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: let his name and memorie, and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity periſh with him: this was the tenure of Ioſhuas curſe.</p>
            <p>Sixe hundred yeeres after in the time of the wicked King <hi>Achab,</hi> one <hi>Hiel</hi> (hauing <note place="margin">1. King. 16.</note> no regarde to this curſe) ſet vppon to reſtore <hi>Hiericho:</hi> and it came to paſſe euen as it was foreſaide by Ioſhua, Gods curſe fell vppon him, he buryed his eldeſt ſonne, bee huryed his youngeſt ſonne, hee was left without comforte euen as a man that the Lorde had curſed: for Gods will was that <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo:</hi> ſhoulde lye waſte, and deſolate for euer,
<pb facs="tcp:8193:9"/>
as an euerlaſting remembraunce of his wrath, that all people ſhould feare to withſtand his wil. This is the plaine ſtory onely, according to the letter.</p>
            <p>But as touching the <hi>Allegorie,</hi> or the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which therein lyeth couered, it hath a farre deeper meaning. This <hi>Hiericho</hi> whereof the ſtory ſpeaketh, was a citie in <hi>Canaan,</hi> in a lowe, ſowre, barren ground, in the middeſt of a rotten <note place="margin">2. King. 2</note> and peſtilent water, by reaſon whereof before the ſame water was cured by the Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus,</hi> the men that dranke thereof died of ſundry diſeaſes, &amp; the women alſo became vnfruitfull. This citie withſtoode the people of God, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to keepe them from their inheritaunce that God had giuen them.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Hiericho</hi> of whiche we haue nowe to conſider, is a ſpirituall power of darkneſſe, that reſteth onely in fleſh, and in worldy promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that withſtandeth Gods people, and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth itſelfe againſt God. For euen in this life, as there is a <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſo is there a <hi>Hiericho:</hi> as truth hath her houſe, ſo is there alſo a houſe wherein falſhoode and errour dwelleth. As there is a glory of the light, ſo is there a power of darkeneſſe. This <hi>Hiericho</hi> of falſehood and darkeneſſe God ouerthroweth when it ſeemeth good in his ſight, with the breath of his mouth, and with the blaſt of his holy woorde hee doeth
<pb facs="tcp:8193:10"/>
ouerthrow it, and whoſoeuer wil ſeek to reſtore it, ſhalbe accurſed.</p>
            <p>Three things therfore I haue thought good by Gods ſufferance to treate of.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 Firſt, how high this <hi>Hiericho</hi> is built, and how ſtrongly it is fenced, and yet how eaſily it is ouerthrowen.</item>
               <item>2 How vainely, and how miſerably they looſe their labour, that ſeeke by any meanes to reſtore it.</item>
               <item>3 What good remedies may be deuiſed, that this <hi>Hiericho</hi> be not reſtored againe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Whatſoeuer my ſimple learning or vttera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhalbe, yet I doubt not, but the very bare conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration hereof, of it ſelfe, vnto the godly muſt needs be comfortable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They that goe down to the ſea in ſhippes, and occupy by the great waters, they ſee the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 107.</note> 
               <hi>works of the lord, &amp; his wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders in the deep.</hi> For God is maruelous in the ſurges and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtes of the Sea: he is marueilous in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heauen: but much more marueilous is he in the ſurges and ſtormy Tempeſtes of his Church. Here may we beholde the worke of his hands. This is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhop of his power, of his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, of his light, and truth, and righteouſneſſe, and patience, and mercy. Here may we ſee the children of light, and the children of darkneſſe: the veſſels of honour, and the veſſels of ſhame:
<pb facs="tcp:8193:10"/>
the aſſaultes of falſhood, and the glory and victory of truth. Here ſhall we ſee how God leadeth euen into Hell, and yet bringeth ſafely backe: how he killeth, and yet reuiueth: howe he refuſeth the full, and feedeth the hungrye: howe he is the ruine of many, and the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many. Here may we ſee the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wayes, and the vnſearcheable iudgments of GOD. It is a place full of terrour, and a place full of all comfort. In reſpect hereof the Prophete <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>O Lorde, our Lorde, how wonderful is thy name in al the world?</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 8.</note> Againe he ſaith, <hi>One thing haue I deſired of the Lord, that I wil require, that I may dwel</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 27.</note> 
               <hi>in the houſe of the Lorde al the daies of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lorde, and to viſit his Temple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hiericho</hi> was a mighty ſtrong Towne, wel manned, well victualed, well walled, well fenced: and in affiaunce thereof it withſtood the whole power of Gods army. <hi>Ioſuah</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he had great force of armed men) du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the aſſaulte, ſuffered no man to vſe his weapon: hee willed them all to walke quietly, and ſilent, without doyng violence: his ſtrength was not in the number and courage of men, but onely in the Arke, that is in the preſence and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God.</p>
            <p>Thus it fareth oftentimes in ſpirituall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fares:
<pb facs="tcp:8193:11"/>
falſehood is armed, &amp; truth goeth naked: falſehood maketh outcries, and trueth ſaith title: falſehood is bold, and truth is outfaced. Blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it ſelfe naturally is hardy and ventrous: and falſehoode is wyly and ſhifting. When the high prieſtes &amp; captaines of the temple, &amp; the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers were come to lay handes on Chriſt, he ſaid vnto them, <hi>This is your very houre, and the power of darkneſſe.</hi> Their hearts were darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> their eyes were blynded, they ſaw not their wayes, they knewe not their daungers, they would not vnderſtand, they woulde not be taught: malice and frowardnes had made them blinde, therefore the feare of God was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes. Herein ſtoode their power, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were bolde, and ſayde, <hi>Let vs breake their bandes, and caſt their cordes from vs,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.</note> Therefore they ſayde, <hi>Wee will not haue this man to raigne ouer vs.</hi> Therefore they ſayde, <note place="margin">Luke 19.</note> 
               <hi>The word that thou haſt ſpoken to vs in the name of the Lorde, we will not heare it of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ierc. 44.</note> 
               <hi>thee.</hi> Thus cryed they, becauſe of the blindnes which was in them, and becauſe of the folly of their hearts.</p>
            <p>Yet is there no ſouldier ſo ſtoute in defence of <hi>Hiericho,</hi> as hee that thinketh his cauſe is good, and that his doing pleaſeth God well, and therefore is moued thereto in conſcience. None ſo deſperate and wilfull for the falſehoode and
<pb facs="tcp:8193:11"/>
darkenes of <hi>Hiericho,</hi> as ſuch who haue zeale without knowledge, as are blinde, and followe their blinde guides: who when they ſlaunder, or perſecute, or kill others for righteouſneſſe ſake, thinke they make a ſacrifice vnto God, and that GOD is highly pleaſed with their doing. Such were they that cryed againſt Chriſt, <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iohn 19. Matth. 26.</note>

               <hi>what they do.</hi> They know not me, they knowe not whence I come, nor who it is that ſent me, they take light for darkeneſſe, and darkneſſe for light. Therefore the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Leane not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prou. 3.</note> 
               <hi>vnto thine own wiſdom, do not the thinges that ſeem right in thine own eies. There is a</hi>

               <hi>way which ſeemeth right to a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues therof are the waies of death.</hi> It ſeemeth Catholique, it ſeemeth holy, but the ende thereof leadeth to death. <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſaith of the Jewes. <hi>If</hi>

            <p>But <hi>Hiericho</hi> is not onely thus fenſed with blinde zeale and wilfull ignoraunce: but alſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
<pb facs="tcp:8193:12"/>
hath helpe of mans ſtrength, and the fauour and ſuccour of worldly power. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had mighty Chariots, ſtraked and barred with yron, in the ſtrength whereof they put their truſt. The people of <hi>Babylon</hi> built themſelues a Tower as high as the Heauens, to ſhew forth their pryde, and get themſelues a name.

            <p>Now to ſpeak of the third help, of the power of Princes, whom the wicked builders of this ſpirituall <hi>Hiericho</hi> haue in all ages deceiued.

            <p>The Heathen and Infidels vſed this helpe againſt the Chriſtians, they accuſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before
<pb facs="tcp:8193:20"/>
Kinges that they were wicked, that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped ſtrange gods, that they liued in adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and inceſt, that they killed theyr Children, and dyd feede vpon mans fleſh. Before them they charged the Chriſtians with diuiſions and ſchiſmes, ſayinge, You Chriſtians agree not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your ſelues, you haue ſo many ſects, and one ſect is at defiance with another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth one another: therefore your religion is not true, it is not of God. Since the time wee forſooke our Gods, theſe and theſe euils are come vpon vs. They charged Chriſtians that they were ſtirrers vp of rebellion, and that they diſquieted the mindes of the people. Let theſe Chriſtians, ſaid they, be caſt to the Iyons. Such complayntes were brought before Kinges and Princes againſte the Chriſtians of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, and theſe falſe charges haue bene thoughte true: therefore were there ſharpe lawes made agaynſt them. It was comaunded, that no man ſhoulde ſpeake in the Name of Chriſt, and who did not obey this, ſhoulde dye the death.</p>
            <p>Who is able to expreſſe the miſeries, whiche followed in the execution of thoſe Lawes? There was no ſworde nor weapen, no racke nor torment, no fire, nor water, but they were prepared for, and ſtayned with Chriſtian blood, Souldiers were kept in whole gariſons: prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

made Leagues, kepte Councils, deuiſed new and cruell lawes, vſed conſpiracies, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed al kindes of ſtrange and terrible deathes for the defence of <hi>Hiericho:</hi> they kylled Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by thouſandes <hi>Maximianus</hi> burnt in one Temple twentie thouſande, aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to celebrate the memorie of the Natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt. <hi>Diocleſian</hi> made proclamation for the ouerthrowinge of the Chriſtian Churches throughout all the <hi>Romane</hi> Empyre: hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Bookes of holy Scripture to bee bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the open Market place: and diſplaced with great ignomie ſuche Chriſtians as were Magiſtrates, and all other that bare any office.

            <p>But the Lorde, which was mightie to ſaue <hi>Daniel</hi> in the middes of the lyons, and <hi>Ionas</hi> in the whales bellye, and his three ſeruantes in the flaming fire, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the redde Seat whoſe eyes are ouer the righteous, and whiche is nigh vnto all that call vpon hym: was alſo able to make his owne cauſe good, to giue courage to his Seruantes, &amp; tremblinge and anguiſh of minde to their enemies. For the more his ſeruannts were deminiſhed, the more they encreaſed: and the more tyrants preuailed, the more they were weakened. He that ſhould die was bold and careleſſe: he that ſhoulde kyl,
<pb facs="tcp:8193:21"/>
was fearefully amazed: the tormentor mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the condemned reioyced: the dead had the glorie, the Tyrantes the ſhame: their ſacrifices decayed, their Temples were forſaken, theyr Goddes laught to ſcorne, their Prieſtes were wood, and lacked their large offringes: the Lorde did let the curſe fall vpon them, whiche he made by his ſeruant Ioſhuah, and whiche ſhall come vpon al thoſe that wyll ſeeke to raiſe vp <hi>Hiericho.</hi>

               <hi>Iuliane</hi> of all other began moſt politiquely and ſubtlely, and therefore moſt mightely to ſet vp <hi>Hiericho.</hi> He gaue commandement that no Chriſtian mans childe ſhould goe to ſchoole, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing thereby to keepe them rude and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that no Chriſtian ſhoulde beare office, or liue in any manner authoritye, thereby to make them vyle: that they ſhould neuer be Captaynes or ſouldiers, that ſo they might be kept in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he remoued the Chriſtians out of his court. He opened againe the temple of the Heathen, &amp; did erecte Idolles in them, and the more to giue credit and countenaunce to the matter, he him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe being the Emperour, tooke vpon him the office of a Biſhop, and did offer ſacrifice: many of the nobles, &amp; many of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, applied them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues to followe this example, and did the like. He lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced the Iewes to returne home again, &amp; to build vp <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he allowed them mony,

he gaue them liberties, and all this onely in the deſpite of Chriſt: onelye to diſcredite and deface the glory of the ſonne of God. Hereby the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes vpbrayded and defied Chriſt: the faithfull were diſmayed, and the church of GOD was brought to great confuſion.</p>
            <p>But now let vs enter into the ſanctuary of the Lordes counſels, and behold the later end of theſe doinges. The Iewes fell to woorke, layd their foundation, prouided al thinges needefull, and began to buylde: ſodainely brake out an earthquake, and ouerthrew their worke: lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges fel from heauen and burnt their tooles in their handes, and their coates on their backs. The print that the lightning made in their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was a croſſe, in token that they were the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſte.

            <p>It is not enough, that wee looke backe and gaze at this decayed citie of <hi>Hiericho,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the rampiers looſed, the walles throwen downe, the houſes burned, and the people there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſlayne.

the Lords hand towards vs. That thing whiche hath bin done, may be done again. The Arke of God was taken by the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his temple to be ſpoyled: not that he was offended with the Arke, or with the temple, but for the vnworthines of the people.

<pb facs="tcp:8193:25"/>
Now it remaineth we conſider what wholſome remedies may be deuiſed, that <hi>Hiericho</hi> be neuer againe reſtored. Here of I wil ſay ſomewhat, the time ſo requireth. Heere might wee marke the practiſes and policies of noble co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querors, what wayes they take to keepe themſelues in ſafety, and their conquered ſubiectes from rebellion, Some when they had gotten a citie, thought it enough to ouerthrow the walles therof, Some razed al the caſtels, &amp; threw down al the holdes. Others haue built ſtrong places, and Towers, and furniſhed them with munition to bridle the people. Others haue ſpoyled them, and kept the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poore. Others haue vnarmed them, &amp; kept them from all weapon. Others to withdrawe them from vnquiet fancies, haue ſet them to Plough the ground, and to other bodily labour. Others haue cut off their captaines, and al ſuch as might ſeem able to leade the people, and to moue rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Some haue killed their male children. Some diſſolued the old Lawes, and gaue them new. Others haue forbidden banquets &amp; feaſts, and al other conuenticles or aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies, to make them ſtrange one to another. Others haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely ſowed and mainteined factions, &amp; ſet city againſt citie, ſurname againſt ſurname, blood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt blood, that no man might ſafely truſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Some haue deuiſed othes and bands, of conſcience: ſome haue deuiſed lawes martial, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:8193:26"/>
other crueltie: ſome haue tranſported, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the whole people, man, woman, and child: as <hi>Nabuchodonozor</hi> did the Iewes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> &amp; put others in their place. By theſe, and ſuch other like wayes, as much as wiſedom and pollicie could deuiſe, they thought to keepe countries and nations in obedience.</p>
            <p>But, as touching our ſpiritual <hi>Hiericho, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuah</hi> ſuffered nothing to ſtand, he burnt hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and palaces, and killed man, woman, &amp; child, &amp; cattel without mercy, altogether. For ſo God had giuen him in commandement, and ſo is it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten written of him, that where the Lord gaue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people into his hands, he left nothing remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, no, were it neuer ſo little. Of this pollicie <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh. <hi>If you wil not driue out the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the land before you, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Num. 33.</note> 
               <hi>which ye let remaine of them, ſhalbe pricks in your eies, &amp; thornes in your ſides, &amp; ſhall vexe you in the land wherein ye dwell.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy not ſome onely, to leaue ſome: you ſhall leaue nothing, no not a little. If you doe leaue, you breake the commandement of God.</p>
            <p>In religion, no part is to be called little. A heare is but little, yet it hath a ſhadowe. In the bodie, a little diſquiet is oftentimes cauſe of death. The <hi>Ciniphes</hi> were but litle, yet are thei reckoned among the great plagues of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Metellus</hi> a noble man of Rome, by receiuing
<pb facs="tcp:8193:26"/>
a haere in his milke, was choked with it, &amp; died thereof. Some thinges are ſmal and do no hurt: ſome things though they be ſmal, do great hurt. Therefore doth God ſtraightly charge his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to keepe the law ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalte not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ioſue. 1. &amp; 6. Deut. 15. &amp; 28. 1. Co. 5.</note> 
               <hi>turne awaye from it, neither to the right hand nor to the left.</hi> And <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>A litle leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſpeake not this, becauſe I thinke nothing at al may be left to any ſpecial purpoſe. For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Hiericho,</hi> where was made a general deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Ioſue 6.</note> God himſelfe commanded, that all ſiluer &amp; gold, and veſſels of braſſe &amp; iron ſhould be ſaued, &amp; not ſaued only, but be brought into the Lords treaſurie. How be it, the things that may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, muſt not be duſt, or chaffe, or hay, or ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but gold, and ſiluer, &amp; yron, and braſſe, I meane, they may not be things meet to furniſh and mainteine ſuperſtition, but ſuch thinges as be ſtrong, and may ſerue either directly to ſerue God, or els for comelines and good order. Such thinges may be reſerued. notwithſtanding they came out of the ſpoyle of <hi>Hiericho.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to ſtay the reſtoring of <hi>Hiericho,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good wayes may be deuiſed. For our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration at this preſent, and becauſe the time is farre ſpent, I will name onely foure vnto you. The firſt, <hi>Maintenaunce of ſchooles &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> Secondly, vnderſtanding of the cauſe:
<pb facs="tcp:8193:27"/>
that is, that euery man may conſider, what hee hath left, &amp; what he hath receyued: out of what darknes, into what light he is come. Thirdly, kindnes towards God, &amp; tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfulnes. Fourthly the diſcipline of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church. With theſe 4. by gods grace, we may keepe <hi>Hiericho</hi> from reſtoring. Of eche of theſe a few words, &amp; ſo I wil end.</p>
            <p>That learning and knowledge, is able to hinder the builders of <hi>Hiericho,</hi> it is ſo playne that it needeth no ſpeech. In the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, <hi>Aaron</hi> the great Biſhop and high Prieſt, had writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a tablet before his breſt, <hi>doctrine,</hi> and <hi>truth:</hi> not onely learning, but alſo trueth: wherby was meant, that neither might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other. For, as learning is daungerous and hurtfull without religion, ſo is religion vnable to defend it ſelfe, and to conuince the gaine ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, without learning.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe, the Heathen, when they erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted temples in the honour of their gods, did alſo builde libraries, that is, places to keepe bookes: that by ſuch meanes, their prieſts might grow in knowledge, &amp; be better able to perſwade others to their religion. <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth of the <hi>Smyrni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that they builte a temple in the honour of <hi>Homer,</hi> and ioyned therto a library. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour, built a temple and alſo a library in the honour of <hi>Apollo, Traianus</hi> in like maner built a library and called it <hi>Ulpia</hi> after his own

The Prophets of God had their ſchooles, to breed vp vnder them ſuch as might after their death draw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people from idolatrye,
<pb facs="tcp:8193:28"/>
and reſiſt the falſe Prophets. They which were ſo taught by them, were called <hi>Filij Propheta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, The ſonnes of the Prophetes, Samuel</hi> taught in ſuch ſort at <hi>Rama. Elias</hi> and <hi>Elizeus</hi> the Prophetes, in ſuche ſorte, taught the Law of God beſides <hi>Hiericho.

Others did the like at <hi>Antioche,</hi> and at other places. Out of ſuch ſchooles it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to take many excellent men, and place them in his Church, as <hi>Origen, Tertullian, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Lactantius, Arnobius, Baſilius, Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenus, Chryſoſtomus, Hieronimus, Ambroſius, Auguſtinus,</hi> who were brought vp in al kind of learning, and became ſhyning ſtarres, &amp; bright lightes in the houſe of God, notable defenders of religion, ouerthrowers of idols, and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Heretikes.

            <p>As alſo for the contrarie, ſuch as haue practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed cruelty vpon learned men, and haue hated knowledge, are worthely diſcommended in the ſtories of all ages.

Such an enemie to knowledge was alſo <hi>Licinius</hi> the Emperour, who called learning the poiſon and ouerthrowe of common weales. The like is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of <hi>Caligula, Caracalla</hi> and <hi>Domitianus,</hi> that either they vtterly hated all maner of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or had ſome ſpecial malice againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of ſome one notable man, and therefore ſought to deſtroy them.

            <p>And were theſe the practiſes of Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces onely? May not we remember the like at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts wrought in our daies. Who wil cal to minde the time that is not farre paſt, ſhal finde that this ignoraunt <hi>Hiericho</hi> had many friends, who by all meanes drew men from knowledge: they gaue liberty rather to doe any thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſeeke vnderſtanding, and yet ſuffered rather the vſe and reading of fabulous &amp; vncleane writers, then of the holy ſcriptures, and bookes whiche carried fruitful inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Good letters, and ſtudie to increaſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, are not to be neglected. Such as preſume of Gods ſpirit ouer boldely, that without their endeuour to vſe the wholeſome meanes which he hath left vnto his Church they ſhal and do by ſpecial inſpiration vnderſtand his wil, do tempt God.

we cannot loue hym as our father we can not feare him as our Lorde.</p>
            <p>But, when wee ſee the miſerable blindeneſſe and ignoraunce in all places abroade, what hope may wee haue to ſee <hi>Hiericho</hi> ſuppreſſed and quite ouerthrowne? It cannot be but great inconueniences ſhall followe in the Churche of God, as confuſion of order, and diſſolution of life, to the indangering of the ſtate, vnleſſe by godly care of the Magiſtrates, ſome helpe be prouided. This care muſt ſhewe it ſelfe in remouinge blinde watchmen whiche haue no knowledge, who are but dumme dogges that can not barke, who lye and ſleepe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſleeping. Theſe greedye Dogges can neuer haue enough (ſayeth the Prophet <hi>Eſaye,) Non reſidence</hi> and abſence from their cure, is <note place="margin">Eſay. 56.</note> a fault that woulde bee amended in the Sheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes of the Lordes flocke.

               </gap>, if they bee not at hande to giue their flockes their bread in due ſeaſon, what let may there bee, but that ignorance and blindeneſſe ſhall growe and encreaſe in the people?</p>
            <p>Another fault no leſſe hurtfull to the Church of God, is the ſufferinge of pluralities, when
<pb facs="tcp:8193:32"/>
one man taketh the profite of two or more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, whiche is not worthye of one. Theſe <hi>Non reſidents</hi> and pluralitie men teache not, they knowe not, nor care for the People of their charge: they haue brought this confuſion and ſhame into the houſe of God.

God wyll fall vppon them: the blood of Gods people ſhall be required at their handes, becauſe they bring the abhomination of deſolation into the holy place: becauſe they ſuffer Chriſtes flocke to periſhe for lacke of knowledge, and to be caryed away after euery wynde of falſe doctrine. God graunt al ſuch, that they may ſee with their eyes, and vnderſtande in their heartes, and knowe the gratious goodneſſe of the Lorde, that the people bee not through their negligence like Horſe and Mule: but that they may deſcerne betweene darkeneſſe and lighte, and betweene <hi>Hiericho</hi> and <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> that they may bee able to giue a reaſon of the faith whiche is in them and that they may teache the ſame vnto their Children.

            <p>The thirde meanes to ſtay the buyldynge of <hi>Hiericho,</hi> is to bee thankefull for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites whiche God hath beſtowed vpon vs: and in ſuche ſorte to leade our life, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare wee bee his ſeruants.

Let vs call to remembrance the Leſſon that was giuen vs in this place on Sunday laſt: Let vs ſearch the ſcriptures. <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet ſaith, <hi>To the Law, and to the teſtimonie, if they</hi>

For if we haue eyes to ſee, and neglect not our owne ſaluation, wee haue nowe much greater cauſe to reioyce then <hi>Dauid</hi> had, becauſe the things which are this daye reſtored vnto vs by

Wherefore god ſpake to them by the Prophet <hi>Aggaeus, Is it time for your ſelues to dwel in your ſeeled houſes, and this houſe lye waſt?</hi> Haue you found le aſure to ſet vp &amp; furniſh your owne houſe, &amp; can you neglect the reſtoring of my houſe? My houſe (I ſay) in which my Lawe hath bene read and preached to you, where your Fathers haue made mee ſacrifices, towardes which houſe you turned your faces, whenſoeuer you prayed vnto me in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and were heard? Therfore ſayth the Lord. <hi>Ye haue ſowen much

            <p>This place of the Prophet <hi>Aggaeus,</hi> I haue thought good to apply to the preſent ſtate of our time. For, as then the citie of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was miſerably raſed, and the Temple of god burnt downe by heathens: euen ſo hath it fared in time lately paſt with the Churche of Chriſte, here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge vs. And, as then God mollified &amp; ſofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the heart of the king <hi>Darius</hi> for the deliuery of his people, euen ſo of his great mercie hath he nowe ſtirred vp a moſt noble &amp; vertuous Ladie our ſoueraigne Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for the ſame purpoſe. And, as then there were many that ſet light by Gods benefites, and thought it meete y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for him to waite vpon their leiſure: euen ſo, I pray God, the ſame ſecuritie be not founde in vs at this time. I pray God there be none of vs that make light of Gods grace, and ſay in our heartes, <hi>Nondum venit tempus, &amp;c. The time is not yet come, that the Lords houſe ſhould be builded.</hi>

            <p n="1">1 Wherfore, firſt I wil proue (by Gods grace) that our Churche hath bene ouergrowne with errours and abuſes, as then the temple of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> was defaced by the Caldees.</p>

you, and by them your wiſedomes ſhall gheſſe the reſt.</p>
               <p>Chriſt gaue the Sacrament of his body and blood to bee frequented in the Congregation, that all ſhoulde bee partakers thereof, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his death, and ſayde, <hi>Hoc facite</hi>

                  <hi>in meam commemorationem, Do yee this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of mee.</hi> Thus Chriſt hymſelf or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned and commanded: thus the Apoſtles, and the catholique fathers in the primatiue Church vſed it: and there can no commandement, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ample, be ſhewed forth to the contrary. Yet our later fathers, agaynſt Chriſt, agaynſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, againſt the primitiue church, haue thought it ſufficient, that one prieſt alone ſhould commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate for all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Chriſt deliuered the holy Communion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both kindes, and ſo was it vſed in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, and in the times of the doctors, <hi>Chryſoſtome, Ambroſe, Gregorie, Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Hierome.</hi> But our fathers in the Councill holden at <hi>Conſtance</hi> of late yeares, haue gone from the originall, and haue decreed againſt Chriſt himſelfe, againſt his Apoſtles, and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours: that, to miniſter the Communion to a lay man vnder both kinds, is an open hereſie. Alas, (good brethren) I beſeeche you conſider by the way, in what ſtate was the Church of Chriſte then, when Chriſtes owne inſtitution, and the Apoſtles doctrine was called hereſie?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8193:40"/>
Chriſt, his Apoſtles, &amp; the catholque fathers vſed their praiers in a common tongue, that the people might perceiue what was ſaide in the Church, &amp; ſay Amen. But, how neere our later fathers come to that originall, it needeth no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal. For you haue heard it taught you as a neceſſary doctrine, that your prayers ſhould be in the Latine tongue, although you did not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what ye prayed for: and that kinde of prayer hath bene called deuotion.</p>
               <p>God left order to his Church, <hi>Non facies tibi ſculptile, thou ſhalt not make thee any graue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> image.</hi> From Chriſts time for the ſpace of 500 yeres, there was no allowance of images in the Catholique Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but our later fathers ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not take it for a Church, vnleſſe it be decked, &amp; ſet about with images.</p>

               <p>You wyll ſaye, Theſe be but ſmal matters, and may be borne withal, for decencie and good order.

Not long ſithence, in this citie there were certaine interrogatories put forth, to enquire of ſuche as then they called heretikes, wherein one inquiry was made in this ſort: Item, whether you knowe or haue heard of any perſon or perſons within your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, that hath kept, or at this preſent doth keepe, any heretical, naughtie, and ſeditious booke or

               <p>Whenſoeuer any great Eclipſe chanceth in the ſunne or moone, ſome maruellous impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or change, or mortality foloweth vppon the earth: Euen ſo, when true knowledge faileth in the Church of God, it cannot be but the ſoules of the people ſhal periſh. If in the little time of <hi>Moſes</hi> abſence, the people forgate God, and fell to idolatry: if when Chriſt ſlumbred, and tooke but a litle nappe in the ſhippe, the ſhip began to drowne: how ſhall it bee with them that receiue not <hi>Moſes</hi> at all, and giue no place to our ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, who only is able to ſaue the Church from drowning?

Thoſe churches are in danger of drowning, wherin the word of God waketh not: Not for that Chriſt is in any ſlu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, but becauſe his word is heauy in vs through our heauines:</hi> &amp; <hi>Orig.</hi> ſheweth how dangerous y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is where, the Goſpel is not preached. <hi>Such a Church can

               </p>
               <p>And therfore Chriſt compareth his church to the weakeſt things that be. Sometimes hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it a vine, which vnies it euermore be propte and borne vp, &amp; looked vnto, &amp; pruned, of it ſelfe is not able to ſtande, but falleth to the ground, &amp; groweth wilde.

Sometime to a ſhippe, which if it be not wel prouided on euery ſide, if it be deſtitute of light of ſunne &amp; ſtarres, is in daunger of the rocke, and windes, &amp; ſurges of the ſea.

               <p>What needeth more proofe in a matter being of it ſelfe ſo cleere?

yea, the Biſhopyes of Rome and their chiefe pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, doe coufeſſe that the patterne and original, hath not beene kept.

               <p>But me thinke I heare ſome ſay, The church cannot bee ſo forſaken, it is the houſe and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, it is the ſpouſe of Chriſte: Chriſt made her a ſure promiſe, that he woulde neuer forſake her. <hi>Ero vobiſcum vſ<expan>

               <p>Other impedimentes there bee, that keepe men from the buylding of Gods houſe. But that which GOD complayneth of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, is, that euery man fell to builde his owne houſe, and lefte the houſe of God vnbuilded. This is the corruption of our nature. Such thinges as we ſhoulde glorifie God withall, we abuſe moſte to the diſhonour of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſte calleth them <hi>thornes, and the Mammon of wickedneſſe,</hi> not becauſe they are ſo of themſelues, for they are the giftes of God, but becauſe our frowarde nature maketh them ſo.</p>

               <p>O good my Lordes and brethren, I come not hither to bee a Patrone for money mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: GOD ſeeth my hearte before whome I ſpeake it. But I ſee Gods Temple by this meanes is forſaken. Young men, ſuche as are of moſte to wardeneſſe turne them ſelues to be Phiſitions, or men of Lawe: yea. Clearkes, or Apothecaries. The matter is ſo vſed, that they are aſhamed to bee Miniſters in Gods Churche. They ſhoulde not ſo doe, ſaye you: no, neyther yet you, as your dooinges are, can bee angrye with them. They are not Angelles, but your owne children, your brethren, your Couſins, of your owne affections, of your owne fleſhe and blood, and they thinke themſelues too good to become your ſlaues.</p>
               <p>O mercifull GOD, at the beginning of the Goſpell, euerye man brought his goodes, and layde them at the feete of the Diſciples. Nowe euerye manne is readye to pull out in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner neceſſarye ſuſtenaunce, euen out of the mouthes of Chriſtes Diſciples. Then that that was euery mans owne, euerye man made it common, and no man counted it to bee his owne. Nowe that appertayneth to others,
<pb facs="tcp:8193:55"/>
and is appointed to the building and preſeruing of Gods Church,, that euery man layeth handes on, and counteth to bee his owne. In the meane ſeaſon, the poore Uniuerſities are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, the ſchooles euerye where vnfurniſhed, the youth driuen and chaſed away from the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>Thinke of this in your heartes: Conſider with your ſelues. There lacke already Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters throughout the Realme; to teach the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; to builde vp the walles of Gods Church. One poore hireling is driuen to ſerue two or three Pariſhes. The ſicke hath no man to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte or counſell them: the dead haue no man to burie them: one man burieth another. That thing I knowe is not materiall: yet it ſeemeth not ſo to al men, and our bodies are the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the holy Ghoſt, and ought reuerently to be brought to their graues.</p>
               <p>Uiew your Vniuerſities: view your ſchooles which euer haue beene nourceries to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: alas, how many ſhall you finde in both the Uniuerſities, and in all the Schooles through England, not onely that are already rype, but alſo that are mynded to the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye: If they be not founde there, alas where thinke you to haue them: Where thinke you will they be found? Thinke you that they will ſpring out of the grounde, or droppe downe from the Heauens: No, no, they be of you, and

If there be none to be founde, nor hope of any to be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: be you wel aſſured that Actes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Proclamations, are not enough to content the conſcience of the people, and to build vp the Temple.</p>
               <p>Oh, that the Queenes Maieſty knewe the great ſcarcitie, and miſerable neede of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that is abroade.

But their meeting was (as <hi>Dauid</hi> foreſpake, and as <hi>Peter</hi> declareth, and as wee knowe) againſt the Lorde, and againſt annointed.

In like maner the Apoſtle may ſay of others, they haue the feare of God, but not according to knowledge: of others, they haue the loue of God, but not according to knowledge: of another, he hath the faith of God, but not according to knowledge: And another may be ſaide to faſt, but not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to knowledge.

            <p>This zeale, as on the one ſide it hath manye tokens of goodnes, for that it hath a conſcience, and a feare, and an obedience towardes God: ſo, on the other ſide it is very daungerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it lacketh knowledge: euen as a ſhippe for lacke of a Gouernaur is euer in daunger of the rockes, and as the body whiche hath no eye, is euer in daunger of falling.

            <p>But the true and godly zeale proceedeth not from hypocriſie or intention, but is led and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by vnderſtanding, and is moulten into the heart, and the vehemency and heat of it, no man knoweth, but he that feeleth it.

            </p>
            <p>And, albeit there is much likeneſſe between the rage and fury of hypocrites, and the godlye zeale of good men: for either are hot, either are vehement, either wiſheth redreſſe: yet this is an euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: godly zeale is tempered &amp; ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with charity, the vngodly is ioyned with bitternes &amp; reuenge: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly ſeeketh to winne, the vngodly to kill and to deſtroy.

They ſay, Come, let vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, that they be no more a nation.</p>
            <p>Let not the name of Iſrael be had any more in remembrance. They burne the holy bookes of the Scriptures, as did <hi>Aza</hi> and <hi>Antiochus.</hi> They ſaye, ranſake it, pull it downe, caſe it to

the foundation, let nor one bee left aliue. They digge vp the bodies of the dead, out of their graues. They ſhewe their cruelty vppon the bones and aſhes, which were long before bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and well nigh conſumed. It grieueth them when they lacke vppon whome they may whet their blood thyrſtie and cruell zeale. It grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them, no one thing elſe ſo much, that they did not woorke ſurely, and cut vp the roote. Such is the zeale of the vngodly. Euen ſuch a zeale as was in <hi>Nero,</hi> in <hi>Caligula,</hi> of whom it is reported, he wiſhed that all the Romaines had but one necke, that he might cut off all their beades at one ſtroke: as was in <hi>Herode,</hi> in <hi>Annas.</hi> and <hi>Catphas,</hi> and the like murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
            <p>But the Godly, when they ſee any diſorder, they doe nothing like the other: they mourne in their heartes to ſee that the trueth is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyued, and to ſee the mindes of their brethren ſo obſtinately hardened: they make prayer to God for them: they are deepely touched with the feeling of ſuche calamittes whiche GOD layeth vppon other.

The kings &amp; ſtates of the world, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> biſhops, profeſſors &amp; ſchollers in vni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſities, &amp; preachers were brought to ſwere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; obedience vnto him. I deuiſe not this, the ſtories hereof are abrode, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oth which they tooke is known. His authorite grew greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the authoritie of general councilles. Nothing might be decreed in councels, but what pleaſed him: none might be admitted to ſpeak in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cils, but ſuch as were ſworne to him. He had al law in his breaſt. There was ſometimes a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in <hi>Rome,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for conſiderations no man ſhould erect or builde vp any theater: &amp; that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were ſet vp, it ſhold be raſed, &amp; pulled down. <hi>Pompeius</hi> a gentleman of great wealth, &amp; noble courage, did build a theater, ſuch a one as before had not bene ſeene, which would receaue 2500. men, contrary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proclamation, &amp; order taken. But, dubtinge leaſt the next maieſtrates ſhould deſtroy it, he cauſed a place of religion to bee ſet vpon it, &amp; called it the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of <hi>Venus.</hi> Whereby he prouided, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if any wold ouerthrow it, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:8193:72"/>
it was a Theater, they might yet ſpare it for the temples ſake: for to pul down a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple was ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. Euen ſo, there haue bene proclamations, &amp; cannons, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man ſhoulde be called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of al Churches, or vſurpe ſuch authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer others: but when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope built vp his ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie againſt the meaning of ſuche canons, hee prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his doing: he ſayde, it was <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man ſhould preſume or atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt it, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo his power might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue for euer.</p>
            <p>If they haue bene thus carefull to mainteine falſhod, how much more careful ſhould we be to maintaine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth: If they to adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce their owne kingdome, how much more wee, to ſet forth the kingdom of God, &amp; to builde vp the Church of Chriſt: And if they ſought to do y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by lies, &amp; by falſe meanes, why ſhould we bee ſlack to vſe the right, &amp; true, &amp; good meanes, wherby that good thing which God hath wrought for vs, may bee eſtabliſhed:</p>
            <p>And, albeit there be many wayes, by which the kingdome of God may be mainteined: as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour &amp; countenance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, whiche ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth &amp; cheriſheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, as the ſunne beames co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort &amp; cheriſh the earth: &amp; knowledge, &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, &amp; diſcipline, which are as the life, &amp; the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, &amp; without which the Church muſt needes fall aſunder: at this time, I wil leaue to ſpeak of the reſt, &amp; only ſtay vpon learninge, which may truly be called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, &amp; of chriſtian religien.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8193:73"/>
How neceſſarie a thinge, they haue counted learninge to the ſettinge foorth of Religion, the ſtories of our old fathers, of heathens, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in al ages, doe witneſſe. They thought, that neither Religion might ſtande without knowledge, nor knowledge were to bee eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med without Religion. <hi>Charles</hi> the great, that hee might the better plant Religion in <hi>Saxonie</hi> and <hi>Heluetia,</hi> did erect many places for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of learning. He knewe well, that there was no other way better to eſtabliſh Religion. The Cathedral Churches, before ſuch times, as ignoraunce and blindeneſſe grewe ouer all the worlde, and brought in an vniuerſal corruption, maintayned ſchooles of learning, that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which was taught in thoſe places, might bee defended agaynſt the gayneſayers by ſuche learned men, as were there bred vp. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Germanie, and the free Cities, after they had receyued the Goſpell, they diſſolued theyr monaſteries which had bene harbourers for ſuch as liued in idlenes, and ſet vp Schooles and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which ſhould be nourceries to breede vp learned men, that might bee able to teache the people, and to maintaine religion. Whereby it came to paſſe, that in ſhorte time they had great ſtore of worthy and learned men.</p>
            <p>This did they wel ſee, that haue bene the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of religion, &amp; therefore vſed all meanes to hinder the encreaſe of learninge, that they
<pb facs="tcp:8193:73"/>
might haue the better way to ouerthrow Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For if learning decay, it is likely that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion can not abide. Beare with me, if I ſpeake that whiche may ſeeme more fitt for ſome other place, then for this audience: the beſt here vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth me wel. In other countries, the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Goſpell, hath alwayes bene cauſe, that learning was more ſet by: and learninge hath euer bene the furtherance of the Goſpell. In England, I knowe not how, it commethe otherwiſe to paſſe. For ſince the Goſpell hath bene receiued, the maintenaunce for learninge hath bene decayed. And, the lacke of learninge will be the decay of the Goſpel. Would God it were not ſo: or, that yet before the faulte be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, there may be ſome redreſſe.</p>
            <p>Loth I am to ſpeake, yet the caſe ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that it is needefull to be ſpoken, I truſte I ſhall ſpeak in the hearing of them that wyll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider it. Maintenance of learninge, whereby an able and ſufficient miniſterie may growe, and be eſtabliſhed in al the Churches of this realme, is to be wiſhed for. The good eſtate of this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kingdome, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> comfort of poſterytie, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſtaye of Religion, the continuing of the Goſpell, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing of darknes hangeth vpon it. One aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſometimes, howe it was that in <hi>Athens</hi> ſo goodly and great a citie, there were no Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, To whom this anſwere was made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are rewardes appointed for them
<pb facs="tcp:8193:74"/>
that practiſe Phiſicke. The ſame anſwere may be made for our times: the cauſe why y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Church of God is ſo forſaken, is the want of zeale in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that ſhould either for their curteſie, or for their ability be foſterers of learning, &amp; encreaſe the liuings where occaſion is, and giue hope &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to learned men. What ſaid I, increaſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nay, the liuings and prouiſion which hertofore were giuen to this vſe, are taken away.</p>
            <p>Haue patience, if any ſuch be here, as I well know there are, whom theſe things touch. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to ſpeake the truth, it is Gods cauſe. The liuings of ſuch as are in the miniſtery, are not in their handes, to whom they are due. Al other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers and artificers haue their hire increaſed double, as much as it was wont to be: Onely the poore man that laboureth, &amp; ſweateth in the vineyard of the Lorde of hoſtes, hath his hire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged &amp; abated. I ſpeak not of the Curats, but of Perſonages &amp; Uicarages, that is, of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are the caſtles &amp; towers of fence for the Lordes temple. They ſeldome paſſe now a dayes from the patrone, if he be no better then a gentleman, but either for the leaſe or for preſent money. Such marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> church of God, a great deale more intolerable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were they who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt chaſed &amp; whipt out of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. Thus they y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſhould be careful for Gods church, that ſhould be patrones, to prouide for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the people, &amp; to place amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a learned
<pb facs="tcp:8193:74"/>
Miniſter, who might bee able to preach y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> worde vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of ſeaſon, &amp; in ſeaſon, &amp; to fulfil his miniſterie: ſeeke their own, &amp; not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſts. They ſerue not Ieſus Chriſt, but their bellie. And this is done, not in one place, or in one countrie, but throughout England. A gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot keepe his houſe, vnles he haue a Parſonage or two in ferme for his prouiſion.</p>
            <p>O mercifull God, wherto will this growe at laſt? If the miſerie which this plague worketh, would reache but to one age, it were tolerable. But it wil be a plague to the poſteritie, it wilbe the decay &amp; deſolation of Gods Church. Yong men which are toward &amp; learned, ſee this. They ſee that he whiche feedeth the flocke, hath leaſt part of the milke: hee which goeth a warfare, hath not halfe his wages. Therefore they are weary and diſcouraged, they chaunge their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: ſome become prentiſes, ſome turne to phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, ſome to lawe: all ſhun and flee the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie. And beſides the hinderance that thus groweth by wicked dealing of patrons: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the impropriations, the Uicarages in many places, &amp; in the propereſt market townes, are ſo ſimple, that no man can liue vpon them, and therefore no man wyll take them. They were wont to ſaye, <hi>Beneficia ſine cura: Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices without charge:</hi> but now may be ſaid, <hi>Cura ſine beneficio, Charge or cure without benefice.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:8193:75"/>
I ſpeake not this of my ſelfe: many here preſent know I ſpeake the trueth. And my ſelfe know the places, which haue continued ſtyll theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares without a Miniſter reſident amonge them, and haue prouided them ſelues, as they might, with their owne mony.</p>
            <p>Your Graces ſubiects had hope of amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in your graces late viſitation. But yet it ſtandeth ſtil in caſe as miſerable, as it did before. I know, your grace heareth not of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And I hope God wyll worke in your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart, to prouide ſome remedy agaynſte them. For otherwiſe, the ſcholes wil be forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Church deſolate, the people wylde and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed, the Goſpel diſcredited: otherwiſe, wee ſhal ſee that wrought againſt the houſe of God, that neuer any <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> or <hi>Iulian,</hi> or <hi>Licinius,</hi> could haue brought to paſſe againſt vs. This noble Realme which euer was famous for the name of learninge, is like thereby to come to ſuch ignorance, and barbarie, as hath not beene heard of in any memorie before our time.</p>
            <p>I knowe that there are grieuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes made, that the Biſhops appoint Prieſts and Miniſters, that are ignoraunt and haue no vnderſtanding in the latine tongue. Woulde God it were not true. Or would God that they which be the cauſers hereof, woulde ſomewhat helpe to ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it. But alas, are we able to make learned men vpon the ſudden? Or can we make
<pb facs="tcp:8193:75"/>
others then come vnto vs, or wyll come to liue in miſerie?</p>
            <p>But there are many which can ſay, ſuch as bee miniſters in the Churche, ſhoulde teache freely, without hope of recompence or hire for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Our preachers are no better then <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; the other Apoſtles. They are no better then the holy prophets, who liued poorely. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable eſtate. So ſay ſome, in lyke deuotion as did Iudas, <hi>What needed this waſt? this might haue bene ſold for much &amp; giuen to the pore: not that he cared for the pore, but becauſe he was a thiefe, &amp; had the bag, &amp; bare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was giuen.</hi> I doubt not, there are many which teach Chriſt for Chriſtes ſake, which ſay in their ſoule, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord is my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: who in that heauy time, from which God deliuered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they might haue receiued theyr life only for a reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence, would haue bin glad to take the paines: who ſeeke you and not yours: which haue forſaken all they had, to followe Chriſt. I doubt not, there are ſuch.</p>
            <p>But for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hope of poſteritie, I report me to al you which are fathers, &amp; haue childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for whom you are carefull. Although your ſelues haue a zeale, &amp; a care for the houſe of god: yet wil you breed them vp, keepe them at ſchoole, vntil 24. yeeres old to your charges, that in the ende they may liue in glorious pouertie? y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may liue poorely &amp; naked like the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:8193:76"/>
Our poſteritie ſhall rue, that euer ſuch fathers went before them: And Chronicles ſhal report this contempt of learning amonge the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and murraines, and other plagues of God. They ſhall leaue it written in what time, and vnder whoſe raygne this was done. Or if we growe ſo barbarous that wee conſider not this, or bee not able to drawe it into Chronicle, yet forraine nations wyl not ſpare to write this, and publiſh it to our euerlaſtinge reproche and ſhame.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, what may bee gheſſed of their meaning, which thus rauine and ſpoyle the houſe of God, which decay the prouiſion therof, and ſo baſely eſteeme the Miniſters of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel? They can not ſay to God, the zeale of thy houſe hath eaten me vp. Howſoeuer in other thinges they doe wel, howſoeuer they ſeeme to reioyce at the proſperitie of <hi>Sion,</hi> and to ſeeke the ſafetie and preſeruation of the Lordes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted: yet needes muſt it bee, that by theſe meanes forraine power, of which this realme by the mercie of God is happely delyuered, ſhall agayne be brought in vpon vs. Suche thinges ſhalbe done vnto vs, as we before ſuffered: the truth of God ſhalbe taken away, the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures burnt and conſumed in fire. A marueilous darkneſſe and calamitie muſt needes enſue. For if the tempeſt be ſo darke in the ſea that the load ſtarre loſe her light, and the needle fayle to giue
<pb facs="tcp:8193:76"/>
token of the North Pole, no marueile though the Ship loſe her courſe, and be ſwallowed vp in the ſandes.</p>
            <p>The Goſpell of Chriſte is the fountaine of light, and of knowledge. It cannot be maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ignorance and darknes. Theſe, bee the proppes of their kingdome which take away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcriptures, which hold the people in blindenes, which flie the light, whiche haue their common prayers, miniſter the Sacraments, Mary, burie their dead in a ſtrange tongue, that the People may vnderſtand nothing: which make a famine of hearing the word of God: which ſtop vp the ſpringes of the water of lyfe: which take awaye the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen, and neither enter in them ſelues, nor ſuffer them that woulde enter: which ſay ignoraunce is the mother of deuotion, &amp; the Church is then in beſt order, &amp; the people moſt deuoute, when they are hood winckt, &amp; blinded, &amp; ſee nothing.</p>
            <p>Theſe are not fit inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, wherwith we may ouercome the aduerſaries. This is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſworde of the ſpirit, theſe are not the ſpiritual weapons, which caſt downe holdes, and euery high thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge of God What man that would keepe out his enemy, will pul downe his holdes? what captaine that meaneth to giue a forcible aſſault vpon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, will diſcourage his fighting ſouldiers? but our ſouldiers are out of courage, our Caſtles
<pb facs="tcp:8193:77"/>
are falling: therefore that which we feare wyll fall vpon vs,</p>
            <p>The oxe that treadeth out the corne is muſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. He that goeth a warrefare, receiueth not his wages: the crye hereof goeth vp into the eares of the Lord of Hoſtes. He wil not abide ſo great contempt of his worde, and preachers: his owne name is therby diſhonoured. Our ſauiour ſaith, <hi>He that diſpiſeth you, diſpiſeth mee.</hi> And <hi>S. Paul, He</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>deſpiſeth theſe thinges, deſpiſeth</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 1. Theſ. 4.</note> 
               <hi>not man but god.</hi> And think we, that hee wyll ſuffer his holy name to be deſpiſed? Nay, hys wrath is alreadie kindled. He hath already begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his iudgements, &amp; therfore many places are left deſolate. There is none that can warne them of their ſinne, none that can moue them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, none that can preach vnto them forgeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes through Chriſt, none that can inſtruct them in the comfort of euerlaſting life. Becauſe they worke ſuch thinges againſt the Lord, the hearts of many are aſtonied. Though they heare, they vnderſtande not. They ſcorne and ieſte at the worde of ſaluation: it is vnto them a ſauour of death vnto death: they are earthlye minded, whoſe God is their bellie, and whoſe glorie is to their ſhame.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe you liue ſtill in your ſinnes, in adulterie, in couetouſues, and in pride, without any feeling of conſcience, without any feare of God. Your daughters, your heires, to whom
<pb facs="tcp:8193:77"/>
you ſhall leaue your landes, are ſtollen awaye from you, Robberies and theft are ſo common, as if it were not onely lawful, but alſo commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable: as if ſinne were no ſinne, and he I fire but a fable.</p>
            <p>Thus wee prouoke God to anger. Manye walke, of whom wee cannot thinke but with weeping: they are the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt: the name of God is blaſphemed through them. Many are ſo ignoraunt, they knowe not what the Scriptures are, they knowe not that there are any Scriptures. They call them he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall, and newe doctrine. Many will beleeue neyther ſide, whatſoeuer they alleadge. Bring they trueth, bring they falſhoode: teache they Chriſt, teach they Antichriſt: they will beleeue neither, they haue ſo hardened their heartes. Be the Preacher rough or gentle, learned or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, let him vſe authority of the ſcriptures, of the doctours, of the councels, of Decrees or Decretalles, of Gods Lawe, of mans law, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wil moue them, nothing wil pleaſe them, becauſe the miniſtery of God, and there by God himſelfe, is deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>Theſe woordes happily ſeeme ſharpe, and ouer vehement: but the hardneſſe of our hearts againſt GOD, and the lacke of zeale of his houſe, inforce me to them. We are almoſt fallen into the loweſt pitte: we are left without zeale, as ſenſeleſſe men, and as if we had cleane for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb facs="tcp:8193:78"/>
our ſelues, as the Heathen which know not God. Therefore, vnleſſe we repent, the kingdome of God ſhall be taken away from vs. He will ſend vppon this land a famine of the woorde. Hieruſalem ſhall be ouerthrown, and made an heape of ſtones, the man of ſinne, and they which haue not the loue of the trueth ſhall preuayle with many, and withdraw them from obedience to the Prince: this noble realme ſhall be ſubiect to foreine nations: all this will the zeale of the Lorde of hoſtes bring to paſſe.</p>
            <p>I could haue ſpent this time in opening ſome other matter: but nothing in my iudgement is more worthy your good conſideration, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy redreſſe. I would be loth raſhly or rudely to abuſe the reuerence of this place: but vnles theſe things be cared for, vnleſſe we ſhew foorth grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter zeale then hitherto, if the yeeres to come eate vp and take awaye from the Miniſtery as the late yeeres haue done, there wil not be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while, any to ſpeake the word of God out of this place. The Pulpits ſhall haue none to vſe them: the people ſhal grow wyld and voyd of vnderſtanding.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Xerxes</hi> behelde the greate company of his Souldiers, ſuddenly he brake into teares, and wept bitterly. One ſayde to him, O Syr, you haue cauſe to reioyce, you haue a goodlye companie, they are able to fight for you agaynſt
<pb facs="tcp:8193:78"/>
any nation. But what ſhall become of them, ſaith <hi>Xerxes?</hi> after a hundred yeeres: not one of all theſe ſhall be left aliue. If the view of the ſmal number of Preachers might be taken, how fewe they are, and howe thinne they come vp, we haue greater cauſe then <hi>Xerxes</hi> to lament, if we haue any zeale to the houſe of GOD. For, of the Preachers which nowe are, within fewe yeeres none will remayne aliue. And <hi>Xerxes</hi> ſouldiers lefte iſſue behinde them, which might afterwardes ſerue their Countrey: But there is like to bee ſmall increaſe for the ſupplie of Learned men. The Lorde ſhall lacke men to bring in his harueſt, the little ones ſhall call for bread, and there ſhall be none to giue it them. They that ſhall come after vs, ſhall ſee this to bee true. There is no houſe ſo ſpoyled, as the Houſe of the LORD. There is no Seruaunt ſo little rewarded as the Seruaunt of Chriſt, and the diſpoſer of the myſteries of God.</p>
            <p>Oh that your Grace did beholde the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſorder of Gods Church, or that you might foreſee the calamities, which will follow. It is a part of your kingdome, &amp; ſuch a parte, as is the principall proppe and ſtay of the reſt.

            <p>I hope I ſpeake truly, that which I ſpeake without flatterie, that God hath endued your Grace with ſuch meaſure of learning &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as no other Chriſtian Prince. He hath giuen you peace, happineſſe, the loue and true hearts of your ſubiectes. Oh turne and employ theſe to the glory of God, that God may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm in your Grace the thing which he hath begun. To this ende hath GOD placed Kinges and Princes in their ſtate, as Dauid ſaith, that they ſerue the Lorde, that they may ſee and cauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to ſee to the furniture of the Church. The good Emperor <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> cared for this as much, as for his life. <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius, Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> &amp; other godly Princes, called themſelues <hi>Vaſallos,</hi> the ſubiects and bond ſeruants of God. They remembred that God furniſhed them in their houſes, and were not vnmindful to furniſh his houſe.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had beautified Rome with ſetting vp many faire buildings, he ſaid, <hi>Inueni
<pb facs="tcp:8193:79"/>
lateritiam, marmoream reddidi. <hi>I fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it made of bricke, but I leaue it made of marble.</hi>
               </hi> Your grace when God ſent you to your inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the right of this Realme, founde the church in horrible confuſion, and in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> true worſhip of God, a church of brick, or rather (as <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſaith) daubed vp with vnſeaſoned morter. Your grace hath already redreſſed the doctrine: now caſt your eyes towardes the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, giue courage &amp; countenance vnto lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that Gods houſe may be ſerued: ſo ſhal you leaue a Church of God, &amp; a teſtimonie that the zeale of the Lords houſe hath eaten you vp.</p>
            <p>And you, O dearely beloued, if there be any ſuch which are neither hot nor colde, which doe the work of the Lord negligently, which eſteem the word of GOD but as a matter of pollicie, which are aſhamed to bee called Profeſſours of the Goſpel of Chriſt, pray vnto God that he wil increaſe your zeale. Let vs continue rooted and built in Chriſt, and ſtabliſhed in the faith. Let vs haue care for the houſe of God. Whoſoeuer is not after this ſort zealous, is a man of a double heart. We may not halt between two opinions. If the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal be he, then go after him: he that is not with Chriſt, is againſt him. Many talke of the Goſpel, and glorie in their knowledge: but it is neyther talke nor knowledge whiche ſhal ſaue them in that day. He that feareth the Lorde, and ſerueth
<pb facs="tcp:8193:80"/>
him with a pure heart, and may truely ſaye, the zeale of thine houſe hath conſumed me, he ſhall be ſaued. If they ſhall not eſcape which haue zeale without knowledge, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of vs which haue knowledge without zeale:</p>
            <p>And you, whoſoeuer you are, that by ſuch meanes haue decayed the Lordes Houſe, and abridged the prouiſion and maintenaunce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſee the miſerable wracke of Gods Churche: if there be any zeale of God in you, if you haue any felowſhippe of the ſpirite, if any compaſſion and mercy, if you loue God, if you deſire the continuance of the Goſpel, oh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you haue the patrimonie due vnto them that ſhoulde attend in the Lordes houſe: you take vnto your ſelues wrongfully, that which was not lotted for you. Giue vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> thoſe things which belong to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and vnto GOD the thinges which appertaine to him, and make for the beauty and furniture of his houſe. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich your ſelues by lawfull meanes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpoyle and waſte of Gods Church. Let not the Miniſtery by your meanes be deſpiſed. You enriched them, which mocked, &amp; blinded, &amp; deuoured you: Spoyle not them now that feed, and inſtruct, and comfort you. Let vs ſeeke the glory of God. Let vs at length ſerue the Lorde and not our bellie, and greedy wantonneſſe.</p>
            <p>So ſhal God bleſſe you and proſper you in al
<pb facs="tcp:8193:80"/>
your affaires, ſo ſhal he ſtrike a terrour of you into all forreine Princes that dwell about you, ſo ſhall your heart be kept ſtedfaſt in the hande of God, ſo ſhal your heart be perfect before the Lorde, ſo ſhall you leaue ſuche as ſhall alwayes praiſe the Lorde in Sion, ſo ſhall you ſee your childrens children, and peace vpon Iſrael.</p>
            <p>And, thou O moſt mercifull Father, graunt that thy wordes be not ſpoken in vayne: it is thy cauſe. Thou art our father, we are as claye in thine handes. Thou haſt the key of our hearts: Giue zeale to them that haue knowledge, giue knowledge to them that haue zeale, that they may be inflamed and rauiſhed with the loue of thy houſe, to ſorrow for the decay thereof, and to doe al their indeuour to build vp and eſtabliſh the ſame for euer,</p>

a flocke of ſheepe without a heard: and that not through their owne malice, but through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful blindneſſe and negligence of them that were ſet to guide them.</p>
            <p>Sheepe (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> write of them) are a ſimple kinde of cattell, profitable to many vſes, ready to receiue all maner wrongs, without ſkil, to helpe or ſuccour it ſelfe: it coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to breake out of the folde or cloſe, if it may eſpie any hole open, it ſtrayeth and wandreth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, many times hangeth in the briers, many times is taken vp by the Wolfe: it is euer in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

To ſuch a kind of cattel are the people likened.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſaith not, they were like vnruly ſheep, that would not be guided by their heard: but he ſaith. They were like poore loſt ſheep, that had no heard at al. For, the people of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues were not vnwilling to receiue the Goſpel: but there was none to inſtruct them. And for that, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth an other ſimilitude, to declare the ſame, and ſaith, The harueſt indeed is great, but the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are but few: the corne is ripe, &amp; ready to be cut, but there lack hands to fetch it in.</p>
            <p>The comming of theſe times was promiſed long afore, euen from the firſt creation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
<pb facs="tcp:8193:82"/>
but the perfourmance thereof at the firſt was darke, and as it were wrapt vp, and hid in a cloude, and like corne buried in the ground.</p>
            <p>After, it was ſomewhat more cleerely ſet forth in the Law giuen by <hi>Moſes.</hi> After that, it was reuiued by the Prophetes, and in manner plainely, in what place, at what time, of what mother, of what houſe or ſtocke Chriſt ſhould be borne: what doctrine he ſhould teach, what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles he ſhould worke, what death he ſhoulde die, how he ſhould be buried, howe he ſhoulde ariſe, how he ſhould aſcend into heauen, howe the heathens ſhoulde be called to beleeue in him, howe the holy Ghoſt ſhould be ſent, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, how Chriſt ſhould come at the laſt, to iudge the world. After that came <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> to point out <hi>Chriſt</hi> plainely with his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to ſay, <hi>Ecce agnus Dei, qui tollit pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta mundi, Behold the lambe of God, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the ſinnes of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſt of al, Chriſte himſelfe began to preache and prophecie of himſelfe, and to gather vnto him a choſen people, that ſhould be followers of good woorkes. Then was the accompliſhment and fulneſſe of time come to paſſe, that had ſo long beene looked for: then the kingdome of God began to ſuffer violence, and men violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euen by force, brake in vpon it: then the corne ſowed and caſt into the ground by the patriarks long before, and watered &amp; cheriſhed by the dew
<pb facs="tcp:8193:82"/>
of the Prophets, was ripened and kerned by the ſpirit of God: then was the harueſt greate, and the eares white, euen ready to be cut.</p>
            <p>Yet this notwithſtanding, Chriſt ſaith, the harueſt men are but few. He ſaith not, the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt is great, and there are but few <hi>Scribes,</hi> but few <hi>Phariſies,</hi> but few <hi>Sadduces,</hi> but few prieſts, but few Leuites: For the Prieſts and Leuites were diſtributed through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole countrey.

The Biſhop had euermore before his breaſt a tablet, wherein was imbrodered in letters of Golde, <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thumim:</hi> in token that he ſhould be a man both perfect in life, and alſo full and plenteous in the truth of God. In the ſame were ſet twelue ſtones, and therein grauen the names of the twelue tribes of the people, that he might haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euermore in remembrance. The ſkirtes or hemmes of his roabes were ſet with belles of gold, and pomegranates: in token that his life ſhould giue a good ſauour, and his voice ſhould ring, and be heard among the people.</p>
            <p>The Phariſies had certaine ſpecial poynts, and ſentences of the Lawe written round about in the borders of their garmentes, that it might neuer be out of their eyes: they prayed, no men more, and that in euery corner of the ſtreetes: they faſted twiſe euery weeke: the bed that they laye vpon, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writeth, was but a ſpanne broade, &amp; yet, that they might ſleepe with leſſe eaſe, they ſtrowed thornes vnderneath the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And therfore they were called <hi>Phariſaei,</hi> that is, <hi>diuided,</hi> as men in holines &amp; perfection of life farre paſſing al the reſt of the people.</p>

            <p>When they ſawe the people followe thicke after Chriſt, and to haue him in reuerence, they cried out, none of the Princes and great holye learned men beleeue in him, but theſe Raſcals,
<pb facs="tcp:8193:84"/>
that thus runne after him, are accurſed, &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and know not the law. The vnlearned ſort ſaid of Chriſt, he caſteth out vncleane ſpirits by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> power of God: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> great learned men ſaid, no, he throweth out diuels by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> power of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prince of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> diuels. The vnlearned marueiled, &amp; were aſtonied at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wonderful works that he did: the learned ſaide, he hath a diuel, he is out of his wittes. The vnlearned ſaid, no doubt a great Prophet is riſen amongſt vs: the learned ſayd, He deceiueth the people. The vnlearned ſayde, God hath viſited, and ſent comfort amongſt his people: the learned ſaid, Behold a glutton and a companion of <hi>Publicans</hi> &amp; ſinners. The great learned ſhepherds perſecuted Chriſt, &amp; chaſed him from place to place: the poore ſheepe folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him into the deſert.

            <p>And therefore, notwithſtanding there were groſſe &amp; damnable errours amongſt the people, as wel as amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the learned: yet Chriſt chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not the people for them, but only y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prieſts &amp; the Phariſies that tooke vpon them to lead the people: for that he ſaw the Phariſies and prieſts offended eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of malice, &amp; the poore people only of ignorance and ſimplicity. <hi>Woe be vnto you</hi>

            <p>But, as for the people, he had compaſſion on them, for that he ſawe they were forſaken, and periſhed euen as ſheepe without a heard: that they had a certaine zeale of God, although not according to knowledge: that they fell into the pitte, not of wilfull malice, but onely becauſe they followed the blynd guydes, that fell before them: that they were Gods harueſt, and lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, and were loſt, &amp; no man would take the paines to fetch them in.</p>

               <hi>wilt thou that I do?</hi> and after, he writeth of him ſelfe, God hath had mercy, and taken me to his grace, becauſe I knew not what I did.</p>
            <p>Many there were that cried out vpon Chriſt, crucifie him, crucifie him: &amp; after when he hung vpon the croſſe, nodded their heads vpon him, &amp; made mowes at him, &amp; did him al maner of ſpite &amp; vilany, &amp; yet pertayned they to Gods harueſt, and afterward, as it is credible, were crucified for him, &amp; ſhed their blood for him themſelues:</p>

Euen ſo are there, euen at this time, many that of ignoraunce perſecute the Goſpel of Chriſt, &amp; as it were crucifie Chriſt againe: which if they felt indeede, that it were the Goſpell of God, they would not ſo litle regard their owne ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <note place="margin">Iohn 10.</note> ſaith, <hi>My ſheep heare my voice, &amp; follow me, &amp; they wil not follow a ſtranger, but flye fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.</hi> And to conclude, whoſoeuer feeleth a lack within himſelf, &amp; can ſuffer himſelfe to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; taught by the ſpirit of God, he may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, God wil take him for his harueſt. Thus was the harueſt great, the laborers very few, the ſcatterers &amp; waſters, almoſt infinite. This was the ſtate of the Church at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Euen likewiſe, in theſe our dayes, Chriſt our ſauiour hath gone abroad in progreſſe, and done marueilous cures, &amp; ſhewed ſtrange miracles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his people, &amp; hath cauſed his goſpel to ring throughout the world.

                  <pb facs="tcp:8193:86"/>
is great,</hi> &amp; marueilous forward: yea, euen there where as no worldly hope of harueſt could haue beene. Many there are that hunger &amp; thirſt after the kingdome of God, which is the knowledge of his Goſpel: many that are yet greene &amp; igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, many that lie by the way ſide, and yet haue gathered no root, many that as yet are but tares and darnell, I meane blinde and obſtinate, but when Gods holy will ſhalbe, may be turned into good corne, and pertaine to his harueſt.</p>
            <p>But the laborers are few. I ſay not, there be but few Cardinals, few biſhops, few prieſts, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhold be preachers, few Archdeacons, few Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celors, few Deanes, few prebendaries, few vicars, few pariſh Prieſts, few monkes, few friars: For the number of theſe is almoſt infinite. <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene</hi> in his time, complained at the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Prieſtes, and ſaide, they were almoſt as many as the reſt of the people.</p>

            <p>The number of theſe is great: but alas, the number of labourers is very ſmal. And yet they giue a ſhewe to the worlde, that they be paſtors and feeders of the flocke, that they be the fathers of the people, that they bee the teachers of the multitude, that they be the labourers in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt, that the whole Catholike Churche ſtayeth altogether vpon them.</p>
            <p>They giue the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> theſe titles, that hee is the onely key of Chriſtian faith, that he is greater then the Apoſtles, for that they could erre, and he cannot: they ſay, he is Chriſtes Uicar, whereas indeede to any mans ſight, Chriſt may be contented to be his Uicar. They ſay, he is no bare man, but a god, as it is written in the <hi>Decretals</hi> of <hi>Nicholas</hi> Pope, and many other the like, which I leaue.</p>
            <p>The Pope calleth the Cardinals. <hi>Cardines mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di &amp;c. <hi>The very hookes and ſtaies of the world, vpon whom the doore of the church militant muſt be turned.</hi>

that they be the pillars and ſtaies of the Church: and pollaxes, to beate downe al euil doctrine.</p>
            <p>And what ſhal I ſpeake of biſhops? their clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen miter ſignifieth perfect knowledge of the new teſtament &amp; the old.

Theſe 900 yeres. I ſay, ſince <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt of that name, it can hardly be found, that euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſeene in a pulpit. One of themſelues, <hi>Adrianus</hi> 4. a biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>Succedimus non Petro in doce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do, ſed Romulo in parricidio. <hi>Wee ſucceede not Peter in teaching, but Romulus in murthering.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in a canon of the Apoſtles it is decreed, that the biſhop that teacheth not his flock, ſhould be depoſed. To which purpoſe they alleadge <hi>S. Auguſt: Epiſcopatus, nomen eſt operis, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> honoris:</hi>

               <hi>Wherfore pray the Lorde of the harueſt, that he would ſend forth labourers into his harueſt,</hi> It is the Lorde which caſteth the firſte ſeede into the earth, whiche doeth moyſten the ground, and maketh it fruitful, and giueth forth his ſunne, that it may come to ripening. Al the ſoile, field, corne, and the huſbandry therof is the Lordes. Let vs pray to him to ſend forth labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to trauaile and take paines.</p>
            <p>

Notwithſtanding we ought to praye to God, that hee will ſtirre vp and ſet foorth men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his people: yet that nothing embarreth the authority of princes. For, as God calleth him inwardly in the heart, whom he wil haue to bee a miniſter of his word: ſo muſt he be authorized of his Prince by outward and ciuil calling, as I could ſhew at large, if time would ſuffer it.</p>

And the ſame <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> was wont to ſay, that he had no leſſe regarde to the Church of God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had to his own ſoule. So <hi>Conſtantinus, Valentinianus</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> called themſelues <hi>Vaſallos Chriſti, The vaſals of Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>Socrates</hi> in his ſtory ſaith. <hi>Wee</hi>

            <p>Labourers they muſt be, and not loyterers. For Chriſt compareth the teaching of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to thinges that be of greate labour, as to plowing and fallowing of the grounde, to planting of a Uine, to rearing of a Houſe, to threſhing of Corne, to feeding of ſheepe, to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:8193:91"/>
of an Hoſte, and keeping of warre: in which thinges is required much diligence and labour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cato</hi> in his bookes of huſbandry, ſaith it was an old ſaw among huſbandmen, <hi>Qui terram co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit, ne ſedeat: eſt enim aliquid ſemper quod agat.

            <p>Therefore, if they he Paſtours, let them feede the flocke: if they be Doctours, let them teach the people: if they be watchmen, let them ſtande vppon their watche: if they bee meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, let them doe their erraunt. This is the way to buylde vp the Churche of Chriſt. This commiſſion Chriſt gaue vnto his Diſciples, <hi>Ite in mundum vniuerſum, &amp;c.

caſting down the imaginations &amp; euery hie thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captiuity euerie thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi> This is the only inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wherwith we may cut down and haue in the harueſt of God.</p>
            <p>For all mens deuiſes, Actes, Iawes, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, be the authority thereof neuer ſo great, yet are not ſufficient to content one mans conſcience.

               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the great wiſe Philoſopher on a time being ſick, when the phiſition came to him to miniſter him a potion, &amp; ſhewed him not what was in it, began to chafe and take on with him: why, ſaid he, heale not me as thou wouldeſt heale an oxe or a horſe, but ſhew me what thou giueſt me, what are the ingredients, and wherefore thou giueſt it me.

<pb facs="tcp:8193:92"/>
that the church of Chriſt was not gathered by the law, but by faith. Baſil</hi> ſaith, <hi>If you wil haue Gods wiſedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take place, al your world<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly wiſedome muſt be ſet a parte.</hi> And in like ſort <hi>Hillarius, Humanis operib. extructa no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent: aliter aedificanda Eccleſia, aliter cuſtodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enda eſt &amp;c. Things that be ſet vp with mans workmanſhip</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hillary) will not endure: the church of God muſt otherwiſe be buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and preſerued: for the foundation of it muſt be layde vppon the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. The church being thus built by God, that is to ſay, by the doctrine of God, ſhall neuer fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſpeake not this againſt all ciuil, and honeſt lawful policie: for I know it is the gift of God, without the which, nor common ſtate, nor the Church can be mainteined. But this ſeemeth to haue byn the meaning of theſe olde Fathers, that in the building of Gods church, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of Gods worde muſt goe before, to quiet mens conſciences: and wiſedome &amp; pollicie, like hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maides muſt follow after. For this honor &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue God claimeth onely to himſelfe, that his Church muſt bee built vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets. Which if it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe built, <hi>Niſi dominus aedificauerit domu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in vanum laborauerunt, qui aedificant eam. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe God himſelfe build vp the houſe, they ſweat and labour but in vain, that ſet it vp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8193:92"/>
Thus Chriſt at the beginning gathered his Church, not by lawes of men, but againſt all law &amp; policy, by the preaching of his word. God might haue inſtructed <hi>Cornelius</hi> by the Angell that appeared to him, as it appeareth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles:</hi> but he woulde not ſo, but ſent <hi>Peter</hi> to him, that he might be inſtructed by the mouth of a Preacher. Hee might haue taught <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had ſtriken him downe from his horſe, when he appeared to him, &amp; ſaid, <hi>Ego ſum Ieſus que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tu perſequeris: I am Ieſus who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou perſecuteſt:</hi> But he would not ſo, but rather left him to be taught by <hi>Ananias.</hi> And as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the <hi>Actes of the Apoſtles,</hi> at the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of <hi>Peter</hi> 3000. people were conuerted &amp; wonn in one day, that it might appeare by what tooles, and with what workemen God woulde haue his harueſt ſet forward.</p>
            <p>Nowe let vs beholde the preſent ſtate of our countrey. Theſe wordes of Chriſt our Sauiour were neuer more true, then we find them now in theſe our dayes. The harueſt is great, &amp; the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers very fewe: the poore people lyeth forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and left as it were ſheepe without a guide: the afflicted in conſcience haue no man to quiet them: they growe wilde and ſauadge, as it were a people that had no God: they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to change their religion, and forlacke of inſtruction, they know not whither to turne them: they knowe not, neither what they leaue
<pb facs="tcp:8193:93"/>
nor what they ſhould receiue.</p>
            <p>Some other defie, and ſpit at the holy goſpel of our Sauiour Chriſt, and refuſe the Couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of euerlaſting life. Some other for lacke of knowledge, followe after wilfull &amp; blinde mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and become Arrians or Pelagians, and thus they blaſpheme the ſonne of God. Some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giue themſelues ouer to their owne affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as he ſaith, reioyce and triumph in their filthineſſe, without feare of God, without conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſinne, and ſo treade downe the blood of the teſtament vnder their feete: and this do they for lacke of teaching, becauſe they haue not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, and preachers to ſhew them what they ſhould doe.</p>
            <p>O, ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt the good ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard and Biſhop of our ſoules, my harueſt is beaten down and loſt, and there is none that wil goe abroade and ſaue it. My people run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to their own deſtruction, not of malice but of verye ſimplicity, onely becauſe they are not taught, becauſe they know not my father nor me. Alas, it is not my fathers will, that anye of them ſhould be loſt.</p>
            <p>They be our brethren, they be the flocke of God, they be the harueſt, they are bought with great price: I beſeeche you, euen for that blood that was ſhed and ſpent for them and vs al, let vs not deſpiſe them.</p>
            <p>If the kingdome of God be not worthy to be
<pb facs="tcp:8193:93"/>
promoted, yet the kingdome of Satan is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye to be ouerthrowne. Now is that acceptable and ioyfull time come amongſt vs, euen nowe God hath viſited his people: now the harueſt is greate and plentious. Al the world this day lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, and groneth after the Goſpell. Let vs therefore altogether, directe our prayers to the Lord and maſter of the harueſt.</p>
            <p>Wee beſeeche thee moſt mercifull father, for thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, as thou haſt plentifully encreaſed thy harueſt, &amp; brought it to a ripenes in theſe our dayes, ſo ſende out labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, to get it in, that it be not ſpilt. Gather in al thy ſheepe that lie ſtraying w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out a heard. Ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the heartes of thine aduerſaries, that they may know the time of their viſitation, and ſee that bleſſed hope, whereunto thou haſte called them. That all the worlde with one mouth, and one minde, may know and gloryfie thee, the onely true and lyuinge God, and thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt to whom with thee, and the holy Ghoſt, be al honour and glorye.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:8193:98"/>
of it: ſo vnkinde commonly many haue bene towardes the meſſengers of Gods word.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt hymſelfe came downe from Heauen, from the boſome of his father, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to vtter &amp; to teache the Goſpell of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, and to confirme the ſame with manie a ſtraunge myracle: the poore people gaue eare vnto hym, and beleeued his doctrine, and by his wonderous workes knew him to be the ſonne of Dauid, the very Meſſias y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was promiſed them.</p>
            <p>But the Scribes &amp; Phariſes, that bare the name of Doctours, and had bene euermore brought vp in learnynge, &amp; were the inſtructors of the people, made light of Chriſtes miracles, &amp; ſaid to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, <hi>he caſteth out deuils thorow <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the chiefe of the deuils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The miracle was ſuch, that no reaſonable man would haue thought it to be wrought by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil. The poore man that before had ben deafe, was now able to heare: that before was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the deuill, was now deliuered: that before was ſicke, was now reſtored to his health. The poore people marueiled at the doing, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified God. But the Phariſies cryed out againſt him. <hi>In <hi>Beelzebub principe daemoniorum, eiicit daemonia.</hi> He caſteth out deuils through Beel zebub, the chiefe of</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>deuils.</hi> Not becauſe it was true, nor becauſe it was likely to be true, nor becauſe they in their conſcience thought it to bee true: but onely to bring Chriſt in hatred
<pb facs="tcp:8193:98"/>
w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the people, &amp; to deface his doctrin, And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they blaſphemed that, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> indeede they coulde not deny: &amp; that they knew to be the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, they ſaid it proceeded from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil.</p>
            <p>Chriſte our Sauiour putteth backe theſe ſlaunders with diuers reaſons, whereof at this time for ſhortnes ſake, I wyll touche but two. The firſt reaſon is: Euery kingdome that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided in it ſelfe, ſhal be brought to deſolation: if Satan be deuided againſt him ſelfe, then muſt his kingdome needes be diſſolued, &amp; that by his owne workyng. But that is not likely. For al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angels of Satan agree and conſpire together to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vpholding of their kingdome: therfore muſt you needes confeſſe that I haue remoued this deuil by ſome other greater power, &amp; not by the power of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the chiefeſt of the deuils.</p>
            <p>Here perhaps, ſome man wil replie that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, &amp; coniurers oftentimes chaſe away one de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uil by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane of an other. Poſſible it is ſo, but that is wroughte, not by power, but by collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuils. For one deuil, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better to attain his purpoſe, will giue place, &amp; make as though he ſtood in awe of another deuil. And by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, to touch but a worde or two of this matter for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the horrible vſing of your poore ſubiectes infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth therunto: It may pleaſe your grace to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this kind of people, I meane witches, &amp; ſorcerers, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in theſe fewe laſt yeres, are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilouſly increaſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in this your graces realm.
<pb facs="tcp:8193:99"/>
Theſe eyes haue ſeene moſt euident and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt markes of their wickedneſſe. Your graces ſubtectes pine away euen vnto the death, their colour fadeth, their fleſh rotteth, their ſpeach is benummed, their ſences are bereft.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, your poore ſubiects moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto your highnes, is, that the lawes touching ſuch malefactours, may bee put in due execution. For the ſchole of them is great, their doinges horible, their malice intollerable, the examples moſt miſerable. And I pray GOD, they neuer practiſe further, then vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubiect. But this onely by the way, theſe be the ſcholers of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> the chiefe captaine of the deuils.</p>
            <p>This firſt reaſon that Chriſt vſeth, is taken of common experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For natwithſtanding there be nothing ſo puiſſant, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force of a kingdom: yet if it be deuided in it ſelf, it wyl periſh &amp; come to confuſion. For, concord and agreement is the ſtrength and maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of al ſtates. Break the hoopes of a veſſel, &amp; al the boordes wil fal aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples hereof are too rife. The migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt kingdomes that euer were, by ſuch meanes haue bene conquered, &amp; fallen into the power of their enemies.</p>
            <p>Therfore, <hi>Eſay</hi> prophecying the deſtruction of the kingdome of the Jewes, ſayeth, firſte the people ſhal fal at diſſention within themſelues, and then ſhould folow their confuſion.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Emperour &amp; his ſonne
<pb facs="tcp:8193:99"/>
               <hi>Titus</hi> came with an armie againſt <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> the whole natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Jewes was deuided into three factions, eche of them ready to vndo the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Then folowed the ouerthrow of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Then was <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> raſed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: Then were there ſlayne of the Jewes to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 1100000. Once agayne I wil ſay it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is marueilous, and moſt true, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> (who was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a capitain there in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field) writeth there were then ſlayne of the Jewes of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, no leſſe then 1100000.</p>
            <p>Of late yeeres, the diſſention betweene two brothers, brought all <hi>Graecia</hi> &amp; <hi>Aſia,</hi> &amp; al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Eaſte parts of Chriſtendome, into the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Turke.</hi> But what needeth vs to goe to <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> or to <hi>Turkie</hi> for examples:</p>
            <p>This kingdome of ours, the mightieſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt, the richeſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſedeſt lande that is, or euer was vnder heauen, coulde neuer yet be conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any enemie, but onely at ſuch time, as the people were at varia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mſelues. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> with a ſmal number, then were the Engliſh <hi>Saxons,</hi> then were the <hi>Danes,</hi> then was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandie</hi> able to ouerrunne vs, and to poſſeſſe our countrie.</p>
            <p>Therefore the prince that deſireth to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, laboureth not ſo muche to furniſhe his owne men, and to make himſelfe ſtrong, as to ſet diſcord among his enemies. For that is a ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifeſt token of their vndoing, &amp; that Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb facs="tcp:8193:100"/>
is at hand. And for that cauſe, <hi>Herodian</hi> an old writer pronounceth, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> as much as warre is worſe then peace: ſo much is ciuill ſedition worſe then warre. And <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> in his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſaieth, <hi>haec res ſola facit, vt magna imperia ſint mortalia: <hi>Diſſenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only, ſaith he, cauſeth that great Empires can not continue but haue an end.</hi>
               </hi> For, if the one part conquere, and haue the victory, it is euen as if a man with his right hand would maime himſelfe, and chop off the left. This example Chriſt vſeth to confound the malice of the Phariſies.</p>
            <p>The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reaſon is this: If I caſt out deuils by the power of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> by what power doe your children my diſciples, <hi>Iohn, Iames, Peter, Andrew,</hi> &amp; the reſt caſt them out? They graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Chriſtes diſciples wrought miracles, onely by the name of God. And yet that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the ſcholers, euen of malice &amp; hatred, and contrarie to their conſcience, they repoued and blaſphemed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maſter. Hereof Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, if I caſt out deuils in the power of god, then doubtleſſe the kingdome of God is among you: your own childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe iudges ouer you.</p>
            <p>Now to applie theſe wordes vnto this our preſent time, wherein vnder a moſt godly and gracious prince, the trueth of Chriſtes Goſpell is freely preached, Gods holy name therfore be prayſed for euer.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Moſes</hi> in his time was counted a ſorcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer:
<pb facs="tcp:8193:100"/>
as the Jewes were called deſpiſers of al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſeditious, and heady agaynſt their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: as the Apoſtles were counted dronken, and full of new wine: as al Chriſtians were called i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters, worſhippers of <hi>Bacchus</hi> &amp; <hi>Ceres,</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, inceſtious, &amp; adulterers: as <hi>S. Paul</hi> for his preaching, was iudged a Rebel: and al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were taken for enemies of all common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates: euen ſo in theſe latter daies, all theſe or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> like crimes, haue bene laid to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> preachers &amp; profeſſors of Chriſtes Goſpel: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thei haue bene godleſſe, ſeditious, rebelles, deſpiſers of good orders, inceſtious, adulterers, maſters of al ſinne and wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p>But this is our comfort, that nothing can be deuiſed to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt vs, but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time hath bene deuiſed &amp; ſpoken againſt Chriſt hymſelfe. For he himſelf was called a Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion of publicans &amp; harlotes, a gluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a lyar, a blaſphemer, a ſubuerter, of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whole nation, a ſeducer of the people, a rebell againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> a ſorcerer, a worker by the deuill, and a breaker of the Sabboth day,</p>
            <p>We are ſet vp, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> as a marke for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake againſt, &amp; whatſoeuer be ſpoken of vs, be it neuer ſo vntrue or vnlikely, yet are there ſome that wyll beleeue it. Yea ſuch thinges as woulde not bee beleeued ſpoken of a theefe, or a murtherer, wyl ſoone be beleeued of hym that profeſſeth the name and Goſpell of Jeſus <note place="margin">Ieremy. 5.</note> Chriſt. <hi>Woe is mee,</hi> my mother (ſayth <hi>Ierimy)
<pb facs="tcp:8193:101"/>
that thou haſt borne me a contentious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; a man that ſtriueth with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole earth: I haue neither lent on vſury, nor men haue le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto me on vſurie: yet euery one doth curſe mee.</hi> The vntrue report of theſe things cauſed ſuch extremitie as this day you may heare of in other countries, and ſome times haue ſeene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently before your eyes.</p>
            <p>Princes, &amp; noble men hated the doctrine of the Goſpel, before they knew it. They hated it, and thought ill of it, not of malice, nor againſt their conſcience, nor againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teſtimony of the holye ghoſt, but only of ignorance, becauſe they lacked inſtruction, They had a zeale, &amp; a feeling of god, but not according to knowledge. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doinge as they did, they thought they dyd God high ſeruice.</p>
            <p>This curteſie had chriſt our ſauieur ſhewed him when he was in the worlde. The ſame cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie muſt they looke for, that wil become chriſts diſciples. They ſayd of Chriſt, that whatſoeuer he did, he did it in the name of <hi>Beelzebub</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chief of the deuils. Euen ſo, whereas it hath pleaſed almightie God to bleſſe vs with the true Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge, and light of his holy Goſpell: yet there are ſome that condemne it, and call it hereſie, &amp; beare the people in hand, that all this doctrine is nothing els but a renuing of old hereſies.</p>
            <p>It is a greeuous matter for a Chriſtian man, iuſtly to be accuſed of hereſie. For whoſoeuer
<pb facs="tcp:8193:101"/>
is an heretique, is an enemie of god, and a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and deſtroyer of all true Religion. And therefore, vnleſſe the crime bee marueilous eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he doeth great wrong that calleth any man heretique: and though a man be falſely charged, yet may he not diſſemble it. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> would ſay, that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were not a Chriſtian, whoſoeuer would abide to be called an heretique. All other iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may be borne withall, but this is ſuche and ſo hainous a crime, that vnleſſe it be manifeſtly euident, no man may ſuffer to be ſo iudged: and it ſhould not be beleeued, when it is layde to the charge of any Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, for as much as the cauſe is gods, and pertaineth to the conſcience of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, let it be as lawfull for the poore man that is vniuſtly hurt, to make his ſalue, as others think it lawfull for them to giue the wound.</p>
            <p>Chriſt our Sauiour, when he was thus char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, made anſwer, <hi>Si ego in Beelzebub eiicio dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia, filii veſtri in quo e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iciunt? If I through Beelzebub caſt out deuils, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe your children caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out?</hi> So may we ſay to ſuch as this daye bee aduerſaries to this cauſe, and ſpeake agaynſt vs. If we be heretikes that teach this doctrine, what are the ancient Fathers, the Doctours, and the Apoſtles that haue taught the ſame: If they were Catholiques, and haue bene euermore ſo taken, writinge as they dyd, howe is it that onely wee are not Catholiques,
<pb facs="tcp:8193:102"/>
writing &amp; ſaying as they did? they ſhal iudge on our ſide againſt you. And would God in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt &amp; ſpecialeſt poynts of our controuerſies, all parts would be contented to ſtand to their iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo ſhould al contention be ſoone at anend.</p>
            <p>For I call Heauen and Earth to witneſſe, and ſpeake it before God and his holy Angels, and before the conſciences of al them that ſpeak agaynſt vs, that touchinge the very ſubſtance of religion, wee teache nothinge this day, but that hath bene taught before by Chriſt him ſelfe: ſet abroade by his Apoſtles: continued in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, and maintained by the olde and ancient Doctors.</p>
            <p>And in one or two wordes onely to giue a taſte of the ſame, that thereby ye may the better iudge of the reſt:</p>
            <p>Wee ſaye, that in the Sacrament after the conſecration, remaineth the ſubſtance &amp; nature of bread and wine. The ſame ſaith. <hi>S. Auguſtine, S. Chryſoſtome, Theodoretus, Gelaſius,</hi> &amp; others. <hi>Gelaſius</hi> wordes are ſo plaine, as no man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie them: <hi>Non deſinit eſſe ſubſtantia panis &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni. There leaueth not to be the ſubſtance of bread and wine.</hi> Thus wrote they, and were Catholiques.</p>
            <p>We ſay, that Chriſtes laſt Supper muſt be vſed as a communion, &amp; frequented with more then one. So Chriſt ordeined it, ſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Apoſtles, the Primitiue Church, and all the olde Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb facs="tcp:8193:102"/>
practiſed it, and neuer was there any of them that euer made me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of a priuate Maſſe: Thus did they, and yet were they Catholiques.</p>
            <p>We ſay, the holy Communion or ſacrament of the breaking &amp; ſhedding of the body and blood of Chriſte, ought of neceſſitie to bee vſed vnder both kindes: Thus did all the Doctors vſe it. And <hi>Gelaſius</hi> an old father ſaith, <hi>that otherwiſe to vſe it, is open ſacriledge.</hi> And for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſpace of 1000. yeeres after Chriſt, there can no example be found to the contrary. Thus did they, and yet were Catholiques.</p>
            <p>We ſay, the publique prayers ought to be in the common tongue: that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> ought not to take vpon him to be the head of the vniuerſal Church: that the prince is of right, &amp; by the authority that god hath giuen hym, the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ruler of his Church and Realme, as well of the eccleſiaſticall officers, as of the temporall.</p>
            <p>And all theſe thinges bee aduouched &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> examples of the primatiue Church, by the olde general Councels, and by the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And the contray here of ſhall neuer be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, nor by old father or Doctor, nor by aucient councel, nor by example of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> primatiue Church, nor by any ſufficient authoritie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. I leaue the reſt, for it were an infinite la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſay as much as might be ſaide.</p>
            <p>Thus they taught, thus dyd they, &amp; were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes: &amp; alas, are we ſayinge the ſame, onely
<pb facs="tcp:8193:103"/>
becauſe we ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, become heretiques: that was once true, is it now become falſe: that was once Catholique doctrine, is it now at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hereſie: O, mercifull God, was it thy wil, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy trueth ſhould be true but for a ſeaſon, vntil there ſhould come men to decree the contrary: If we be heretiques that teach the ſame that the olde Doctours of the Church taught, what then are they, that teach contrary to the Doctours:</p>
            <p>Chriſt our Sauiour to reproue the Phariſes, thought it ſufficient to ſay to them, <hi>Hoc Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham non fecit. This thing Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer did.</hi> Therefore are you not the children of Abraham. Euen ſo may we truely ſay to ſuch as holde not themſelues contented with this doctrine, theſe things that you do, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> neuer did. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> neuer did: none of the ancient fathers euer did: the Apoſtles in the Catholike primatiue Church neuer did: therefore yee are not the children of <hi>S. Auguſtine:</hi> ye are not the children of <hi>S. Hierome:</hi> ye are not the children of any of the olde catholique doctors: ye are not the children of Chriſtes primatiue, Catholyke, and vuiuerſal Church.</p>
            <p>It may not become me to ſette order in theſe thinges: yet if it were lawfull, I woulde wyſh that once agayne, as time ſhoulde ſerue, there might be had a quiet and a ſober diſputation: that eche parte might be required to ſhew their groundes, without ſelfe wyll, and without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
<pb facs="tcp:8193:103"/>
not to mayntayne or breede contention, (for I truſt it ſhould be the way to take away al contention) but onely that the trueth may bee knowen, many conſciences quieted, and the right ſtone tryed, by compariſon of the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite. For, at the laſt diſputation that ſhould haue bene, you know whiche partie gaue ouer, and would not meddle. Some will ſaye, the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges wyll not be indifferent. And alas, what man that doubteth his owne matter, wyll euer think the Iudges indifferent: Let the whole worlde let our our aduerſaries, them ſelues bee Iudges heerm, (affection put apart) let our aduerſaries themſelues be Iudges. What can wee offer more? if this bee not ſufficient, what can there be ſufficient:</p>

Then <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> an old gentleman, and one of his army ſayd to hym, O ſir, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your promiſe, you lacke men, now let vs ſee your ſwarme of Souldiers.</p>

It is wel knowne that it hath bene ſpoken, both in this place, and in other lyke, that al the Doctours, and al the general councels were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. Nowe the armie is diſcomſtted, nowe they ſtande in neede of men, nowe let them call for their Doctours and Councels: if they come but with one ſufficient Doctour or Councell, they may haue the field.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake not this to boaſt my ſelf of any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but the goodnes of the cauſe maketh me y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holder. Neither woulde I haue in this behalfe ſaid ſo much as I haue, ſauing that the matter it ſelfe, &amp; very neceſſitie inforced me ſo to doe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, it were great pitie that Gods trueth ſhoulde be defaced w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> priuy whiſperings. It were great pitie that whole houſes ſhoulde be ouerthrowen, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s conſciences wounded, the people deceiued, Gods trueth and the loue thereof pulled from your heartes, his woorke blaſphemed, as if it came from <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any good ground, without any authorytie of the Scripture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any example of the Primatiue Churche, without Counſell, without any auncient Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour or father.</p>
            <p>But they haue another kinde of learuynge, which becauſe wee haue not, therefore they ſay we are vnlearned. For if controuerſies might haue bene tryed by learnyng, you ſhoulde neuer haue ſeene the Maſſe agayne after it was once downe.</p>

If there euer come another change, as I pray God wee may neuer ſee, nor ſurely euer ſhall wee, vnleſſe our vnkindneſſe pull downe Gods plague vppon vs: but, if a change come, ſuche a one as they looke for, you ſhall ſee with what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument they wyll proue their Maſſe. We reade that Chriſt dyd put the Phariſes to ſilence, yet afterwarde when their tyme came, they ſayde, <hi>We haue a lawe, and by our law he muſt die.</hi> But Gods name be prayſed, no perſecutions, no torments, no fire, no fagot, haue euer weakened the cauſe of the Goſpel. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Plures</hi>

               <hi>Pirrhus</hi> a luſtie gentleman, and Kinge of <hi>Epyrus,</hi> when he firſt tooke Counſell with hys Nobles to wage warre againſt the Romanes, heard ſaye hee might ſoone conquere them, for that they were nothinge elſe but a ſorte of wilde and harbarours people: but afterward, when he

came to the view of the Romanes army indeed, and ſawe their Captaines and Souldiers wel appoynted, and their flagges, and ſtandardes in good order: mary (quoth he) whether theſe men be barbarous or no, I cannot tel, but wel I wot their behauiour, and the order of their campe is not barbarous.</p>
            <p>So, what accompt ſoeuer men make of this doctrine, that god be thanked is taught this day, yet whoſoeuer ſhall come neere &amp; view it well, and try it to the vttermoſt, and ſhall finde that al thinges are done ſeemely and orderly according to the olde doctours, to the Apoſtles, and to the primatiue Church of Chriſt, ſhall fall downe to the grounde, and confeſſe that the order and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner therof, or any thing that is taught therein, is not hereticall.</p>

               <hi>Saint Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſent his diſciples to Chriſt to knowe whether hee were the true Meſſias or no, or els, whether they ſhould looke for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Chriſt made them anſwer, <hi>Go and ſhewe Iohn what thinges ye haue hard and ſeene:</hi>

number of errours are now reuealed, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is remoued, idolatrie is taken away, the Sacramentes are rightlye and duly vſed, the dombe ſpeake, the blinde ſee, the poore afflicted mindes receiue the Goſpell, the prayers are in ſuch ſort as the people may take profit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by them. God giue vs grace to know how great neede we haue to pray, that in all places we may lift vp cleane handes and heartes vnto God, and cal vpon him in ſpirit and truth.</p>
            <p>If this be hereſie, then, alas, what is true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?

            <p>O good brethen, this is the worke of Gods right hande, the kingdome of God doubtleſſe is come vppon vs, the prince of errour is put to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the readineſſe of the people vniuerſally &amp; in al places is marueilous, kinges and princes ſuffer themſelues to be led captiues to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt.

time as to any mans reaſon it might ſeeme im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: when al the world, the people, prieſts, &amp; princes were ouerwhelmed with ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of God was put out of ſight: when he that tooke vpon him the generall rule of altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was crept into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy place, &amp; had poſſeſſed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience of man, as if he had bene God, and had ſet himſelfe aboue the ſcriptures of God, &amp; gaue out decrees, that whatſoeuer he ſhould do, no man ſhoulde finde fault with him: when all ſchooles, prieſts, biſhops, &amp; kings of the worlde were ſworne to hym, that whatſoeuer he tooke in hand, they ſhould vphold it: when he had choſen kings ſonnes &amp; brothers to be his Cardinales: when his Legats &amp; eſpies were in euery kings councel: when nothing could be attempted any where, but he by &amp; by muſt haue knowledge of it: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whoſoeuer had but muttered againſt his doinges, muſt ſtraight waies haue bene exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, &amp; put to moſt cruel death, as Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: when no man could haue thought there had bene any hope, that euer theſe dayes ſhould haue bene ſeene that God of his mercy hath giuen vs to ſee: when al things were voide of al hope, and full of deſperation:</p>
            <p>Euen then, I ſay, euen then, contrarye to all mans reaſon, God brought all theſe thinges to paſſe. Euen then God defeited their policies, not with ſhielde or Speare, but only with the ſpirit of his mouthe, that is with preachinge of the

            <p>This is the day which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord hath wrought: to thee o Lord, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prayſe hereof is due: thou haſt tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned our mourning into ioy: thou haſt put to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of error: thou haſt inflamed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hearts of thy people: thou haſt brought princes &amp; kings to the obedience of thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt: thou haſt opened the eyes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world to eſpy out, &amp; to cry for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel.

            <p>
               <hi>Iuſtinus</hi> the martir ſaith, he was firſt turned to Chriſt: for the admiration that he had of the innocent and godly life of Chriſtian men.</p>
            <p>Such then was the life of them that bare the name of Chriſt, they came to learne, they lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to liue. You might haue knowne theyr pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, by the onely changing of their maners. The court wherin they liued, was ſo reuerently kept, without notable ſinne or wantonnes, as if it has ben the temple of God.</p>
            <p>O almighty God, howe fares it nowe with
<pb facs="tcp:8193:107"/>
them that woulde be called Chriſtians, and bee reckoned among profeſſors of the Goſpel? how many are there that come to learne? how many are there that learne to liue? howe many are there that may be knowne by changing of their maners? Unleſſe it be, for that they make a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie of Gods holy Goſpel, and ſo become more diſſolute, more fleſhly, more wanton, then euer they were afore.</p>
            <p>What court can we finde, that any part may be lyke the temple of God? Seldome is it, that almightye God may bee hearde to ſpeake hys minde. But when he hath ſpoken, who is he that thinketh vpon it? who is he that doth not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe it? who is he that ſpurneth not at it?</p>
            <p>If our life ſhould giue teſtimonie and report of our religion, ſory I am to ſpeake it, but alas, it is to true in too many, it cryeth out, <hi>Non eſt Deus:</hi> the very courſe of our life beareth wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt vs, that in our heartes wee thinke there is no God, and that there is no feare of God before our eyes. I amplifie not, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the matter: I woulde to God it were no more then I make of it.</p>
            <p>Thus we doe withholde the trueth of God in vnrighteouſneſſe: thus the grace of God is abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the contenting of our pleaſures: thus wee become the veſſels of Gods wrath, and heape vp vengeance vpon our heads. Therefore wil God take away his holy ſpirit from vs, therefore wyl

God giue vs ouer to a reprobate minde, therfore ſhal y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of vs be worſe then was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning.</p>
            <p>O good brethren, let vs not abuſe the mercy of god, let vs not receiue the grace of god in vaine. Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber how many eyes are ſet vpon vs, let vs take occaſion away from them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſeeke occaſion to ſclander our profeſſion: let not, let not our life cauſe the goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt to be yl ſpoken of and blaſphemed: let vs walke ſo as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them that are called, and in deede are <hi>Filii lucis, The children of light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The trueth of the goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt hath nowe ſhined ouer the whole worlde: if it be yet hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from any, it is hidden fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them that periſh: he that periſheth nowe, ſhall periſh in his owne blood. Now, if any beleeue not, he is inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The wiſdom of god in publiſhing his word, contrary &amp; againſt the courſe of mans policie: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> continual preaching of it in al places: the aſhes of ſo many learned fath ers &amp; godly men &amp; wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who haue yeelded their bodies to the cruel torments of tyrants, to bee conſumed in the fire for the teſtimony therof, are yet ſo freſh in your eies, &amp; ſpoken of in your hearinge, and witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in your hartes and conſciences, that you can not denie, but the kingdome of God is come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs.</p>
            <p>But if there be any, that is not perſwaded in his religion, (for aſmuch as it is a matter of lyfe and death, of ſaluation &amp; damnation) I beſeeche
<pb facs="tcp:8193:108"/>
you before God, and before his Chriſt, let vs not be careles, let vs not be negligent. If we miſlike it, let vs read the Scriptures, and know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we miſlike it.</p>
            <p>Diſpiſe not good brethren, deſpiſe not to heare gods worde declared. As you tender your owne ſoules, be diligent to come to ſermons: for that is the ordinary place, where mens hearts be moued, &amp; Gods ſecrets be reuealed. For be the preacher neuer ſo weake, yet is the word of God as mightie, &amp; as puiſant as euer it was. If thou heare Gods worde ſpoken by a weake man, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ignorant man, a ſinner as thou thy ſelfe art, and yet wilt beleeue it, and heare it with reuerence: it is able to open thine eyes, and to reueale vnto thee the high miſteries of thy ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Remember we are the ſonnes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. The kingdome of God is come amongſt vs. Let vs not withſtand the Spirit of God: let vs not treade downe the blood of the euerlaſting Teſtament.

            <p>That wee may the better diſcerne the light, let vs beholde the darkeneſſe of that time, which was before. The whole worlde was diuided into the people of the Iewes, and the heathens: and beſides theſe, there were no other people. The Heathens were forſaken of God: the Iewes were his choſen people. The Heathens woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the workers of their owne handes, and gaue the glory of God vnto creatures, whiche are not God. They went after Idols, euen as they were lead: they had many goddes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number of their Cities: they deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp their bodies to all manner filthines: God
<pb facs="tcp:8193:111"/>
gaue them ouer to followe their luſtes. The Fathers amongeſt them ſlewe their owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and offered them vp in Sacrifice to Diuels. So ſtrongly did the Prince of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe poſſeſſe them, they had not the Arke of the Teſtimonie, they liued without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, or couenaunt, or Chriſte, or God: they liued without hope, or light, or comforte. In ſuch a night, and ſuch a darkeneſſe lay the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
            <p>The Iewes, Gods choſen people, they were alſo bereft of knowledge: there was no prophet left among them, nor any to teache them the wil of the Lord. The lawe did periſh from the prieſt, and counſel from the auncient: light was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into darkneſſe, and iudgement into worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood: they were bitter and grieuous to the poore: they ſlew the Prophets which were ſent vnto them, they did for ſake the fountaine of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing waters, and followed <hi>Baal</hi> and <hi>Aſtaroth. Like people, like Prieſtes: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſole of the</hi>

               <hi>haue no pleaſure in you, neither wil I accept an offering at your hand.</hi> Of them he ſayde, <note place="margin">Eſa. 1.</note> 
               <hi>When you ſhal ſtretch out your hands, I wil hide mine eies from you: and though you make many prayers, I will not heare you,</hi> In ſuch a darkeneſſe laye the Iewes, in ſuche a darkeneſſe laye the Gentiles. All had ſinned,
<pb facs="tcp:8193:112"/>
they were all corrupt and abhominable in their wayes, they were the Children of wrath, and the veſſelles of diſtruction. So were they wrapt in the cloude of ignoraunce, and couered in the ſhadowe of death. Suche was the night <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſpake of, ſo vglie, ſo darke, ſo voyde of comfort.</p>
            <p>But God gaue foorth his light to ſhyne vppon them, he ſent the Patriarches and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, and holye Fathers, hee ſent vnto them <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and Angelles from Heauen, to giue out ſparkes of this light. Hee made it appeare by his Prophete <hi>Eſaie, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eſa. 7.</note> 
               <hi>the Virgine ſhall conceyue, and beare a Sonne, and ſhee ſhall call his name Emanuell. In him ſhall all Iſrael bee ſaued, hee is the light to lighten the Gentiles, his name ſhall be called wonderfull, counſeller, the mightie God, the euerlaſting father, the Prince of peace: in him ſhal al the endes of the worlde bee bleſſed.</hi> This light they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde, when it was not cleerely opened vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, they did ſee it comming, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced in it, they were vnder a Schoolemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and had not the perfect knowledge of this light.</p>
            <p>But nowe God hath ſcattered all theſe Cloudes, and wee beholde as in a mirrour the glorye of the Lorde with open face. Our elder Fathers in the olde Teſtament had onely
<pb facs="tcp:8193:112"/>
a dimme candle to guide their Feete, we haue the bright Sunne beames: They had onelye the greene blade of the Corne, wee haue the plentifull encreaſe, euen as in the time of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt: they had the ſhadowe, we haue the light: they had onely a droppe to refreſhe themſelues, wee haue the whole ſtreame of Gods mercie powred out vppon vs.</p>
            <p>Nowe hath God remembred his holie coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt, and the othe whiche hee ſware to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abraham:</hi> nowe the woorde was made fleſhe, and dwelt with vs. The day ſtarre is ſprong vp in our heartes, the Spirite of God hath filled the whole world: the earth is full of his glorye. The Idols of the Heathen are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and are put to ſilence: their greateſt myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries appeare to bee follies, and are laught to ſcorne, the children make games of them in their ſtreetes. Sathan the Prince of this worlde, which is the accuſer of our brethren, is now caſt foorth.</p>
            <p>Nowe is it knowen, that ſaluation, and power, and glory belongeth to our God. Hee hath rayſed his Chriſte, and hath eſtabliſhed his kingdome, the kings and nations of the worlde ſhall walke in his light, and his light ſhall not bee put out, and his kingdome ſhall haue no ende. Nowe is that newe <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> the glorious Citie of our God reuealed from on high: nowe hath God made the Heauens newe
<pb facs="tcp:8193:113"/>
and a newe earth, and hath fixed his Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and dwelling place among men. The ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of time is come, the ſounde of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles is gone through all the earth: the Sunne of righteouſneſſe hath appeared: he is the light and comfort of the whole worlde. This is the gracious yeere of mercye, this is the daye whiche the Lorde hath made. Nowe is the mercy of the Lorde ſhewed more and more towardes vs, and his trueth endureth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. When <hi>Balaam</hi> the falſe Prophete, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the glorye of this time, hee brake out and ſayde, <hi>Who ſhall liue when GOD doeth</hi>

               <hi>this?</hi> Who ſhall liue, and ſee, and enioy theſe thinges?</p>
            <p>Awake therefore, or ariſe from ſleepe, the time ſo requireth: <hi>For nowe is our Saluation neerer then when we beleeued it.</hi> Of thoſe few words, haue growen diuers ſenſes, al good and godly: yet in my iudgement, the ſimpleſt and playneſt ſenſe is this. When we were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and ſate in darkneſſe, we thought we did well, and that wee ſhoulde be ſaued in that way, in whiche wee walked: and that there was no hope of ſaluation, but onelie in that: and wee had a great liking in our doinges. This is the vanitie, and miſerie of man: oftetimes where he thinketh himſelfe moſt ſure, he is deepely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued.</p>
            <p>The Turks &amp; the Iewes at this day, &amp; others

the enemies of the croſſe of Chriſt, thinke there is no other true religion but theirs: &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are woonderfull zealous, and ſtande in it vnto death: no perſwaſion nor force can remooue them. When the people of <hi>Epheſus</hi> heard of the <note place="margin">Act. 19.</note> preaching of <hi>Paul,</hi> they rayſed vproare, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Citie full of tumult: they caught <hi>Gaius</hi> and <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> men of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> companions in his iourney, and woulde haue ſlayne them: they made an outcrie, ſaying, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians,</hi> ſhe is a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, ſhe hath made Heauen and Earth, we haue put our truſt in her, we will call vpon her, and ſhe will heare vs. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhe weth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note>

Circumcelliones,</hi> which were a ſorte of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes ſprong out of the Donatiſtes about 420. yeeres after Chriſt, through zeale murthered one another, they threwe them ſelues downe from high rockes and deſtroyed them ſelues, and thought that, the onely way to pleaſe God: ſo hot and feruent was their deuotion. The
<pb facs="tcp:8193:114"/>
children of light haue ſeldome ſuffered more, or more willingly, or with more affiance, then the children of darkeneſſe: ſo ſtriued they for God, but againſt God: and abuſed his name agaynſt him ſelfe, and wittingly and willingly went downe to Hell. They haue great zeale and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire of the glorye of GOD, but not according to knowledge. They contented them ſelues with that they had receiued of their Fathers, &amp; would ſeeke no further they thought they did ſerue GOD, but they blaſphemed the Name of the Sonne of GOD. In ſuche ſorte did God ſuffer them to walke in the blindeneſſe of their heart. In the latter day many ſhall ſay <note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> vnto Chriſt, <hi>Lorde, Lorde, haue wee not by thy Name prophecied? and by thy Name caſt out Diuels? &amp; by thy Name done many greate workes?</hi> Wee haue prayed, and giuen almes for thy ſake: was it not done of zeale &amp; deuotion towardes thee? So well ſhall they be perſwaded of their doinges, they ſhall preſſe boldely to the throne of Gods Maieſty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their meede.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt ſhall aunſweare them, <hi>I neuer knewe you:</hi> you ſerued your fancie, you ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not mee: your almes, and miracles, and your prayers ſhall condemne you.

but are deceiued. Euen ſo, hee prayed his father for them that crucified him, and ſtood by, and reuiled him, O Father, thou art full of mercie, forgiue them, they are moued of zeale, and thinke they pleaſe thee, they knowe not what they doe, they knowe not thee, nor mee thy Sonne whom thou haſt ſent. <hi>Saint Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>

            <p>We were drowned in darkeneſſe (ſayth the Apoſtle) yet thought we had the light. I my ſelfe (ſaith hee) was a blaſphemer, and did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Church of God: I followed the way of my fathers, I had a great zeale, and thought I did well, but the way wherein I walked, was ſlippery, the light was darkeneſſe.

<pb facs="tcp:8193:115"/>
I was blinde, yet perceiued it not, and therefore was my blindeneſſe and miſerie ſo muche the more.</p>
            <p>But now is our Saluation come neere vnto vs: our bodies are made the Temples of God, and his ſpirit dwelleth within vs. We haue the woorde of life put both in our mouth, and in our heart: the kingdome of God is in the middes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs. The Sonne of God calleth vnto vs, <hi>Come vnto me al ye that trauel and be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily laden, and I wil refreſh you.

When <hi>Paul</hi> heard the voyce of Chriſt from heauen aboue, he fell flat on the earth, and being aſtonied, ſayde, Lord, what wilt thou that I do? I am thy ſeruaunt, and the ſonne of thy hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayde: make me to doe that thou commandeſt me to doe.</p>
            <p>Then coulde neither life, nor death, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor thinges preſent, nor thinges to come, nor height, nor depthe, nor any other Creature ſeparate Paule from the loue of God whiche is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lorde: then hee eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to knowe anye thinge ſauing Ieſus Chriſt, and him crucified.

Whoſoeuer putteth his hande to the plough, and looketh backe, is vnmeete for the

kingdome of heauen. Theſe thinges are ſent for our vnderſtanding: GOD hath giuen his worde vnto vs. We haue ſeene the workes of God, the doumbe to ſpeake, the deafe to heare, the blynde to ſee, the lame to goe, the dead to riſe and come out of their graues: the Sunne to be darkened, the earth to quake, rockes to rent, and the Diuell to confeſſe the Sonne of God: for he was forced to ſay, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Sonne of God.</hi> Nowe doth the kingdome of heauen ſuffer violence. The night is paſſed, the daye is at hande: we haue ſlumbered enough in ignoraunce, it is nowe time, we knowe the bleſſinges which GOD hath beſtowed vppon vs: it is time wee ſhoulde be thankefull, and awake out of the ſleepe of forgetfulneſſe, that wee humble our ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mighty hande of God, and dreame no more of our owne ſtrength: our conſcience is charged: we cannot pleade ignoraunce: it is time that we riſe: the mercie of God, the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of his bleſſing, the feare of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the regarde of our ſaluation ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
            <p>Let vs caſt away the workes of darkeneſſe: they bee vnfruitefull, lotheſome, and horrible, They darken the hearte, and blinde the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: hee that doeth them ſhall bee caſt into vtter darkeneſſe. Let vs bee afrayde, let

            <p>The firſt is gluttonie and drunkennes, the roote and mother of al euill: nothinge ſtandeth ſafe, where wine preuayleth.

            <p>Now, ſomewhat more ſpecially to applie the woordes of the Apoſtle to this preſent time. <hi>It is now time alſo,</hi> that wee ſhould ariſe from ſleepe.

            <p>Let vs looke backe to the time late paſt, and beholde the night of errour, and ignoraunce. What ſhall I ſay? Where ſhould I beginne, or howe may I ende? The matter is of great compaſſe: the time I haue to ſpeake is but ſhorte: and I haue no delight to ſpeake of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. After God had deliuered the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and giuen them paſſage through the red ſea, Marie the Propheteſſe, ſiſter of <hi>Aaron</hi>

            <p>Euen ſo, let vs caſt backe our eies, &amp; make a view of the Church. Loth I am to ſpeake of it: Yet it is nedefull to ſay ſomewhat thereof, that we way reioyce in our deliueraunce. All thinges were done in a ſtrang tounge: the prieſt ſpake, and the people hearde they knewe not what. No man coulde ſay Amen to their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

The holy Scriptures, which are the light to direct our wayes, and the power of God to ſaue our ſoules, wer hid vnder a buſhel. Whoſoeuer built him ſelfe and his faith vpon them, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged an Heretike. Marriage was forbidden, and fornication ſuffered. They did not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure widowes houſes, but drew to them ſelues the fat of the land, by pretence of their long prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

            <p>Yet will I ſhewe you one of their night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birdes, lately hatched in the neſt of all ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

            <p>O, what a ſhepheard is he, that nowe in this light of the day, thus mocketh and deceiueth the lambes and ſheepe of Chriſt? Is this to woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe Chriſt in ſpirite and trueth? Is this the hope we haue in Chriſt? Is this the profeſſion of the Goſpell? Is this the will of GOD, to commit our liues to ſo vile a cake? Howbeeit, there is no cauſe why any man ſhoulde maruell hereat. For, ignorance which is the mother of errour, by their owne confeſſion, is become the mother of deuotion: and theſe bee the fruites, and children of blindneſſe and ignorance. I will ſpeake nothing of that man from whence this geare commeth. Woulde God hee were the man he woulde ſeeme to bee. But if the light it ſelfe be darkeneſſe, how great then is the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Yet they ſay of him, his voyce muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, as the voyce of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the worde of God him ſelfe muſt take authoritie and credite of him. Thus hath hee come betweene, like a Cloude, and eclipſed the ſunne of Gods glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Goſpell.</p>
            <p>If wee beholde eyther their Schooles, or their Churches, their quier, their pulpit, their prayers, their Sacramentes, their Cleargie, their people, their doctrine, or their life: wee may truely ſaie as the Prophete ſaide, <hi>Surely

Wee are in his hande, both we and al our counſels: God graunt we may put off all fleſhly affections, and put on Ieſus Chriſt, and that all the earth may ſee his glory.</p>
            <p>Nowe on the other ſide, let vs conſider howe mercifully God hath dealt with vs. Hee hath reſtored vnto vs the light of his Goſpell, and hath taught vs the ſecrets of his heauenly will. We heare him talke with vs familiarly in the Scriptures. as a father talketh with his child. Thereby hee kindeleth our faith, and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our hope: thereby our heartes receiue ioye and comfort. We haue the holy miniſtration of the Sacraments: we know the couenant of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: wee knowe the couenaunt and myſterie of the Lordes Supper. Wee fall downe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and confeſſe our life before God: wee pray together, and vnderſtande what we pray. This
<pb facs="tcp:8193:127"/>
was the order of the Primitiue Churche: this was the order of the Apoſtles of Chriſte. If wee compare this with the former, wee ſhall ſoone ſee the difference betweene light and darkneſſe.</p>
            <p>The kingdome of God nowe ſuffereth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

The ſunne is riſen, the day is open: God hath made his kingdome woonderfull among vs. It is nowe time, nowe is it time that wee ſhoulde ariſe from ſleepe: for nowe is our ſaluation neere. Nowe it is in our mouth, wee can ſpeake of it: GOD graunt it may bee neerer vs, euen in our heartes. The night is paſt, GOD graunt it be paſt for euer: that we be neuer againe throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en into the darkeneſſe of death: that the worde of life, the trueth of Chriſt, be neuer againe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from vs. And it ſhall neuer be taken away, if wee bee thankefull. Unkindeneſſe can neuer ſcape vnplagued. Let vs wake, let vs wake, our ſleepe is deadly. Let vs pray to GOD to awake vs: hee is able to rayſe the dead.

            <p>Let vs caſt away the workes of darkeneſſe, and all doctrines of ſuperſtition and ignorance. Let vs beholde the troubles and miſeries of other countries.

Al this haue I done ſimply, &amp; plainly, without al ſhewe of learning, that it might the better ſinke into our heartes.</p>
            <p>Nowe I thinke good to ſpeake of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Church, that al you may know what they are, becauſe you are all partakers of the holy ſacraments. Chriſt hath ordeined them, that by them hee might ſet before our eyes the

myſteries of our ſaluation, and might more ſtrongly confirme the faith, which wee haue in his blood, &amp; might ſeale his grace in our hearts. As Princes ſeales confirme and warrant their deedes and char<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus doeth God make knowen his ſecret purpoſe to his Church: firſt, he declareth his mercie by his worde: then he ſealeth it, and aſſureth it by his ſacraments. In the word we haue his promiſes: in the ſacraments we ſee them.</p>
            <p>It woulde require a long time, if I ſhould vtter that might be ſaide in this matter: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in laying open ſuch errours and abuſes, as haue crept into the Church. But I wil haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to this place, and ſo frame my ſpeech, that the meaneſt &amp; ſimpleſt may reape profite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. That you may the better remember it, I wil keepe this order. I wil ſhewe you, what a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is: Secondly, who hath ordained them: thirdly, wherfore they were ordained, and, what they worke in vs: fourthly, how many there are: and then I will briefly ſpeake of euery of them.</p>
            <p>A Sacrament is an outwarde and viſible ſigne, whereby GOD ſealeth vp his grace in our heartes, to the confirmation of our Faith. <hi>Saint Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Sacramentum eſt inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis gratiae viſibile ſignum.

Therefore after a certaine maner of ſpeech (and not otherwiſe) the Sacrament of the bodie of Chriſt, is the body of Chriſt, &amp; the Sacrament of the blood of Chriſt, is the blood of Chriſt: ſo the ſacrament of faith, is faith.</p>
            <p>Who hath ordeined the Sacramentes? Not any Prelate, not any Prince, not any Angel, or Archangel, but onely God himſelfe. For, he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath authoritie to ſeale the charter, in whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:8193:132"/>

            </p>
            <p>In like maner, when God would witnes &amp; ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh to <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; his ſeede after him, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his mercie: he himſelfe ordained a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to confirm the ſame: <hi>This is my couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which ye ſhal keep between me &amp; you, &amp; thy</hi>

            <p>But why were ſacraments ordeined? he telleth you: <hi>In nullu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nonce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religionis, ceu veru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c. Men</hi>

               <hi>ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be gathered together to the profesſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether it be true or falſe: vnleſſe they be bound inthe felowſhip of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſignes or ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</hi> The firſt cauſe why they were ordeined, is, that thereby one ſhoulde acknowledge another, as felowes of one houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, &amp; members of one body. So was al Iſrael reckoned the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe of their circumciſion, &amp; al ſuch as were vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, were cut off from the people, &amp; had no part in the common wealth of Iſrael, becauſe they were vncircumciſed: Euen as wee take them that are not baptiſed, to be none of our brethren, to be no children of God, nor members of his Church, becauſe they will not take the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Babtiſme.</p>
            <p>An other cauſe, is, to moue, inſtruct, and teach our dul and heauy hearts, by ſenſible cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, that ſo our negligence in not heeding or
<pb facs="tcp:8193:133"/>
marking the woorde of God ſpoken vnto vs, might be amended. For if any man haue the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſeale, and haue not the faith thereof ſealed within his heart, it auayleth him not: hee is but an hypocrite and diſſembler. So the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the foreſkinne of the fleſhe, taught them to mortifie their fleſhly affections, and to cut off the thoughts and deuiſes of their wicked hearts. Therefore ſaid <hi>Stephen</hi> to the Iewes, <hi>Ye ſtiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked, &amp; of vncircumciſed hearts &amp; eares,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> 
               <hi>you haue alwaies reſiſted the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, when in Baptiſme our bodies are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with water, wee are taught that our ſoules are waſhed in the blood of Chriſt. The outward waſhing or ſpriukling, doth repreſent the ſpriu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keling and waſhing which is wrought within vs: the water doeth ſignifie the blood of Chriſt. If we were nothing elſe but ſoule, hee would giue vs his grace barely and alone, without ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it to any creature, as hee doeth to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: but ſeeing our ſpirite is drowned in our bodie, and our fleſhe doeth make our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dul: therefore we receiue his grace by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thinges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Aliter ego, &amp; aliter incredulus diſponitur. Ille cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c. I am otherwiſe affected,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hom. 7. in 1. Cor.</note> 
               <hi>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is he which beleeueth not. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of the water of Baptiſme, hee thinketh it is nothing els but water: But, I ſee (not the creature onelie, which mine eyes do ſee, but
<pb facs="tcp:8193:133"/>
alſo) the cleanſing of my ſoule by the holie Ghoſt. He thinketh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my body oneli is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: I beleue, that my ſoule is therby made pure &amp; holy: and withal I conſider Chriſtes burial, his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, our ſanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouſnes, redemption, adoption, our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the kingdom of heauen, &amp; the fulnes of the ſpirit.</hi> For I iudge not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things I ſee by my bodily eyes, but by the eyes of my minde.</p>
            <p>When one that is vnlearned, and can not reade, looketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a booke, be the booke neuer ſo true, neuer ſo wel written, yet becauſe be know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the letters, and cannot reade, hee looketh vpon it in vayne. Hee may turne ouer all the leaues, and looke vppon all, and ſee nothing: but another that can reade, &amp; hath iudgement to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidereth the whole ſtory, the dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

So do the faithful receiue the fruite &amp; comfort by the Sacraments, which the wicked &amp; vngodlie neither conſider, nor receiue. Thus do the ſacraments leade vs, &amp; inſtruct vs to behold the ſecrete and vnknowen mercies of God, and to carry our ſelues to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of his will. And this is the other cauſe, why ſacraments were ordained.</p>
            <p>Thirdely, they are ſeales and confirmations of Gods promiſe. <hi>S. Paul ſaith, Abraham recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued</hi>

               </hi> They are not bare ſignes: it were blaſphemie ſo to ſay. The grace of God doeth alwayes woorke with his Sacramentes: but wee are taught not to ſeeke that grace in the ſigne, but to aſſure our

            <p>Suche opinion had the auncient learned fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſuch reuerent wordes they vſed, when they entreated of the Sacraments, For, it is not man, but God which worketh by them: yet is it not the creature of bread or water, but the ſoule of man, that receiueth the grace of God. Theſe corruptible creatures neede it not: we haue need of Gods grace. But this is a phraſe of ſpeaking. For the power of God, the grace of GOD, the preſence of the Trinitie, the holy Ghoſt, the gift of God, are not in the water, but in vs. And wee were not made, becauſe of the ſacramentes: but the ſacraments were ordeined for our ſake.</p>
            <p>Now, for the number of Sacraments, howe many there be: it may ſeeme ſomewhat hard to ſay, &amp; that it cannot be ſpoken without offence.
<pb facs="tcp:8193:136"/>
For mens iudgments herein haue ſwarued ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much: ſome haue ſaid, there are two: others three: others foure: and others, that there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen Sacramentes. This difference of opinions ſtandeth rather in tearmes, then in the matter. For a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner of ſpeaking which the Church vſeth, &amp; in the writings of the holy ſcripture, &amp; of auncient fathers ſometimes ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth properly euery ſuch Sacrament which Chriſt hath ordayned in the newe Teſtament, for which he hath choſen ſome certain element, and ſpoken ſpeciall wordes to make it a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hath annexed thereto the promiſe of grace: ſometimes it is vſed in a generall kinde of taking, and ſo euery myſterie ſet downe to teach the people, and many thinges that indeed and by ſpeciall propertie be no ſacraments, may neuertheleſſe paſſe vnder the generall name of a Sacrament.</p>
            <p>The ſacraments inſtituted by Chriſt, are only two: the ſacrament of Baptiſme, &amp; of our Lords Supper, as the auncient learned fathers haue made acompt of them. <hi>S.

                  </expan> factu facilima, &amp;c. <hi>Our Lord &amp; his Apoſtles haue deliuered vnto vs, a few ſacraments in ſteede of many: &amp; the ſame in doing moſt eaſie, in ſignification moſt excellent, in obſeruation moſt reuerend, as is the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and the celebration of the bodie and blood of our Lord.</hi>
               </hi> Thus <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> vnto whom I might alſo ioyne other auncient fathers, recken but two Sacramentes. Let no man then be offended with vs for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: wee doe no newe thing, but reſtore the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt, and keepe the example of the holy fathers.</p>
            <p>What then: Doe we refuſe confirmation, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, orders, and matrimonie: Is there no vſe of theſe among vs? doe we not allow them: yes. For we doe confirme and teache repentance, &amp; miniſter holy orders, and account matrimonie, &amp; ſo vſe it, as an honorable ſtate of life. We viſit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſicke among vs, and anoynt them with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious oyle of the mercy of God. But we cal not theſe ſacraments, becauſe they haue not the like inſtitution. Confirmation was not ordeyned by Chriſt: penance hath not any outward element ioyned to the worde: the ſame may be ſayd of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And matrimony was not firſt inſtituted by
<pb facs="tcp:8193:137"/>
Chriſt: for God ordeined it in paradiſe long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But in theſe two, we haue both the element and the inſtitution. In Baptiſme, the element is water, in the Lords Supper, bread and wine. Baptiſme hath the word of inſtitution. <hi>Teache al nations, baptizing them in the name of</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

               <note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> Therfore theſe two are properly and truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sacraments of the Churche, becauſe in them the element is ioyned to the word, and they take their ordinance of Chriſte, and be viſible ſignes of inuiſible grace.</p>
            <p>Nowe, whatſoeuer lacketh eyther of theſe, it is no Sacrament. Therefore are not the other fiue, which are ſo reckoned, and make vp the number of ſeuen, in due ſignification and right meaning, taken for ſacraments. For, in ſuch ſort as theſe are called ſacramentes, that is, becauſe they ſignifie ſome holy thing, wee ſhall finde a great number of thinges, which the godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Fathers haue called Sacramentes, and yet I trow, we muſt not holde them as ſacraments ordeined to be kept and continued in the church: for then ſhoulde there bee not ſeuen, but ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene ſacramentes.</p>

ſolennitas &amp;c. The remiſſion of ſinnes, whether it be giuen by baptiſme, or by anie other Sacraments, do properly appertain to the holy ghoſt. The ſolennitie of the words, and the inuocation of Gods holy Name, &amp; the outwarde ſignes appointed to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Prieſt by the inſtitution of the Apoſtles, worke the viſible outward Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

            </p>
            <p>Such a change is made in the ſacrament of baptiſme. Through y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> power of Gods working, the water is turned into blood. They y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bee wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in it, receiue the remiſſion of ſinnes: their robes are made cleane in the blood of the lambe. The water it ſelfe is nothing: but by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Gods ſpirit, the death and merits of our Lorde and Sauiour Chriſt, are thereby aſſured vnto vs.</p>
            <p>A figure heereof was giuen at the redde Sea. The children of Iſrael paſſed through in ſafetie: but Pharao and his whole armie
<pb facs="tcp:8193:142"/>
were drowned. Another figure heereof was giuen in the Arke. The whole worlde was drowned, but Noah and his familie were ſaued aliue: Euen ſo in the fountaine of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, our ſpirituall Pharao the Deuill, is choked: his armie, that is, our ſinnes are drowned, and we ſaued. The wicked of the worlde are ſwallowed in concupiſcence, and vanities, and wee abide ſafe in the Arke: GOD hath choſen vs to bee a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to himſelfe, wee walke not after the fleſh, but after the Spirite, therefore wee are in Chriſte Ieſus, and there is nowe no condemnation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</p>

Man pronounceth the worde, but GOD ſetleth our heartes with grace: man toucheth or waſheth vs with water, but God maketh vs cleane by the Croſſe of Chriſt. It is not the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, but Chriſt himſelfe whiche is the Lambe of GOD that taketh away the ſinnes of the worlde.</p>

or thriſe, whether one or two or three, or more be Godfathers, or witneſſes of the Baptiſme, it maketh nothing to the vertue of the ſacrament, they are no part thereof: without theſe, baptiſme is whole and perfect. Hereof <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſaith, <hi>In vna fide nihil officit conſuetudo Eccleſiae diuerſa.</hi>

            <p>Some make doubt of thoſe infantes the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the faithfull, which depart before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, whether they be ſaued or not. What, ſhal wee ſay that they are damned? It is a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and too curious for man to enter into the iudgements of God: his mercie is infinite, and his purpoſe ſecrete, Hee ſheweth mercie vnto thoſe, vpon whom hee will haue mercie. Who can appoynt him, or ſet him an order what hee ſhall do: It is not good, nor ſtandeth with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian reuerence to bee contentious and buſie in ſearching out, or reaſoning of matters, which the wiſedome of God hath hid from our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>Yet, if any would faine bee reſolued: hee may thus ſafely reaſon. It is true, that children are borne in ſinne, and that by the ſinne of one man death hath entred into the worlde, and that the
<pb facs="tcp:8193:143"/>
reward of ſinne is death: but who knoweth if God haue forgiuen them their ſinne? Who is his Counſailour, who knoweth his meaning? Our children are the children of God. Hee is our God, and the God of our ſeede. They bee vnder the couenant with vs. The ſobreſt waye is to ſpeake leaſt, and to leaue them to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mercie of God.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, if any ſhould deſpiſe, and of wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes refuſe this holy ordinaunce, ſo that they woulde in no caſe bee baptized, or ſuffer their children to bee baptized: that were damnable. Otherwiſe the grace of God is not tyed ſo to the miniſtration of the ſacrament, that if anye be preuented by death, ſo that he cannot bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to the felowſhip thereof, he ſhoulde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be thought to bee damned. For many haue ſuffered death for Gods cauſe, for their Faith in Chriſt, who neuer were baptized: yet are they reckoned, and are indeed bleſſed Martirs. So <hi>Valentinianus</hi> a Chriſtian Emperour died without baptiſme: yet doeth <hi>Ambroſe</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him, and nothing doubteth, but that hee <note place="margin">Orat. de obit.

Tel me, what other thing is there in vs, but our wil, &amp; our deſire?</hi> Againe, <hi>Hee which was endued with thy ſpirite, O God,
<pb facs="tcp:8193:143"/>
how might it be that he ſhould be voyde of thy grace? Or, If this moue you, becauſe the miſteries were not ſolemnly miniſtred: are not the Martirs crowned if they be only no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices (that be not yet chriſtned?) But if they be waſhed in their blood, then is he alſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in his godlines and in his deſire. S.

            <p>
               <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> the great, was the firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperour: yet was not baptized vntill the time of his death. <hi>Qui, cum Nicomediae ageret,</hi>

Who, when he was at Nicomedia, being grieuouſly ſick, and knowing the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certeinty of this life, was baptiſed.</hi> The theef vpon the croſſe, was not baptized: Yet Chriſte ſaide vnto him, this day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe. The Prophete <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Bapt.</hi> were ſanctified in their mothers wombes. By theſe fewe it may appeare, that the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment maketh not a Chriſtian, but is a ſeale &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> receiue it of the grace of God, vnleſſe they make themſelues vnworthy thereof: And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man may deſpiſe this holy ordinance, &amp; keepe backe his infants fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baptiſme, for in ſo doing he procureth his own da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation. In time
<pb facs="tcp:8193:144"/>
of ignorance manie could ſee this, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, that the outwarde baptiſme by water was not neceſſarie vnto ſaluation, ſo that the children or others that died without it, were for lacke thereof damned. The church hath alwayes receiued three ſortes of Baptiſme: the Baptiſme of the ſpirit, or of blood, or of water, If any were preuented by death, or hindered by crueltie or perſecution, ſo that they coulde not receiue the ſacrament of Baptiſme at the hands of the miniſter, yet haueing the ſanctification of the holie Ghoſt, or making their faith knowne by their ſuffering, they were borne a newe, and baptized. God hath his purpoſe in vs and our children. Before we be borne, when we had do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e neither good nor euil, he hath mercie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on vs. Iudgement appertaineth vnto God. He knoweth who are his. No man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the thinges of God, but the ſprite of God onely. And thus much of the Sacrament of Baptiſme, which is the badge and cogniſance of euery Chriſtian. If any bee not baptiſed, but lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the marke of Gods folde, wee cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne him to be one of the flocke. If anie take not the ſeale of regeneration, we cannot ſay, he is borne the childe of God. This is the ordinarie way, let vs vſe it, let vs not deſpiſe, nor foreſlow to receiue the Sacraments: they are the meanes by which God maketh ſure his good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs.</p>

The other Sacrament of Chriſtes Church, is the ſacrament of the Lordes Supper, whiche ſome haue called the Sacrament of the Altar: ſome the Sacrament of the holie table: ſome the Sacrament of bread and wine: but wee moſt properly may call it the ſacrament of the bodie and blood of Chriſt.

            <p>The nexte matter, and the thirde of the ſixe, is, whether the breade and wine abide ſtill in
<pb facs="tcp:8193:152"/>
former nature and ſubſtaunce as before, euen as the nature and ſubſtaunce of water remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the Sacrament of Baptiſme. There are ſome that ſaye by vertue of theſe woordes, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> the bread is chaunged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bodie of Chriſt, that the ſubſtaunce of bread is gone, and nothing remayning, but onely accidentes: that is, a ſhewe, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and likeneſſe of bread. They ſay, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be the ſame it was, but it is chaunged: it ſeemeth to bee bread, but it is not bread: and the wine, by the taſte and colour ſeemeth to be wine, but it is not wine. They ſay we may not beleeue our eye ſight, nor ſtand to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſenſes. They ſay, Chriſt is almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he ſpake the word, and al thinges were made: he hath ſaid, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> therfore it is now no more bread, but his body: and that this is the faith of the Church, in which we were borne and chriſtned.</p>
            <p>In deede, this hath lately beene receiued, as a matter of faith. But if we examine it well, wee ſhall finde it to bee an errour, and no point of faith. I ſaye it hath beene receiued of late: for our olde Fathers neuer beleeued it, as I will declare and prooue, and let you ſee, that it hath not beene the Catholike faith, nor the faith of the Primitiue churche, nor of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles of Chriſte, and therefore no faith at all. The opening of this matter will be ſomewhat

darke, and where with you haue not beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted: but giue me your attendance, lend me your ſenſes, and I truſt by the grace of God I ſhall make it playne.</p>
            <p>They ſay, the bread is changed, and done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way vtterly: and, that it is no breade, though it ſeeme to be bread: that in this caſe, we may not truſt our eyes, but leane to faith. Marke, I ſaye they tell vs that the bread remayneth not: and for trial hereof, they require vs not to leane to any other thing then faith. Wee will then cloſe and ſhut vp our ſenſes, and hearken what <hi>Chriſt,</hi> what <hi>S. Paul,</hi> what the holy fathers of the church, who are beſt able to inſtruct our Faith, haue ſpoken.</p>

Councel of <hi>Laterane</hi> vnder Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, in the time of king <hi>Iohn,</hi> king of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp; in the yeere of our Lorde a thouſand two hundreth &amp; fifteen, that is, 350 yeres ago, &amp; not before. Then was it firſt ſo named, and made a matter of faith, and neuer before. This I ſpeake not of my ſelfe: they that maintaine that errour confeſſe it, the moſt learned, and wiſeſt, &amp; ſageſt of them ſay it. And yet then was it no Catholike faith, for it was onely receiued in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the other churches ouer all the worlde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it not, as appeareth by a Councel holden at <hi>Florence.</hi> Therefore, if tranſubſtantiation be a matter of faith, it is a newe late founde faith, and no old and Catholique faith. In the time of our great graundfathers it was not ſo taken. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> 3. commaunded, that it ſhould be kept vnder a canopie, and that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">An. 1226.</note> ſhould worſhip the ſacrament. And after him <hi>Vrbanus</hi> 4. made a newe holie day in honour of <note place="margin">An. 1265.</note> it, which he called <hi>corpus Chriſti</hi> day. And all theſe thinges haue been done within theſe fewe yeeres. For before, in the times of <hi>Auguſtine, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Chriſoſtome,</hi> and the old fathers, they were neuer heard of.</p>
            <p>But, to returne to that we haue in hand: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the bread and wine in the Sacrament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in their proper nature. Yes verily: for ſo is it auouched by our Sauiour, by <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> by <hi>Ignatius, Iuſtinus, Irenaeus, Origen, Dioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,

Cyprian, Ambroſe, Chriſoſtome, Auguſtine, Gelaſius, Theodoretus, Cirillus, Bertramus,</hi> and <hi>Rabanus.</hi> By ſo many good and lawfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes it appeareth, that the bread and wine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in the ſame nature and ſubſtance, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>I ſeeke not to aſtoniſhe you, by bringing in ſuch a heape of Authors: nor yet to ſeeke mine owne glorie therby, God is my witnes, and his Chriſt. If I would ſeeke mine owne commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, I ſhoulde holde my peace, and not vnfolde theſe errours, wherewith the Churche of God hath byn diſquieted theſe late yeeres. As for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, I haue none in theſe things: ſhame come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that ſeek the glory and commendation of men: our glorie is to diſcharge our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, and to ſpeake the truth, that wee may be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in the day of our Lord.</p>
            <p>And yet in ſpeaking thus of the ſacrament of the Lordes ſupper, and denying the ſtrange and new learning of tranſubſtantiation, and making it knowen, that the bread and wine continue ſtil, that they were before, we do not conceiue baſely or vnreuerently of the ſacrament: wee doe not make it a bare or naked token. Let no man bee deceiued. We doe both thinke, &amp; ſpeake ſoberly, and with reuerence of the holy myſteries. As we cannot cal them more then they are: ſo may wee not eſteeme them leſſe then they are by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8193:157"/>
We ſay, they are changed, that they haue a dignitie and preeminence which they had not before, that they are not now common breade, or common wine, but the ſacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt: a holy myſterie: a couenant betweene Chriſt and vs: a teſtimonie vnto our conſcience, that Chriſt is the Lambe of God: a perfite ſeale, &amp; ſufficient warrant of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, whereby God bindeth himſelfe to vs, and we ſtand likewiſe bounden vnto God, ſo as God is our God, and we are his people.</p>
            <p>In Baptiſme, the nature &amp; ſubſtance of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth remaine ſtil: and yet is not it bare wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is changed, &amp; made the ſacrament of our regeneration. It is water conſecrated, &amp; made holy by the blood of Chriſt. They which are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed therein, are not waſhed with water, but in the blood of the vnſpotted Lambe. One thing is ſeene, and an other vnderſtande. Wee ſee the water, but wee vnderſtande the blood of Chriſt. Euen ſo wee ſee the bread and wine, but with the eies of our vnderſtanding we looke beyonde theſe creatures, wee reache our ſpirituall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into heauen, and beholde the raunſome and priſe of our ſaluation. Wee doe beholde in the Sacrament, not what it is, but what it doeth ſignifie. When wee receiue it with due reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and faith, we ſay as ſayde <hi>Gregorius Nyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenus, Ego aliam eſcam agnoſco, quae &amp;c. <hi>I know</hi>

We know y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Chriſt hath left his ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to his Church, that they might be helpes to lift vs vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By them we are ioyned with Chriſt, and made partakers of his paſſion.</p>
            <p>Next, let vs conſider, how and after what ſort we eat the body of Chriſt in the ſacrament. And here, I beſeech you, that you may take the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of the body &amp; blood of Chriſt, to giue good eare. For, of miſtaking this myſtery, grewe the firſt error in the Church. When y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> diſciples of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:8193:158"/>
heard Chriſt ſpeake of this matter, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him not, they were offended, and ſhrounke backe, and departed. If we take the wordes of Chriſt in ſuch meaning as they did, wee ſhalbee deceiued, and offended as they were.</p>
            <p>This it is then which wee haue to conſider, whether the bodie of Chriſt goe into our mouth, and our bodies, as other meates: or whether it be receiued ſpiritually, as a ſpirituall meate, and ſo paſſe into, and nouriſhe our ſoule. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſomewhat was ſayde before, by the way, and ſhortly. But for cleerer vnderſtanding of the ſame, we haue to weigh and declare, that the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the body of Chriſt, is not groſſe, or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but ghoſtly and ſpirituall, as a peculiar worke of the minde.</p>
            <p>The trueth hereof is founded in our Creede, and is an article of our Chriſtian faith. Wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that Chriſt did riſe againe from the dead, and aſcended into heauen, and ſitteth at the right hand of God in glorie.

               <hi>not be conuerſant together with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in his fleſh, after he had aſcended vnto his father.</hi> It would bee tedious to alleadge all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might be ſaide to like purpoſe. Thus Chriſte, and <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter:</hi> thus <hi>Vigilius, Ambroſe, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, Cirill,</hi> and al the olde Catholique fathers ſay: and wee are taught to beleeue, that Chriſt is not corporally in the churche, but is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heauen, and that hee hath giuen to his bodie immortalitie, but hath not taken from the ſame the nature of a bodie. <hi>Vigilius</hi> hauing cauſe to prooue this ſame article againſt <hi>Euti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> ſhutteth vp the matter thus: <hi>Haec eſt fides</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The body then which we eate, is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: aboue all Angels, and Archangels, and powers, and principalities. Our meate is in Heauen on high, and we are heere belowe on the earth. Howe may it be, that we may reach

it, or taſte, or eate it? Heere let vs imagine, that there are two men in euery man, and that euerie man is fleſhe and ſpirite, bodie, and ſoule. This man thus doubled, muſt bee furniſhed with double ſenſes: bodily to ſerue the bodye: and ſpirituall, to ſerue the ſoule. Hee muſte haue eyes of the bodie, and eyes of the ſoule: eares of the bodye, and eares of the ſoule. Spirituall ſenſes, ars quicke, ſharpe, and liuely. They pearce anye thing, bee it neuer ſo thicke: they reache anye thing, bee it neuer ſo farre off. Chriſt ſaieth of <hi>Abraham, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

            <p>When we ſpeake of the myſterie of Chriſte, and of eating his bodie, wee muſt ſhut vp and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon all our bodily ſenſes. And, as wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, that wee ſee him with our bodily eyes, or heare him with our bodilye eares, or touche him with bodily feeling: ſo likewiſe can we not, and therefore may wee not ſaye, wee taſte him, or eate him with our badylie mouth. In this woorke wee muſt open all the inner and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſenſes of our ſoule: ſo ſhall wee not onely ſee his bodye, but heare him, and feele him, and taſte him, and eate him.

            <p>But ſay ſome, the fathers of the olde lawe, were in darkenes, in a ſhadow, &amp; a figure: it was meete they ſhould receiue the Sacrament ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, or the body of our Lord ſpiritually: but al otherwiſe with vs, vnto whoſe benefite, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the new Teſtament work y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thing it ſelfe that they ſignifie: ſo that we receiue Chriſt really, bodily, and with the mouth of our bodies.</p>

            <p>To make this ſomewhat more euident, let vs take the iudgement of the Fathers.

               <hi>downe from heauen, is not receiued, but of him that hath our Lord, and is the member of Chriſt,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the vndoubted meaning of the olde fathers, that the wicked are not partakers of the paſſion of Chriſt, becauſe they lacke faith, whereby onely Chriſt is receiued of vs. As <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>

            <p>Nowe let vs examine what difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the body of Chriſt, and the ſacrament of the bodie. It behoueth vs to take eche part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right as it is, leaſt we be deceiued and take one for another. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, <hi>Simpliciores neſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes diſtinguere. &amp;c.

Beleeue me,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">De ieiuniis &amp; lectione Gen.</note> 
               <hi>it is a great matter to vnderſtande what is the creature, and what is God the Creator: what are the workes, and what is the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> The difference heerein is this, A Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a figure or token: the bodye of Chriſt is figured or tokened. The Sacrament bread is bread, it is not the bodie of Chriſt. The bodie
<pb facs="tcp:8193:163"/>
of Chriſt is fleſh, it is no bread. The bread is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, the bodie is aboue. The bread is on the table, the bodie is in heauen. The bread is in the mouth, the bodie in the heart. The bread feedeth the outward man, the bodie feedeth the inwarde man. The bread feedeth the bodie, the body fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſoule. The bread ſhall come to nothing: the bodie is immortall, and ſhall not periſh. The bread is vile, the bodie of Chriſt glorious. Such a difference is there betweene the bread, whiche is a Sacrament of the bodie, and the bodye of Chriſt it ſelfe. The Sacrament is eaten as well of the wicked, as of the faithfull: the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is onely eaten of the faithfull. The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may bee eaten vnto iudgement: the body can not bee eaten, but vnto ſaluation. Without the Sacrament we may be ſaued: but without the bodie of Chriſt wee haue no ſaluation, wee can not bee ſaued. As <hi>Saynt Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">Trect. 26. in Ioh.</note> 
               <hi>Quinon ſumit carnem Chriſti, non habet vitam: &amp; qui eam ſumit, habet vitam, &amp; eam vtique ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternam. Hee that receiueth not the fleſhe of Chriſt, hath not life: &amp; he that receiueth the ſame, hath life, and that for euer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such a difference maketh <hi>Epiphanius, Hoc eſt rotundae figurae &amp; inſenſibile, quantum ad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Epiph. in Anchor.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c. This thing</hi> (that is, the ſacrament) <hi>is of a rounde forme,</hi> (for it was a great thick round cake) <hi>and touching any power that is in it, vtterly voyde of ſenſe. But wee knowe
<pb facs="tcp:8193:164"/>

            <p>It remayneth, that wee conſider howe wee ought to prepare our heartes: and with what faith, and reuerence wee ſhoulde reſorte to theſe holy myſteries. Wee may not come, as we vſe to doe to our vſuall meates.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the Sonne of GOD brought before the Iudge, and arraigned as a Theefe, and condemned, and ſcourged, and put to death: his ſide was opened with a ſpeare, and the bloode flowed out: and he ſayde, It is finiſhed: that is to ſay, the price for man is nowe payed. Thus, <hi>beeing in the fourme of God, hee thought it no robberie to bee equall with God: but</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> 
               <hi>he made himſelfe of no reputation, &amp; tooke on him the fourme of a ſeruaunt, and was made like vnto men, &amp; was founde in ſhape as a man.

There was no other ſacrifice left for ſinne: woe worth the ſinne of man, that was the cauſe of the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What were the effects of his death? What followed? <hi>God hath highly exalted him, and giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him a name aboue euery name, that at</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:8193:165"/>
and that euerie tongue ſhould confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt is the Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</hi> God ſpake out of the heauens, and ſaide, This is my beloued ſonne, in whom I am well pleaſed. Hee crowned him with glorie and honour: hee hath not onely aduanced Chriſt, but vs alſo together with him, <hi>And made vs ſitte together in heauenly places in Chriſt Ieſus:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Hee hath made vs like to the Image of his ſonne.</hi> Thus hath hee made vs an acceptable people, and hath renewed the face of the earth: ſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nowe hee ſaith not, as he did to Adam, thou art earth, and ſhalt returne to earth: but he ſaith: Thou art heauen, an immortall and vndefiled inheritance that fadeth not away, is reſerued in heauen for thee. This is the effect, and value of the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>All theſe thinges are layde before vs in the holy Table, if wee haue eyes to ſee and beholde them. There may wee ſee the crucifiyng of his bodie, and the ſhedding of his blood, as it were in a glaſſe. Therefore Chriſte ſayeth, doe this in remembraunce of mee: in remembraunce of my benefite wrought for you: in remembrance of your ſaluation purchaſed by me. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>As often as ye ſhal eate this bread, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> 
               <hi>drinke this cuppe, ye ſhew the Lordes death til he come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this ſupper, lieth a hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> myſtery, There is the horror of ſinne, there is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of our Lorde
<pb facs="tcp:8193:166"/>
for our ſinne repreſented, howe he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our ſinnes, and tormented for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and ledde as a lambe to the ſlaughter. There may we ſee the ſhame of the croſſe: the darkeneſſe ouer the worlde: the earth to quake: the ſtones to cleaue aſunder: the graues to open, and the dead to riſe. Theſe thinges may we ſee in the Supper: this is the meaning of theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly myſteries.</p>
            <p>Therefore, let euery one examine him ſelfe, and ſearch and weigh his owne hearte, whether he be the childe of GOD, and a member of the bodie of Chriſte: and ſo let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cuppe. The ſacrament of the Lordes Supper, is a holie foode, the ſeale of our Faith, the aſſuraunce of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and a couenant betweene God and man. He that doeth vn worthely thruſt himſelfe to this table, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation. When a ſicke man, of a weake and feeble ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, ſitteth downe to eate with them that are whole, whatſoeuer he eateth or drinketh, it doth increaſe his ſickneſſe. To them that periſh, the worde of God is a ſauour of death vnto death. Who ſo diſagreeth from Chriſt, neither eateth his bread, nor drinketh his blood, as ſaith <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any of vs come to the Sacrament of the bodie of Chriſt, and yet make our ſelues the members of the Diuell, wee treade Chriſte
<pb facs="tcp:8193:166"/>
vnder our feete, we regarde not his body cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, nor his blood ſhed for vs, we regard not the price of our ſaluation, wee are guiltie of his death, we betraie the innocent blood, we are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from grace, and Chriſt hath died in vaine for vs.</p>
            <p>Let vs remember Chriſt was forſaken, ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, buffeted, crucified, and left vpon the croſſe: he was a worme and no man, a reproch among men. Nature it ſelfe yearned and yelded at the ſight hereof. The whole lande grewe darke, the earth did quake, the ſunne loſt his light, the powers of heauen were moued, the rockes were clouen, the vaile of the temple rent, the thiefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, &amp; ſaid, Lorde remember me when thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meſt into thy kingdome: the centurion glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified God, and ſaid, of a ſuretie this man was iuſt.</p>
            <p>Where is the power of Chriſts death now? Where is the force and power of his word? By theſe meanes he ſpeaketh to thee, and calleth, ſaying, Beholde, O man, thus haue I ſought thee: theſe things I ſuffer for thy ſake, that thou ſhouldeſt eate my fleſh, and drinke my blood, &amp; be made one with me: that thou mighteſt come into mee, and I into thee. I haue made thee a member of my bodie, bone of my bones, and fleſh of my fleſh. Thou that walloweſt in thy ſinnes, thou <hi>Sodoma,</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> thou childe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which haſt reioyſed in my ſhame, and
<pb facs="tcp:8193:167"/>
arte not moued with the paines which I haue ſuffered, what might I do for thy ſake, to ſaue thee, that I haue not done? What might I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and haue not endured it? O be a partener of my death, that thou mateſt haue part in my reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Let vs die with Chriſt, let vs bee crucified vnto the worlde. Let vs bee holy Egles, and ſcare aboue. Let vs goe vp into the great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and receiue of our Lorde the cup of the newe teſtament. There let vs beholde the bodie that was crucified for vs, &amp; the blood which was ſhead for vs. There let vs ſay, this is the raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the world: this was once offered, &amp; hath made perfect for euer al them that beleue: this entered once into the holy place, and obtained e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting redemption for vs: this ſtandeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in the preſence of God, &amp; maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for vs: this is the Lambe of God, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the ſinnes of the world: by this bodie I am now no more earth &amp; aſhes: by this, I am now not a bondman, but made free. This bodie hath broken the gates of hell, &amp; hath opened hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. In this are all the treaſures of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie by this the prince of darkenes is caſt foorth, in this bodie ſhall he come againe to iudge the quicke and the dead.</p>
            <p>Let no vncleane or filthie perſon, no adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, no vſurer, no cruel extortioner, or deuourer of Gods people, offer him ſelfe to the receiuing
<pb facs="tcp:8193:167"/>
of this Sacrament. If any bee ſuch a one, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire hym by the body &amp; blood of Ieſus Chriſt, and by the iudge of the quicke and the dead, that he come not to the Lordes table: that he betraie not the ſonne of God. It were better he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bene borne, and that a milſtone were hanged about his necke, &amp; he throwne into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea. Let vs not deceiue our ſelues: God wil not be mocked. He receiueth da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> receiueth vnworthely.</p>
            <p>Let vs fall downe before our Lorde, and giue thankes vnto hym: Let vs ſay, what ſhall I giue vnto the Lord, for al that he hath giuen vnto me? I wyl take the cup of ſaluation, &amp; call vpon the name of the Lord. Let vs ſay, O Lord our Lord, how wonderful is thy name in all the world. Let vs ſay, prayſe the Lord, O my ſoule, and all that is within me, prayſe his holy name. Let vs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and promiſe amendement of our lyfe: let vs goe out with <hi>Peter,</hi> and weepe: let vs fall at Chriſtes feete with <hi>Marie Magdalene,</hi> and with our teares waſhe his feete: Let vs ſaye with <hi>Dauid,</hi> I haue ſinned to the Lorde: Let vs ſaye with the Prodigal ſonne, father, I haue ſinned agaynſt heauen and againſt thee, I am no more worthy to bee called thy ſonne: Let vs ſaye, haue mercy on mee O God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to thy great mercie: thou art my God, I am thy ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. O ſaue me for thy mercies ſake. Let vs offer vp our bodies, a liuing, pure, holy, and acceptable ſacrifice to God. So ſhall we be
<pb facs="tcp:8193:168"/>
partakers of the death of Chriſt, and of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. Thus haue we briefly gone through the whole matter of the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt, and followed the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which was ſet down. Firſt that we do in the Sacramente truely eate the bodie of Chriſt. Secondly, what is the meaning of the wordes, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum.</hi> Thirdely, whether y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bread remeaine in nature &amp; ſubſtance, Fourthly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be eaten with the mouth of the bodie, or by faith onely. Fiftly, what difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the bodie of Chriſt, and the myſticall ſignes. Sixtly, howe we muſt be prepared, and with what deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ought to come to receiue this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus treated of the Sacramentes of the newe teſtament, and ſaid ſo much as is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for you to knowe of them both, as well of Baptiſme, which is the ſacrament of our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, as of our Lordes ſupper, which is the ſacrament of our refection or nouriſhment: I will now in fewe wordes ſpeake ſomething of <hi>confirmation, of matrimony of eccleſiaſtical miniſterie,</hi> which ſome call holy orders, <hi>of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or penance, and of extreme vnctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> which ſome of late yeeres haue called Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by ioyning theſe to the other, haue made vp the nomber of ſeuen Sacramentes, &amp; ſo haue charged the Church with fiue ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts more then Chriſt did euer ordaine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8193:168"/>
For theſe fiue, wante either the worde, or the element, or both: and therefore may not bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for true ſacraments. Such as haue with all their ſkil ſhewed them ſelues helpers and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of our aduerſaries. yet haue plainely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that they are not ſacraments of Chriſtes inſtitution: <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hales,</hi> ſaith of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. <hi>The ſacrament of confirmation, as it is a Sacrament, was not ordained either by Chriſt or by the Apoſtles, but afterwarde in the Counſel of Melda:</hi> Which Counſel was kept many yeres after Chriſt. And <hi>Durandus</hi> ſaith of matrimonie, <hi>Matrimonie in due and proper kinde of ſpeach, is no Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> And <hi>Beſſarion a Cardinal,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth (as it was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) that in due and right conſideration, none of theſe fiue may be called Sacramentes: <hi>We reade</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that theſe two onely Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, were deliuered vs plainely in the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, of Confirmation, which is ſo called becauſe that which was done on our behalfe in baptiſme, is ratified and confirmed, many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes had not ſuch due care as they ought in the godly bringing vp of their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo that many children knew not whether they were baptized or no: many were neuer taught what couenant was made betweene them &amp; God in their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: many ſwarued away from Chriſtian profeſſion, and caried them ſelues to the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb facs="tcp:8193:169"/>
of the heathens: and of the ſonnes of God, became the ſonnes of the deuel. Upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, the Churche of God laieth charge vpon the parentes, and the witneſſes of the baptizing of younge children, that they teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the waies of the Lorde, &amp; to know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy myſtery that they haue receiued, and what they haue promiſed and profeſſed in baptiſme: that they put them in minde, howe God hath called them out of the kingdome of darknes, vnto his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full light, and to the fellowſhip of the ſaintes in light.</p>
            <p>When the children of the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were thus brought vp, &amp; had learned the religyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, and to walke in the waies of Godlines, they were brought to the church, &amp; by their parents preſented vnto the Biſhop: and yeeled a reaſon of their faith openly, before the whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: they profeſſed they would ſo beleue, that they would liue and die in that faith. Then the Biſhop and all the people fell downe on their knees, and prayed vnto God, that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the good thing hee had begonne, and the biſhop laying his hande vpon them, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended them vnto God. This was the ratifying of the profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they made by others at their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and for that cauſe called <hi>Confirmation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, whether it be a ſacrament: and when I ſay a ſacrament, I meane a ceremonie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God in expreſſe wordes: For God
<pb facs="tcp:8193:169"/>
onely hath the authorytie to inſtitute a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sacraments are confirmations, &amp; ſeales of the promiſes of God, and are not of the earth, but from heauen. As Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The babtiſme</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 21.</note> 
               <hi>of Iohn Whence was it? from heauen or of men? Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, The miſterie were not of God, nor perfect, if thou ſhouldeſt put any thing to it. Marke, and iudge, &amp; your ſelues ſhal ſee, whether this were a ſacrament inſtituted by Chriſt. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid, <hi>Accedat verbum ad ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum, &amp; fit ſacramentum. Ioine the worde to the creature, &amp; it is made a ſacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This creature or element is viſible, as are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, bread &amp; wine. The word which muſt be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; inſtitution of chriſt: without the word, and the commandement and inſtitution, it is no ſacrament.</p>
            <p>I proteſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the vſe and order of confirmation rightly vſed, is profitable, and neceſſarie in the Church, &amp; no way to be broken. But all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, &amp; neceſſarie, is not a ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Chriſt did not comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de it, he ſpake no word of it. Looke, and reade, if you doubt it. Chriſtes wordes are written, and may be ſeene. You ſhal neuer finde that hee commanded <hi>Confirmation,</hi> or that hee euer made any ſpecial promiſe to it. Therefore may you conclude, that it is no ſacrament. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, being rightly vſed, it is a good cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, &amp; wel ordeined of our auncient fathers.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles layde their handes on them,
<pb facs="tcp:8193:170"/>
and confirmed them which were baptized of <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> But that proueth not this confirmation: that was extraordinarie, it was a miracle. The holy Ghoſt came downe vpon them, and lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their hearts by this laying on of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles handes. But it is not ſo nowe, the holy Ghoſt doth not now deſcende in viſible forme vpon thoſe which are confirmed: there is no ſuch miracle wrought. There is no neede, that it ſhould ſo be. There was no commandement, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to appoint it vnto the Church, or to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it vntyl the comming of Chriſt, and the end of the worlde. Therefore it is no Sacrament by the inſtitution of Chriſt, Hitherto of the vſe: Now, ſomewhat of the abuſe.</p>
            <p>Nothing ſo good and holy, but it may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed. The worde of God hath bene abuſed to Hereſies, to Necromancie, to Charmes, and Sorcerie, and Witchcrafte. The ſupper of the Lord was abuſed in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> time of <hi>S. Paul.</hi> He telleth the <hi>Corinthians, This is not to eate the Lords Supper.</hi> Leſſe marueile then, if this happen to <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> a ceremonie. Time ruſteth and conſumeth all things, &amp; maketh many a thing to proue naught in the ende, which was firſt deuiſed for good. The braſen Serpent, at the firſt was made by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſet it vp for good purpoſe. But, after warde it was abuſed: The children of Iſrael did burne incenſe vnto it, and therefore <hi>Ezechias</hi> brake it in pieces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:8193:170"/>
The firſt abuſe in confirmation was, that it was done in a ſtrange tongue, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> no man might vnderſtand what was ment. Then, that they receiued to confirmation ſuch children, and ſo young, as were not able to make profeſſion of their faith: ſo that the infant promiſed, he knew not what: and the Biſhop ratified and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, where there was nothing to be confirmed: he ſet to his ſeale, where there was nothing to be ſealed. Theſe abuſes, were farre vnmeete for the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, ther was great abuſe in the manner of doing. For thus the Biſhop ſaid, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigno te ſigno crucis, &amp; confirmo te chriſmate ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutis. I ſigne thee with the ſigne of the croſſe, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme thee with the oyle of ſaluation.</hi> Thus they vſed to doe: theſe were their words, <hi>with the oyle of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> They tooke not this of Chriſt, nor of his Apoſtles, nor of the holy auncient fathers. It agreeth not with our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, to giue the power of ſaluation vnto oyle. He that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eketh ſaluation in oyle, looſeth his ſaluation in Chriſt, and hath no parte in the kingdome of God. Oyle for the bellie, and for neceſſarie vſes of life. It is no fit inſtrument without commaundement or promiſe by the worde, to worke ſaluation.</p>
            <p>More, they ſaid, he was no perfect Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that was not anointed by the Biſhop with this holy oile. This was another abuſe. For, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb facs="tcp:8193:171"/>
is baptized, receiueth thereby the full name of a perfect Chriſtian, and hath the full and perfice couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and aſſurance of ſaluation: he is perfitely buried with Chriſt, doth perfitely put on Chriſt, and is perfitely made partaker of his reſurrection. Therefore they are deceiued, that ſay, no man is a perfite Chriſtian, that is not marked with this oyle. Els the Apoſtles, and holie Martyrs were but halfe Chriſtians, becauſe the lacked this oyle. Els, what hope and comfort might the pore fathers haue? In what ſtate ſhall he thinke to finde his childe if he die before confirmation, &amp; paſſe without perfite Chriſtendome? verely they write thus, <hi>Sine oleo Chriſmatis, nemo poteſt ſiſti ante tribunal chriſti. Without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oyle of chriſme, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can appeare before the Iudgment ſeat of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, they ſay, confirmation is more hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then baptiſme: becauſe any prieſt may bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, but confirmation is giuen onely by a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or a ſuffragain. So doe they giue a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preeminence to confirmation, which is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by man, then to the holy ſacrament of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which Chriſt him ſelfe ordained. I neede not ſpeake more hereof, the errour is ſo groſſe, ſo thicke, ſo ſenſible and palpable.</p>
            <p>Againe, when they bleſſed, or halowed their oyle, they vſed theſe wordes, <hi>Fiat domine hoc o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum, te benedicente; vnctio ſpiritualis ad purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationem me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tis &amp; corporis, <hi>O Lord, let this oile
<pb facs="tcp:8193:171"/>
by thy bleſſing, be made a ſpritual ointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to purifie both ſoule &amp; body.</hi>
               </hi> O Chriſt Ieſu, where was thy croſſe, where was thy blood, and the price of thy death and paſſion, when a drop of oyle was of power to worke remiſſion of all ſinnes, to ſaue and defende againſt al the dartes of the wicked ſpirites, and to refreſh both bodie and ſoule? Yet ſo were we taught, ſo were wee lead. I faine not theſe things: The words may be ſeene. Neither do I ſpeake this, to bring you to a miſliking or loathing of our latter fathers: but onely that wee may humble our heartes, and giue thankes to GOD, that hath brought vs out of that darkenes, and giuen vs better knowledge.</p>
            <p>Nowe, a worde or two of the bringing vp of children, and preparing them to confirmation. Wherein I woulde God the olde order were duely obſerued, that they were inſtructed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly to know relygion, &amp; theyr duetie to God: and ſo might be brought before the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make an open profeſſion of their faith, with promiſe, that neither tribulation, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, nor perſecution, nor famine, nor naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, nor fire, nor ſword, nor life, nor death, ſhall euer make them denie their faith. Hereof might much be ſpoken, but I will be ſhort.</p>
            <p>The whole ſtandeth in knowledge and in the feare of God: that they may knowe God, &amp; walke before him in reuerence and in feare, and
<pb facs="tcp:8193:172"/>
ſerue him in holines, and righteouſnes, al the dayes of their life. The Iewes are a miſerable people: they liue in errour, they die in their owne blood: yet haue they ſo much vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that they bringe vp their children in the knowledge of God, and that knowledge they teach out of the worde of God. They remember what charge God gaue them: <hi>Thou ſhalt teach them thy ſonnes, and thy ſonnes ſonnes.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, a father muſt teache his childe what God is: That he is our father, that he hath made vs, and doeth feede vs, and geueth vs all thinges needefull, both for body, and ſoule: that he is our Lord, and therefore we muſt ſerue him, and obey him, and do nothinge whereby he may be diſpleaſed: that hee is our iudge, and ſhall come to iudge the quicke and the dead, and that all men ſhall come before him, to receiue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they haue done in the fleſh. He muſt put his childe in minde of his baptiſine, and teach him that it is a couenent of Gods mercie to vs, and of our duetie to God: that it is a miſterie of our ſaluation: that our ſoule is ſo waſhed with the blood of Chriſt, as the water of baptiſme waſheth our bodie. So muſt he alſo teach his childe the miſterie of the Lordes ſupper: what and how he receiueth there to his comfort: that as the bread is broken, and the wine poured out, ſo the bodie of Chriſt was crucified, and his blood ſhed for the remiſſion of ſinnes: that, if
<pb facs="tcp:8193:172"/>
wee beleeue in Chriſt, wee are through the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of GOD, ſo certainely nouriſhed in our ſoules to euerlaſting life, by the paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, as our bodies are truely nouriſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the creaturs of bread &amp; wine. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> was brought vp at the feete of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 22.</note> and inſtructed according to the perfect maner of the law of the fathers. Thus <hi>Timothie</hi> was <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> brought vp to knowe the holy Scripturs of a childe. How are we become ſo ſuperſtitious? Why haue we bene ſo delited in darkenes? why is it ſo harde a matter to remoue vs from the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours wherein wee haue liued? Why had wee rather fal downe before dombe things and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them, &amp; continue ſtill in ignorance, rather then harken vnto the worde of God? Why haue we plaied y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> parte of the Iewes, &amp; cried <hi>Crucifige</hi> vpon our deare frendes, and kinſmen: vpon thoſe whome we coulde not iuſtly accuſe of any crime: who offended vs no wayes, but in that they did poynt vs to Chriſt, and called vs to ſeek ſaluation onely in him? Hereof there cannot any better cauſe be yeelded, then this, that wee were ignorantly bred vp, without knowledge of God, without vnderſtanding of his worde The wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Teach a childe the trade</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prou. 22.</note> 
               <hi>of his way, and when he is olde hee ſhal not depart from it.</hi> And againe, <hi>Who ſo awaketh vnto wiſedome betimes, ſhall haue no great</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Wiſ. 6.</note>

               <hi>trauel: for he ſhal find her ſitti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g at his dores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore wicked rulers, as <hi>Iulianus, Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Maximinus,</hi> and ſuch others, haue forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that children ſhould be brought vp in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God. They taught them to blaſpheme Chriſt, and holy men, and to ſpeake yll of them before they knewe them. But let vs looke vpon our children, as vpon the great bleſſings of god. They are the Lords veſſels ordained to honour, let vs keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cleane: they are chriſts lambes, and ſheepe of his flocke, let vs leade them foorth into wholſome paſture. They are the ſeede plot of heauen, let vs water them, that god may giue the encreaſe: their angels behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> face of God, let vs not offende them: they are the temples, &amp; tabernacles of the holy ghoſt, let vs not ſuffer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foule ſpirit to poſſeſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; dwell within them.</p>
            <p>God ſaith, your children, are my childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They are the ſonnes of God.

By you they are borne into the world, be careful alſo that by your meanes they may be begotten vnto God, you are careful to traine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in nourture and comely behauiour of the bodye, ſeeke alſo to faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their mindes vnto godlines. You haue brought them to the fountaine of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme to receiue the marke of Chriſt, bring them vp in knowledge, &amp; watch ouer them that they be not loſt. So ſhal they be confirmed, and wyll

keepe the promiſe they haue made, &amp; wil growe vnto perfite age in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Of mariage I ſhall neede ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſſe, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſo knowne, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon. This felowſhip was firſt ordeined by God himſelfe in paradiſe. God himſelf ſaid, <hi>It is not good that man ſhoulde</hi>

Although man were in Paradiſe, although he were in the perfection of vertue, yet ſaith God he hath neede of a helper. Chriſt diſdayned not to be at a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he honoured it both by his preſence, &amp; by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> working of a miracle. <hi>S.

This is a priuate exhortation, and as it were a Catechizing, or inſtructing in the faith, and a meanes to leade vs by familiar and ſpeciall conference, to examine our conſcience, and to eſpie wherein wee haue offended God.

            <p>That the Prieſtes ſhoulde heare the priuate confeſſions of the people, and liſten to their whiſperings: that euery man ſhoulde be bound to their auriculer confeſſion, it is no commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ordinance of God.

            <p>Therefore <hi>S.

As the <hi>Corinthians</hi> dyd abuſe the gift of tongues, &amp; were taught by <hi>S.

As the gift of tongues was not to laſt for euer, but only for a time: ſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gift of healing was not to continue euer, but for a time. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>When thou faſteſt, anoint</hi>

thereby, that in our faſte we bee freſh and mery. Euen ſo <hi>S.

This is the meaning of his words.</p>
            <p>Let vs marke what abuſes haue growne by miſtaking them. <hi>S.

            <p>I deuiſe not theſe thinges, I imagine them not of my ſelfe, nor reporte them vntrulye. The Byſhop in ſuch wordes bleſſeth the oyle: &amp; with ſuch wordes doeth the Prieſt anoynt the ſicke with oyle: In their Bookes it is eaſie to bee ſeene. Now iudge you, if this were <hi>S Iames</hi> doctrine, or if this order were kept in the church in the time of the Apoſtles. Would you thinke that <hi>S.

So great difference is there betweene
<pb facs="tcp:8193:186"/>
the late meaning, and the meaning of <hi>S. Iames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such vſe of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> oyle we haue not, neither doth the Church of God allow it. Yet holde we the rule of the Apoſtle in viſitation of the ſicke: When any is ſicke among vs, the Miniſter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Thus he ſaith: Brother, you are entringe the way of al fleſh.

Man that is borne of woman, is of ſhort continuance, and ful of trouble. He ſhooteth foorth as a floure, &amp; is cut downe: hee vaniſheth alſo as a ſhadowe, and continueth not. Humble thy ſelfe vnder the mightie hand of God. Hee is our good father, &amp; dooth correct thoſe children whome hee loueth. Bleſſed is he, whom the Lord doth chaſtiſe, and inſtruct in his wayes.</p>
            <p>Here is the proofe &amp; trial of your patience, &amp; faith: remember the patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> in al his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries he praiſed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> name of the Lord.

            <p>My ſonne, in all thy doings feare the Lord. If thou feare the Lord, thou ſhalt proſper, &amp; in the day of thine ende, thou ſhalt bee bleſſed. Medle not much with other mens buſines, leaſt thou be entangled with controuerſies: abhorre the flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer &amp; double tongued. Let my doings which am thy father, be euer before thyne eyes. Thoſe few goodes which I haue, were truly gotten. I haue not gathered them of the teares, and heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and vndoing, or hindering of any. Be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to thy wife, and beſides her know none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Helpe thy neighbour accordinge to thy power: and turne not thy face from the poore &amp; needie. Be mercifull after thy power. If thou haſt much, giue plentiouſly: if thou haſt licle, do thy diligence gladly to giue of that litle. Be not ſlowe to viſit the ſick: whatſoeuer thou takeſt in hande, remember the ende, and thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer do amiſſe.</p>
            <p>As for me, I haue paſſed the vanities and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries

of this world. The Lorde hath giuen, and the Lord taketh away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord. He is the Lorde my God, let hym doe with me, as it ſeemeth good vnto hym. I knowe that this ſhall haſten my ſaluatien: And that Chriſt ſhalbe magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death. I haue not ſo liued, that I am aſhamed to liue: neither am I afrayde to die, for we haue a gracious Lord. I know, that if my earthly houſe of this tabernacle bee deſtroyed. I haue a building giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, that is, an houſe not made with handes, but eternal in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> heauens. They that die in the Lord are bleſſed, they ſhall reſt from their labors. Chriſt is vnto me both in lyfe, and in death, aduantage. In ſuch ſort do the Godly prepare themſelues to their iourney out of this life.</p>
            <p>Then the Miniſter prayeth, that he e may bee conſtant in this faith: he ſtrengtheneth him, &amp; confirmeth him in it. He exhorteth the ſicke to commende him ſelfe vnto God: he prayeth vnto God, that he will giue his Angels charge ouer him to keepe him and defende hym, that hee fall not into temptation. He teacheth him to ſaye, O lord, in thee haue I truſted, let mee neuer be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. Come Lord Ieſus, come, and take mee vnto thee: Lord, let thy ſeruant depart in peace: thy kindome come. I am thy ſonne, thine am I, O ſaue me: into thine hands, O Lord, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende my ſpirite, thou haſt redeemed mee, O

Lorde God of trueth. In this ſtate he dyeth, and hath his eyes alwayes faſtened vpon God, and ſo ſeeth, how indeede, the dead are bleſſed which dye in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thus doth the Churche of God inſtruct all men to liue, and to die, and to bee in readineſſe. Thus ar the ſicke amonge vs annointed with the inner &amp; in uiſible oyle of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mercie of God. Thus are they put in minde to haue the oyle of faith, and of a good conſcience, and that their lampes may euer be burning, that ſo they may enter in with the bridegrome: that the day ſpring from an high may viſit their hearts: &amp; that it may be ſaid vnto them, come ye bleſſed of my father, inherit ye the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome prepared for you from the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the worlde.</p>
