            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For firſt they do teach that there is no thing better, nor any thing more wiſhfull then to liue moſt friendly and louingly with the congregation which is the Temple and dwelling houſe of God and ſhal for euermore enioy the ſight of God. Secondly, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and condemne the erronious perſons which will bee members of no church, but ſeeke for <hi>Platoes</hi> citie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is no infirmitie. Let ſuch knowe that they are not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen vnto the ſociety of life euerlaſting, becauſe they are not of that congregation of thoſe that be called, according to that ſaying of S. Paul Rom. 8.14. <hi>Whom he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, thoſe he hath called.</hi> Thirdly, they comfort the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones, who indure great ſorrow in their mindes to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the common aſſemblies of the church: for Mat. 5.6. <hi>They are bleſſed which hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe:</hi> and moſt earneſtly wiſh and deſire to be ioyned with the true church. Laſt of all, they diſcerne the true church from other Sectes. For the church hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth faſt the poſſeſſion of the holy and ſacred fountain, from whence are drawne neceſſarie doctrine and whole ſome conſolations. But other ſectes are deſart places full of errours and darkeneſſe, and voyde and barren of al conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: for though they retaine a particle of the Lawe, yet they either are vtterly ignorant of, or corrupt the goſpell. But touching this difference I haue oftetimes elſewhere ſpoken in the Pſalmes.</p>

               <p>He expreſſeth plainely the cauſe of this deſire, becauſe God is in the Church alone truely acknowledged and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon, and the ſpeciall preſence of God is perceiued: for he calleth <hi>Gods glorie,</hi> the proper ornament of the church; namely the pure doctrine of the goſpel, and ſignes of grace, which are called vſually the Sacraments. <hi>The power of God;</hi> he ſignifieth that maner of preſence wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with god is preſent vnto his church alone: for though God in power and ſubſtance be euery where, according to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remies ſaying 23.24. <hi>Doe not I fill heauen and earth?</hi> And Paul ſaith Actes 17.28. <hi>In him wee are, liue, and moue:</hi> yet, by another reaſon God dwelleth in his church: for there he is by his word and ſacraments ſo effectuall, as he may regenerate &amp; ſanctifie many vnto life euerlaſting.

whereas nothing may be more excellent then order, who maruelleth not by right, that mankinde is by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence moſt wiſely diſtributed into three degrees or orders as it were: and certes to this end, that the true knowledge of God ſhould be of euery one according to their vocation preſerued and aduanced. For as it is ordained that Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians do teach, that is, by the prouidence of the workeman to be directed vnto a certaine rule, and to a certaine ende. And how great goodneſſe is that, where theſe three eſtates (as I may ſo ſay) are not ouerthrowne by the outrages of the Deuil and the Worlde, but are by God effectually preſerued and defended: for albeit our vnthankefulneſſe deſerue the vniuerſall deſtruction of our churches, policies and matrimoniall eſtate; yet God (ſuch is his goodneſſe) doth withſtand infinit moleſtations and generall hauocke, then which nothing may be thought or conceiued more greeuous?
