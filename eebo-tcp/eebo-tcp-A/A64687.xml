            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        </gap>.</note>Having given this account to the Reader, I shall only mention three things Concerning him, and forbear many more that might be added.</p>
                  <p>First, To the testimonies concerning him from <hi>Spanhemius, Ger. Vossius, Buchartus, Simplitius, Lud de dieu. Paulus Testardus, Blessensis, Arnoldus, Bootius, Mr. Selden, Dr. Prideaux, Bp. Davenant, Bertius, Mr. Cambden, Sir Rog. Twisden, and the whole University of Oxford,</hi> beside the forced testimony of his adversaries, <hi>Moranez, Beaumont,</hi> (Alias) <hi>Rookwood, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loner, Henry Fitz. Simonds,</hi> for all which I refer to the book aforesaid. Give me leave to add the testimony of <hi>Dr. William Chappel,</hi> sometimes fellow of <hi>Christ's College in Cambridge,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Provost of Trinity College near Dublin:</hi> which from such an acute man as he was, may amount to the like equivalent testimony from the <hi>University of Cambridge.</hi> He gave me once <hi>three</hi> reasons why he thought Doctor <hi>Usher</hi> (then <note place="margin">James Meath. <hi>Anagram, I am the same. See Dr.</hi> Bernard, <hi>pag.</hi> 52.</note> 
                     <hi>Bishop of Meath)</hi> was in his esteem the greatest Scholar in the Christian world.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One was, <hi>because of his rare natural parts, the foundation of his other Learning; having a quick Apprehension, a prompt Wit, a strong Memory, a clear Understanding, a piercing Judgment, and a ready utterance: Seldom</hi> (said he) <hi>shall you meet all these in an Eminent degree in the same person, but in him they so concurred, that it is hard to say in which he most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another was, <hi>because few men, though they had such parts, were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther able or willing to make so rich improvement of them, by choice Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries, unwearied studying in them, and searching out the Rarities of any other: few men's bodies and brains (he believed) would bear it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third was, <hi>because he was so esteemed both in these Universities, and in those beyond the Seas:</hi> and indeed whosoever conversed with him, found him (if they pleased to try it) a skilful Linguist, a Subtil Disputant, a flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Orator, a profound Divine, a mighty Antiquary, an exact Chronologer, and indeed a living and walking Library; The greatest professors have admired the Concatenation of so much and such variety of Learning in one person.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Do but think; he that
<q>
                        <p>Learned to read of two of his Aunts that were both blind.</p>
                        <p>Was converted from a state of Nature into grace at ten years old.</p>
                        <p>Was admitted the first Scholar into the College at <hi>Dublin;</hi> and that upon design, by reason of his pregnancy and forwardness, at thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of age.</p>
                        <p>Made an exact Chronology of good part of the Bible, and of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Authors he had read, at fifteen years old.</p>
                        <p>Encountred a Jesuite at <hi>19</hi> years old, and afterwards was called by him <hi>(of such as are not Catholicks) the most Learned.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:99037:5"/>Was Master of Arts, answered the Philosophy Act, and chosen Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chist of the Colledge, when he went through a great part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Divinity, in the Chappel, by way of common place, at nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old.</p>
                        <p>Commenced Batchelour of Divinity at twenty seven years old, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after was chosen Professor of Divinity in that Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do but think, I say, how mighty he was, when beside his promptness in School Divinity, he had read over all the Fathers, and trusted his own eyes in the search of them, by that he was thirty eight years of age, and was Master of all other Learning also.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If any yet be found, that would detract from so accomplished a person, and indeed pillar of our Church in his Generation, by reason of the distance at which they stand from <hi>Prelacy,</hi> or by reason of their Engagement in the late civil and unhappy differences between <hi>The late King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> claiming to themselves Liberty wherein soever they differ from others, both in matters of Church and State, but allowing to others as little concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning either: to such as these (if they be such as deserve satisfaction) give me leave to say,</p>
                  <p>A Divine and Apostolical Bishop he was, and next to the <hi>Apostles, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, and Prophets,</hi> as great <hi>a Pastor and Teacher,</hi> and trusted with as much of Gods mind, as I believe any one since hath been.</p>
                  <p>An Ecclesiastical Bishop he was also, and the most able <hi>Moderator</hi> in Church assemblies: To him pertained the <hi>double honour for ruling well, and for Labouring in word and Doctrine: Famous were two of his Predecessors in that</hi>

Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as you have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the Law.</hi> Had we all the means in the World to make us great, if we either do not teach, or do not make our selves Examples of what we teach, 'tis just with God that we should grow contemptible and vile, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have entered on these Words in the other <hi>Vniversity</hi> on a day of Publick Humiliation, as being suitable to the <hi>occasion,</hi> the chief matter of them being the Doctrine of the <hi>Conversion</hi> of a sinner.</p>
                     <p>For as much as <hi>God's Judgments are abroad upon the Earth,</hi> and hang over our heads, the only means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and remove both temporal and eternal, is our speedy conversion and return unto God, Else <hi>he will whet his sword, bend his bow, and make it ready</hi> to our destruction, <hi>Psal.</hi> 7.12. God did bear a <hi>deadly hatred</hi> against sin in the time of the Psalmist, and so he doth still, for his <hi>nature</hi> cannot be <hi>changed,</hi> If we <hi>return not,</hi> we are but <hi>dead men.</hi> The <hi>eternal weight</hi> of God's <hi>wrath</hi> will be our portion, both <hi>here,</hi> and in the <hi>world to come,</hi> if we repent not.</p>
                     <p>In the Words there are three observable Points, though not expresly named, yet if we weigh the Context, sufficiently implied.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Continuance in sin brings certain death,<note place="margin">

                     <p>
                        <hi>God takes no delight in the death of a sinner,</hi> nor that he should despair of his mercy: but would have us turn out of the <hi>broad way,</hi> which leads to destruction.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It behooves every one speedily to set about the work of conversion.<note place="margin">

your life depends. Obeying it, you are <hi>made</hi> for ever, neglecting it, you are <hi>undone</hi> for ever. Unless you embrace this Message, God will bend his bow, and make ready his arrow against you, or rather the arrows which he hath drawn to the head, he will let fly upon you. Know therefore 1. <hi>That continuance in sin brings certain death,</hi> There will be no way of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping, but by repentance, by coming in speedily unto God.</p>
                     <p>The words of this Text are taken from <hi>Psal.</hi> 95. <hi>Harden not your hearts, as in the Provocation,</hi> and as <hi>in the Temptation in the Wilderness.</hi> If when God calls us, either to the doing of this, or leaving that undone, yet we are not moved, but continue in our evil ways. What's the reason of it? It's because we harden our hearts against him. The Word of God; which is <hi>the power of God to salvation,</hi> and <hi>a two-edged sword to sever between the joynts and the Marrow,</hi> The <hi>strength</hi> of the Almighty encounters with our <hi>hard hearts,</hi> and yet they remain like the <hi>stony</hi> and <hi>rockie</hi> ground: whereon though the <hi>Word</hi> be plentifully sown, yet it fastens no root there, and though for a season it spring, yet suddenly it <hi>fades</hi> and <hi>comes</hi> to <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> We may, haply have a <hi>little motion</hi> by the Word yet there's a <hi>rock</hi> in our <hi>souls,</hi> a <hi>stone</hi> in our <hi>hearts,</hi> and though we may sometimes seem to receive it with some <hi>affection,</hi> and be made as it were <hi>Sermon-sick,</hi> yet it holds but a while, it betters us not: Why? because it's not received <hi>as an ingrafted word.</hi> Therefore saith St. <hi>James, Receive with meekness the ingrafted word,</hi> James 1.21. Let the word be <hi>ingrafted</hi> in thee; one <hi>sprig</hi> of it is able to make thee grow up to everlasting life. Be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the <hi>hearing</hi> of it, but pray God it may be firmly <hi>rooted</hi> in your hearts; this will cause a <hi>softning. To day if you will hear his voyce, harden not your</hi> hearts against Almighty God. If you do, expect him also to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you in indignation. Hearken what he saith by his Prophet. <hi>I will search</hi> Jerusalem <hi>with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil,</hi> Zeph. 1.12. Mark, <hi>I will search</hi> Jerusalem <hi>with candles, and punish those that are settled on their lees.</hi> When a man is thus <hi>settled</hi> and <hi>resolved</hi> to go on in his sins, to put the matter to the hazard come what will come, there's a kind of <hi>Atheism</hi> in the soul. For what do's he but in a manner reply, when God tells him by his Minister that he is preparing the <hi>instruments</hi> of <hi>death</hi> against him, do you think us such fools to <hi>believe it?</hi> What does this but provoke God to <hi>swear that we shall never enter into his rest.</hi> What's the reason of this? It's because men are not <hi>shifted,</hi> they have no <hi>change,</hi> they are settled on their lees. Moab <hi>hath been at ease from his youth, he hath been setled,</hi> and hath not been emptied <hi>from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity,</hi> Jer. 48.11. Consider we whether our <hi>security</hi> comes not from the <hi>same cause:</hi> We have not been emptied from <hi>vessel</hi> to <hi>vessel,</hi> we have always been at rest. Why have we so little <hi>conversion?</hi> There are two things hinder it: the <hi>hardning</hi> of a mans heart against the Word: and our <hi>setling</hi> our selves on our <hi>lees.</hi> When we have no change in our condition, we are <hi>secure,</hi> we never see an evil day. That makes us say, with the Sensualists in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>To morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant,</hi> Isa. 56.12. And this is that, which <hi>slays</hi> the <hi>foolish person. Wo to them that are at ease.</hi> It were better for thee to be <hi>emptied</hi> from <hi>vessel</hi> to <hi>vessel,</hi> to go into <hi>captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> For as long as a man continues thus in an <hi>unregenerate condition,</hi> he can look for nothing but <hi>troubles</hi>; certain Judgments must necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and as sure as God is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> so sure may they expect misery on <hi>Earth:</hi> and they shall receive the eternal weight of God's wrath, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured up against the day of wrath: Therefore there is a necessity of our <hi>conversion,</hi> if we will keep off either <hi>temporal,</hi> or eternal <hi>wrath.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour makes it the case of all impenitent sinners, to be liable to <hi>wrath:</hi> One Judgment befel the <hi>Galileans,</hi> another those on whom the <hi>Tower of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99037:10"/>
Siloam fell:</hi> But what saith our Saviour, <hi>Suppose you that these were greater sinners above all the men of</hi> Jerusalem? <hi>I tell you nay, but except you repent you shall all likewise perish,</hi> Luke 13.3. All, every Mother's Son here present, if you turn not from your sinful courses, God will meet with you one time or other, if you harden your hearts against him, be sure. <hi>Who ever hardned his heart against God and prospered?</hi> Job 9.4. As long as a man is in this condition, his state is woful. As many as are in the state of unregeneracy, are under the power of Satan, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25, 26. Mark the Apostles words, <hi>In meekness instruct those that oppose themselves, if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth. And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the Devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</hi> The state then of the <hi>hardned</hi> and <hi>setled on their lees,</hi> is as of a <hi>bird</hi> in a <hi>cage,</hi> taken <hi>alive,</hi> at the will of the <hi>Fowler.</hi> So it is here, as long as we continue <hi>obstinate,</hi> and <hi>hardned,</hi> we are taken <hi>alive</hi> at Satan's will, we are at his <hi>disposing.</hi> While we are at liberty, we are <hi>way-laid</hi> by his <hi>nets</hi> and <hi>traps,</hi> and taken, we are at his pleasure: As long as we are hardned in heart, we are in the Devil's <hi>cage:</hi> true <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> is that, whereby alone we purchase our <hi>freedom,</hi> whereby we reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our selves; and therefore in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Hardness of heart</hi> and <hi>impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi> signifie the same thing. <hi>After thy hardned and impenitent heart thou treasurest up unto thy self wrath against the day of wrath.</hi> Mark then: what's a hard heart? It's an impenitent heart. Dost thou harden thy heart? Then know that for the present thou art a dead man. If not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all God's threats out of his word, thou art not a jot mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou art dead whilst alive, as <hi>the woman that lived in pleasure.</hi> And if thou continuest so, thou treasurest up wrath against the day of wrath, and the just revelation of God's Judgments. God's word is the especial means to recover thee. A man that is in a <hi>swoon,</hi> they <hi>rub</hi> him to recover him, because there's <hi>life</hi> in him; but if <hi>dead, strong-waters,</hi> or any thing else cannot <hi>restore</hi> him. Examine thy self then, does the working of the Word <hi>rub,</hi> and <hi>gall</hi> thee? It's a sign there is life in thee; but if it make no <hi>impression,</hi> it moves thee not, it's a sign of a <hi>dead heart.</hi> Consider then the danger of this condition for a man to resolve on his evil courses, never purposing to alter matters. It exceedingly hastens God's Judgments.</p>
                     <p>But leaving this, I proceed to the second <hi>Point,</hi> which is to direct us how to work our <hi>escape.</hi> Though God threatens us, yet if we have but the grace to <hi>look</hi> about us, and remember our selves: If God do but cause us to consider we have to deal with a <hi>merciful</hi> Father, and make us meet him by <hi>humiliation,</hi> then though our sins were as <hi>scarlet,</hi> yet submitting our selves to our Judge, living as obedient <hi>Subjects</hi> the <hi>storm</hi> shall pass from us: So that this is the Second Point.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Notwithstanding God threatens us, yet if he gives us but grace to repent, and bethink our selves, let our sins be never so great, we may be sure of mercy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O that we could see with what a gracious God, we have to deall Canst thou but humble thy self? All these things shall speak peace unto thee. As an impenitent sinner is under the power of Satan, and liable to all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery: So contrariwise who ever returns and seeks the Lord, is sure to be under his wings, and free from all evil. Thinkst thou that God makes use of threatnings for thy hurt? No, he deals not with us as an angry Judge, but as a compassionate Father; men will take an enemy always at an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, when they may do him most hurt. God's terrors overtake us, he threatens us, that he will do this and this, that we may prevent it. He knows that unless his terrors awake us, we will rest secure. Before he smites us, he tells us. <hi>He will whet his sword: He hath bent hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> bow, and made it ready: He hath prepared his instruments of death,</hi> Psalm 7.12, 13. He could shoot thee presently, and instantly run the through, but he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99037:11"/>
threatens thee, that so he may not strike thee. <hi>Non te vult percutere qui tibi clamat, Observa,</hi> He that saith: <hi>Look to your self,</hi> hath no intention to strike thee. See what the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> denounces from the Lord, <hi>Cap.</hi> 11, 12. <hi>I have given you cleanness of teeth, I have with-holden rain,</hi> v. 6, 7, 8. <hi>I have smitten you with blasting and mildew,</hi> v. 9. <hi>I have sent amongst you the Pestilence,</hi> v. 10. <hi>yet have you not returned unto me. Therefore thus will I do unto thee O</hi> Israel, <hi>and because I will do thus unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel,</hi> v. 12. What Judgments have befallen us, have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen us for our own use, if so be we will be warned by them. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why God saith, he will overthrow us, is not because he means to do it, but that we may prevent him by repentance. Look into <hi>Jer.</hi> 3 1. and see what wonderful passages are to this purpose: There's a Law case. <hi>If a man put away his Wife, and she go from him, shall he return unto her again? Shall not that Land be greatly polluted? But thou hast plaid the Harlot with many Lovers.</hi> And in the 20. <hi>v. As a Wife treacherously departeth from her Husband, so have you dealt treacherously with me, O house of</hi> Israel. And yet see God's unspeakable mercy. <hi>Return again unto me.</hi> And 23. <hi>v. Return ye back-sliding Children, and I will heal your back-sliding: turn to me, and I'll not cause mine anger to fall upon you. Only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast transgressed against the Lord thy God,</hi> v. 13. See God supporteth us the worst and vilest of all, and yet as it were intreats us to return. See then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he Conclusion of the second Point; how, if God give us but grace to repent, let our former evils be what they will, the danger is past, the terror I mean of eternal destruction; so that you may say, and not in <hi>Agag</hi>'s delusion, the bitterness of death, the second death is past, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.32.</p>
                     <p>But I leave this and come to the Third, for which I chiefly chose this Text. You have seen how dangerous a thing hardness of heart is, how it brings certain death: and that if we have the heart to repent, we are safe. As to make it appear in an instance. It's not the falling into water, but the lying under it that drowns a man. Art thou faln into sin? only lift up thy head: if thou canst be but thus happy, the promise of salvation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to thee. The main thing then is this.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>It behooves us to set about the work of conversion and repentance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God is angry with us, and we know not whether God will execute his Judgments on us this day or no, therefore go about it presently. God will remove all our adulteries, and put away all our sins, if we will come to him within a day. Now what madness is it to neglect it? <hi>After a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time</hi> (saith the Apostle) according to that in the Psalmist. <hi>Psalm</hi> 95. <hi>God hath limited a certain day:</hi> Thou hast provoked the Holy Ghost, and now he limits thee a day, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Wherefore</hi> (saith the Holy Ghost) <hi>to day if you will hear his voice.</hi> Now is it safe think you to pass this day? A hard heart is a provoking heart, and as long as it continues hard, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues provoking God, and despising the Holy Ghost. <hi>To day therefore hear his voice,</hi> that is, this present day. But which is that day? It's this very time, wherein you stand before God, and in which you hear me. If you embrace the opportunity, happy are you; if not, you shall give as dear an account, as for any thing you ever heard in your life. There is no dallying with God, take his proffer, take him at his word, in a matter of salvation. He calls to thee to day, peradventure he will speak no more, therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.7. we shall find it's a limited day. <hi>Exhort one another to day; whilst it's called to day, lest any of you be hardned through the deceitfulness of sin,</hi> Heb. 3.13. While it is called to day, that is, stay not till to morrow, but embrace the present opportunity. This day God holds out the golden Scepter, and <hi>my life for yours,</hi> if you accept it you
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99037:11"/>
shall be saved. If you take it not to day, your heart will be more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to morrow; and so it may be you will never touch it; your hearts will be like stones, and you'l be uncapable of yielding. <hi>God is angry with us,</hi> Psal. 7.11. Why? He is our adversary, because we bear arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and will try the mastery with him. We oppose him in hostile manner as long as we continue sinful against him. What's the best coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel in this case? <hi>Agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art in the way with him.</hi> It's wisdom to do that soon, which must of necessity be done. If it be not, we perish for ever. <hi>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and thou perish from the right way,</hi> Psal. 2. <hi>ult.</hi>

                        </gap>, the present now. God at this time stirs the Waters, if now thou wilt step in and close with God, casting down thy weapons, then this will be the day of thy salvation; this is called, as Gods day, so <hi>our day: O Jerusalem, Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, if thou hadst known in this thy day, the things that belong unto thy peace, but now they are hidden from thine eyes,</hi> Luke 19.42. Mark, <hi>If thou hadst known in this thy day:</hi> So that if we pass by in this acceptable time those things which belong to our peace, they will be hidden from our eyes. Therefore should the enemies of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> lay <hi>her even with the ground,</hi> because she had neglected this opportunity, the day of Gods visitation. Wilt thou be so hard-hearted, as to put from thee Gods grace? If thou findest now that Satan hides this from thee, and perswades thee to do it to morrow, and to take a day of thine own, neglecting Gods day, Know and remember that he is <hi>a lyar</hi> from the beginning.</p>
                     <p>Give me leave to press this to you, for nothing more brings destruction, then this putting from us the proffers of Gods grace; unless we return to the Almighty, humbling our selves there will be <hi>bitterness in the end.</hi> There's the matter, whether God must wait on us, or we on him? This <hi>is the day of Salvation,</hi> saith God, and we must take time to think of it, whether it be seasonable or no. Alas</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By this means we incur the highest presumption: And this is no light thing inconsiderately to be passed over. Shall God offer you such a proffer, and you be so presumptuous, as to think such a one more seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? It's high presumption for <hi>thee</hi> to make thy self wiser then God, to neglect that he perscribes, and that with a promise too, as if thou hadst God at command. If thou resolve to take to morrow, it is requisite that thou have. 1. Space to repent, and</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Grace to do it. Now neither of these are in thine own hands, if they were, thou hadst ground for a farther delay. If thou hadst power to say, I will live so long, or couldest by thine own might prolong thy life, it were something, but it's otherwise. In refusing Gods proffer, thou refusest him, that hath thy life in his hand. What high presumption is this? See it in <hi>Jesabel,</hi> Rev. 2.21. <hi>I gave her space to repent, but she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not.</hi> As if God should have said, it's I gave it here, I gave her time to live, I might have cut her off in the midst of her Whoredomes. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve here by the way the reason why God gives us this space; it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. What presumption must that be, when we will go quite contrary
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99037:12"/>
to God? And because we have space, therefore we will not repent. Why does not God smite thee from heaven, when thou thus audaciously settest thy self against him? Why do's he not strike thee with a thunderbolt? Sure he gives the this space not to spend idly, but to another end; not to follow our lusts, neglecting Gods call, but that thou mayst remember thy self, and return with all thy heart. Remember those words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>My times are in thy hand.</hi> Psal. 31.15. He said not, my times are in mine own hands; for he knew it was grand presumption. Why then should any challenge that to himself, which belongs to God, as if he were the Lord of his own life, supposing Gods call unseasonable, and that he may think on it better hereafter? May not a young man die soon? Now an old man cannot live long. Many strong and lusty men are brought to the Grave as well as the weak and feeble. And why should we suffer Satan to abuse us thus? Thy space then is preserved in Gods hand, and therefore thou mayst not be Lord and Master of it. But admit God grant thee space, yet thou mayst not have the grace to do it. What was <hi>Jezabels</hi> case, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Though God gave her space, yet she repented not.</hi> What canst thou tell, what may then become of thee? perchance thou mayst live long, yet mayst thou never find as much as thy thoughts on repentance, much less the grace to do it: Thou mayst not have a desire that way, much less per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. Repentance is not a thing at our own command. <hi>In meekness</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>instruct them that oppose themselves, if God peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will give them repentance to the acknowl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mark, the Apostle would have Gods Ministers to be humble and meek; but how many are of other spirits? If anothers opinion be contrary to theirs, they are in a heat presently, as if a man were master of himself and of his own heart, to believe what he would. No, no, Repentance is a grace out of our reach, it's not in a mans own power. Be meek therefore in instructing. What needs passion? That helps not the matter. The opening of the eyes of the blind is in Gods hands; thank him for what thou seest, and know that 'tis his gift, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. The Apostle speaking of our Saviour Christ, saith, <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.</hi> The grace of repentance then is no <hi>Herb</hi> growing in our own <hi>Garden,</hi> it's a gift of Gods bestowing. And to this purpose is <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. <hi>When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, then hath God also to the Gentiles granted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto life.</hi> As God grants life, so repentance unto life. <hi>I have heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>Thou hast chastised me, and I am chastised as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, turn thou me, and I shall be turned,</hi> Jer. 31.18. And to the same purpose, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned.</hi> As if <hi>Zion</hi> should have said, we are no more able to turn our selves then a dead man. <hi>After that</hi> (saith <hi>Ephraim) I was turned, I repented, and after I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea even confounded.</hi> See then what an high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption it is for a man to presume he hath this grace of God at command: But as it is high presumption, so</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It's the highest contempt and despising of the grace of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering?</hi> Thus is it here. God gives thee space: Thou hast it, but imployest it not in what God gave it thee for. Thou deferrest the main business; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle accounts it no better then despising the proffers of Gods grace and goodness. Dost thou think God will take this at thy hands? Wilt thou despise him, and think he'l not despise thee? <hi>With the froward he will shew himself froward.</hi> God will come on a suddain, if thou makest not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99037:12"/>
use of thine opportunity, and take all away from thee. The threatning is plainly laid down, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.3. <hi>If thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee.</hi> It's spoken to us all, and therefore concerns us all: <hi>Whosoever hath an ear to hear let him hear.</hi> They are God's words, I have spoken to you this day, and you shall be accountable for them: let not the Devil steal this from you, hold it fast, this is your day: <hi>If thou shalt not watch, I'll come on thee suddenly as a Thief.</hi> It's the heaviest Judgment can come on uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted persons, irregenerate souls, not to awake till God comes on them, never to bestir themselves till hell rouze them up. Thus will it be with us, unless we awake by repentance, God will come stealing on us as a thief by suddain death, and speedily cut us off.</p>
                     <p>To pray against suddain death, and not to fit thy self for it, is to add contempt to thy presumption and rebellion. The wise man tells us, <hi>That man knoweth not his time, as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them,</hi> Eccles. 9.12. Mark, when it falls suddenly, at unawares, here's the wisdom then to provide that thou mayst not be taken suddenly. <hi>If the good Man of the house knew at what time the Thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to have been broken up,</hi> Matth. 24.43. And therefore Christ counsels us <hi>to watch, since we know not the day nor hour when the Son of man cometh,</hi> Here's the difference then between wisdom and folly. Hereby may we know whether we are wise men or fools, if we foresee this day, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for it, it's an argument of wisdom, if we watch, so as that when it falls, it may not fall on a suddain on us. If we are negligent of this day, and suffer our hearts to be dead as <hi>Nabal's like a stone,</hi> 1 Sam. 25.37. He had a great time of repentance, ten days, yet repented not, for his heart was dead, and like a stone; and this may be the case, if thou despisest the day of thy salvation, God's day, and thine own day too, thou mayst be a <hi>Nabal,</hi> no more moved than a Pillar in the Church, as I have found some by sad experience.</p>
                     <p>But you may reply, I suppose God will not take me at an advantage, I trust I shall have life and space, and not <hi>Nabal</hi>'s condition; I hope I shall have my wits about me to be able to cry, <hi>Lord have mercy upon me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But suppose God gave thee a tender heart, and thou art sensible of thy danger, that so thou call and cry earnestly to God for mercy, yet this is a miserable condition. Thou shalt find it will not be enough to cry, <hi>Lord be merciful to me.</hi> If thou neglectest him here, he will cry <hi>quittance</hi> with thee on thy death bed: Nor do I speak this of my self; No: Look what <hi>Wisdom</hi> saith, <hi>Because I have called and you refused, I have stretched out mine hand, and no man regarded, but set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof, I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh,</hi> Prov. 1.24, 25, 26. As if he had said, you refused me on my day I called and cried unto you, but you set at nought my words, and rejected my counsel, and were wiser than I, therefore <hi>will I laugh at your destruction:</hi> when you are in misery I will mock and deride, in stead of succouring. A terrible thing will it be, when in stead of hearing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries to answer them, he shall deride us, and laugh at our folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, And in the 28 verse, <hi>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.</hi> See what folly then it is to let slip this time. This is the acceptable day, <hi>Esay</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, call on him while he is near.</hi> When a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses God's day, God will not hear his prayer, all his sighs and sobs, his groans and cries, shall not prevail, <hi>Esay</hi> 66. <hi>I will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear.</hi> When men will needs be choosers of what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99037:13"/>
God would not have, God will have his choice too, and it shall be that which will be displeasing to them. <hi>I will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them.</hi>

Folly it is in the highest degree to trust on the future, when as in our own hands we have neither <hi>space,</hi> nor <hi>grace</hi> for such a business.

God gives us <hi>space,</hi> that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and we repent not, because he gives us <hi>space:</hi> He gives us life, that with <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>trembling</hi> we may set about the business of salvation, and we (through strong delusions) put from us the proffers of his grace, as if they were unseasonably offered. What madness is it to frustrate the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty of his ends and purposes? <hi>The Lord is not slack touching his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. It's a great <hi>stop</hi> and <hi>hinderance</hi> to our progress in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and the work of repentance, when we distrust God, and take him not at his word. He sends abroad his Embassadors, who proclaim, <hi>This is the accepted time, this is the day of salvation, to day if you will hear his voyce, harden not your hearts</hi>; 2 Cor. 6.2.

                        </note> though thou go but softly, thou mayst come to thy journeys end; but the doubt remains still, there is a question whether thou art in the way, or not. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are we if we are, although we can but halt and limp on, in this way: although this should be no ground for us to content our selves therewith. We must not trifle in the wayes of holiness. It's that concerns our life, and must be seriously thought on, and that speedily too. Mat. 5.25. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with thine Adversary quickly while thou art in the way with him.</hi> God is thine Adversary, unless thou agree with him speedily; his patience will break forth into his fury. Psal. 2.12. <hi>Kiss the Son lest he be angry, and thou perish from the right way.</hi> Thou hast no assurance of thy life, thou mayst be snapt off, whilst thou thinkest it time enough to repent and return. As long as we go out of the way of repentance, we are in the way to Hell, and the farther a man goes in a wrong way, the nearer is he to Hell, and the greater ado to return back: and in this regard <hi>Soft</hi> and <hi>Fair</hi> may go far; but 'tis far out of the way, far in the way to perdition and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As long as we are out of the right way to Heaven and happiness, we are in the path, that leads directly to the Chambers of death.</p>
                     <p>But let me in this particular rip up the heart of a natural man. What's the reason, that when God gives men a day, and cries out, <hi>This is the day of salvation, this is the accepted time,</hi> what in the name of <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Devils</hi> name rather (for he is the adversary, who maligns our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) should cause them, to put salvation from them? To defer and desire a longer time? Thus a natural man reasons with himself, I cannot so soon be taken off from the Profits, and pleasures of the World; I hope to have a time, when I shall with more ease and a greater composedness of mind, bring my self to it: or if it be not with so much ease, yet, I trust, in a sufficient manner, I shall do it: Wherefore, for the present, Ile enjoy the Profits, and Delights of the State, and Condition, where I am; I will solace my self with the pleasures of sin for a season, I hope, <hi>true repentance</hi> will never be too late.</p>
                     <p>This is well weighed; but consider, whether these thoughts which poise down our hearts, be not groundless; see, whether they will hold water at the last; and whether in making such excuses, to great presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we add not the height of folly. To pretend for our delay, the Profits and Pleasures of sin, and yet hope for Heaven at the last, as well as the generation of the righteous; it's but a meer fallacy, and delusion of Satan, to fill our hearts with such Vanities: Can it be expected, that we should have our good in <hi>this World,</hi> and in the <hi>World to come too?</hi> This is well, if it might be.</p>
                     <p>But let us try the matter, and begin with your first branch.</p>
                     <p>You are loth to part with your Profits, and Pleasures.</p>
                     <p>But consider, what a grand iniquity this is. Can you offer God a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wrong and indignity? <hi>Do you thus requite the Lord you foolish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise?</hi> Dost thou think this the way to make thy peace with God, whom thou hast offended, as long as thou mayst to be a <hi>Rebel</hi> against him?

When these things are past, <hi>what profit will you have of those things, whereof then you will be ashamed?</hi> Nay, whereof (were thine eyes open) thou wouldst now be ashamed; and happy wouldst thou be, if thou wert (as the converted Romans were) even now asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. Shame accompanies Sin so constantly and unavoidably, that even repentance it self removes it not. The Romans, now Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, were ashamed, for what they had done, before they knew Christ. When a man comes to see truly and throughly into himself, he will find no profit of such things as these: <hi>Death</hi> will certainly follow us, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Temporal</hi> but <hi>Eternal</hi>; also if we <hi>Repent</hi> not the more speedily, that's all the profit we shall find.</p>

Consider that the wisest of men gave thee this counsel, <hi>Remember thy Creator in the day of thy youth, before the evil dayes come, wherein thou shalt say, thou hast no pleasure in them.</hi> Eccles. 12.1.

                     <p n="2">2. Consider, what sin is in its nature. It is <hi>a weight,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. The nature of sin.</note> Heb. 12.1. <hi>Let us lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us.</hi> Sin is then <hi>a weight,</hi> and so an <hi>Heavy</hi> thing; but add sin to sin, a weight to a weight, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Heavier</hi> and <hi>Heavier.</hi> A man that is in the state of impenitency, hath this weight laid on him, and is subject to the Devil, in a state of <hi>Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> against God. A man now in this estate is weighed down, what will he be, six, seven, or ten years hence, going on in his impenitency? How will he then shake that off, which now he cannot free himself of? He must hereafter <hi>Buckle</hi> against it with a great deal of disadvantage, and <hi>Wrestle</hi> with more difficulty. One sayes well, that if we consider of sin aright, it's like the rising of water, over which a man being to pass, and finding it <hi>Higher</hi> then it was wont to be, he stayes a while, and then tryes again, and finds it <hi>Higher</hi> then before: he stayes yet longer, till it become unpassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, so that he may not adventure without great disadvantage. Thus it is with sin: Now peradventure the <hi>Waters</hi> of iniquity are <hi>Passable,</hi> if thou wilt, thou mayst go over, but if thou delayest the adventure, the streams of sin will run together into one Channel, and be more difficultly passed. Thou shalt find them like the Waters in <hi>Ezek.</hi> rising from the ankles to the <hi>Knees,</hi> from the knees to the <hi>Loyns,</hi> till they become Water, in this indeed unlike them, not to <hi>Swim</hi> in, as they were, but to <hi>Sink</hi> in, like the Waters of the Red Sea returning in their force in which <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and his Host sank down as a Stone, nay as Lead when the Wind of the Lord blew upon them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.5, 10.</p>

                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:99037:15"/>Take another Metaphor from the Scripture: The Scripture compares sin to <hi>Cords,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sin is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to cords.</note> which are instruments of binding, and the mystery of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is expressed by <hi>binding and loosing; Whose soever sins you shall bind on Earth, they are bound in Heaven, but whose sins ye remit, they are remitted.</hi> Mat. 18.18. Joh. 10.23. Every sin thou committest is a bond, and binds thee hand and foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against the <hi>Judgment</hi> of the <hi>great-day.</hi> Therefore it's said, <hi>His own iniquity shall take the wicked, and he shall be bound and holden with the cords of his sins.</hi> 23. Prov. 5.22. Now consider what folly it is, when a man shall say, though my sins are so many <hi>Cords</hi> difficult to be broken, yet Ile not trouble my self about it in my younger days, but Ile stay till my old age, and then I hope I shall be the better able to break these <hi>Bonds,</hi> and cast all these <hi>Cords</hi> from me; when as every iniquity I commit is as a new cord, which binds me <hi>faster</hi> and <hi>faster.</hi> Is not this <hi>Madness</hi> it self to think so, that in our <hi>younger Years</hi> being scarce able to break one of them, in our <hi>Dotage</hi> we shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to break ten thousand together?

But add hereunto the Argument in the Text: <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart</hi>; But repent while it is called <hi>to day.</hi> Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if we pass this <hi>Day,</hi> we shall be <hi>Harder</hi> and <hi>Harder.</hi> Wherefore, saith the Apostle, <hi>Exhort every one another daily while it is called to day, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin,</hi> Heb. 3.13. As if he had said, if thy heart be <hi>Hard</hi> to day, it will be <hi>Harder</hi> to morrow. Custome in sin hardens the heart, and takes away the sense of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith the Apostle, <hi>I speak after the manner of men, because of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of your flesh, For as ye have yielded your members servants to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now yield your members servants to righteousness, unto holiness,</hi> Rom 6.19. So that we see if a man once give himself up to sin, he will not be satisfied therewith, but will give himself up <hi>to iniquitie unto iniquitie.</hi> What's the meaning of that? It's as if he had said, if we give our selves up to iniquity, we will not rest there, but we'l add <hi>iniquity,</hi> unto <hi>iniquitie, Sin</hi> unto <hi>Sin:</hi> we will be brought to such a custom in evil, as that it will be <hi>easier for a black-moor to change his skin, and a Leopard his spots, then for those that have been accustomed to do evil, to learn to do well,</hi> Jer. 13.23. It will be to as much purpose to wash an <hi>Aethopian,</hi> as to go to put off that ill <hi>custome,</hi> and shake off that second <hi>Nature.</hi> Sin is a <hi>Hammer,</hi> and sin is a <hi>Nail</hi> too. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very sin strikes the former sin home to the <hi>Head,</hi> that whereas before it might easily have been drawn out, it roots it in so fast, as that it can very hardly be plucked out. Mark how the Apostle describes this cursed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of sin: <hi>Having eyes full of Adultery, and that cannot cease from sin, beguiling unstable souls, a heart they have exercised with covetous practices,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.14. What makes a man prompt in any thing but <hi>Exercise</hi>? When a man is <hi>exercised</hi> in sin, see the event of it: it brings him to that vicious habit, as that at length he cannot <hi>cease</hi> from <hi>sin.</hi> If a man deal with a young twig, it will bend, and break at his pleasure; but when it comes to full <hi>growth,</hi> it's past his strength. So fares it with sin: if thou dealest with it whilst thou art <hi>Young,</hi> and it in thee, before it hath taken <hi>Root,</hi> thou mayst easily wield it, at least with more facility, then otherwise thou couldst; but if thou let it run on to <hi>Confirmed Habits,</hi> it becomes <hi>immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> Wherefore saith the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Let us lay aside the sin which doth so easily</hi> beset us. The reason is evident, because, else we shall be so <hi>hardned,</hi> as that we shall not be able. A man that hath a <hi>green wound,</hi> if he'l seek for his cure betimes, it may be quickly, and easily remedied; but through <hi>delay,</hi> it begins to fester, and must be lanced to the quick, not without great <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Anguish</hi> to the <hi>Patient.</hi> Sin is such a wound; if it be let alone, it corrupts; and <hi>Proud flesh</hi> the more grows up, the longer

But what is my effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? Its that, when God touches my heart, and translates me from the <hi>Death</hi> of sin, to the <hi>life of</hi> Grace. Before this <hi>effectual calling,</hi> even the <hi>elect Ephesians</hi> were <hi>without Christ, Aliens from</hi> the <hi>Commoa-Wealth of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Strangers from the Covenant of promise, having no hope</hi> and <hi>without God in the</hi> World. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.12. Now there are certain times which God appoints for this <hi>effectual calling,</hi> wherein he uses the means to work on us, and of which he can say, <hi>what could I do more then I have done?</hi> And mayst thou not fear an actual <hi>rejection,</hi> since thou hast lived thus long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>means of Grace</hi>; That God hath waited these, not only <hi>three,</hi> but <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If our <hi>consciences</hi> witness for us, happy are we, but when there have been these <hi>showers</hi> of grace out of Gods word flowing down upon us, and yet we have received so much <hi>Grace in vain</hi>; O what can we expect, but a curse in this life, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death in the World to come?

                     <p>HAving entred on the Doctrine of the conversion of a sinner, in that Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.7. upon which depends our everlasting sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. I laboured to perswade you of the necessity of taking the accepted time of embracing the proffers of Gods grace, and of the necessity of doing it speedily.</p>
                     <p>I shewed you that there is a certain time in which God will be found, and that this time was the present time.</p>
                     <p>I declared unto you the great danger that would follow, if we took not God at his word, but refused his day for a day of our own, as if we were wiser than he; If when God calls, and holds out the <hi>Golden Scepter,</hi> we refuse to draw neer, and touch it: Also what danger there is of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by <hi>Satan,</hi> and our own <hi>hearts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shewed you farther, that the work was half done is this were done, if we could but learn this <hi>lesson.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now all that I shall speak will be to little purpose, if this be not first wrought. If it be already wrought in us, blessed are we. Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were thrice happy, would God now <hi>strike</hi> in, and cause us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to himself. It's not good to dally with God, the time may come when it will be too late, when we shall wish he had done otherwise, and taken the <hi>accepted time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I will go on to a farther point, which is this, when Satan cannot prevail with a sinner, to say to his soul, or to think with himself, I will do it hereafter, or I will at the day of death, when he cannot prevail with him to defer it, and leave it quite undone for the present: then he will give way to his doing a little to it, but it shall be so <hi>superficial,</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99037:17"/>
on such <hi>false grounds,</hi> that he had as good leave it <hi>undone</hi>; For Satan makes him thus conclude with himself, well, since I see it is a duty so <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> I will not defer, I will not put it off to an hour, but yet I see no such matter required in <hi>conversion,</hi> no such great need of being new <hi>moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> But now in the point of <hi>conversion,</hi> there are <hi>two</hi> things to be thought on.</p>
                     <p>First what <hi>estate</hi> the sinner is in for the present, and then, when he hath made search, and found it to be <hi>amiss,</hi> then the next thing is, he must <hi>turn</hi> unto God, and resolve to <hi>amend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall not now stand to speak of that common <hi>aspersion</hi> cast upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the waies of God (that men must sail to Heaven by the <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Hell)</hi> of which many are so much afraid: But yet we must not think that our Saviour came to <hi>heal</hi> those, which were <hi>whole</hi> already; he's a God of <hi>Wisedome,</hi> and the <hi>Physician</hi> of the Soul; he comes to find, that which is lost: So that we must be <hi>lost</hi> in our own apprehensions, if we will be found, as <hi>David</hi> was, <hi>Ps.</hi> 119. <hi>ult.</hi> He first saith, <hi>I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost, then seek thy servant.</hi> If now we are once <hi>lost,</hi> we are <hi>lost</hi> for ever, if he <hi>seek</hi> us not; therefore we should first consider with our selves, what estate we are in now, how the case stands with us at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, that if God should come and strike thee with <hi>Death,</hi> if thou wert now to come to <hi>Judgment,</hi> what would <hi>trouble</hi> thee most, what couldst thou then <hi>answer</hi> him? Therefore since it is uncertain how soon God may deal thus with thee, it is wisedome to be always ready. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Let us search and try our wayes, and turn again unto the Lord.</hi> Let us first try how the matter stands with us, at the present, let us <hi>examine</hi> our selves and our <hi>ways,</hi> and see if all be well, and then may we go on with <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> in the <hi>way</hi> wherein we are.</p>
                     <p>But when we have searched, and find thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> not to go as well as they ought, or that we are not in a <hi>right way,</hi> then after our searching we must,</p>
                     <p>Turn unto the Lord: Thus the Prophet did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 129.57. <hi>I thought upon my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</hi> First he <hi>thought</hi> on his wayes, he considered, whither he was going, to <hi>Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Hell</hi>; then when he had thus thought, he made hast, and <hi>turned his feet unto Gods testimonies.</hi> Here are both put together: first he made <hi>hast</hi> and <hi>thought</hi> on <hi>his ways,</hi> and then he <hi>turned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I took this Text to shew that one of these is as dangerous as the other, and how men are apt to deceive themselves in their <hi>search</hi> and <hi>examination.</hi> 'Tis as dangerous not to <hi>prove</hi> our <hi>wayes,</hi> as to <hi>put off</hi> and <hi>defer</hi> our <hi>

But yet this man cannot but think, he is <hi>something</hi>: Well then, something he is, but <hi>nothing to the purpose:</hi> As we say of an Idol, <hi>An Idol is nothing in the World:</hi> that is, Nothing that can help, or succour those that bow to it, and adore it, nothing that can relieve the worshipper of it.

The first false glass is <hi>Self-love,</hi> and the property of love is to make the good things in the party it loves very great, and the vices very little, <hi>Self-love</hi> represents nothing in it's true shape. The Apostle speaking of the latter dayes, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. saith, <hi>There shall be perillous times:</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lieth the peril? <hi>Men shall be lovers of their own selves.</hi> As if he had said, that is one of the worst perils, for a man to have a great conceit of himself. If one be sick of this disease, it will so blind him, that he shall never see a thing in its right place: we may see it by the contrary in the want of love. Suppose it in the case of a malignant neighbour, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; he that is full of <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>envy</hi> towards his neighbour, (consider what a false glass this is.) will never want matter of quarrel against him. The man that wants love, see how the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> deeds of his neighbour shew themselves to him: when he looks on the <hi>good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of his neighbour, they appear but very small, he is alwayes abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

When both meet together, it's well indeed. <hi>Demetrius</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 3.12. we read, <hi>had a good report of all men, and of the truth it self.</hi> To have a good report from men, and also from the <hi>truth,</hi> is an happy thing: but having it not from the truth, <hi>Woe to us, when all men speak well of us.</hi> What folly is it to rest upon a good report from <hi>men,</hi> when I have it not from the <hi>truth</hi>? The like madness it is, as for a man to trust in the absolution of his <hi>fellow-prisoners,</hi> when the <hi>Law</hi> of the Land <hi>condemns</hi> him. Shall a sick man be so mad, as to say he is well, because others say so? As if we should seek our selves <hi>out</hi> of our selves, No, <hi>Let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoycing in himself, and not in another.</hi> Rom. 2. <hi>ult. He is a Jew, which is one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, whose praise is not of men but of God.</hi> Not as if this did <hi>dis-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> or turn out the praise of men; but it is <hi>comparatively</hi> spoken, and it's meant, whose praise is not so much of <hi>men</hi> as of <hi>God.</hi> So that this is the second false glass, when a man concludes himself to be in a good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state because men praise him, thinks it well with him, because others think so, and say so. He hath a good <hi>opinion</hi> of himself, but that's not a ll, other men give him a good <hi>report</hi> too.

                     <p n="1">1. When he <hi>compares himself with others.</hi> I thank God, saith he, I am better then <hi>twenty</hi> of my <hi>neighbours</hi>; I know this man follows such <hi>cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and another lives in such a <hi>foul sin.</hi> Sure, saith he, I am not such a <hi>sinner</hi> as <hi>these,</hi> therefore I am happy, and I doubt not room in <hi>Heaven.</hi> This is the cause that the <hi>Pharisee went home unjustified,</hi> because looking on other men, he <hi>justified</hi> himself. <hi>God I thank thee I am not as other men, no extortioner,</hi> &amp;c. This fellow is so far from begging any thing of God, that he fills up his time with <hi>thanksgiving,</hi> he thinks he wants nothing, and that is his error; he looks on other men, and compares himself with them, and thence concludes he is well enough, because he is not so <hi>bad</hi> as <hi>this</hi> or that man. This is the common deceit, when men take this for a <hi>rule,</hi> that because they are not so bad as the <hi>off-scouring</hi> of the World, but are better then the <hi>ordinary sort</hi> of men, therefore they suppose they are very well, or as well, as they need to be: As if a <hi>sick</hi> man should say, I am not so <hi>sick,</hi> as such a man, who is at the <hi>point</hi> of death, therefore I am very <hi>well.</hi> I would desire such men, that as they look on those that are under them, so they would a little cast up their eyes on those that are above them. When you look on the <hi>Publican,</hi> this and that man, and bless your selves, because you are not so bad as these, who perchance are before you in points of <hi>morality</hi>: If you stand on comparisons, look on those that are <hi>above</hi> you, that go beyond you in <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>zeal,</hi> and look not so much on the sins of others, as your own: Another mans sins may <hi>condemn</hi> him, they cannot <hi>save</hi> thee. When a <hi>Thief</hi> and a <hi>Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> are both arraign'd at the <hi>Bar</hi> for their lives, will the <hi>Thief</hi> say to the <hi>Murtherer</hi> thy sin is <hi>greater,</hi> thy fault is of an <hi>higher nature,</hi> therefore I shall be <hi>saved,</hi> because mine is not <hi>hainous,</hi> when they both are punishable with death? The fault of another will not make thy case the better. It's no point of <hi>Justification,</hi> thus to deceive thy self, and to conclude because a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother is worse then thee, that therefore thy estate is blessed. So we see the degrees of <hi>false glasses. Self-love:</hi> or <hi>self conceit</hi>: Then a <hi>good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion</hi> of men: and <hi>conferring</hi> a mans self with some <hi>others.</hi> He's better then they, therefore his <hi>estate</hi> is good. An absurd conclusion; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will mightily <hi>insult</hi> over such as he can so easily deceive.</p>
                     <p>But this man goes farther; I not only compare my self with <hi>others,</hi> but with <hi>my self too,</hi> and find good ground to conclude the safeness of my condition. I remember a time, when I was <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>idle,</hi> when I ran in a way <hi>contrary</hi> to God. But now I have sowed my <hi>wild-oats</hi>; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before I was <hi>loose</hi> and <hi>dissolute,</hi> I have care to do my <hi>duty,</hi> to <hi>serve</hi> God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am not so <hi>prophane</hi> as formerly, my estate must needs be <hi>good.</hi> This is a very dangerous thing to say, that because I am not as <hi>bad,</hi> as I was, I am therefore <hi>good:</hi> It is as if a man had a <hi>debter,</hi> a slack <hi>pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master,</hi> to whom the <hi>Creditor</hi> calls earnestly to pay the <hi>debt,</hi> the best an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the debtor gives is this, I am sure there are many worse <hi>paymasters</hi> in the World then I am, and I my self have been a worse, and more slow <hi>paymaster</hi> heretofore then I am now. Well, because there are worse <hi>pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters,</hi> and he himself hath been a <hi>worse,</hi> doth this make him a <hi>better</hi> now?

The Tables in <hi>Moses</hi> hands were excellent things, God made the first <hi>Tables</hi> with his own hand, and perchance they may be therein <hi>typical,</hi> when these were broken, <hi>Moses</hi> makes the <hi>second,</hi> these not so excellent as the former, though I should esteem a piece of these, more excellent, then all the reliques of the <hi>Papists,</hi> for there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the first in them, God writes them with his own <hi>finger.</hi> This glass which then was so <hi>perfect,</hi> is now <hi>broken,</hi> and is not so perfect as it was, though there be something yet remaining in it; We may see some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of its ancient lustre in the <hi>Gentiles, for these having not a Law, are a Law unto themselves.</hi> There are <hi>practical principles,</hi> yet remaining in the <hi>Tables</hi> of our hearts, so that they that care not for the Law, shall be judged by that <hi>natural light,</hi> which is in them. We have a conscience to difference between <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil.</hi> This is the truth. It's a part of the <hi>Image</hi> of God implanted in us, which we are not to despise lest we be judged with those that <hi>hold the truth in unrighteousness:</hi> The truth is the principle of difference betwixt good and bad: The soul was to have a seat as a Queen to rule all our actions: But now this Queen is taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and all is lost: <hi>Morality</hi> and inward <hi>principles</hi> are to be much esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as things which God at first planted, yet do they come short of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a man to <hi>Heaven.</hi> The young man in the Gospel had a good esteem of himself, and was doubtless well esteemed of others, and did many things: but yet our Saviour tells him, <hi>how hard a thing it was for one no better qualified than at that time he was, or rather impossible</hi> (for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred his wealth before the blessed society of Christ) <hi>to come to Heaven</hi>: Although he thinks himself well enough, though he were rich not onely in great outward possessions, but in his moral Vertues too, so that when our Saviour tells him of the Commandments, he replies: <hi>all these, have I kept from my youth,</hi> which evidenced him to have bin a good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man indeed in that he had done so much, yet this was not enough <hi>one thing lacked: go and sell all that thou hast, &amp;c.</hi> However because there was so much in him, we read <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.21. <hi>Jesus loved him:</hi> he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that his cause was heavy, that going so far he should not attain his end.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99037:20"/>
But this was not to be despised, for this Jesus loved him. So 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.13. <hi>He onely of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good things towards the Lord.</hi> If there are but some <hi>good things</hi> in a man, the <hi>remains</hi> of Gods work, God loveth his own work; Here's the point then, though Morality be good, and natural reason be good: And what through the providence of God remains in us, since the <hi>state</hi> of our first creation; (For this <hi>state</hi> was a <hi>pure</hi> and a <hi>full glass,</hi> made by God himself, but since the fall, is much darkned: If we consult with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural reason and Moral Philosophy, they will discover many things:) yet this comes short. There are abundance of things that it cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, manifold defects which it cannot discern. The Apostle saith in the <hi>Romans</hi> c. 7. v. 7. <hi>I had not known sin but by the Law. I had not known lust to have been a sin, had not the Law said, thou shalt not lust.</hi> We have <hi>many sins</hi> we cannot know, but by the Law, yea such secret sins, as must be repented of. Our Saviour overthrew the Tables of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Changers, and would not suffer them to carry Burthens through the Temple, though for the use of those that sacrificed, a thing which had some <hi>shew</hi> of Religion in it.

                        </hi> what they did by the Law. Now, as God would not have sin <hi>lodge</hi> and make its abode in the Soul, so he would not have it made a <hi>thorow fare</hi> for sin: he would not have <hi>vain thoughts</hi> come up and down in the hearts. Now, <hi>By the Law comes the knowledge of these secret sins.</hi> Reason is a glass much to be esteemed for what it can shew; but it is not a perfect glass; sometimes it shews a sin, but many times di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishes it, that we cannot see it in full proportion. The Apostle makes this use of the Law, that by it <hi>sin becomes exceeding sinful.</hi> Thou mayst see sin to be sin by natural reason, but to see it exceeding sinful, this <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> comes short of, thou must have this from the <hi>Law</hi> of God.</p>

Beware of the Doctrine when the deceiver preacheth. This may be his Doctrine, <hi>He that believeth and is Baptized shall be saved.</hi> From this, by Satans cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning delusion the natural man thus concludes: A meer Heathen shall be shut out of Heaven gates, but I believe in the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,</hi> therefore I am in a good condition. Why then should I trouble my self any further? There is no man can accuse me, and my own <hi>good works</hi> will testifie unto me, that I do enough. <hi>Strictness</hi> in Religion is troubleness, and it is an unreasonable thing to do more: But this is but a meer delusion of Satan, for there is nothing more quiets, and satisfies a man, then Religion; there's nothing in the World more reasonable, then the service of God. First then know thy <hi>disease,</hi> and then apply those sweet and soveraign Cures. It is no easie matter for a man to <hi>believe</hi>: We block up the <hi>strait wayes</hi> of God, if we think it an easie matter to <hi>believe</hi> of our selves. It must be done by the <hi>mighty power</hi> of God: It's as great a work of God, as the Creation of the World, to make a man believe: It's the mighty power of God to salvation. Such a one must not receive Christ as a <hi>Saviour,</hi> but as a <hi>Lord</hi> too. He must renounce all to have <hi>him,</hi> he must take him on his <hi>own terms.</hi> He must deny the <hi>World</hi> and all, looking before hand what it will cost him. Now for a man to take Christ, as his <hi>Lord,</hi> denying himself, the World, and all, to resolve to pluck out his <hi>right eye,</hi> cut off his <hi>right hand</hi> rather then to part with him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count nothing so <hi>dear</hi> to him as <hi>Christ,</hi> is no small matter.

done: it must be here as in the case of <hi>mariage</hi>; a man must forsake all others, yea the <hi>whole World,</hi> else Christ will not own him. Observe the speech of the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. <hi>What is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward that believe,</hi> &amp;c. Mark, is to believe so easie a matter think you? Why, unless the mighty <hi>Power</hi> of God be engaged for it, with that strength as it was engaged in raising Christ from the dead, it cannot be. When thou art to believe, and united unto Christ, the agreement is not that thou shalt take him as thy <hi>Wife,</hi> and thou shalt be his <hi>Husband:</hi> No, he must be thy Husband, and thou his Wife, and according to the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that relation, thou must be in subjection to him, and must obey him. Now for a man to be brought out of his natural <hi>condition,</hi> and to take Christ on any <hi>terms,</hi> so he may be saved by him in the end, is not so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. Canst thou think there is no more required but onely the outward Baptism, or that there is no more in Baptism but the outward washing of the flesh? No, <hi>He's not a Jew that is one outwardly, neither is that circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is in the flesh; but he's a Jew that is so inwardly, and cireumcision is that of the heart.</hi> Rom. 2.29.

The other thing required is, that we forsake all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2. It is not confined to the very act, but it hath a perpetual effect all the dayes of thy life. I add, it never hath its <hi>full effect</hi> till the day of our death, the abolition of the whole <hi>body</hi> of <hi>sin.</hi> That which we seal, is not compleat till then, till we have final grace. The water of Baptism quenches the fire of Purgatory; for it is not accomplished till fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal grace is received. We are now under the Physicians hands, then shall we be cured. Baptism is not done onely at the Font, which is a thing deceives many; for it runs through our whole life: nor hath it consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation till our dying day, till we receive <hi>final grace</hi>: The force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Baptism is for the washing away of sin to morrow, as well as the day past: the death of sin is not, till the death of the body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its said <hi>we must be buried with him by Baptism into his death.</hi> Now at our death we receive <hi>final grace</hi>; till when, this <hi>washing</hi> and the vertue thereof hath not its <hi>consummation.</hi>

a man may find many faults in himself, but to find that which the Apostle afterwards found in himself, to see the flesh a <hi>rottenness,</hi> the sink of iniquity that is within him, and to find himself so bad as indeed he is, unless it please the Lord to open his eyes, and to teach him, he can never attain it.</p>
                     <p>Now we come to this place of the Apostle, wherein we see the true glass of our selves, the Spirit knows what we are, better then our selves and the Spirit shews us that every man of us either was, or is such as we are here set down to be. We are first natural before we can be spiritual, there is not a man, but hath been, or is yet, a <hi>natural</hi> man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore see we the large description of a natural man before he is quickned, before God, which <hi>is rich in mercy,</hi> enlivens him <hi>being dead in sins,</hi> and saves him by grace in Christ. Thus is it with us all, and thus must it be; and we shall never be fit for grace till we know our selves thus far, till we know our selves as far out of <hi>frame,</hi> as the Spirit of <hi>truth</hi> declares us to be. In this place of Scripture consider we</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Who this <hi>carnal man</hi> is; what they are which the Apostle speaks of, to be <hi>dead in sins: and that walk after the course of the World, led by the Devil, and have their conversation after the flesh, Children of wrath.</hi> These are <hi>big</hi> words and <hi>heavy</hi> things: Consider first the <hi>subject,</hi> of whom this is spoken.</p>
                     <p>Then follows the Praedicate, or</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What that ill news is, which he delivers of them. We begin with the first.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Who they are of whom this is spoken: and that is (you) <hi>You hath he quickned who were dead</hi>: and (<hi>ye</hi>) (in the words following) <hi>that in times past walked after the course of the world:</hi> and in the third verse more particularly: <hi>Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past.</hi> He speaks now in the first person, as before in the second, so that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is <hi>we all</hi> and <hi>ye all.</hi> Not a man in this Congregation, but is or was as bad as the holy Ghost here makes him. But</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To come to that, which is delivered of him: he is one <hi>not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, dead in sins:</hi> no better then <hi>nature</hi> made him, that <hi>corrupt nature</hi> which he hath from <hi>Adam,</hi> till he is thus spiritually enlivened.</p>
                     <p>Now he's described.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By the quality of his person.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By his company. <hi>Even as others.</hi> Thou mayst think thy self bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then another man, but thou art no better; never a <hi>barrel the better herring</hi> (as we say:) <hi>Even as others,</hi> thou art not so alone, but as bad as the worst, not a man more evil in his nature then thou art. When thou goest to Hell, perhaps some difference there may be in your several punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, according to your several acts of Rebellion: but yet you shall <hi>all come short of the Glory of God,</hi> And for matter of quickning you are all alike.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. First concerning their quality: And this is declared.</p>

Dead,</hi> and therefore unable and indisposed to the works of a <hi>spiritual living man:</hi> Besides, not onely indisposed and unable thereto, but <hi>dead in tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes and sins.</hi> For the separation of the Soul from God, is a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous death, than the separation of the Soul from the Body, and this is the reason, why St. <hi>John</hi> calls, <hi>damnation</hi> the second death. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.14. reckoning (in comparison) the naturall death for none. Accordingly also speaketh the learned Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> St. <hi>Cyril. Tom.</hi> 6. p. 415. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. <hi>That is not properly death, which separateth Soul from the body, but that which separateth God from the Soul. God is the life of the Soul, but he that is separated from life, is dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of alacrity and cheerfulness, as of life.</hi> He lies <hi>rotting</hi> in his own <hi>filth,</hi> like a <hi>rotten carkass,</hi> and <hi>stinking carrion</hi> in the nostrils of the Almighty, so loathsome is he: all which is drawn from <hi>Original sin.</hi> Not onely dis-enabled to any <hi>good,</hi> but prone to all <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. By his particular conversation: And that appears in the verse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. <hi>Where in times past ye walked.</hi> How? Not according to the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> not according to his <hi>rule,</hi> but they walked after three other wicked rules. A <hi>dead</hi> man then hath his walk you see: a strange thing in the <hi>dead,</hi> but who directs him in his course? These three, the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> the worst guides that may be; yet if we look to the <hi>conversation</hi> of a <hi>natural</hi> man, we see these are his <hi>Pilots,</hi> which are here set down.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The World. <hi>Wherein times past ye walked after the course of the World.</hi> He swims along with the stream of the <hi>World.</hi> Nor will he be singular, not such a <hi>precise</hi> one as some few are, but do as the <hi>World</hi> doth, run amain whither <hi>that</hi> carries him. See the state of a natural man. He's apt to be brought into the <hi>slavery</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> This is his first guide. Then follows</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Second, which is the <hi>Devil.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> leads him as well as the <hi>World: According to the Prince of the power of the Air, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that now worketh in the Children of disobedience.</hi> In stead of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Spirit of God to be led by, he's <hi>posted</hi> by the Spirit of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and <hi>the lusts of his Father the Devil he will do,</hi> He hath not an heart to resist the vilest <hi>lusts</hi> the Devil shall perswade him to. When Satan once <hi>fills</hi> his <hi>heart,</hi> he hath no heart to any thing else, then to follow him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There remains the Flesh, his guide too, and that's not left out, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Amongst whom we had our conversation in times past in the lusts of the flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind.</hi> So that you see the three <hi>guides</hi> of a <hi>natural</hi> man; and he is as bad as these three can make him: and till the <hi>stronger man</hi> comes and pulls him out, in this condition he remains, and in this natural estate, he is a son of <hi>disobedience.</hi> We see then the state of disobedience described to be <hi>wretchedness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. This further appears by that which must follow, which is <hi>cursedness. Rebellion</hi> and <hi>wretchedness</hi> going before, <hi>cursedness</hi> will follow. For God will not be abused, nor suffer a <hi>Rebel</hi> to go unpunished: Therefore saith the Apostle, <hi>We are by nature the Children of wrath.</hi> Being the natural sons of <hi>disobedience,</hi> we may well conclude we are the Children of <hi>wrath.</hi> If we can well learn these two things of our selves, how <hi>deep</hi> we are in <hi>sin,</hi> and how the wrath of God is due to us for our <hi>sins,</hi> then we may see what we are by Nature. Thus much concerning the quality of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man. Next follows</p>
                     <p n="2">2. His company. <hi>Even as others.</hi> By nature we are <hi>the Children of wrath even as others.</hi> That is to say, we go in that <hi>broad wide</hi> way that leads to damnation, that way we all naturally rush into: though we may think it otherwise, and think our selves better, yet we are deceived. For it is with us even as with others. <hi>Naturally</hi> we are in the same state that the worst men in the World are; so that we see the glass of a <hi>natural man,</hi> or of a man that hath made some <hi>beginnings,</hi> till Christ come and <hi>quicken</hi> him.</p>

I may say there is <hi>hell-fire</hi> in the heart; thy heart is a little hell within thee, these manifestations from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out make it appear to be so. The words of this man are <hi>rotten</hi> words and <hi>stinking</hi> words, and his heart is much more. So, this is the point, we are utterly indispos'd, aliens to all good, and bent to all evil. <hi>I am carnal</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>we are sold under sin,</hi> slaves unto it; sin is our <hi>Lord,</hi> and we its <hi>slaves.</hi> We have generally forfeited our happy estate, and are servants to S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>YOu see in this excellent portion of Scripture, the <hi>two Covenants</hi> of Almighty God: to wit, the <hi>Covenant of Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> The first of <hi>Nature,</hi> which was <hi>written by God in mans heart,</hi> and this is the holy Law of God, by vertue whereof a man was to continue in that <hi>integrity, holiness</hi> and <hi>uprightness,</hi> in which God had first created him, and to serve God according to that strength he first ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him with, that so he might live thereby.</p>
                     <p>But now, when man had broken this <hi>Covenant,</hi> and enter'd into a state of Rebellion against God, he's shut up in misery, but not in misery for ever, as the Angels that fell <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No, the Lord hath shut him up in prison, only for a while, that so he may the better make a way for their <hi>escape</hi> and <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and for their entrance into the second <hi>Covenant of Grace:</hi> that so making him see his own <hi>misery,</hi> wherein by nature he is, and cutting him off from his own <hi>stock,</hi> he may be <hi>ingrafted</hi> in Christ, draw sap and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from him, and bring forth fruits to everlasting life. And this is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod the Scripture useth: <hi>It concludes all under sin, that so the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe,</hi> Gal. 3.22. It's no new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine devised by us, but it's the <hi>course</hi> and <hi>method</hi> of the Scripture: for it begins in this great Work with <hi>imprisoning</hi> and <hi>shutting</hi> up. The Law is as <hi>a Justice of Peace,</hi> by his <hi>Mittimus</hi> commands us to prison: It's a <hi>Serjeant</hi> that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests a man, and carries to the <hi>Gaol:</hi> But why does the Scriptures do thus? It's not to destroy you with famine; the Law sends you not hither to starve you, or to kill you with the <hi>stench</hi> of the <hi>prison,</hi> but thereby to save and preserve you alive, and that you may <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirst</hi> after deliverance.

This word (<hi>all</hi>) is a forcible word, and empties us clean of every thing, that we may truly confess with the Apostle, <hi>In me,</hi> that is, <hi>in my flesh dwells no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7.18. It's impossible a man should by <hi>nature</hi> think thus of himself, that there is no <hi>good</hi> in him; or that he should by asking others find himself half so bad, as the Law makes him to be, by <hi>shutting</hi> up a man under sin, and all things in a man, yea all good whatsoever is in thee.</p>
                     <p>And this it doth <hi>that thou mayst come to Christ</hi>: as it is enlarged in the second verses following. <hi>Before faith came</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>we were kept up under the Law, shut up unto the faith, which should afterward be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: wherefore the Law was our School-master to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</hi> Before the time then that thou hast faith, (which is <hi>the day wherein salvation comes to thine house) thou art kept under the Law.</hi> Thou art not assured of salvation, nor canst thou expect, till then, that God should shew thee mercy.

The Law doth this, not to <hi>terrifie</hi> you too much, or to break your minds with <hi>despair,</hi> but to fit you for the faith: It's a <hi>shutting up, till that faith comes, which should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be revealed.</hi> He's a miserable <hi>Preacher</hi> which ends with preaching of the <hi>Law</hi>; the <hi>Law</hi> is for another, it's to fit us for <hi>faith. It's our School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master to bring us to Christ.</hi> We thunder not the <hi>Law,</hi> to make men run <hi>away</hi> from God, but to bring them <hi>home</hi> unto him. The Schoolmaster by the smart of his rod makes the child weary of his bondage, and desire ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to be past his non-age; and this is his end, not that he delights to hear him cry. Thus are we beaten by the Law, not that God delights or loves to hear us <hi>sigh</hi> or <hi>sob,</hi> but that we may grow weary of our misery and cruel bondage, may desire to be justified by faith. <hi>The Law</hi> then <hi>is so a Schoolmaster,</hi> as that by making us <hi>smart,</hi> it might bring us home. We see then the course and method of the Scripture, it <hi>hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</hi>

They do not begin to preach Christ first, his Vertue and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy; but first they tell them of their great sin, in crucifying the Lord of Life, <hi>viz. Whom with wicked hands you have taken and crucified.</hi> But what was the end of their doing thus? It's set down, <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>They were pricked to the heart, and then they cried out, Men and brethren, what shall we do to be saved?</hi> See, this was the end of all, the <hi>humbling</hi> of them, that by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what they had done, they might be pricked at the heart; so that now they see it, if it be no better with them, then for the present, it's like to go ill with them. This makes them cry out, <hi>What shall we do? Then</hi> (saith <hi>Peter) repent and be baptized, and you shall receive the gift of the holy Ghost.</hi> After he had told them their own, &amp; had brought them to their <hi>search,</hi> which is their first work, then comes the <hi>promise</hi> of Christ. Observe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles method in the Epistle to the <hi>Romans:</hi> which Book is a perfect <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism</hi> of the Church, which contains these three parts of Divinity, <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, Justification,</hi> and <hi>Sanctification.</hi> See how the Apostle orders his method. From the <hi>first Cap.</hi> to <hi>part of the third,</hi> he treats all of <hi>the Law,</hi> and <hi>convinces both Jew and Gentile, and all of sin.</hi> Then <hi>Cap.</hi> 3.19. mark his Conclusion: <hi>that every mouth may be stopped.</hi> When he had stopped every mouth, cast down every strong hold, which lifted it self up against God: when he had laid all at Gods feet, and left them bleeding, as it were, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the knife of God, then comes he to Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. <hi>The righteousness of God without the Law is manifest.</hi> He had done his first business in humbling them, in shewing them their sins by the Law: and assoon as that was done, when every mouth was <hi>stopped,</hi> then comes he to <hi>the promise by faith in Jesus Christ to all that believe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You see then the method of the Scripture is first to <hi>conclude all under sin, and so to fit men for the promise of Jesus Christ.</hi> Know therefore, that Law is the <hi>high-way</hi> to the Gospel, the path that leads to it, that way which must be trodden in: we are still out of our way, till we have begun our walks in this path: And if thou art not <hi>terrified</hi> by the Law, and the sight of thy <hi>sins,</hi> been at thy wits end, as it were, weary of thy condition and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, thou art not in the way yet. <hi>Our sowing must be in tears,</hi> Psal. 126.5. And it is said, that in the Church <hi>Triumphant all tears shall be wiped

away from our eyes.</hi> That's a promise: But is it possible that tears should b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Shall it be accounted a point of preciseness to walk in this way, or a <hi>soul-torturing</hi> doctrine to preach it? This is the way that all our Fore-Fathers have both preached, and gone. This is that time of sowing spoken of in <hi>Psal.</hi> 126.5, 6. <hi>They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</hi> It brings us <hi>joy</hi> in the end, to begin our <hi>sowing in tears.</hi> It waters that precious seed, and makes it bring forth joy unto us in abundance, yea such as no man can take from us.</p>
                     <p>So then having laid laid this point for a foundation, we now will come to the next.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That until we come to Christ, the Law layes hold of us. Till Christ come, we are shut up under the Law, kept under it.</hi> And if there were nothing else in the World to make a man weary of his <hi>condition,</hi> this were enough. Until a man hath given over himself to Christ, and renounced his own <hi>righteousness,</hi> he is subject to <hi>the Law,</hi> kept under it, not <hi>under grace.</hi> It brings a man only to the place, where grace is. Put this therefore close to your consciences, and jumble not these two together. First <hi>Nature</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and whilst you are under that, you are under the Law. Never think you are under the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> till you believe (of which belief we shall speak more hereafter.) Whilst you are under the Law, you are held under it and by it made obnoxious to the wrath of God; <hi>Whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is under the Law, is under the curse.</hi>

                     <p>Now that I may unfold it, and shew what a fearful thing it is to be under the Law, to be held under it (although many think it no great matter) hearken what the Apostle saith of it: <hi>Cursed be every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to doe them,</hi> Gal. 3.10. Well then, art thou under the <hi>Law?</hi> Then never think of being under <hi>grace</hi> at the same time; not but that we may hope to be under <hi>grace</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: By this <hi>Law</hi> we must be judged, and the Judgment of the <hi>Law</hi> is very severe: It requires not onely, that thou do this, or that good thing; but if thou continuest not in every thing, that is written therein, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns thee.</p>

                        <hi>Strange conceits</hi> men have now adayes, and <hi>strange Divinity</hi> is brought forth into the World: That if a man does as much as lies in him, and what he is of himself able to do; nay farther, though he be a <hi>Heathen,</hi> that knows not <hi>Christ,</hi> yet if he doth the best he can; if he live honestly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men; according to the conduct of his reason, and hath a <hi>good mind</hi> towards God, it's enough, he need not question his <hi>eternal welfare.</hi> A cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and desperate Doctrine they conclude hence? Why (say they) may not this man be <hi>saved</hi> as well as the <hi>best</hi>? But if it be so, I ask such, What is the benefit and advantage of the <hi>Jew</hi> more then the <hi>Gentile</hi>? What is the benefit of Christ? of the Church? of Faith? of Baptism? of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper? This ground of <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> is that, for which the devout Spouse of Christ, the Church <hi>abhors</hi> us: when we shall undertake to bring a man to <hi>salvation</hi> without Christ: whereas, if he be not under <hi>grace,</hi> under <hi>Christ,</hi> he is <hi>accursed.</hi> If thou wilt be saved by the Law, it is not thy endeavour or doing, what <hi>lieth in thee</hi>; that <hi>will serve the turn</hi>; every <hi>jot</hi> and <hi>

                     <p>Now that I may declare to you the difference between the Law and the Gospel: I will difference it in three particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Law rejects any kind of obedience besides that which is <hi>thorough, sound, full,</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> without any touch of the flesh. It rejects all <hi>crackt payment:</hi> it will take no <hi>clipt coyn.</hi> That obedience which hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imperfection joyn'd with it, will not be accepted: But here I must not speak without book. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. <hi>We know that the Law is spiritual, but I am carnal.</hi> And then concludes, <hi>O wretched man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Law is spiritual,</hi> What's that? We may know the meaning of it by the particle (<hi>but</hi>) but <hi>I am carnal. The Law is spiritual.</hi> That is, it requires, that all our works be <hi>spiritual,</hi> without any <hi>carnality,</hi> or touch of the <hi>fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> then our <hi>blessed condition</hi> under the Gospel: it requires not perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but <hi>thankfulness</hi> for mercies received, and a <hi>willing mind.</hi> Suppose we cannot do what we would, that's no matter. God looks to our <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and the <hi>willingness</hi> of our minds; if it be according to the strength that thou hast, it is received with <hi>acceptance.</hi> Here then arises the second point of difference, and that is.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Law considers not what thou <hi>now</hi> hast, but what thou <hi>once</hi> hadst. If thou sayst, I have done my best; and what, would you have a man do more then he can do? The <hi>Law</hi> heeds not that: It considers not what thou <hi>doest,</hi> but what thou <hi>ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>st</hi> to do. It requires that thou shouldst perform obedience according to thy first strength, and that perfection once God gave thee, that all thou doest should have love for it's ground: that thou shouldst <hi>love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and strength. Mat.</hi> 22.37. Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> the Law is very imperious, like those <hi>Task-masters</hi> in <hi>Egypt, that laid bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens on the Israelites too heavy for them to bear.</hi> They had at first materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and then they delivered in the full tale of bricks: But when the straw was taken from them, they complain of the heaviness of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ir burthen.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99037:27"/>
But what's the answer? <hi>You are idle, you are idle, you shall deliver the same tale of bricks as before,</hi> Exod. 5.17. So stands the case here. It's not enough to plead, Alas! if I had <hi>strength,</hi> I would do it; but I have not strength, I cannot do it. But the Law is <hi>peremptory,</hi> you must do it: you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by force, you shall do it. The <hi>impossibility</hi> of our fulfilling it, does not exempt us, as appears by comparing <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. although it be impossible, as the case stands, for the Law to be by us fulfilled, yet we are held under it, as appears plainly thus. If I deliver a man a <hi>stock</hi> of <hi>money</hi> whereby he may gain his own <hi>living,</hi> and be advantageous to me; and he <hi>spend</hi> it, and when I require mine own with increase, he tells me, True Sir, I received such a <hi>sum</hi> of <hi>money</hi> of you for this purpose, but I have spent it, and am <hi>disinabled</hi> to pay. Will this serve the turn? will it satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Creditor,</hi> or discharge the <hi>debt?</hi> No, no, the <hi>Law</hi> will have its <hi>own</hi> of him. If thou payest not thy <hi>due,</hi> thou must be shut up under it. It's otherwise under the Gospel: that accepts a man according to what he hath, not according to what he hath not. And here comes in the third point.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> although I am <hi>fallen,</hi> yet if I repent, the greatest sin that is, cannot condemn me. By <hi>repentance</hi> I am safe. Let our sins be never so great, yet if we return by <hi>repentance,</hi> God accepts us. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> remove all. The <hi>Law</hi> knows no such thing. Look into the Laws of the Realm. If a man be indicted and convinced of <hi>Treason, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> or <hi>Felony</hi>; though this man plead, True, I have committed such an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; but I beseech you Sir, pardon it, for I am heartily sorry for it: I never did the like before, nor never will again. Though he thus <hi>repent,</hi> shall he escape? No, the rigour of the Law will execute Justice on him: there is no benefit had by <hi>repentance,</hi> the <hi>law</hi> will <hi>seize</hi> on him, he should have looked to it before. If thou committest <hi>Murther</hi> or <hi>Burglary,</hi> it's not enough to put one good deed for another; to say, I have done <hi>thus</hi> and <hi>thus</hi> for the <hi>King</hi>; I kept such a Fort, or I won such a Town: this will not serve thy <hi>turn,</hi> it will not save thy <hi>neck:</hi> the law takes no knowledge of any good thing done, or of any repentance. This is thy estate. Consider then what a case they are in, that are shut up under the Law: until a man hath saith, it admits no exeuse, requires things far above thy power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; it will accept no repentance: And therefore we may well make this Conclusion in the <hi>Galathians, As many as are under the law, are under the curse,</hi> as it is written, <hi>Cursed is every one that continues not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10.</p>
                     <p>But now, where are we thus shut up? <hi>It's under sin,</hi> as the Apostle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ells us. <hi>For the Law discovers sin to be sin indeed: that sin by the commandment may become exceeding sinful,</hi> Rom. 7.13. The Law makes us see more of it than we did, or possibly could come to have seen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>By the Law cometh the knowledge of sin: I had not known sin, but by the law.</hi> Yes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure I might have known Murther, Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to have been sins; but to have known them to have been <hi>exceeding sinful,</hi> I could not but by the <hi>law.</hi> To know what a kind of plague sin is in it self, so as not to make a <hi>game</hi> of it, or a <hi>small matter,</hi> as many <hi>usually make it</hi>; to see the <hi>ugliness</hi> of it, I cannot without the <hi>law.</hi> But that we may know what sin is, and that we may see it to be <hi>exceeding sinful,</hi> I here bring you a few <hi>Considerations,</hi> which I would have you <hi>ponder</hi> on, and <hi>enlarge</hi> them to your selves, when you come home.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Consider the <hi>baseness</hi> of him that offends, and the <hi>excellency</hi> of him that is offended: You shall never know what sin is without this <hi>twofold Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>: lay them together, and it will make sin out of <hi>measure sinful.</hi> See in <hi>David, The drunkards made songs and ballads of him.</hi> He aggravates the indignity offered him, in that he was their King, yet that those wretched
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99037:28"/>
and filthy beasts <hi>the drunkards made songs of him.</hi> See it likewise in <hi>Job,</hi> Cap. 29. when he had declared unto them in what glory he once was, that he was a King and Prince in the Country. Then see <hi>Cap.</hi> 20. <hi>They that are younger than me have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdain'd to have set with the dogs of my flock.</hi> He aggravates the offence. First from the dignity of the persons wronged, <hi>a King, and a Prince.</hi> Then from the <hi>baseness</hi> and <hi>vileness</hi> of those, who derided him, <hi>They were such as were youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than he, such as whose fathers he would have disdain'd to have set with the dogs of his flocks.</hi> A great <hi>indignity,</hi> and mightily <hi>aggravated</hi> by these <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> that a <hi>King</hi> should be abased by such <hi>vile</hi> persons. Now some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion there might be between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>the drunkards, Job</hi> and <hi>these men</hi>; but between <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>God</hi> what proportion can th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What a base worm that crawleth on the earth, dust and ashes, and yet <hi>darest</hi> thou thy Maker? Dost thou (saith God) lift thy self up against <hi>him,</hi> before whom all the powers of Heaven do tremble? whom the Angels do adore?

What, oppose thy self, a base <hi>creature,</hi> to Almighty God thy <hi>Creator?</hi> Consider this, and let the <hi>baseness</hi> of the <hi>delinquent,</hi> and the Majesty and Glory of that God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom he offends, be the first <hi>aggravation</hi> of sin, and thou shalt find sin <hi>out of measure sinful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Consider the <hi>smalness</hi> of the <hi>Motives,</hi> and the <hi>littleness</hi> of the <hi>induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> that perswade thee so <hi>vile a creature,</hi> to set thy self against so <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> a <hi>God.</hi> If it were <hi>great m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A little <hi>profit</hi> it may be, or <hi>pleasure:</hi> It may be neither of these, or not so much. When thou breathest out <hi>oaths,</hi> and belchest out <hi>fearful blasphemies</hi> against God; when thou <hi>rendest</hi> and <hi>tearest</hi> his <hi>dreadful</hi> and <hi>terrible</hi> name: what makes such a <hi>base</hi> and <hi>vile villain</hi> as thou thus to fly in Gods face? Is there any <hi>profit</hi> or <hi>delight</hi> in breathing forth blasphemies? <hi>Profit</hi> thou canst take none, and if thou take <hi>pleasure</hi> in it, then the Devil is in thee: yea, then thou art worst than the Devil himself. This is the second Consideration which may make us to see the vileness of sin, and abhor our selves for it: to wit, the <hi>slenderness</hi> of the temptations, and <hi>smalness</hi> of the motives to it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Add what strong <hi>helps</hi> and <hi>means</hi> God hath given thee to keep thee from sin. As, I say, thou shouldst consider the <hi>bitterness</hi> of the <hi>delinquent,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>offended,</hi> the mean motives whch cause so <hi>base</hi> a <hi>creature</hi> to do so <hi>vile</hi> an <hi>act</hi>; so also consider the great means God hath given thee to keep thee from sin.</p>
                     <p>He hath given thee his Word, and this will greatly aggravate thy sins, to sin against his Word, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.11. When God convinces <hi>Adam,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thus far with him: <hi>Hast thou</hi> (saith he) <hi>eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?</hi> What, hast thou done it, as if thou wouldst do it on purpose to <hi>cross</hi> God? God hath given thee an express <hi>command</hi> to the contrary, and yet hast thou done this? Hast thou so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard the Law, and pray'd, <hi>Lord have mercy on me, and incline my heart to keep this law,</hi> and yet wilt thou <hi>lye, swear, commit adultery,</hi> and <hi>deal falsly,</hi> and that contrary to the command of God, obstinately disobey him?</p>
                     <p>Now God hath not only given this great means of his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> but great <hi>grace</hi> too. Where understand that there is not only final grace, but degrees of grace: else the Apostle would not have said, <hi>receive not the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in vain.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.1. Consider then how much <hi>grace</hi> thou hast received in <hi>vain.</hi> How many motions to good hast thou rejected? Perhaps thy heart is touched at this Sermon, though it is

not my <hi>tongue,</hi> nor the <hi>tongue</hi> of the most elegant in the world, that can touch the heart, but the Spirit that comes along with his Word. Now when thou findst with the <hi>Word</hi> a <hi>Spirit</hi> to go with it, it is a <hi>grace.</hi> If thy conscience be enlightned, and thy duty revealed to thee, so that it tells thee <hi>what</hi> thou art, <hi>what</hi> thou oughtest <hi>to do,</hi> and <hi>not to do,</hi> it is a <hi>grace.</hi> Now if for all this, thou blindly runnest through, and art never the better, but obstinately settest thy self against God, and dost many things which others that have not received the same <hi>grace</hi> would not have done, know then that thou receivest this <hi>grace</hi> in vain, and thy <hi>case is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. Consider God's great goodness, which ought to restrain thee from sin upon a double account.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. First, his <hi>goodness</hi> in himself should keep thee from offending him. There's nothing but <hi>goodness,</hi> infinite <hi>goodness</hi> in him, and canst thou find in thy heart to sin against so <hi>good</hi> a God? To offend, and wrong a <hi>good</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position'd person, one of a <hi>sweet nature</hi> and affection, it aggravates the fault, 'tis pity to wrong or hurt such a one, as injures no body. Now such a one is God, a <hi>good</hi> God, infinite in <hi>goodness,</hi> rich in mercy, very <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> it self; and therefore it must needs aggravate the <hi>foulness</hi> of sin to sin against him: But now he is not only thus in himself, but</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Secondly, He's good to thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>Despisest thou the riches of his</hi> goodness <hi>and forbearance?</hi> &amp;c. What hast thou that thou hast not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from his bountiful hand? <hi>Consider</hi> of this, and let this be a means to draw thee off from thy <hi>sinfulness.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> had greatly sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and when God brings his murther home to him, he pleads thus with him: <hi>When thou wert nothing in thine own eyes, I brought thee</hi> (saith God) <hi>to the Kingdom, I took thee from the sheep-fold, and exalted thee, and brought the to a plentiful house,</hi> Vid. 2 Sam. 12.7, 8. And may not God say the like to us? and <hi>do you thus requite the Lord, O you foolish people and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,</hi> Deut. 32.6. that the more his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> is to you, the higher your sins should be against him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Besides, consider more than all this, we have the examples of <hi>good men</hi> before our eyes. God commands us not, what we cannot do: If God had not set some before our eyes, that walk in his <hi>ways,</hi> and do his <hi>will,</hi> then we might say that these are precepts, that none can perform: But we have patterns, of whom we may say, such a man I never knew to <hi>lye,</hi> such a one never to <hi>swear,</hi> and this should be a means to preserve us from sinning, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Noah</hi> was a good man, and being moved with fear, set not at nought the threatning of God, but <hi>built the Ark, and thereby condemned the world.</hi> His example <hi>condemned the world,</hi> in that they followed it not, although it were so good, but continued in their great sins. So, art thou a wicked deboist person? there is no good man but shall condemn thee by his <hi>example.</hi> It's a great crime <hi>in the land of uprightness to do wickedly,</hi> Isa. 26.10. to be <hi>profane,</hi> when the <hi>righteous</hi> by their blameless lives may teach thee otherwise.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And lastly, add to all the consideration of the <hi>multitude</hi> and <hi>weight</hi> of thy <hi>sins.</hi> Hadst thou but sinned <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice,</hi> or in <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> it were somewhat tolerable. But thy sins are <hi>great</hi> and <hi>many</hi>: They are heavy, and thou continually encreasest their weight, and addest to their number. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.6. <hi>A lyon out of the forrest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evening shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their Cities, and every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces.</hi> Why? <hi>Because their transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are</hi> many, <hi>and their back-slidings are</hi> encreased. If thou hadst commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but <hi>two,</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> or <hi>four</hi> sins, thou mightest have hope of <hi>pardon</hi>; but when thou shalt never have done with thy God, but wilt be still <hi>encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> still <hi>multiplying</hi> thy sins, then mayst thou expect to hear from Gods

mouth that dreadful expostulation in the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.7. <hi>How can I pardon thee</hi>? Thus <hi>David</hi> sets out his own sins in their <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>number,</hi> Psal. 38.4. <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over my head, as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</hi> The continual <hi>multiplying</hi> of them adds to their heap both in <hi>number</hi> and <hi>weight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I have shew'd you what the <hi>Law</hi> does in respect of sin, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of being under the <hi>Law,</hi> that it makes sin appear in its own colours, and sets it forth to be, as indeed it is, <hi>exceeding sinful.</hi> But the Law does not yet leave sin, nor let it scape thus: But as the <hi>Law</hi> discovers our <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,</hi> and <hi>accursedness</hi> by sin, its <hi>wretchedness</hi> and mans <hi>misery</hi> by it, till his <hi>blessedness</hi> comes, from the hand of his <hi>Jesus:</hi> so it lays down the miserable estate which befals him for it. If he will not spare God with his <hi>sins,</hi> God will not spare him with his <hi>plagues.</hi> Let us consider of this <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursedness</hi> sin brings on us: God will not let us go so, but as long as we are under the <hi>Law,</hi> we are under the <hi>Curse</hi>; and till we are in Christ, we can expect nothing, but that which should come from the hand of a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked</hi> God. Assure thy self, thou that pleasest thy self in thy abomonati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that God will not take this at thine hands, that by so <hi>base</hi> a <hi>creature</hi> as thou art, so <hi>vile</hi> a thing as <hi>sin</hi> is should be committed against him. But of the woful effects of sin, which is Gods wrath, we will speak the next time.</p>

                     <p>I Declared unto you heretofore, what we are to consider in the state of a natural man, a man that is not new <hi>fashioned,</hi> new <hi>moulded,</hi> a man that is not cut off from his own <hi>stock,</hi> a man that is not <hi>ingrafted</hi> into Christ, he is the <hi>son</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> he is the <hi>son</hi> of <hi>death.</hi> First I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you his <hi>sinfulness,</hi> and now Secondly I shall shew you his <hi>accursedness,</hi> that which follows necessarily upon sin unrepented of. I declared before what the nature of sin is: And now I come to shew what the <hi>dreadful effects</hi> of sin are; I mean the enevitable <hi>consequence</hi> that follows upon sin, and that is, <hi>woe</hi> and <hi>misery, Woe unto us, that we have sinned.</hi> A <hi>woe</hi> is a short word, but there lieth much in it.</p>
                     <p>Doct. <hi>Woe and anguish must follow him that continueth sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And when we hear this from the Ministers of God, it is as if we heard that Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.13. <hi>flying through the midst of Heaven, denouncing, Woe, woe, woe to the Inhabitants of the earth.</hi> The <hi>Ministers</hi> of God are his <hi>Angels</hi>; and the same that I now deliver to you, if an Angel should now come from Heaven, he would deliver no other thing. Therefore consider that it is a voice from Heaven, that this <hi>woe, woe, woe,</hi> shall rest upon the <hi>heads,</hi> upon the <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>souls</hi> of all them that will not yield unto God, that will not stoop to him, that will be their own masters, and stand it out against him: <hi>woe, woe, woe</hi> unto them all. <hi>Woe unto us.</hi> It's the voice of the Church in general, not of one man; but <hi>but woe unto us, that we have sinned.</hi>

It is not for me to make particular application, do you do that your selves: <hi>We are all children of wrath by nature:</hi> in our <hi>natural</hi> condition we are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, we are all of one <hi>kind,</hi> and every <hi>kind</hi> generates its own <hi>kind:</hi> 'Tis an hereditary condition, and <hi>till the Son makes us free, we are all subject to this woe.

                           </gap>st and a third woe is coming.</hi> God proceeds punctually with us. And are not our proceedings in <hi>Judiciary Courts</hi> after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? The <hi>Judge</hi> when he pronounceth sentence, doth particularize the matter; <hi>Thou shalt return to the place, from whence thou camest, thou shalt have thy bolts knockt off, thou shalt be drawn to the place of execution, thou shalt be hanged, thou shalt be cut down, and quartered</hi>; and so he goes on. And this is that, which is the witness of Justice. Thus is it here, the Spirit of God thinks it not enough to say barely, the state of a sinner is a woful estate; but the <hi>woes</hi> are punctually number'd, and this shall be my practice. Now</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first thing that followeth after sin is this: After the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of sin, there cometh such a condition into the soul that it is <hi>defiled, polluted,</hi> and becometh <hi>abominable.</hi> And this is the first woe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The soul being thus defiled and abominable, <hi>God loaths it</hi>; for God cannot endure to dwell in a <hi>filthy</hi> and <hi>stinging carrion-soul,</hi> he startles as it were, and seems afraid to come near it, he <hi>forsakes</hi> it, and cannot endure it. And that's the second woe: First sin defiles it, then God departs from it, there must be a <hi>divorce.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. When God is departed from the soul, then <hi>the Devil enters in,</hi> he presently comes in, and takes up the room, there will be no <hi>emptiness</hi> or <hi>vacuum.</hi> And this is a fearful woe indeed: for as soon as God is depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a man, he is left to the guidance of the <hi>Devil,</hi> his own <hi>flesh,</hi> and the <hi>World.</hi> There will be no emptiness in the heart: no sooner God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, but these step in, and take Gods place.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Then in the fourth place, after all this is done, comes <hi>sin and cries for its wages, which is death.</hi> The terrible death which comprehends in it all that beadroll of curses, which are written in the Book of God; and not onely those, but the curses also which are not written, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. which are so many that they cannot be written. Though the Book of God be a <hi>compleat Book,</hi> and the Law of God a <hi>perfect Law,</hi> yet here they come <hi>short,</hi> and are <hi>imperfect</hi>: For the curses not written shall light upon him, which are so many, as pen and ink cannot set down, nay, the very pen of God cannot express them, so many are the calamities, and sorrows, that shall light upon the soul of every sinful man.</p>
                     <p>Now let us take these woes in pieces one after another.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first woe is <hi>the polluting and defiling of the soul by sin.</hi> A thing (<hi>it may be</hi>) that we little think of; but if God once open our eyes, and shew us what a black soul we have within us, and that every <hi>sin,</hi> every <hi>lustful thought,</hi> every <hi>covetous act,</hi> every sin sets a new <hi>spot</hi> and <hi>stain</hi> upon the soul, and tumbles it into a new <hi>puddle</hi> of <hi>filth,</hi> then we shall see it, and not till then; for our eyes are <hi>carnal,</hi> and we cannot see this. If once we did but see our <hi>hateful</hi> and <hi>abominable</hi> spots, that every sin <hi>tumbles</hi> us afresh into the <hi>mire:</hi> did we see what a black Devil we have within us, we would <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>abhor</hi> our selves, as <hi>Job</hi> did. It would be so foul a sight, that it would make us out of our wits, as it were, to behold it. A man that is but <hi>natural,</hi> cannot imagine, what a <hi>black Devil</hi> there is within him: But though he seeth it not, yet <hi>he that hath eyes, like as flame of fire,</hi> Rev. 1.14. seeth our <hi>stains,</hi> and <hi>spots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:99037:30"/>Our Saviour shews the filthiness of the heart, by that which proceeds out of the mouth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Those things which proceed out of the mouth, come from the heart.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. Observe. Of all evils we account evil <hi>thoughts</hi> the least. This we think strange, what, <hi>thoughts</hi> defile a man? what, so light a matter as a thought? Can they make any <hi>impression</hi>? Yes, and defile a man too, leaving soch a spot behind them, which nothing but the <hi>hot blood</hi> of Christ can wash away. So many evil <hi>thoughts,</hi> so many <hi>blasphemies,</hi> so many <hi>filthy things</hi> come from the heart, every one being a new <hi>defilement</hi> and <hi>pollution that a man</hi> is made so <hi>nasty</hi> by it and <hi>filthy,</hi> that he cannot believe that it is so bad with him, as indeed it is. the Apostle having shewn the <hi>Corinthians</hi> their former life, and exhorted them against it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. goes on <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh, and spirit.</hi> Mark then, there is a double filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>a filthiness of the flesh,</hi> and <hi>a filthinest of the spirit.</hi> The filthiness of the flesh, that every one acknowledgeth to be filthy carnality, Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These <hi>bestial lusts</hi> every one knows to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</hi> But then there is a <hi>filth</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> too, and such are evil <hi>thoughts.</hi> They are the filth of the Spirit. <hi>Corruptio optimi est pessima. The corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which cleaves to the best thing is worst.</hi> The Soul is the Best thing, the most noble thing; the filthiness, which cleaves to it therefore must needs be the greatest. Fleshly <hi>filthiness,</hi> as Adultery, is <hi>filthy</hi>; but <hi>Contemplative Adultery,</hi> to <hi>dwell thereon,</hi> is worse: however such a man may be pure from the filth of the flesh, yet if he <hi>delight</hi> himself in <hi>filthy thoughts,</hi> his <hi>spirit</hi> is <hi>abominable</hi> in the sight of God: There is a stain by every one of thy <hi>impure thoughts</hi> left behind. However an actual sin be far greater then the sin of a thought, yet if that be but once committed, and these are frequently in thee; if thou alway lie tumbling in the <hi>suds</hi> of thy filthy <hi>thoughts,</hi> thy continuing therein makes thy sin more <hi>abominable,</hi> then <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> outward act, which he but once committed. So that we see there is <hi>a filthiness of the spirit, as well as the flesh.</hi> In <hi>James</hi> 1.21. we have a word sets out the filthiness of it, which is (<hi>Superfluity.) Lay apart</hi> (saith he) <hi>all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, it's expressed by the name of <hi>filthiness,</hi> shewing there's nothing so defiles a man as sin.</p>
                     <p>Then 'tis called superfluity of naughtiness; But what, is there any naughtiness to be born with? And what exceeds that, it is superfluity? No, that's not the meaning of the place. By <hi>superfluity,</hi> is meant the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of sin.</hi> Excrements are the refuse of meat, when the good nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment is taken away from it. And 'tis as if he had said, <hi>Lay aside fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, nasty, or excrementitious sin.</hi> The word was used in the Ceremonies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and thereby we may see what was taught concerning sin, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.12, 13. <hi>Thou shalt have a place without the camp whither thou shall goe,</hi> &amp;c. Though the comparison be homely, yet it shews the filthiness of the sin, that it is a very excrement. <hi>Thou shalt have a paddle, and it shall be that when thou wilt ease thy self, thou shalt dig therewith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thou shalt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that which cometh from thee.</hi> But what, did God care for these things? No, it was to teach them a higher matter: As the reason following im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. <hi>For the Lord thy God walketh in the midst of the Camp.</hi> God would thereby shew them, that those things at which every man stoppeth his nose, are not so <hi>filthy</hi> to man, as a sin is unto God. So that you see how the case stands with a sinful man: Sin <hi>defiles</hi> him, it <hi>pollutes</hi> him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And then in the next place, <hi>It makes Gods soul to hate and abhor him.</hi> It's true, some sins there are that every man imagineth to be <hi>shameful</hi> and <hi>filthy</hi>; but we see all sin is so to God, 'tis <hi>filthiness of Flesh and Spirit.</hi> A
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99037:30"/>
man may hate <hi>carnality, fleshly filthiness</hi>; peradventure also he may hate <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,</hi> but pride and prodigality that he may get (as he thinks) credit by, that he cannot maintain the reputation of a Gentleman without them. A miserable thing, that a man should account that a <hi>garnish</hi> of the soul, which doth defile and pollute it. If a man should take the excrements of a beast to adorn himself, would not we think him an Ass? Well, when we thus defile our selves by sin, God cannot <hi>endure</hi> us, he is forced to <hi>turn</hi> from us, he <hi>abhors</hi> us; And that's the next woe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When thou hast made thy self such a <hi>Black Soul,</hi> such a <hi>Dunghil,</hi> such a <hi>Sty,</hi> then God must be gone, he cannot endure to dwell there: It stands not with his <hi>honour,</hi> and with the <hi>purity</hi> of his nature to dwell in such a polluted heart, there must now be a divorce: <hi>Holiness becomes his House for ever. His delight is in the Saints, Psal.</hi> 93.5. <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. He is <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> he will not be in a <hi>Sty:</hi> When thou hast thus <hi>pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted</hi> and <hi>defiled</hi> thy soul, God and thou must presently part: God <hi>puts thee off,</hi> and thou <hi>puttest God off</hi> too, We read in that place before alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. that before they knew Christ, they were <hi>without God in the world,</hi> &amp;c.

And in <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Having their understanding darkned, and being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them.</hi> The <hi>presence</hi> of God is the <hi>life</hi> of our souls; and we having through <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> banisht God, we become <hi>strangers</hi> until the time of our <hi>ingrafting</hi> into Christ; we are aliens from the life of God: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon comes a mutual kind of <hi>abhorring</hi> one another. God <hi>abhors</hi> us, and we <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>filthy</hi> wretches <hi>abhor</hi> God again. There is enmity betwixt God and us, and between all that belongs to God, and all that belongs to us. There's an enmity betwixt God and us, and observe the expression of it, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.15. <hi>If you shall despise my statutes, or if your souls shall abhor my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, so that you will not do my commandments,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>Nor is this all the enmity. There is <hi>enmity</hi> also betwixt all that belongs to God, and all that belongs to us. Gods children and the wicked have ever an <hi>enmity</hi> betwixt them, such an enmity as will never be reconciled. It's set down in <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.27. <hi>An unjust man is an abomination to the just, and he that is upright in his way, is an abomination to the wicked.</hi> Just as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>seed</hi> of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> so it is between both the <hi>seeds. A wicked man is an abomination to the just, and an upright man is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the wicked.</hi> There is a pale of abomination set between them: so that this is the second woe. We come now to the third.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And the third woe is that which immediately follows, <hi>Gods leaving of us.</hi> When we have polluted our selves with sin, and God by reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>abhors</hi> us, and turns from us, then are there others ready presently to take up the room; so soon as God <hi>departs,</hi> the Devil <hi>steps in</hi> and becomes thy God. He was thy God by <hi>Creation,</hi> this by <hi>usurpation:</hi> He was thy <hi>Father</hi> that would have given thee every good thing; but now thou art <hi>Fatherless,</hi> or rather worse, thou hast the Devil for thy Father, and better is it to be without one. When the Devil is thy Father, his works thou must do. When <hi>the Spirit of God departed from</hi> Saul, <hi>presently the evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99037:31"/>
entred into him,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.14. If the good Spirit be gone out, the evil Spirit soon comes in: he comes and takes possession, and is therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The God of this world:</hi> And while we are in that state, <hi>we walk after the course of</hi> him <hi>that worketh in the children of disobedience, Eph.</hi> 2.2. We would account it a terrible thing, for our selves or any of our children to be <hi>possessed</hi> of a <hi>Devil</hi>; but what it is to be possessed of this Devil thou knowest not. It's not half so bad to have a <hi>Legion</hi> possess thy <hi>Body,</hi> as to have but one to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess thy <hi>Soul.</hi> He becomes thy God and thou must do his work; he will tyrannize over thee. What a fearful thing therefore is this, that as soon as God departs from us and forsakes us, and we him, that the Devil should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently come in his room, and take up the heart? Mark that place in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Where in times past ye walked according to the course of the world, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> &amp;c. Assoon as God leaves a man, what a fearful company assail him? They all concur together, the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil:</hi> These take Gods place.</p>
                     <p>The world is like the <hi>tide,</hi> when a man hath the <hi>tide</hi> with him, he hath great advantage of him that rows against the <hi>tide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here is the Devil too. The world is as a swift current, and besides this comes the Devil and fills the heart, the <hi>Prince of the Power of the Air.</hi> While thou wert carried with the world, thou went'st with the Stream, and hadst the <hi>tide</hi> with thee; but now the Devil being come, thou hast both <hi>wind</hi> and <hi>tide</hi>; and how can he chuse but <hi>run, whom the Devil drives?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this is not all: There must be something in thine own disposition too, that it may be completely filled: Though there be <hi>wind</hi> and <hi>tide,</hi> yet if the Ship be a <hi>slug,</hi> it will not make that hast that another light ship will: Therefore here is the <hi>flesh</hi> too, and the <hi>fulfilling</hi> the desires thereof, which is a <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>nimble</hi> vessel, and this makes up the matter. So that if we consider the <hi>wind</hi> and <hi>tide,</hi> and <hi>lightness</hi> of the Ship, it will appear how the room is filled: And how woful must the state of that man be? It is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to be delivered up unto Satan, but not so fearful as to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to <hi>ones own lusts.</hi> But by the way observe this for a ground: God never gives us up, God <hi>never forsakes us till we first forsake him.</hi> He is still before hand with us in doing us <hi>good</hi>; but in point of <hi>hurt</hi> we our selves are first, in the point of forsaking we are always before hand with God. If it should be proposed to thee, whether thou wilt forsake God or the Devil, and thou dost forsake God and chusest the Devil, thou deservest that he should take possession of thee. When a man shall obstinately renew his <hi>gross sins,</hi> doth he not deserve to be given up? Observe the case in our first Parents. God told the woman one thing, the Devil perswades her another; she hearkens to the Devil, and believes <hi>him</hi> rather than God; and when we shall desire to serve the <hi>Devil</hi> rather than God, the God that made us, and that made heaven for us, do we not deserve to be given up to him? For <hi>his Servants we are whom we obey, Rom.</hi> 6.16. And thus we see how fearful a thing it is, to be delivered up to our selves and to the Devil, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.11. First they forsake God: God comes and offers himself unto them, I will be thy God, thy Father, thou shalt want nothing: yet notwithstanding <hi>Israel would not hear, they would have none of me.</hi> And then if thou wilt have none of me, I will have none of thee saith God. Then see what follows, <hi>v.</hi> 12. God commits the Prisoner to himself: <hi>I gave them up to their own hearts lusts,</hi> &amp;c. And there's no case so desperate as this, when God shall say, If thou wilt be thine own <hi>Master</hi> be thine own <hi>Master.</hi> Thus to be given up to a mans <hi>self,</hi> is worse than to be given up unto <hi>Satan:</hi> To be given up unto Satan may be for thy safety; but there's not a mountain of Gods wrath greater, than to give a man up unto himself. We would fain go over the hedges; but when God loves us <hi>he hedges up our ways,</hi> Hos. 2.6. If God love us he will not leave us to our selves, though we desire it. But when God
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99037:31"/>
shall say, go thy wayes, if thou wilt not be kept in, be thy own Master, this is a most fearful thing: And this is the third woe. First <hi>the soul is pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with</hi> sin; it <hi>forsakes God, and God forsakes it:</hi> Then <hi>the World, the Flesh, and</hi> the <hi>Devil, these fill up the room</hi>; and then what follows, when these three rule within? But all kinds of sin: And so all kinds of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the next <hi>Woe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. And this woe brings in all the curses of Almighty God, an <hi>Iliad</hi> of evils. Sin calls for its wages, <hi>viz. Death, Death.</hi> That's the payment of all: <hi>The wages of sin is death.</hi> And this is the next thing; which I shall open and explain.</p>
                     <p>Now in handling hereof, I will first shew how death in general must of necessity follow sin, that thou who hast forsaken the <hi>fountain of life,</hi> art liable to everlasting death. And for this see some places of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2, 3. <hi>The wages of sin is death.</hi> Consider then, first what this <hi>wages</hi> is. Wages is a thing which must be paid: If you have an hireling, and your hireling receive not his wages, you are sure to hear of it, and God will hear of it too, <hi>James</hi> 5.4. <hi>He which keeps back the wages of the labourer, or the hireling, their cry will come into the ears of the Lord of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both.</hi> As long as hirelings wages are unpaid, Gods ears are filled with their cries, <hi>Pay me my wages, pay me my wages.</hi> So sin cries, and it is a <hi>dead voice, Pay me my wages, pay me my wages, the wages of sin is death.</hi> And sin never leaves crying, never lets God alone, never give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> him rest, till this wages be paid. When <hi>Cain</hi> had slain <hi>Abel,</hi> he thought he should never have heard any more on't; but sin hath a voice, <hi>The voice of thy Brothers blood cries unto me from the ground.</hi> So <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.20. the Lord saith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Sodom, Because the cry of Sodom is great, and their sin very grievous, therefore I will go down and see, whether they have done according to the cry that is come up into mine ears.</hi> As if the Lord had said, It's a loud cry, I can have no rest for it, <hi>therefore I will go down and see,</hi> &amp;c. If man had his ears open, he would continually hear sin crying unto God, <hi>Pay me my wages, pay me my wages,</hi> kill this sinful soul: And though we do not hear it, yet so it is. The <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>doleful</hi> sound thereof fills Heaven: It makes God say, <hi>I will go down and see,</hi> &amp;c. Till sin receive its wages, God hath no rest. Again, see <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11. <hi>Sin taking occasion by the Commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</hi> I thought sin not to have been so great a matter, as it is. We think on a matter of profit or pleasure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon are inticed to sin; but here's the mischief, <hi>sin deceives us.</hi> It is a <hi>weight,</hi> it <hi>presses down,</hi> it <hi>deceives</hi> men, it's more then they <hi>deemed</hi> it to be. The committing of sin, is as it were running thy self upon the point of Gods blade. Sin at first may <hi>flatter</hi> thee, but it will <hi>deceive</hi> thee: It's like <hi>Joabs</hi> kiss to <hi>Amasa.</hi> Amasa <hi>was not aware of the sword that was in</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abs <hi>hand, till he smote it into his ribs that he died.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.26. When sin entices thee on by <hi>profits,</hi> and <hi>pleasures,</hi> thou art not aware, that it will <hi>slay</hi> thee: But thou sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>lt find <hi>it will be bitterness in the end.</hi> A sinner that acts a <hi>tragedy</hi> in sin, shall have a bloody <hi>Catastrophe.</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed? Blood,</hi> and <hi>death</hi> is the end of the Tragedy. <hi>The end of those things is death. The sting of death is sin,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. What is <hi>sin? It's the sting of death</hi>: Death would not be death, unless <hi>sin</hi> were in it. <hi>Sin</hi> is more <hi>deadly</hi> then <hi>death</hi> it self; It's sin enableth death to <hi>sting</hi>; enableth it to <hi>hurt</hi> and <hi>wound</hi> us: So that we may look on sin, as the <hi>Barbarians</hi> looked on the <hi>viper</hi> on <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, <hi>they expected continually when he would have swollen and burst.</hi> Sin bites like a <hi>Snake,</hi> which is called a <hi>fiery Serpent,</hi> not that the Serpent is fiery, but because it puts a man into such a flaming heat, by their poyson: And such is the sting of sin, which carries poyson in it, that had we but eyes to see our <hi>ugliness</hi> by it, and how it <hi>inflames</hi> us, we should continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99037:32"/>
every day look, when we should <hi>burst</hi> with it. The Apostle, <hi>James</hi> 1.15. useth another metaphor. <hi>Sin when it is accomplished bringeth forth death.</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, saith the Original, sin goeth as it were <hi>with child,</hi> with death. The word is proper to Women in <hi>labour,</hi> who are in <hi>torment</hi> till they are <hi>delivered.</hi> Now as if sin were this Woman, he useth it in the faeminine gender. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. So it is with <hi>sin, sin</hi> is <hi>in pain, cries out,</hi> hath no rest till it be delivered of this dead birth, till it have brought forth <hi>death:</hi> That is, sin grows <hi>great with child</hi> with death, and then it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>deserves</hi> death, but it <hi>produceth</hi> and actually <hi>brings forth</hi>: This is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally so.</p>
                     <p>Now consider with your selves, death is a <hi>fearful thing.</hi> When we come to talk of <hi>death,</hi> how doth it <hi>amaze</hi> us? The Priests of <hi>Nob</hi> are brought before <hi>Saul</hi> for relieving <hi>David,</hi> and he saith, <hi>Thou shalt surely die Ahime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech.</hi> And this is your case, you shall surely die: death is terrible even to a good man. As appears in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who though he were a good man, yet with how sad a heart doth he entertain the message of death? The news of it <hi>affrighted</hi> him; it went to his heart, it made him <hi>turn to the wall and weep.</hi> How cometh it to pass that we are so careless of <hi>death?</hi> That we are so full of <hi>infidelity,</hi> that when the word of God saith, <hi>Thou shalt die Ahimelech,</hi> we are not at all moved by it? What, can we think these are Fables? Do we think God is not in earnest with us? And by this means we fall into the <hi>temptation</hi> of <hi>Eve,</hi> a <hi>questioning,</hi> whether Gods <hi>threats</hi> are <hi>true,</hi> or not? That which was the <hi>deceit</hi> of our first <hi>Parents,</hi> is <hi>ours.</hi> Satan disputes not whether sin be lawful, or not: Whether eating the fruit were unlawful: Whether Drunkenness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; he'l not deny, but it is unlawful. But when God saith, <hi>If thou dost eat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou shalt die</hi>: he denies it, and saith, <hi>ye shall not die.</hi> He would hide our eyes from the <hi>punishment</hi> of sin. Thus we lost our selves at the first, and the Floods of sin came on in this manner: When we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not God, when he said, <hi>If thou dost eat thou shalt surely die:</hi> And shall we renew that <hi>Capital</hi> sin of our Parents, and think, if we do sin, we shall not die? If any thing in the World will move God to shew us no mercy, it's this when we <hi>sleight</hi> his <hi>Judgments,</hi> or not <hi>believe</hi> them. This adds to the height of all our sins, that when God saith, if thou dost live in sin, thou shalt die, and yet we will not believe him: That when she shall come, and <hi>threaten</hi> us, as he doth, <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he shall <hi>curse,</hi> and we <hi>shall bless our selves in our hearts, and say, we shall have peace though we go on,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>The Lord will not spare that man, but the anger of the Lord and his jealousie shall smoke against him.</hi> It is no small sin, when we will not <hi>believe</hi> God: This is as being <hi>thirsty</hi> before, we now add <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to our thirst:</hi> That is, when God shall thus pronounce curses, he shall <hi>yet bless himself, and say, I hope I shall do well enough for all that.</hi> There are two words to that bargain. Then see what follows, <hi>The anger of the Lord and his jealousie shall smoke against that man,</hi> &amp;c. We are but now entred into the point; but it would make your hearts <hi>ake</hi> and <hi>throb</hi> within you, if you should hear the particulars of it. All that I have done, is to perswade you to make a right <hi>choice,</hi> to take heed of Satans <hi>delusions. Why will ye die?</hi> Ezek. 33.11. <hi>Therefore cast away your sins, and make you a new heart and a new spirit, for why will you die? Ezek.</hi> 18.31. Where the <hi>Golded Candlestick</hi> stands, there Christ <hi>walks,</hi> there he saith <hi>I am with you.</hi> Where the Word and Sacraments are, there Christ is, and when the Word shakes thy heart, take that time, now choose life. <hi>Why will you die?</hi> Consider of the matter: Moses <hi>put before the people life and death, blessing and cursing: Deut.</hi> 30.15, 19. We put life and death before you in a better manner: He was a <hi>Minister of the letter, we of the spirit.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Now choose life.</hi> But if you will not hearken, but will needs try
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99037:32"/>
                        <hi>conclusions</hi> with God, therefore <hi>because you will choose your own conclusions, and will not hearken unto God, because you will needs try conclusions with him, will not obey him when he calls, therefore he will turn his deaf ear unto you, and when you call and cry, he will not answer,</hi> Prov. 1.28. I press this the more, to move you to make a <hi>right choice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now to turn to the other side, as there is nothing but <hi>death</hi> for the <hi>wages</hi> of sin, and as I have shewed you where death is: So give me leave to direct you to the <hi>Fountain of life:</hi> There is <hi>life</hi> in our blessed Saviour; if we have but an hand of faith to touch him, we shall draw vertue from him to raise us up from the death of sin, to the life of <hi>righteousness,</hi> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.12. He that <hi>hath the Son hath life, he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi> You have heard of a death that comes by the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>sin,</hi> and to that <hi>stock</hi> of <hi>Original</hi> sin we had from him, we have added a great heap of our own <hi>actual</hi> sins, and so have <hi>treasured up unto our selves wrath against the day of wrath. Rom.</hi> 2.5. Now here is a great treasure of happiness on the other side in Christ; <hi>have the Son, and have life.</hi> The question is now, whether you will choose <hi>Christ,</hi> and life, or <hi>sin,</hi> and <hi>death</hi>? Consider now the <hi>Minister</hi> stands in Gods <hi>stead,</hi> and beseeches you in his name, he speaks not of himself, but from Christ. When he draws near to thee, with Christs <hi>broken body,</hi> and his <hi>blood shed,</hi> and thou receivest Christ; then, as thy natural life and strength is preserved and encreased by these <hi>Elements,</hi> so hast thou also spiritual life by Christ. If a man be kept from <hi>nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> a while, we know what death he must die: If we receive not Christ, we cannot have life, we know that there is life to be had from Christ, and he that shall by a <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>lively faith</hi> receive Christ, shall have <hi>life</hi> by him. There is as it were a pair of Indentures drawn up between God and a mans soul: There is <hi>blood</hi> shed, and by it <hi>pardon</hi> of sin, and life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd unto thee on Christs part. Now if there be faith and repentance on thy part, and thou accept of Christ, as he is offered, then thou mayst say, <hi>I have the Son,</hi> and as certainly as I have the <hi>bread</hi> in my hand, <hi>I shall have life by him.</hi> This I speak but by the <hi>way,</hi> that the <hi>Sun</hi> might not set in a <hi>cloud,</hi> that I might not end only in death, but that I might shew, that there is a way to recover out of that death, into which we have all <hi>naturally</hi> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated our selves, by our apostacy from God.</p>

                     <p>THe last day I entred on the Declaration of the <hi>cursed effects</hi> and <hi>consequents</hi> of sin, and in general shewed that it is the wrath of God; that where sin is there wrath must follow. As the Apostle in the Epistle to the <hi>Galathians, As many as are under the works of the Law, are under the curse.</hi> Now all that may be expected from a God highly offended, is comprehended in Scripture by this term, <hi>Death.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever sin enters, death must follow, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Death passed over all men, forasmuch as all had sinned:</hi> If we are <hi>children of sin,</hi> we must be <hi>children of wrath,</hi> Eph. 1.3. We are then <hi>children of wrath even as others.</hi> Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning death in general, I shewed you the last time that the state of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted man, is a <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>desperate</hi> estate: He is a <hi>slave,</hi> it would affright him, if he did but know his own slavery, and what it is that hangs over his head; that there's but a <hi>Span</hi> betwixt him and death, he could never breath any free air, he could never be at any rest, he could never be free from fear. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. the Apostle saith, that <hi>Christ came to deliver them that through fear of death were all their life time subject to bondage.</hi> This <hi>bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> is a <hi>deadly bondage,</hi> that when we have done all that we can do, what's the <hi>payment</hi> of the <hi>service? Death:</hi> And the fear of this deadly bondage, if we were once sensible, if God did open our eyes, and shew us as he did <hi>Belshazar,</hi> our doom written, did we but see it, it would make <hi>our joynts loose, and our knees knock one against another.</hi> Every day thou livest thou approachest nearer to this death, to the accomplishment and consummation of it: <hi>Death without</hi> and <hi>Death within; Death</hi> in <hi>this World</hi> and in the <hi>World to come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Not only death thus in gross and in general, but in particular also.</p>
                     <p>Now to unfold the particulars of death, and to shew you the ingredients of this bitter Cup, that we may be weary of our estates, that we may be drawn out of this death, and be made to fly <hi>to the Son, that we may be free indeed</hi>; observe: that <hi>Death</hi> is not here to be understood of a <hi>separation</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> from the <hi>Body</hi> only, but a greater death than that, the death of the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body.</hi> We have mention made of a <hi>first Resurrection,</hi> Rev. 20.6. <hi>Blessed and happy is he that hath his part in the first Resurrection, for on such the second death hath no power.</hi> What is the first resurrection? It is a rising from sin: And what is the second death? It is everlasting damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The first <hi>Death</hi> is a <hi>Death</hi> in sin, and the first <hi>Resurrection</hi> is a rising from sin.</p>
                     <p>And so again for all things, the judgments or troubles that appertain to this death, all a man suffers before. It is not, as fools think, the last blow that <hi>fells</hi> the Tree, but every <hi>blow</hi> helps forward. 'Tis not the last blow that kills the man, but every blow that goes before makes way unto it. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>trouble of mind, every anguish, every sickness</hi>; all these are as so many <hi>strokes</hi> that shorten our life, and hasten our end, and are as it were so many deaths: Therefore however it is said by the Apostle, <hi>It is appointed for all men once to dye,</hi> yet we see the Apostle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts that he had, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. saith, <hi>that he was in labours abundant, in

So we read <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could say, <hi>Pray unto your God that he would forgive my sins this once, and intreat the Lord that he will take away from me but this death only.</hi> Not that the Locusts were <hi>death</hi>; but are said to be so because they prepared and made way for a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death.</hi> Therefore the great judgments of God are usually in Scripture comprised under this name <hi>Death.</hi> All things that may be expressions of a wrath of an highly <hi>provoked</hi> God, are comprehended under this name: All the judgments of God that come upon us in this life, or that to come; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>ghostly,</hi> or <hi>temporal,</hi> are under the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to come to <hi>particulars,</hi> look particularly on <hi>Death,</hi> and you shall see <hi>death</hi> begun in this world, and seconded by a <hi>death</hi> following, the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of body and soul from God in the world to come.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. First, in this life he is always a dying man: <hi>Man that is born of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> what is he? He is ever spending upon the <hi>stock,</hi> he is ever wasting like a <hi>Candle,</hi> burning still and spending it self as soon as lighted, till it come to its utter consumption: So he is born to be a <hi>dying</hi> man, death seizeth upon him as soon as ever it findeth sin in him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.1. <hi>In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt dye,</hi> saith God to <hi>Adam,</hi> though he lived many years after. How then could this threatning hold true? Yes it did, in regard that presently he fell into a <hi>languishing estate,</hi> subject and obnoxious to <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series</hi> and <hi>calamities,</hi> the hastners of it. If a man be condemn'd to dye, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he be reprieved, and kept prisoner three or four years after, yet we account him but a dead man: And if this mans mind shall be taken up with <hi>worldly matters, earthly contentments, purchases</hi> or the like, would we not account him a <hi>Fool</hi> or a <hi>stupid</hi> man, seeing he lightly esteems his <hi>condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> because the same hour he is not executed? Such is our case, we are while in our natural condition in this life dead men, ever tending toward the Grave, towards corruption, as the <hi>gourd of</hi> Jonah, <hi>so soon as ever it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to sprout forth, there is a worm within,</hi> that bites it and causes it to wither. The day that we are born, there is within us the seed of <hi>corruption,</hi> and that wasts us away with a secret and incurable <hi>consumption,</hi> that certainly brings death in the end: So that in our very birth begins our progress unto death, A <hi>time,</hi> a <hi>way</hi> we have, but it leads unto <hi>death.</hi> There is a <hi>way</hi> from the <hi>Tower</hi> to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> but it is a <hi>way</hi> to <hi>death:</hi> Until thou comest to be <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> unto Christ, every hour tends unto thy death; there's not a day that thou canst truly say thou livest in, thou art ever posting on to <hi>death, death</hi> in this <hi>world,</hi> and eternal death in the <hi>world</hi> to come.</p>
                     <p>And as it is thus with us at our coming into the world, so we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it of that little time we have above ground, our days are full of <hi>sorrow.</hi> But mark when I speak of sorrows here, we must not take them for such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and sorrows as befal Gods <hi>children,</hi> for theirs are blessings unto them: Chastisements are tokens of Gods love, <hi>For as many as I love, I rebuke and chasten:</hi> (saith Christ.) <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Affliction</hi> to them is like the Dove with an <hi>Olive-branch</hi> in her mouth, to shew that all is well; but take a man that is under the Law, and then every cross whether it be loss of friends, loss of <hi>goods, diseases</hi> on his body, all things, every thing to him is a <hi>token</hi> of Gods <hi>wrath,</hi> not a <hi>token</hi> of Gods love, as it is to Gods children; but it is as his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press money, as part of payment of a greater <hi>sum,</hi> an earnest of the wrath of God, the first part of the payment thereof.</p>
                     <p>It's the Apostles direction, that among the other Armour, we should <hi>get
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99037:34"/>
our feet shod,</hi> that so we might be able to go through the afflictions we shall meet withal in this life, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Let your feet be shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace.</hi> What is the shooing of the feet a part of the Armour? Yes: For in the <hi>Roman</hi> discipline there were things they called Galltraps, which were cast in the way before the Army, before the horse and men; they had three <hi>points,</hi> so that which way soever they threw them, there was a point upwards. Now to meet with and prevent this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, they had brazen shooes that they might tread upon these Gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traps and not be hurt: As we read of <hi>Goliah,</hi> amongst other Armour he had boots of Brass. To this it seems the Apostle had reference in this metaphorical speech: The meaning is that as we should get the <hi>shield of faith</hi> and <hi>sword of the spirit,</hi> so we should have <hi>our feet shod,</hi> that we might be prepared against all those outward troubles, that we should meet with in the world, which are all of them as so many <hi>stings</hi> and <hi>pricks</hi>; all outward crosses I say are so: And what is it that makes all these hurt us? what is it that makes all these as so many <hi>deaths</hi> unto us but <hi>sin?</hi> If sin reign in thee and bear rule, that puts a <hi>sting</hi> into them. It is <hi>sin</hi> that arms <hi>death</hi> against us, and it is sin that arms all that goes before <hi>death</hi> against us. Hast thou been <hi>crossed</hi> in the loss of thy <hi>Wife, Children, good friends,</hi> &amp;c. why the <hi>sting</hi> of all is from <hi>sin, sin</hi> it is which makes us feel <hi>sorrow.</hi> What shall we then do?

breadth with <hi>Solomons Porch,</hi> and so many curses were written in it as were able to come in at the Church door. It is as if we should see a huge book now, coming in at the Church door, that should fill it up. Such a thing was presented unto him, and it was a <hi>Roll</hi> full of <hi>curses,</hi> and all these curses shall come on those that obey not all the Commandments, all shall come upon them and overtake them. <hi>Cursed shalt thou be in the City, and cursed shalt thou be in the field, cursed in thy basket and in thy store, cursed when thou comest in, and when thou goest forth,</hi> Deut. 28.16. Till a man come to receive the Promises, till he come to be a son of blessing, till he be in Christ, he is beset so with <hi>curses,</hi> that if he lie down to sleep there is a curse on his <hi>pillow</hi>; if he put his Money in his <hi>cofer,</hi> he lays up a curse with it, which as <hi>rust</hi> eats it out and <hi>cankers</hi> it; if he beget a child, he is <hi>accursed,</hi> there's a curse against his <hi>person,</hi> and his <hi>goods,</hi> and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto him, there's still a <hi>curse</hi> over his head.</p>
                     <p>The creditor in this World by the Laws of the Realm may choose, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will have his <hi>debtors</hi> person seized on, or his <hi>goods,</hi> and <hi>chattels</hi>: But not so here, this writ is executed against his <hi>person,</hi> and <hi>goods,</hi> and all that belongs unto him. So that <hi>it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> If this be the condition of a wicked man, that his <hi>very blessings be curses,</hi> what a <hi>woful case</hi> is it! There's nothing till he be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to Christ, but hath a curse at the end of it.</p>
                     <p>Consider that one place in the Prophesie of <hi>Malachy,</hi> where the very bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings are accursed: not onely when God sends on him the <hi>itch,</hi> or <hi>botch,</hi> or <hi>scab,</hi> or <hi>sword,</hi> but in <hi>blessings, cap.</hi> 2.2. he's accursed. <hi>If you will not hear, and if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name, saith the Lord, I will even send a curse upon you.</hi> But how? See how this <hi>curse</hi> is threatned: <hi>I will curse your very blessings, yea I have cursed them already, because you do not lay it to heart.</hi> Mark, is it not a great <hi>blessing</hi> that God yet affords the <hi>Word,</hi> that we yet enjoy it; but if we come to hear but <hi>formally,</hi> to hear it onely, and lay it not to heart, God <hi>curseth</hi> this <hi>blessing,</hi> yea <hi>I have cursed it already, saith the Lord.</hi> When thou prayest in <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> thy <hi>prayer</hi> is a <hi>curse</hi> to thee. If thou receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> unworthily, the <hi>cup</hi> of <hi>blessing</hi> is a <hi>cup</hi> of <hi>poison,</hi> a cup of <hi>cursing</hi> to thee. Stay not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one hour longer quietly in this cursed condition, but fly unto Christ for <hi>life</hi> and <hi>blessing:</hi> run to this City of refuge, for otherwise there is a curse at the end of every <hi>outward thing,</hi> that thou enjoyest. <hi>I have cursed these blessings already.</hi> It is as sure, as if already pass't on thee. What a <hi>woeful thing</hi> then is it (think you) to be liable to the <hi>curse</hi> of God!</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But what's become of the <hi>soul</hi> now? Why, if thou didst but see the cursed soul, that thou carriest in thy body, it would <hi>amaze</hi> thee. These <hi>outward curses,</hi> are but flea-bitings to the blow that is given to the <hi>soul</hi> of an unregenerate man, that deadness of spirit, that is within: didst thou but see the curse of God that rests upon the soul of this man, even while he is above ground, it would even <hi>astonish</hi> thee.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Consider there are two kinds of <hi>blows</hi> that God gives unto the soul of an unregenerate man. The one is a <hi>terrible blow.</hi> The other, which is the worst of the two, is an <hi>insensible blow.</hi> The sensible blow is when God lets the conscience out, and makes it fly into the face of a man, when the conscience shall come, and terribly accuse a man for what he hath done. This blow is not so usual as the insensible blow; but this insensible is far more heavy. But as it falls out, that as in this World, sometimes before the glory in Heaeen, the <hi>Saints</hi> of God have here a <hi>glimpse</hi> of Heaven, and certain <hi>communion</hi> with God and Christ, certain love tokens, <hi>a white stone, a new name ingraven, which no man knoweth, but he that receiveth it:</hi> And this is the <hi>testimony</hi> of a good <hi>conscience,</hi> which is <hi>hidden joyes: Privy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse</hi>
                        <pb n="52" facs="tcp:99037:35"/>
is between Christ and them, <hi>secret kisses:</hi> And as Gods Children do, as it were, meet with a Heaven upon Earth sometimes, and are, as we read of <hi>Paul, caught up into the third Heaven,</hi> which to them is more then all the things in the World besides: So the wicked have sometimes <hi>flashes of Hell</hi> in their <hi>consciences.</hi> If you had but seen men in the <hi>case</hi> that I have seen them in, you would say they had an <hi>Hell</hi> within them; they would desire rather, and they have expressed it, to be torn in pieces by <hi>wild hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> so they might be freed from the <hi>horrours</hi> in their consciences. When the conscience <hi>recoyls</hi> and <hi>beats back</hi> upon it self, as a <hi>musket or'e charged,</hi> it turns a man over and over: And this is a terrible thing. This sometimes God gives men in this World: And mark, where the word is most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preacht, there is this froth most rais'd, which is the cause many desire not to come where the <hi>word</hi> is taught, because it <hi>galls</hi> their consciences, and desire the Mass rather, because they say, the <hi>Mass bites not</hi>: They desire a <hi>dead Minister,</hi> that would not <hi>rub</hi> up their <hi>consciences,</hi> they would not be <hi>tormented before the time</hi>: They would so, but it shall not be at their choice, God will make them feel here the <hi>fire of Hell,</hi> which they must endure for ever hereafter. This is the sensible Blow, when God lets loose the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a wicked man; and he needs no other <hi>fire,</hi> no other worm to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nothing else to <hi>plague</hi> him: he hath a <hi>weapon</hi> within him, his own <hi>conscience,</hi> which if God lets loose, it will be <hi>Hell</hi> enough.</p>
                     <p>But now besides this blow which is not so frequent, there is another more common and more insensible blow. God saith, he is a dead man, and a flave to sin and Satan, and he thinks himself the freest man in the World. God <hi>curses</hi> and <hi>strikes,</hi> and he feels it not. This is an <hi>insensible blow,</hi> and like unto a <hi>dead palsie</hi>: Thou art <hi>dead,</hi> and yet <hi>walkest about,</hi> and art <hi>merry,</hi> though every one that hath his eyes open <hi>seeth death in thy face.</hi> O this <hi>deadness,</hi> this <hi>senselesness</hi> of heart is the heaviest thing that can befal a <hi>sinner</hi> in this life. It is the cause the Apostle speaks of in the <hi>Rom:</hi> when <hi>God delivers up a man <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, to a reprobate mind:</hi> And so in the Epistle to the <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.19. declares such a man to be <hi>past feeling: Who being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness even with greediness.</hi> Although every sin, (as I told you before) is as it were the running a mans self on the <hi>point</hi> of Gods <hi>sword,</hi> yet these men being past <hi>feeling,</hi> run on, on, on, to commit sin with greediness, till they come to the very pit of destruction, they run amain to their confusion. When this insensibleness is come upon them, it is not Gods goodness that can work upon them. Who art thou that <hi>despisest the riches of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee unto repentance.</hi> Rom. 2.4. It is not Gods judgments that will move them, they leave no impression, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.20. <hi>And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship Devils,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>brass, nor stone and wood, which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk.</hi> They repented not though they were spared, but worshipped Gods which cannot <hi>see,</hi> nor <hi>hear,</hi> nor <hi>speak,</hi> so brutish were they to be led away by <hi>stocks</hi> and <hi>stones?</hi> I think the Papist Gods cannot do it unless it be by couzenage, yet such is their senselesness, that though Gods fury be revealed from Heaven against <hi>Papists,</hi> such as worship <hi>false Gods</hi>; yet are they so <hi>brutish</hi> that they will worship things which can neither <hi>hear,</hi> nor <hi>see,</hi> nor <hi>walk. They that made them are like unto them, and so are all they that worship them,</hi> as brutish as the <hi>stocks</hi> themselves: They have no heart to God, but will follow after their puppets and their Idols, and such are they also that follow after their <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, covetousness, &amp;c Who live in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of riot,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.2. <hi>that run into all kind of excess</hi>; and marvel that you do not so too. They marvel (that ye that fear God) can live as ye do; and speak evil of you that be good; call such <hi>Hypocrites, Dissemblers,</hi> and I know not what nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99037:35"/>
This, I say, is a most woful condition; it's that dead blow. When men are not sensible of <hi>Mercies,</hi> of <hi>Judgments,</hi> but run into all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of sin with <hi>greediness</hi>: And this is a death begun in this life, even while they are above ground.</p>
                     <p>But then comes another death, God doth not intend sin shall grow to an infinite weight, <hi>His Spirit shall not alwayes strive with man,</hi> but at length God comes and crops him off, and now cometh the consummation of the death begun in this life: Now cometh an accursed death.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. After thou hast lived an <hi>accursed</hi> life, then cometh an <hi>accomplishment</hi> of curses.</p>
                     <p>First, a <hi>cursed separation between body and soul, and then of both from God for ever,</hi> and this is the last payment, This is that great death which the Apostle speaks of, <hi>Who delivered us from that great death.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. So terrible is that death. This death is but the severing of the body from the Soul: This is but the Lords <hi>Harbinger,</hi> the Lords <hi>Serjeant</hi> to lay his <hi>Mace</hi> on thee, to bring thee out of this World into a place of everlasting misery, from whence thou shalt never come, till all be satisfied, and this is never.</p>
                     <p>First, Consider the nature of this death, which though every man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, yet few <hi>lay to heart.</hi> This death, what doth it?</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>it takes the things which thou spentst thy whole life in getting.</hi> It robs thee of all the things thou ever hadst: Thou hast taken pains to <hi>heap</hi> and <hi>treasure up goods for many yeors,</hi> presently when this blow is given, all is gone: For <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>preferment,</hi> it takes thee from that; pleasure in idle <hi>company-keeping,</hi> it bars thee of that. Mark, this is the first thing that death doth, it takes not onely away a part of that thou hast, but all, it leaves thee quite <hi>naked,</hi> as <hi>naked,</hi> as when thou camest into the World: Thou thoughtst it was thy happiness to get this and that. Death now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to <hi>unbewitch</hi> thee, thou wast <hi>bewitched</hi> before, when thou didst run after all wordly things: Thou wast <hi>deceived</hi> before, and now it <hi>undeceives</hi> thee; it makes thee see what a notorious <hi>fool</hi> thou wast, it <hi>unbefools</hi> thee. Thou hadst many plots, and many projects, but when thy breath is gone, then without any delay in that very day saith the <hi>Psalmist, all thy thoughts perish, Psal.</hi> 146.4. all thy <hi>plottings,</hi> and <hi>projections</hi> go away with thy breath: A strange thing, to see a man with <hi>Job,</hi> the richest man in the <hi>East,</hi> and yet in the evening (we say) <hi>as poor as Job:</hi> He hath nothing left him now. Now though death takes not all things from thee, yet it takes thee from them all; and so in effect them also from thee; though they remain in thy house, and grounds, yet they are as far removed from thee, is ahou from them. All thy <hi>goods,</hi> all thy <hi>books,</hi> all thy <hi>wealth,</hi> all thy <hi>friends</hi> thou mayst now bid farewel: now adieu for ever, never to see them again. And that is the first thing.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now death rests not there, but cometh <hi>to seize upon thy body.</hi> It hath bereaved thee of all that thou possessedst of all thy outward things, they are taken away: Now it comes to touch the wicked mans person, and see what then. It toucheth him, it rents his soul from his body: those two loving companions that have so long dwelt together, are now separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It takes thy soul from thy body: This man doth not <hi>deliver</hi> up his spirit, as we read of our Saviour, <hi>Father, into thy hands I commit my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> or deliver their spirits as <hi>Stephen</hi> did: But here it's taken from them; it's much against his mind, it's a <hi>pulling</hi> of himself from himself. This it doth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But then again, when thou art thus pulled asunder, what becomes of the parts separated?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. First, <hi>The body as soon as the soul is taken from it, hastens to corruption,</hi> that must see <hi>corruption</hi>; yea it becomes so full of corruption, that thy dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est friend cannot then endure to come near unto thee. When the soul is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99037:36"/>
taken from the body, it's observed that of all carkasses that are, mans is the most <hi>loathsome,</hi> none so odious as that. <hi>Abraham</hi> loved <hi>Sarah</hi> well, but when he comes to buy a monument for her, see his expression, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.8. <hi>He communes with the men and saith, if it be your mind to sell me the field, that I might bury my dead out of my sight.</hi> Though he loved her very well before, yet now she must be buried out of his sight. <hi>It is sown in dishonour,</hi> and it's the basest thing that can be: Therefore when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was going near to the place where <hi>Lazarus</hi> lay, <hi>his Sister saith, Lord by this time he stinketh, Joh.</hi> 11.39. <hi>I have said to corruption thou art my Father</hi> (saith Job) <hi>and to the worm thou art my Mother and my Sister: Job.</hi> 17.14. As in the verse before, <hi>The grave is my house, I have made my bed in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> Here then he hath a new kindred, and though before he had affinity with the greatest, yet here he gets new affinity: <hi>He saith to corruption thou art my Father, and to the worm thou art my Mother and my Sister.</hi> The <hi>worm</hi> is our best <hi>kindred</hi> here; the <hi>worm</hi> then is our best bed; yea <hi>worms</hi> thy best covering, as <hi>Esay.</hi> 14.11. Thus is it thy <hi>Father,</hi> thy <hi>Mother,</hi> and thy <hi>Bed:</hi> nay, it is thy consumption and destroyer also, <hi>Job.</hi> 26. Thus is it with thy body, it passeth to <hi>corruption,</hi> that thy best or dearest friend cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it or endure it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But alas! what becomes of thy soul then? Thy soul appears naked, there's no garment to defend it, no <hi>Proctor</hi> appears to plead for it: It is brought singly to the bar, and there it must answer. <hi>It is appointed for all men once to dye,</hi> but what then? <hi>And after that to come to judgm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Eccles. 12.7. <hi>The body returns unto the earth from whence it was taken, but the Spirit to God who gave it.</hi> All mens spirits assoon as their <hi>bodies</hi> and <hi>souls</hi> are parted, go to God to be disposed of by him where they shall keep their everlasting <hi>residence.</hi> Consider when thou hearest the Bell rung out for a dead man, if thou hadst but the wings of a Dove to fly, and couldst fly after him, and appear with him before Gods Tribunal, to see the <hi>account</hi> that he must give unto God for all things done in the flesh: and when no account can be given, what a state of misery and horror wouldst thou see him in! and this is a <hi>silent</hi> kind of judging: The last day of judging shall be with great <hi>pomp</hi> and <hi>solemnity.</hi> This is a matter closely carried between God and thy self; but then thou must give an account of all that thou hast received, and then when thou canst not give a good account; then is thy <hi>talent</hi> taken from thee. Why, saith God, I gave thee <hi>learning,</hi> how didst thou use it? I gave thee other <hi>gifts</hi> of <hi>mind,</hi> how didst thou employ them? God hath given thee <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>wealth, Moral vertues, meekness, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> &amp;c. These are good things, but mark whatsoever good things thou hadst in this world, is now taken from thee. If a man could but see the <hi>degrading</hi> of the Soul, he should see that those <hi>moral</hi> vertues in which his hope of comfort lay, even these, though they could never bring him to heaven, yet they shall be taken from him. As when a <hi>Knight</hi> is <hi>degraded</hi>; first his <hi>sword</hi> is taken from him, then comes one with a <hi>hatchet</hi> and chops off his <hi>golden Spurs,</hi> and then go Sir <hi>Knave.</hi> This is the <hi>degrading</hi> of the soul before the judgment is received: the <hi>moral vertues</hi> are taken from him and then see what an <hi>ugly</hi> soul he hath, he had <hi>hope</hi> before, now he's without <hi>hope:</hi> he had some <hi>patience</hi> in this world, but he made no good use of it; and now his <hi>patience</hi> is taken from him: And when thou shalt come to a place of torment, and thy <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>patience</hi> be taken from thee, what case wilt thou be in then? <hi>Patience</hi> may stay a man up in trouble, and <hi>hope</hi> may comfort a man up in torment, but both these are taken away. This is a thing we very seldom think; but did we seriously consider of this first Act of the Judgment before the Sentence, we would not be idle in this world.</p>

death lays Gods <hi>Mace</hi> upon him, he's put into an estate of <hi>unchangeableness.</hi> Such is the terribleness of it, that now, though he <hi>yell</hi> and <hi>groan</hi> and <hi>pour</hi> out <hi>Rivers of Tears,</hi> there is no <hi>hope</hi> of change.</p>
                     <p>Consider now what a woful case this is, if some friend of this mans should now come to him, would he not tell him we have often been very merry together, but didst thou know the misery that I am in, thou wouldst be troubled for me: Half those tears that I now pour forth would have put me into another place, had I taken the <hi>season,</hi> but now it is too late.

The act done to the sinners soul before he is sent to hell, is the <hi>deprivation</hi> of his <hi>light,</hi> the taking away of his <hi>talent.</hi> For whilst a man is in this world, he hath many <hi>good things</hi> in him, too good to accompany him to <hi>Hell:</hi> Now all these excellent <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>natural endowments</hi> which did adorn a wicked mans soul, before the soul is hurled into hell, must be taken away from him. There is a kind of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation</hi> of the soul, it is depriested as it were, and becomes like a <hi>degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Knight</hi> rhat hath his honour taken from him. All the <hi>rich talents,</hi> and all the <hi>rich prizes</hi> that were put into the fools hand, shall be taken from him. Is there any moral virtue? Are there any <hi>common graces</hi> and <hi>natural endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> in the miserable soul? it shall be stript of all and packt to <hi>Hell.</hi> You that have abused your <hi>learning</hi> and gifts that God haah given you, do you think that they shall go with you to <hi>Hell</hi>? No such matter, you shall be very <hi>Sots and Dunces</hi> there. All your <hi>learning</hi> shall be taken from you,

A man if he were in most exquisite torment, yet if he had patience it would bear it up with <hi>head</hi> and <hi>shoulders</hi> (as we say) but this shall add to his torments, that he shall not have any <hi>patience</hi> left him, to allay it. A man hath perhaps <hi>hope</hi> in this World, and as the Proverb is, were it not for <hi>hope</hi> the heart would burst; yet even this too shall be taken away from him, he shall have no <hi>hope</hi> left him of ever seeing Gods face again, or of ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any more <hi>tasts</hi> of his favour: And so what hath been said of some, may be said of all his graces and endowments: He shall clean be stript of all ere he be sent to Hell.</p>

The second death</hi> in the Text hath relation to the <hi>first Resurrection,</hi> Rev. 20.6. <hi>Blessed and holy is he that hath his portion in the first Resurrection, on such the second death shall have no power.</hi> The <hi>first death</hi> is that from whence we are acquitted by the <hi>first Resurrection,</hi> and that is <hi>the</hi> death; for that is a kind of death (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of a <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>voluptuous Widow,</hi> saith, <hi>she is dead while she liveth</hi>) and <hi>the time shall come and now is, when they that are dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live:</hi> And again, <hi>Let the dead bury their dead.</hi> So that the <hi>first Resurrection</hi> is, when a man hearing the voice of the Minister, is <hi>rouzed</hi> up from the <hi>sleep</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>carnal security,</hi> and the <hi>first death</hi> is the <hi>opposite</hi> thereunto: So that the death of the body is no death at all, for if it were, then this were the <hi>third death:</hi> For there would be a <hi>death of sin, a death of the body,</hi> and <hi>a death of body</hi> and <hi>soul:</hi> This death of the body is but a <hi>flea-biting</hi> in comparison of the other two. This <hi>second death</hi> is the <hi>separation</hi> of the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> from God, and this death is the <hi>wages</hi> of sin, and God <hi>must</hi> not, <hi>will</hi> not lye in <hi>arrear</hi> to <hi>sin,</hi> but will <hi>pay</hi> its <hi>wages</hi> to the full. All the afflictions a wicked man meeteth withal here, are but as Gods <hi>press-money,</hi> and <hi>part</hi> of <hi>payment</hi> of that <hi>greater sum</hi>: But when he dies, the <hi>whole sum</hi> comes to be paid: Before he did but <hi>sip</hi> of the Cup of Gods wrath, but he must then drink up the dregs of it down to the bottom, and this is the <hi>second death,</hi> it's called <hi>death.</hi> Now <hi>death</hi> is a <hi>destruction</hi> of the <hi>parts compounded,</hi> a man being compounded of body and soul, both are by this death eternally destroyed. That death (like <hi>Sampson</hi> pulling down the <hi>pillars</hi> whereby it was <hi>sustained,</hi> pulled down the house) draws down the <hi>Tabernacles</hi> of our <hi>bodies, pulls Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> in <hi>sunder.</hi> A thing which hath little hurt in it self, were it not for the <hi>sting</hi> of it which makes it <hi>fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>: To dye is esteemed far worse than to be dead, in regard of the pangs that are in dying, to which death <hi>puts</hi> an <hi>end.</hi> This temporal death is in an instant, but this other <hi>eternal,</hi> whereby we are <hi>ever dying,</hi> and never dead, for by it we are punished with an <hi>everlasting</hi>

Luke</hi> 19.27. Those <hi>vessels</hi> of <hi>wrath,</hi> those <hi>Rebels</hi>; the King is inraged, and his wrath is as the <hi>roaring of a Lyon,</hi> which makes all the <hi>beasts</hi> of the <hi>Forrest</hi> to <hi>tremble, Prov.</hi> 19.12. <hi>And where there is the wrath of such a King, the issue thereof must needs be death,</hi> Prov. 16.14. <hi>The wrath of a King is as a messenger of death.</hi> How much more fearful is the wrath of the <hi>King</hi> of Kings. God hath <hi>sharp ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi> and he sets a wicked man as his Butt to shoot at, to shew his strength, and the <hi>fierceness</hi> of his <hi>wrath.</hi> See the expression of <hi>Job</hi> in this case, <hi>The arrows of the Almighty stick fast in me, and the venome thereof hath drunk up my spirits:</hi> In so few words there could not be an <hi>higher expression</hi> of the <hi>wrath</hi> of God. First, that <hi>God should make thee a Butt,</hi> and that thou shouldst <hi>be shot at,</hi> and that <hi>by Gods arrows:</hi> And then they are not shot by a child, but (<hi>as the man is, so is his strength) by the Almighty, by his bow,</hi> wherein he draws the <hi>arrow</hi> to the <hi>head.</hi> And then again these arrows are <hi>poyson'd arrows, and such poyson as shall drink up all thy soul and spirit: Oh, what a fearful thing is it to fall into the hands of such a God:</hi> It's a saying of <hi>Moses,</hi> Psal. 90.11. (for 'tis <hi>Moses</hi> Psal.) <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger? The power of Gods anger is unknown.</hi> And so in his Song, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.22. he sets it out in some measure. <hi>A fire is kindled in mine anger, which shall burn unto the lowest Hell,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. So that the King, being thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, is provoked to curse thee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 29. It's put into the form of thy sentence: this <hi>cursing</hi> shall be thy lot in hell, it shall be thy very sentence, <hi>Go ye cursed into everlasting fire.</hi> There is nothing but cursing: As <hi>Job</hi> cursed himself, and the day of his birth, so then shall <hi>cursing</hi> be all thy <hi>song</hi>: thou wilt <hi>curse</hi> thy self, that thou didst not <hi>hearken</hi> to the <hi>Preacher,</hi> that thou wouldst not accept of Christ, and the means of <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> when it was offered thee: And thou wilt <hi>curse</hi> the time thou wert acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>this</hi> man, and <hi>that</hi> man, and <hi>others</hi> will <hi>curse</hi> thee for drawing them to sin: God <hi>curses</hi> thee, and man <hi>curses</hi> thee; and God curses not in vain, when he curses: Others will curse thee, and thou, thy self and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and think then how <hi>cursed</hi> will be thy condition? All the <hi>curses,</hi> that cannot be thought on, shall rest on the head of an <hi>impenitent sinner,</hi> to shew Gods <hi>terrible</hi> and <hi>just</hi> indignation against him.

When the King of Heaven shall as it were set to work his <hi>wisedome,</hi> to fit it in the sharpest manner, in procuring such ingredients as may make it <hi>rage</hi> most, and be most <hi>violent:</hi> It is a <hi>fire</hi> prepared for the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Angels,</hi> the strongest of creatures, for the punishment of <hi>principalities</hi> and <hi>powers:</hi> And if it can master <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> think not but that God hath a fire to <hi>rost thy</hi> soul. It is the <hi>soul</hi> that is in <hi>Hell</hi> onely till the day of judgment, though the <hi>body</hi> be not <hi>there.</hi> A man would think that the soul did not suffer, but Philosophy tells us, that the soul suffers <hi>mediante corpore,</hi> in and by the body: Therefore 'tis a rule in Divinity, that <hi>whatsoever God doth by means, he can do without means.</hi> Though the <hi>body</hi> be not there, but the <hi>soul</hi> only, yet God is able, nay doth make the soul as well feel <hi>grief,</hi> without the <hi>body,</hi> as he doth by means of the <hi>body.</hi>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99037:40"/>
a <hi>merciless tormentor,</hi> who being in <hi>plagues</hi> and <hi>torments,</hi> and thereby even at his <hi>wits end,</hi> would fain <hi>ease</hi> himself in <hi>tormenting</hi> thee. When the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as we read, was <hi>dispossessed</hi> of a child wherein he was, <hi>he rends and tears, leaves him foaming, that there was little hope of life in him: Mar.</hi> 9.20. But now when a man shall be delivered into the hands of this <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Spirit,</hi> when God shall say to the Devil, <hi>take</hi> him, do what thou wilt with him, do thy <hi>worst</hi> to him: When thou shalt be thus put into the hands of one that <hi>hates</hi> thee, and delights in thy ruine, how will he <hi>tear</hi> thee into <hi>pieces?</hi> How will he <hi>torment</hi> thee? In how desperate and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a case will thy <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>body</hi> be?</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>tormentor within thee</hi> is far more <hi>heavy, painful,</hi> and <hi>grievous, Mar.</hi> 9.44, 46, 48. <hi>That never dying worm</hi> within, the sting of a <hi>guilty</hi> and <hi>wounded conscience,</hi> this, like a <hi>sharp dagger,</hi> is still <hi>stabbing</hi> thee, at the very heart. This by a <hi>reflecting act</hi> upon it self, will cause thee to <hi>revenge</hi> Gods <hi>quarrel</hi> on thy self; and as a musket <hi>over-charged</hi> beats back on the <hi>shooter,</hi> so will it most furiously return upon thee. This is <hi>that,</hi> that smote <hi>David,</hi> when 'tis said <hi>Davids heart smote him. Sam.</hi> 24.10. A man needs no other <hi>fire,</hi> nor other <hi>worm</hi> to torment him, then <hi>that</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him: Which as the <hi>worms</hi> on the <hi>carkass, gnaws</hi> on a <hi>wretched soul.</hi> But there is a greater tormentor then both these behind, and that is</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>God himself,</hi> he is highly <hi>offended</hi> and <hi>inraged</hi> at thee, and therefore comes and takes the matter into his own hand, and will himself be <hi>execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner</hi> of his fury. There is a passage in the <hi>Thess.</hi> To this purpose, which methinks is more then can be spoken by men or Angels <hi>Epist.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</hi> Mark that, God whom thou hast so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked to wrath, hath a <hi>strong</hi> hand, and <hi>glorious power.</hi> He shewed the <hi>glory</hi> of his <hi>power</hi> in the making the world, and all things in it; and all that infinite power which he hath manifested in the creation of heaven and earth, shall be engaged in the <hi>tormenting</hi> of a sinner. Were there a man that should lay a <hi>target</hi> of <hi>brass,</hi> or a <hi>target</hi> of <hi>steel</hi> on a block, and should then cleave all in sunder at a blow; this would sufficiently manifest his strength: So doth God make manifest his <hi>power</hi> in crushing thee to <hi>pieces.</hi> There are still new <hi>charges</hi> and <hi>discharges</hi> against sinners, to make his power therein manifest. <hi>What if God, willing to make his power known,</hi> (saith the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22.) <hi>suffered a while the vessels prepared to destruction?</hi> God will manifest his power by the <hi>strength</hi> of his <hi>stroke</hi> on those that rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. Hence proceedeth <hi>weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth,</hi> which is a Metaphor taken from one either that hath a great <hi>coldness</hi> on him, or from the <hi>symptoms</hi> of a Fever.</p>
                     <p>Add to all that hath been said these two things,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The torment shall be <hi>everlasting,</hi> you shall <hi>desire to die,</hi> Rev. 9.6. that your <hi>torments</hi> may have end: And here you may expect that I should say something of the <hi>eternity</hi> of the <hi>torments</hi> of the <hi>damned</hi>; but I am not able, nor any one else sufficiently to express it: It shall continue <hi>ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand thousand years, after that an hundred thousand times ten thousand, and yet be no nearer end then at the first beginning.</hi> Thou must think of it seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously thy self, and pray to God to <hi>reveal</hi> it to thy soul, for none else suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently can.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But besides, as it is <hi>everlasting,</hi> so is it <hi>unabateable.</hi> If a man were cast into a fire, the fire coming about him, would in short time <hi>blunt</hi> his senses, and take away his <hi>feeling,</hi> and besides the <hi>materials</hi> of the fire would soon spend and wast: But it is not so here, here is not the least <hi>abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the horror, nor the least <hi>inch</hi> of torment taken away throughout all <hi>eternity.</hi> It was a poor request of <hi>Dives</hi> (one would think) that <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus would dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool his tongue:</hi> Luk. 16.14.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99037:41"/>
A cold comfort, but one <hi>drop</hi> of water for the present, which would soon be dried, and yet that is denied him, he must have no <hi>abatement</hi> of his <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Nor is there any abatement of <hi>thy feeling,</hi> but thou art kept in <hi>full strength</hi>; and as long as <hi>God</hi> is God, shall <hi>Tophet burn,</hi> and thou <hi>feel it.</hi>

                        <hi>Obj.</hi> But (may some say) this is <hi>preaching indeed,</hi> this would affright a man, and make him go <hi>hang</hi> himself, sooner then be <hi>converted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> True, should God let loose the <hi>cord</hi> of our conscience, it were the way (such would be the terrours of it) to make a man find another <hi>cord,</hi> did not God restrain him. I desire not by this to <hi>hurt</hi> you, but to <hi>save</hi> you. I am a messenger not sent from <hi>Abraham, Luk.</hi> 16.27. (as <hi>Dives</hi> entreated) but from the <hi>God of Abraham,</hi> to forewarn you that you come not to that <hi>place</hi> of <hi>torment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now (Beloved) there is a way to escape this misery, and that is by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> Mat. 1.21. He was for this end called <hi>Jesus, because he saves his people from their sins, Mat.</hi> 1.21. And consequently from wrath: Which how it is done I shall shew in a word, and that is

                     <p>And then being offered for us, he is <hi>offered to us,</hi> as we may see in the Sacrament, where there are two acts of the Minister, the one the <hi>breaking</hi> the <hi>bread,</hi> the other the <hi>offering</hi> it to the people. Thou hast as good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to take Christ offer'd, as thou hast to take the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine,</hi> which thou art commanded to receive.

If they will try con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions with God, if they oppose him, the Lord cometh with a <hi>Rod of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and will break them in pieces like a Potters vessel</hi>; Psal. 2.9. <hi>Those mine enemies that will not have me to reign over them, bring them, and slay them before me</hi>; Luk. 19.27. It is fit every man should know this; This part is only for this end, that it may <hi>awaken</hi> us; otherwise to what purpose do we preach unto you? Till the Law <hi>awaken us,</hi> we sleep securely in our sins, till the <hi>dreadful Trumpet</hi> of <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> comes with <hi>thundring and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>; as <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14, <hi>Awake thou that sleepest,</hi> &amp;c. Unless this <hi>awaken</hi> us, in what case are we? Sinful men are as <hi>sleepers,</hi> that are a <hi>dreaming,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Jude</hi> 8. A <hi>sleeping</hi> sinner will be a <hi>dreaming</hi> sinner; he never sees things as they are in their proper <hi>shape:</hi> but he thinks with the Church of <hi>Laodicea, That he is rich, and wants nothing; when as he is poor, miserable, blind and naked.</hi> He thinks he shall be admitted into heaven, as soon as the proudest: but this is a dream; <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.8. <hi>As the hungry man dreameth, and behold he eateth; but when he awakes behold he is empty: or as a thirsty man that dreams he drinketh; but awakes, and behold he is faint.</hi> Thus it is with us, we think we are entring upon the <hi>Suburbs</hi> of heaven, and yet we are but in a <hi>dream,</hi> and in a <hi>sleep.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now being thus <hi>awaked,</hi> consider with thy self what thou hast to do, when the dreadful Trumpet of the Law hath <hi>awakened</hi> thee, consider thy state; if thou sleepest this night in thy sins, perhaps hell fire may be thy portion before the morning. It were better for thee therefore to <hi>awake,</hi> before the <hi>flames</hi> of <hi>hell fire awake</hi> thee. Consider likewise that thou must not be led by thy self, thou must renounce thine <hi>own will.</hi> Our <hi>Estates</hi> may be pleasing unto us, to enjoy in a dream our <hi>hearts lusts</hi> here on earth; but
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99037:42"/>
consider, unless thou <hi>cross</hi> thy <hi>Will</hi> here, it shall be <hi>crossed</hi> hereafter: yea it shall be the <hi>main cross a man shall have in hell, (besides the eternal weight of Gods wrath) that he can will or desire nothing, but he shall be crossed in it:</hi> not the least thing he desires, but he shall have the <hi>contrary,</hi> world without end: Learn then what a woful thing it is to be our <hi>own Lords,</hi> to follow our <hi>own Lusts</hi> and <hi>Pleasures,</hi> see what we shall gain by it: never shalt thou enjoy the least portion of thy <hi>will</hi> in the world to come;<note place="margin">Note well.</note> if thou wouldst have but a <hi>drop</hi> of <hi>cold water,</hi> thou shalt be <hi>crossed</hi> in it. There's nothing thou desirest but thou shalt have the <hi>opposite</hi> to it.</p>
                     <p>Thus having truly and plainly shewed our <hi>Sinfulness, Wretchedness,</hi> and <hi>Cursedness</hi> by nature, I come unto the <hi>second part</hi> which I proposed to wit: <hi>Our Remedy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Our Remedy, or our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by Christ</note> 
                        <hi>or our Redemption by Christ.</hi> And God forbid that he should create man the best of his visible Creatures for destruction: <hi>What gain and profit is there in our blood?</hi> Psalm 30.9. <hi>God is full of Grace and Compassion and he considers that we are but dust.</hi> And happy are we that we are but <hi>dust.</hi> Had we been more <hi>glorious Creatures,</hi> as <hi>Angels,</hi> we had not had the benefit of a Saviour. When they rebelled, God considered their <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:</hi> And as with an high hand they rebelled, <hi>So the Lord reserved them in everlasting chains under darkness, unto the Judgment of the great day</hi>; Jude 3. 1 Thes. 1.10. They fell without a Redeemer; It is well for us, that God considereth that we are but <hi>dust; For by Jesus Christ he delivereth us from the wrath to come.</hi> 1 <hi>Thessal.</hi> 1.10. It had been better for us never to have been <hi>born,</hi> then to be born <hi>fire-brands</hi> of Hell. But now the point is, what we are <hi>Brands pluckt out of the fire, Zach.</hi> 3, 2. It is fit therefore we should know who is our Redeemer.</p>
                     <p>Now, as I have shewed you the last day, it is <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> And here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Christ Jesus was offered</hi> for us, for the satisfaction of Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and this is his priestly office.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As there was no <hi>Remission without shedding of blood, Hebr.</hi> 9.22. Therefore after the <hi>bloud</hi> is <hi>shed,</hi> and the Priest offered himself, there comes a second thing, else we are never the better: and that is <hi>Christ offered to us</hi>: This makes up our <hi>comfort.</hi> Many talk of the <hi>extent</hi> of Christs Death and Passion, saying, he dyed sufficiently for us, which is an improper speech: For what comfort were this, that Christ was offered for us, if there were no more? A bare sufficiency in Christ se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ves not the turn: This were a cold comfort: As if a man that were in debt, and afraid of every Serjeant, and every Sheriff, should be told: Sir, there is money enough in the King <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi> to discharge all your debts. This is very true, but what is that to him? What comfort hath he by it, unless the King make him an offer to come, and take <hi>freely</hi> for his discharge? And a <hi>cold comfort</hi> were it to us to know Christ to be sufficient for us, unless he invite us to take freely of the waters of life, <hi>Ho, every one of you that thirsteth, come you to the waters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1. Thus unless Christ be offered <hi>to us,</hi> as well as <hi>for us,</hi> we are never the near.</p>
                     <p>Now to make this appear; Observe that in every <hi>Sacrament</hi> there are <hi>two acts</hi> of the Minister. The one hath Relation to God, a <hi>Commemoration</hi> of the Sacrifice, in which respect the <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> called it a <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> the other, the <hi>breaking</hi> of the <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>pouring</hi> out of the <hi>Wine</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is a <hi>Commemoration</hi> of the <hi>Body broken,</hi> and the <hi>Blood shed,</hi> not as they are Concomitants, the Wine in the Bread, as the <hi>foolish Papists</hi> dream, for that were rather a <hi>commemoration</hi> of his <hi>life</hi> than of his <hi>death,</hi> when the blood runs in the veins. The <hi>commemoration</hi> of Christ's <hi>death</hi> is made by <hi>separation</hi> of the blood from the body; and as there is one act of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in consecrating by <hi>breaking</hi> the <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>pouring</hi> out the <hi>blood,</hi> so there is a second Act which is <hi>ministerial.</hi> When the Minster saith, <hi>Take, eat,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99037:42"/>
This is my body</hi>; as if Christ were present; and said, <hi>Come, Take my body</hi>; thou hast as free an interest to it, as when thou art invited to thy friends table thou hast right to the <hi>meat</hi> before thee. So that as Christ was once <hi>offered for thee,</hi> so he is, in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, <hi>offered to thee:</hi> And what now should hinder thee, unless thou art one that will <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately</hi> oppose thy own <hi>salvation,</hi> and say, <hi>I will not have this man to rule over me,</hi> thou canst not miscarry. But if thou wilt be thine own <hi>Lord,</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in thine <hi>infidelity.</hi> Here be the <hi>Keys</hi> of the Kingdom of Heaven given unto God's Ministers, unless thou wilfully oppose thine own salvation, and shut that <hi>door</hi> of <hi>salvation</hi> which Christ hath opened so wide for thee. See, the ways of God are plain. Christ hath paid a great price for thee; and then, as great as it is, he offers it to thee.</p>
                     <p>Now for the former of these, which is Christ's satisfaction made unto the Father for us, I made choice of this place of Scripture, which sets it out particularly. Herein two things are to be observed.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The person who it is that will thus humble himself.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> grounds his Exhortation on the fourth verse; where he tells us, <hi>We ought not to look every man on his own things, but every man on the things of others, Let this mind be in you, which also was in Christ Jesus.</hi> If Christ had looked only on his <hi>own things,</hi> he might have saved himself a great deal of <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>pains.</hi> He being the Son of God, might as soon as he was born have chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged a <hi>seat</hi> with God in <hi>Glory:</hi> He need not have gone <hi>per viam:</hi> He might be Comprehensor <hi>in meta:</hi> But he would pass on to his journey's end in a <hi>thorny</hi> and <hi>troublesome</hi> way. <hi>Let then the same mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus; who minded not his own things, but the good of others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>What it was wherein he humbled himself. He took upon him the form of a servant, and was obedient unto the death of the Cross.</hi> The highest humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation that can be; that he who is above all praise, whom <hi>Angels</hi> adored, that he should be brought from heaven to earth; and not only be a <hi>Pilgrim</hi> there, but have a sorrowful and pittiful <hi>Pilgrimage</hi>; and at last to be cut off by a shameful death from the land of the living. This <hi>Humiliation</hi> hath no <hi>parallel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>depth</hi> of the <hi>humiliation</hi> consists in the <hi>height</hi> of the person thus <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi>; and were not he so <hi>high,</hi> it could have done us no good. It's no small <hi>satisfaction</hi> that can appease God's <hi>wrath</hi>: therefore the Apostle, in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> speaking of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> the type of Christ, concludes, <hi>how great this man was.</hi> Heb. 7.4.</p>
                     <p>Consider the invaluable price that was paid for thee, and how great he was who paid it; <hi>who being in the form of God, he who was fellow, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-like with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as good as himself, as great as himself; was thus humbled.</hi> It was the <hi>Second Person</hi> in the sacred Trinity, he, and no other, that was thus <hi>humbled</hi> for thee: He was <hi>weary</hi> for thee, and <hi>reviled</hi> for thee, <hi>sweated</hi> and <hi>fainted</hi> for thee, <hi>hungred</hi> for thee, and was <hi>buffeted</hi> for thee. It was he, the <hi>Second Person</hi> of the blessed Trinity, in proper speech, without either <hi>Trope</hi> or <hi>Figure,</hi> shed his blood for thee, <hi>died</hi> for thee; and <hi>suffered</hi> all these things in his <hi>assumed</hi> nature (<hi>taking on him</hi> the <hi>form of a servant</hi>) though not in his <hi>divine.</hi> He remaining God alone, could not die, but die fain he would for thee; therefore he took thy <hi>nature</hi> on him, that he might die for thee in that <hi>assumed nature.</hi> He took not on him the nature of <hi>Angels, but the seed of Abraham.</hi> Heb. 2.16. He being the <hi>Fountain</hi> of life, and the <hi>Prince</hi> of our life, (<hi>and without shedding of blood no Redemption can be wrought</hi>) having not blood to shed as God, therefore took our nature on him; as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body thou hast prepared me: then said I, lo, I come; in the volume of thy book it is written of me, to do thy will, O God.</hi> As if he should have said, Lord, I am not able to accomplish thy Will, or to be subject to thee in <hi>thy nature</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99037:43"/>
thou hast made me a <hi>man,</hi> that in the <hi>form of a servant,</hi> I might shew obedience, which I could not while I was in nature <hi>equal</hi> unto thee. Now consider how great this person is that hath suffered all for thee. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the first begotten of the Dead, and the Prince of the Kings of the earth:</hi> To have a great Prince <hi>bound</hi> like a <hi>thief, arraigned,</hi> and <hi>executed</hi>; the consideration of this state of the person would move a <hi>stony heart. Rev.</hi> 17.14. <hi>He is the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Amongst men, the <hi>Father</hi> is more <hi>honourable</hi> than the <hi>Son,</hi> and the Son is but a servant, until he be emancipated: but it is not so in the <hi>Divinity</hi>; but the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> are both alike honourable.</p>
                     <p>Among <hi>men,</hi> the Son hath the same <hi>specifical</hi> nature with the Father, but not the same <hi>individual:</hi> but it is not so in the <hi>Divinity</hi>; the Father and the Son have the self same <hi>individual</hi> nature. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.30. <hi>I and my Father are one, therefore there must be an equality.</hi> The <hi>Pharisees</hi> themselves could draw this conclusion; that if he were the Son of God, he was equal with God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he said, God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</hi> A man would think how could that follow? He was but God's <hi>Son</hi>; but God's <hi>Son</hi> must be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with the Father. <hi>In making himself God's Son, he made himself equal with God:</hi> and therefore know, upon <hi>this,</hi> and by <hi>this</hi> stands the point of our Redemption. If a pure and holy Angel had suffered never so much, it would not have availed for our Redemption. It is a <hi>Price</hi> no man, nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel must meddle withal; it will require a greater <hi>Price.</hi> It was God himself that suffered in his <hi>assumed nature:</hi> He, and no other person; (for we must understand, though Christ took on him the <hi>nature</hi> of a man, yet not the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of a man) here stands the point, the <hi>Second Person</hi> in the Trinity is the <hi>Suppositum</hi> of all this <hi>humiliation:</hi> and therefore observe when the point of suffering comes, there is a remarkable speech. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.7. The Father seemeth to say concerning the Son, that it was against his <hi>heart</hi> to smite him: The expression was a lively one; it went to his <hi>heart</hi> to smite one that was his <hi>equal,</hi> that did him no wrong: <hi>Awake, O sword, against my Shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow.</hi> You know of whom it is spoken by <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Mat.</hi> 26.31. <hi>I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered. The Lord is ready to break him.</hi> Isa. 53. The Sword was as it were unwilling to smite. <hi>The man that is my fellow?</hi> A blow lighting on God's fellow, equal with God, of what value is it? Consider the difference betwixt a <hi>man</hi> and a <hi>man</hi>: The State of a Prince makes great odds between that is done to <hi>him,</hi> and that is done to <hi>another man.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> would adventure himself into the batttl: <hi>Thou shalt,</hi> say they, <hi>go no more with us, lest thou quench the light of Israel,</hi> 2 Sam. 21.17. and more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is a great ground of the sufficiency of Christ's suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13. <hi>If the blood of Bulls and Goats sanctifie to the purifying of the flesh; how much more,</hi> vers. 14. <hi>shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit, offered himself without spot to God, purge your Consciences from dead works, to serve the living God?</hi> It is not the offering of the body only, but he did it <hi>through his eternal Spirit.</hi> When the Martyrs and Saints offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselves a sacrifice, they offered it <hi>through the flames of their love,</hi> and therefore embraced the stake; and <hi>love</hi> is described as strong as <hi>death:</hi> but Christ did not offer his Sacrifice with the flames of his love, though love was in him the greatest that ever was; <hi>but with the everlasting flames of his

So may Christ say to his Church, a <hi>bloody Spouse</hi> hast thou been to me, that my blood must be shed for thee: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Had they known, they would not have crucified he Lord of Glory</hi>; that is, they would not have <hi>crucified God.</hi> He that was crucified, was the glorious Lord God. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.15. <hi>You denyed the holy one, and killed the Prince of life.</hi> Here's the matter, unless the Prince of life had been <hi>killed,</hi> thou couldst not have life. This the Apostle sets down as the ground of all, before he comes to the particularities of his <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi>; and sets down who it was, who was thus <hi>humbled:</hi> He whom the <hi>Heaven of Heavens could not contain,</hi> he must descend into the lowermost parts of the earth; that's a descent indeed. His Humiliation appears in this, that he who was thus high, became a man; <hi>and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross.</hi> In this humiliation consider, I say, these two Points.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The person who was humbled.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The degrees of his humiliation.<note place="margin">Christ's humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation in iife and death</note> Some things have regard to the <hi>whole course</hi> of his life, others to the <hi>conclusion</hi> or <hi>period</hi> of his life. All his life from his <hi>incarnation</hi> to his <hi>passion,</hi> was a continual <hi>thred</hi> of <hi>humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> from his <hi>Cradle</hi> to his <hi>Cross,</hi> from his <hi>Womb</hi> to his <hi>Tomb:</hi> So here is set down the <hi>humbled</hi> life of our blessed Saviour. For I would not have you think his <hi>humiliation</hi> consisted only in coming to the <hi>Cross,</hi> when they so mercilesly handled him: it cost him more then so: as sinners have the <hi>curse</hi> of God on them in their <hi>life,</hi> as well as in their <hi>death</hi>: So Christ must have a miserable life, as well as an accursed death. Though the heat came at the end o the <hi>Tragedy,</hi> yet his whole life was a continual <hi>suffering.</hi> Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the degrees of it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Consider the <hi>particulars</hi> of it, he took on him the <hi>form of a servant</hi>; Was not this a great humiliation? <hi>That the second person in the Trinity should stoop so low as to take on him the nature of one, who is not worth the looking on?</hi> That he should take <hi>dust</hi> and <hi>ashes</hi> upon him. <hi>Psalm</hi> 113.5, 6. Gods greatness is thus expressed, <hi>Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high, who humbleth himself to behold the things in heaven, and in the earth</hi>: What <hi>Humiliation</hi> is that? Compare these two humiliations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nether. It is an humiliation, to cast but his eye upon the <hi>Heavens,</hi> to look upon the most glorious of all his works, to look upon the Angels, <hi>but what is man that thou so regardest him?</hi> That thou shouldst not only <hi>look</hi> upon him, but <hi>take</hi> him <hi>up,</hi> and make him an <hi>inmate</hi> under thine own roof? This is a greater abasement, but here's a further degree, Christ during the time of his pilgrimage was content to deprive himself of his Glory, that he now enjoyes. By reason of his Hypostatical Union with the God-head, he deserves all honour and glory, <hi>When he brought his first begotten into the world, he saith, And let all the Angels worship him.</hi> Heb. 1.6. <hi>Every knee bows to him that is thus highly exalted. We see Christ crowned with glory and honour, all Dominion and Power being made subject unto him,</hi> yet he for <hi>thirty three years and an half</hi> was content to be exiled from his Fathers court.

Look on <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Sacrifice and burnt offerings thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared me,</hi> these words have relation to that of the Psalmist, <hi>Psalm</hi> 40.6. <hi>Sacrifice and burnt offerings thou didst not desire, but mine ears hast thou opened</hi>; it is in the margent, <hi>mine ears hast thou digged, or hast thou bored.

Mine ear Lord hast thou bored, I will be thy servant for ever.</hi> Christ took on him the <hi>form</hi> of such a <hi>servant</hi>; nay Christ was more then an ordinary <hi>slave</hi>: He was one bound to an everlasting slavery, for he was the <hi>Son of an hand-maid:</hi> Now the Children of an hand-maid were not to go forth at the year of <hi>Jubilee.</hi> Exod. 21. <hi>The Wife and her Children shall be her Masters, and he shall go out by himself:</hi> Meaning thus, he that was the son of an <hi>hand-maid,</hi> must be bound. <hi>Partus sequitur ventrem.</hi> Now that Christ was the son of an hand-maid, we have <hi>Maries</hi> own confession, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the hand-maid of the</hi> Lord, and <hi>he hath looked upon the low estate of his hand-maid,</hi> Luke 1.38, 48.

Thus is Christ a servant in respect of God.</p>

This humane nature being thus assumed, he was content to deprive himself a long time of that estate of glory, which he might have in our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature alwayes (after it's assumption) enjoyed, and in that time was as obedient, as the <hi>meanest</hi> and <hi>poorest</hi> servant of his Father. Nor was he only <hi>actively,</hi> but <hi>passively</hi> obedient; <hi>He was obedient unto the death</hi>: He was content to lay down his life for our <hi>Redemption.</hi> And it was not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry death that would serve the turn, but it must be the <hi>death of the Cross,</hi> the most <hi>accursed shameful</hi> and <hi>painful</hi> death, that death which was most <hi>suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and best <hi>able</hi> to answer the wrath of God.</p>
                     <p>First, He humbled himself by taking our nature upon him: <hi>He that thought it no robbery to be equal with God, took upon him the form of a man.</hi> If it were an <hi>abasement</hi> for God to look upon <hi>heaven</hi> the most glorious of his works, how much more to take upon him a <hi>clod,</hi> or <hi>piece</hi> of this <hi>earth,</hi> and unite it to his own sacred person for ever.

on him the form of a servant, he <hi>humbled himself.</hi> Where we may observe what made the suffering of our Saviour so meritorious: It was because it was <hi>active, free,</hi> and <hi>voluntary.</hi> Our <hi>Passions</hi> are contrary to our <hi>Will</hi>: We are drawn to it, as it is said of <hi>Peter, When thou art old, they shall lead thee whither thou wouldst not,</hi> Joh. 21.18. <hi>Peter</hi> dyed the same death our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did, according to the external passion; but they led him, whither he would not.

                        </gap>, <hi>he troubled himself:</hi> he was the <hi>Author of his own sufferings,</hi> Joh. 10.17. He was not humbled as a mere <hi>patient</hi>; but he <hi>humbled himself:</hi> and so it is said in Scripture oft, <hi>He gave himself for us,</hi> and in all his <hi>passive obedience</hi> he had an eye to do the <hi>Will</hi> of God. The merit of his <hi>passive</hi> obedience ariseth from a mixture with his <hi>active.</hi> This was a great part of his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> his humbling. And how doth he take his Priest-hood upon him? it was by his Father's call. <hi>He was called unto it as was</hi> Aaron. Heb. 5.4. <hi>No man,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>taketh this honour upon him, but he that is called.</hi> Now Christ being <hi>called</hi> to it, he did it to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his call. And thus he did it <hi>actively:</hi> it was not a bare suffering as those in hell suffer, but according to his Father's <hi>call.</hi> Observe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9. That place taken out of the Psalm, <hi>I am come to do thy Will, O God, &amp;c.</hi> What, was it only in its active obedience? No, it was thy Will that he should suffer; as the words following in the tenth verse import, <hi>By the which Will we are sanctified, and by the body of Jesus Christ once offered:</hi> So that Christ offered up himself to do his Father's Will; so that his <hi>passive</hi> obedience was in his <hi>active.</hi> So <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it up again; no man taketh it from me, but I lay it down.</hi> Our Saviour, when he laid down his life, put it off, as a man that puts off his cloak, and lays it from him. They wondred that he was dead so soon, it 'was because himself laid down his life. His soul then was not <hi>drag'd</hi> or <hi>forced</hi> out of his body. It was not only <hi>passive,</hi> but <hi>active</hi> obedience. <hi>No man taketh it from me; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up. This had I from my Father.</hi> They are grosly deceived then, that say Christ's active obedience was not <hi>free</hi> and <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,</hi> because he was <hi>commanded:</hi> for as well may they say, his passive was not voluntary, and so not <hi>meritorious,</hi> because it likewise was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which none can deny. Thus Christ's <hi>offering</hi> was a <hi>free-will-offering,</hi> though it was a most bitter one; yet, this being a part of his Father's <hi>Will,</hi> he went as voluntarily to the pains of the <hi>Cross,</hi> as thou dost to thy dinner, when thou art throughl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

there likewise he shews himself the holy one of God. In a word, as he was thus obedient unto <hi>God,</hi> so was he subject to <hi>men</hi> too; to his <hi>Father in the family,</hi> and to <hi>Caesar in the Commonwealth:</hi> As he <hi>taught,</hi> he <hi>did</hi>: Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards Governors was his Doctrine, and rather than he would not pay Tribute, he would have it out of the <hi>fishes belly:</hi> To shew a <hi>Recognition</hi> of his subjection unto higher powers, the text tells us, <hi>He went about doing good. This man,</hi> say they, <hi>hath done all things well</hi>: And at the last cast, when all the <hi>quarrels</hi> and <hi>Accusations</hi> were brought against him, they could bring nothing that <hi>could hold water</hi>; that he could boldly challenge them all, as it were, <hi>Which of you can accuse me of sin?</hi> You that <hi>pick</hi> so many <hi>holes</hi> in my <hi>coat,</hi> come forth, <hi>spare</hi> me not, <hi>accuse</hi> me; yet at the last he is accounted a <hi>just man.

Our Saviour spent <hi>thirty three</hi> years in his hard service; and oft did the sleep depart from his eyes. When <hi>Israel</hi> came to appear before <hi>Pharoah, My dayes,</hi> saith he, <hi>have been</hi> 130 <hi>years: few and evil have the dayes of thy servant been. Gen.</hi> 47.9. The true <hi>Israelite</hi> might say more. <hi>Jacobs</hi> days were few; but as few as they were, they were 130 years; but if we look upon our Saviours dayes, they were scarce a <hi>quarter</hi> so many.</p>
                     <p>And that is our Saviours humiliation, that he was cut off <hi>in the midst of his dayes.</hi> If we look into the <hi>Psalm,</hi> we shall find it a curse on the <hi>bloody and deceitful man, that he shall not live out half his dayes.</hi> The livelie part of a mans age, (from <hi>Moses</hi> his time to this day, in that <hi>Psalm</hi> of <hi>Moses, Psalm.</hi> 90.) <hi>is threescore years and ten</hi>; Half this is <hi>thirty five</hi> years; and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is taken off, before this <hi>thirty five</hi> is expired.

Add to all this, that he was not like us, <hi>He knew when, and by what death he should die:</hi> He knew in all the time of his suffering what he should suffer, and what should come upon him at his death. If any of us should know that he must <hi>die</hi> a <hi>cursed, shameful,</hi> and <hi>painful</hi> death, and knew when it should be, it would marr all our mirth, and put us to our <hi>dumps</hi> in the <hi>midst</hi> of our <hi>jollity.</hi> Our Saviour in the midst of all his joy on earth, saith, <hi>I have a Baptism to be baptized with: Luk.</hi> 12.50. He knew the <hi>cruel death,</hi> which he should suffer on the Cross. And how is he pained, <hi>till it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished.</hi> The <hi>pains</hi> of it run through all his life, and might well make his whole life <hi>uncomfortable</hi> unto him. In the twelfth of <hi>John</hi> 23. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the Passover, saith he, <hi>The hour is come that the Son of man shall be glorified:</hi> and then verse 27. <hi>Now is, my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour.</hi> When the time was drawing nigh, some <hi>five</hi> or <hi>six</hi> dayes before, the consideration of it troubled him, though he knew he should be glorified, yet the fright of it enwrapt him with fear. <hi>Now is my soul troubled; what shall I say, Father, save me from this hour.</hi> Such a kind of life did our Saviour lead: <hi>Few,</hi> but evil were his dayes. As <hi>evil,</hi> as <hi>few,</hi> he had no comfort in them.</p>
                     <p>Come we now to the point of his <hi>death,</hi> the last thing; and those things that did touch him therein, are the <hi>Curse, Shame, and pain of it.</hi> If there were any death more <hi>accursed,</hi> he must die that death: If any death more
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99037:48"/>
                        <hi>shameful,</hi> or more <hi>painful</hi> then other, he must die <hi>that.</hi> All these do concur in the death of our Saviour, which he suffered, in that death of the Cross. It was the most <hi>accursed,</hi> most <hi>shameful,</hi> and most <hi>painful</hi> death as could be devised.</p>
                     <p>First, For the <hi>Accursedness</hi> of it, there was no death that had a more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar curse on it then this. Howsoever all deaths are accursed, when they light on one that is without Christ; but his death had a legal Curse: and this was the curse annexed to the Cross; a type of that real <hi>Curse.</hi> Now the type of a real Curse, <hi>Was hanging on the tree: Thou shalt bury him that day, for he that is hanged on a tree is</hi> accursed <hi>by God,</hi> Deut. 21.23. So the Son of God was made a Curse for us, alluding unto this, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3.12. And here we see the <hi>blessed</hi> Son of God, he in whom all the Nations of the earth are <hi>blessed:</hi> The <hi>Fountain</hi> of all <hi>blessedness:</hi> We see him stand in so cursed a condition, to be made as it were as an <hi>Anathema,</hi> the highest degree of <hi>cursing</hi> that may be.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Consider the <hi>shame</hi> of it. There is a place in the best of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators</hi> that expresses the detestableness and shame of this death of the Cross. <hi>Facinus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cicero Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>in Verrem.</hi> See what a gradation there is, it is hardly to be expressed in English. <hi>Its a great fault to bind a Citizen of Rome and a Gentleman, what is it to beat him? What to crucifie him</hi>? His Eloquence failed him there, as being not able to express the detestableness of it, and therefore the chief <hi>Captain was afraid because he had bound</hi> Paul, <hi>after he had heard he was a free-man of Rome, Act.</hi> 22.29. but then it's worse to <hi>beat</hi> him; but what was it to <hi>crucifie</hi> him? Our blessed Saviour went through all these indignities. <hi>First they come against him with swords and with staves, as against a Thief. They sold him for a base price. They beat him with rods, pricked him, and after all they crucified him.</hi> Consider then the <hi>shame</hi> of it: he that was to be <hi>crucified,</hi> was <hi>stripped naked,</hi> as naked as ever he came out of his mothers Womb: However the <hi>Painters</hi> may lye in it. And was not this a <hi>shame</hi> thus to be <hi>stripped</hi> before thousands? Wherefore it was a custome among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the greatest King, if he were baptized, was to be stripped naked, which they did as a memorial of the shame of our Saviour. So shameful a thing it was, that they thought him unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to suffer within the walls. <hi>Christ that he might sanctifie the people, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered without the walls. Hebr.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Let us go with him out of the Camp bearing his reproach.</hi> He was a man unfit to suffer within the walls. <hi>Pilat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>
                        </hi> thought he would meet with them, when they were so violent to have him <hi>crucified,</hi> and therefore he joyns <hi>Barabbas</hi> with him, the vilest Thief in the Countrey, and a Murtherer: So that <hi>Peter</hi> cast this in their teeth, <hi>That they preferred a Murtherer before him. He was reckoned with the Transgressors,</hi> as it was prophesied of him before. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.12. <hi>They crucifie him between two Thieves,</hi> as if he had been the Captain of them. <hi>Pilate</hi> thought by naming of <hi>Barabbas,</hi> to have saved Christ; but so enraged was their blind malice, that they preferred the release of <hi>Barabbas,</hi> before the exemption of Christ. Wherefore (as St. <hi>Luke</hi> saith) Pilate <hi>released unto them him, that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. Luk.</hi> 23.25.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Consider the <hi>Pain</hi> of the <hi>Cross, whom God raised up, having loosed the sorrows of death: Act.</hi> 2.24. Not meaning there were <hi>sorrows</hi> that Christ endured after his death, but its meant of the <hi>sorrows</hi> that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his death. It was the most <hi>dolorous</hi> death that ever could be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. We scarce know what <hi>Crucifying</hi> is. The <hi>Christian Emperors</hi> in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of our Saviour banished that kind of suffering, that none after him might suffer it: But yet it is fit we should know what it was, since it was so terrible a thing. And here, as the Apostle said to the <hi>Galathians, Suppose you see Christ crucified before your face at present.</hi> The manner of it was thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:99037:48"/>
                        <hi>First there was a long beam, on which the party was to be stretched, and there was a cross-beam on which the hands were to be stretched: they pull'd them up upon the Cross before they fastned them; they pull'd him to his utmost length.</hi> And this is that the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks of, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.17. <hi>You might tell all my bones. His ribs were so stretched, as that they even pierced the flesh: Conceive him now thus stretched with his hands and feet nailed to the wood: the stretching of Christ on the Cross, was such a thing as the working of the rack.</hi> Imagine him before your eyes thus represented. Your sins cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him: <hi>being thus stretched upon the Cross to his full length, the hands and the feet were fastned, and nailed to the wood.</hi> It's no small torment to have the <hi>hands</hi> bored, especially if we behold the place, it was through the <hi>lower part</hi> of the hand where the veins and sinnews all met together: It's a place that is full of sense, consider withal the bigness of the nails: <hi>Psal.</hi> 22.16. <hi>They have digged my hands, to shew the</hi> bigness of the spikes: for the original bears it, <hi>They digg'd him.</hi> Believe not the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: <hi>Our Saviour had four nails: Not one through both feet, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it, but two through his hands, and two through his feet:</hi> And that you may the better comprehend it, you must know that <hi>toward the lower part of the cross, there went along a ledge or threshold whereto his feet were nail'd,</hi> otherwise the flesh would have rent by reason of the nails, if he had hung by the hands alone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Then comes the lifting up; as the serpent was lift up, so must Christ be lift. As when a man is stretched to the full length, and should be with a girk put up; it's like a strapado, as it were the unjoynting of a man</hi>; and this is that the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks of, <hi>All my bones are out of joynt.</hi> Consider withal the time how long it was. St. <hi>Mark</hi> saith, <hi>cap.</hi> 15.25. <hi>It was the third hour, and they crucified him.</hi> In St. <hi>John</hi> it is the <hi>sixth hour,</hi> but the ancient and best Copies have the third hour, and so hath <hi>Nonnus. The ninth hour he gave up the Ghost:</hi> so that it was six long hours by the clock that our Saviour did hang upon the Cross. And it was not with him as with other men, in whom extremity of pains disannul sense, and blunt pains, because they have not a perfect apprehension; but Christ was in his perfect sense all the while. All that the <hi>Jews</hi> could do, could not take away his life from him, till he would himself: and therefore it is said in <hi>Mark</hi> 15.37. <hi>That immediately before he gave up the Ghost, he cryed with a loud voice,</hi> whereas others are wont at that time to be so weak, that they can scarce be heard to <hi>groan:</hi> but never was Christ <hi>stronger,</hi> nor never cryed <hi>lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> than when he gave up the <hi>Ghost,</hi> Mark. 15.39. this of it self made the <hi>Centurion assoon as he heard it, conclude, certainly this man was the Son of God.</hi> How doth he gather this from his crying? thus, For a man to be in his <hi>full strength,</hi> and cry out <hi>so strongly,</hi> and immediately to give up the Ghost, this is a great Miracle: <hi>Truly this man was the Son of God.</hi> This adds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the greatness of his torment, that he had his <hi>full</hi> and <hi>perfect sense:</hi> that he was <hi>six</hi> full <hi>hours</hi> thus on the Rack, and the extremity of pain took not away his sense. He was as strong at the <hi>last,</hi> as at the <hi>first.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These things <hi>seriously weighed,</hi> Oh! how do they aggravate the depth of his Humiliation? <hi>Seriously weigh</hi> them: they are <hi>miserable</hi> and <hi>lamentable</hi> matters; yet in <hi>these</hi> lie our comfort. Through these words is there a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage open for us into the Kingdom of Heaven: <hi>When he had overcome the terrors of death, he opened the Kingdom of Heaven to all Believers:</hi> these were now but the <hi>out-side</hi> of his sufferings, which did belong to man for his sins. He suffered not only <hi>bodily sufferings,</hi> but <hi>sufferings</hi> in <hi>soul,</hi> and and that he did in a most unknown, and <hi>incomprehensible</hi> manner; But now may some say,</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> No, he suffered those things that such an <hi>innocent Lamb</hi> might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but he could not suffer the <hi>pains</hi> of Hell.

He had so clear a <hi>conscience,</hi> as that he could not be <hi>stung</hi> with any such evil.</p>
                     <p>Another great torment in Hell is <hi>Desperation,</hi> arising from the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the perpetuity of their torments, which makes them <hi>curse</hi> and <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme</hi> God, and carry an <hi>inexpressible hatred</hi> against him; but Christ could not do so; he could <hi>not hate</hi> God: God forbid that Christ should be <hi>lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to these <hi>Passions.</hi>

                        </gap>els us all: we must not say Christ did <hi>forget</hi> for what he came: but he did not <hi>remember:</hi> these words proceeded from the seat of <hi>passion,</hi> which while it is <hi>disturbed,</hi> reason suspends its Acts. Christ had <hi>Passions,</hi> though no <hi>impurity</hi> in them. As take a clear <hi>Vial</hi> full of water from the <hi>fountain,</hi> and shake it, it may be <hi>frothy,</hi> yet it will be <hi>clean</hi> water still. Christ did not forget, only he had the <hi>suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of his faculties for a time. As a man in a sleep, thinks not what he is to do in the morning, and yet he is said properly to forget. <hi>He cryed, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Matth. 27.40. He was contented to be forsaken for a <hi>time,</hi> that thou mighst not be forsaken <hi>everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and this was no faint prayer: if you will read the place in the <hi>Psalm. He cryed out unto God:</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. It's said, <hi>Who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong cries and tears.</hi> He cryed to the Almighty: he made Gods own heart to pity: He would break, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. yet his heart is repenting, and rolled together, so that he sent an Angel to support and comfort him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. those strong cries are expressed with a more forcible word, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me, why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Consider how it was with Christ before any earthly hand had touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, when he beseeched God for his life: this shews the wonderful suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Christ; and for that point, <hi>Why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Consider it was not with <hi>Christ</hi> as with the <hi>Fathers,</hi> they suffered a great deal of punishment and taches, and would not be delivered, yet Christ was more couragious than they all. He had a spirit of fortitude, he was anointed abve his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and yet he quivers. <hi>Our Fathers cryed unto thee, they trusted in thee, and were not consumed; they were delivered: but I am a worm, and no man.</hi> I can find no <hi>shadow</hi> of comfort. Lord, Why art thou so <hi>angry</hi> with me? this speech came not from the upper part of the soul, the seat of <hi>reason,</hi> but from the lower part, the seat of <hi>Passion: My God, my God,</hi> these were not words of desperation. He held fast to God; <hi>Why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> these are words of sense: thus you see the <hi>price</hi> is paid, and what a <hi>bitter</hi> thing <hi>sin</hi> is. God will not suffer his <hi>Justice</hi> to be swallowed up by <hi>Mercy.</hi> It must be <hi>satisfied</hi>; and our Saviour, if he will be a Mediator, must make
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99037:49"/>
payment to the uttermost farthing: Consider what a time this was, when our Saviour suffered: The <hi>Sun</hi> with-draws his beams, the <hi>earth</hi> shakes and trembles: <hi>What aileth thee, O thou Sun to be darkned, and thou earth to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> was it not to shew his mourning for the <hi>death</hi> of its Maker? The <hi>soul</hi> of Christ was <hi>dark</hi> within, and it's fit that all the world should be hung in <hi>black</hi> for the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> of Kings. But mark, when he comes to deliver up his life, and to give up the Ghost, <hi>the vail of the Temple rent in twain, and that was the ninth hour,</hi> which in the <hi>Acts</hi> is called the <hi>hour of prayer</hi>; it was at three a Clock in the afternoon. Hence it is said, <hi>Let the lifting up of my hands be as the evening sacrifice.</hi> The Priest was killing the <hi>Lamb</hi> at that time, there was a <hi>vail</hi> that severed the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> it was between the place of oblations, and the Holy of holies, which signifies the Kingdom of Heaven. Assoon as Christ died, the <hi>vail</hi> rent, and Heaven was open, the Priest saw that which was before hidden. Our Saviour, saith the Apostle, entred through the <hi>vail</hi> of his flesh unto his Father, and fit it was, that the <hi>vail</hi> should give place when Christ comes to enter: but what becomes of Christ's <hi>soul</hi> now? his <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>body</hi> were pull'd asunder, and through the <hi>vail</hi> of his flesh, as it were with blood about his ears he entred the Holy of Holies unto God, saying, Lord, here am I in my blood; <hi>and here is blood that speaks better things than the blood of</hi> Abel, that cries for vengeance, this for blessing and expiation of our sins.</p>

                     <p>First, For us, and so he offered up himself a <hi>Sacrifice, a sweet smelling Sacrifice unto God,</hi> Eph. 5.2. Mark the point <hi>is,</hi> he <hi>is</hi> not only the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but the <hi>Sacrificer. He offered up himself,</hi> saith the Apostle; He was the <hi>Priest,</hi> and it was part of his Priest-hood to offer up himself. The <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> in the old Law that typified him, were only <hi>sufferers.</hi> The poor beasts were only <hi>passive:</hi> but our Saviour he must be an <hi>Actor</hi> in the business. He was <hi>active</hi> in all that he suffered. He did it in obedience to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Will,</hi> yet he was an Agent in all his Passions, <hi>John</hi> 11.43. He <hi>groaned</hi> in Spirit, and was <hi>troubled</hi>; the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, or (as it is in the Margent) <hi>He troubled himself.</hi> With us in our Passions it is otherwise: we are <hi>meer sufferers.</hi> Our Saviour was a <hi>Conqueror</hi> over all his passions, and therefore unless he would <hi>trouble</hi> himself, none else could trouble him: unless he would lay down his life, none could take it from him; unless he would give his cheek to be smitten, the <hi>Jews</hi> had no power to smite it. <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.6. <hi>I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that pluckt off the hair, and hid not my face from shame and spitting.</hi> In all these we should consider our Saviour, not as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> only, but a <hi>Sacrificer</hi> also; an <hi>Actor</hi> in all this business: their wicked hands were not more ready to <hi>smite,</hi> then he was to give his face to be <hi>smitten,</hi> and all to shew that it was a <hi>voluntary Sacrifice.</hi> He did all himself; <hi>He humbled himself unto the death,</hi> Phil. 2.8. And now by all this we see what we have gotten: we have
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99037:50"/>
gotten a <hi>remedy</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> for sins. That precious blood of that <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Lamb</hi> takes away the sins of the world, because it is the Lamb of God, under which else the World would have eternally groaned.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But doth this Lamb of God take away all the sins of the world?</hi>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> It doth not <hi>actually</hi> take away all the sins of the world, but <hi>virtually,</hi> It hath power to do it, if it be rightly applyed, the Sacrifice hath such ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in it, that if all the World would take it, and apply it, it would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate, and remove the sins of the whole World: but it is here, as with <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi> they do not help, being <hi>prepared,</hi> but being <hi>applied; Rhubarb</hi> purgeth choler, yet not unless applied, <hi>&amp;c. Exod.</hi> 39.38. there is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of a <hi>Golden Altar.</hi> Christ is this Golden Altar, to shew that his blood is most precious: <hi>We are not redeemed with silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. Rev. 8.3. &amp; 9.13. He is that golden Alter mentioned in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which stands before the Throne. He was likewise to be a <hi>brazen altar</hi>; for so much was to be put upon him, that unless he were of <hi>brass,</hi> and had <hi>infinite strength,</hi> he would have sunk under the burden. Its <hi>Jobs</hi> Metaphor: <hi>Job</hi> in his passion saith, <hi>Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh brass</hi>? Job 6.12. If Christs flesh had not been <hi>brass:</hi> if he had not been this <hi>brazen Altar,</hi> he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have gone through these: now he is prepared for us a sacrifice for sin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, (for sin</hi>) make a stop there, <hi>condemned sin in the flesh.</hi> This same (<hi>for sin</hi>) hath not reference to (<hi>condemned</hi>) To condemn sin for sin is not good sense; but the words depend on this (<hi>God sent his Son</hi>) that is, God sent his Son to be a Sacrifice for sin, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as the word is translated. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.6. <hi>a sacrifice for sin.</hi> It was impossible the Law should save us: not because of any <hi>imperfection,</hi> or <hi>failing</hi> in the Law, but because our <hi>weakness</hi> is such, as that we could not perform the conditions: therefore God was not tyed to promises; by reason then of the weakness of our flesh, rather than we should perish, <hi>God sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and in that flesh of his condemned all our sins</hi>; we need not look that sin should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in us, when he bare our sins on the tree, then were our sins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; therefore it's said, <hi>Isai.</hi> 53. <hi>When he had made his soul an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for sin:</hi> that is in the Original (when he had made his soul, <hi>sin</hi>) then he <hi>saw his seed,</hi> Isa. 57.</p>
                     <p>We come now to the second thing, if Christ be offered <hi>for</hi> us, yet unless he offer him <hi>to</hi> us: unless any man may have <hi>interest</hi> in him, it's nothing worth. Here then stands the <hi>Mystery</hi> of the Gospel; Christ, when he comes to offer himself to us, he finds not a <hi>whit</hi> in us that is to be respected; <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> And that is the ground of all <hi>disturbance</hi> to <hi>ignorant consciences</hi>; for there is naturally in men <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ignorance,</hi> they think they may not meddle with Christ, through Gods <hi>Mercy</hi>; unless they bring <hi>something,</hi> unless they have <hi>something</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> to lay down. This is to buy Christ, to barter betwixt Christ and the soul: but <hi>salvation</hi> is a <hi>free gift</hi> of God. As the Apostle speaks, Christ is <hi>freely</hi> given unto thee, when thou hadst no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of worth in thee. Faith, when it comes, empties thee of all that is in thee: To whom is the Gospel preached? to the dead. Now before Christ <hi>quicken</hi> thee, thou art <hi>stark dead,</hi> rotting in thy sins. Here's the point then, when there is no manner of goodness in thee, in the world. <hi>In me,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, <hi>in my flesh there is no good thing.</hi> When I have been the most <hi>outragious</hi> sinner, I may lay hold on Christ. Christ comes and offers himself to thee.</p>
                     <p>Now when Christ <hi>offers,</hi> the other part of the relation holds, <hi>we may take.</hi> We have an interest to <hi>accept</hi> what he <hi>proffers.</hi> Consider it by an example: If one give me a million, and I <hi>receive</hi> it not, I am never the richer: and so
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99037:51"/>
if God <hi>offer</hi> me his Son, and with him all things, I am nothing the better, if I receive him not. That he is <hi>born</hi> and <hi>given,</hi> what is that to us? unless we can say, <hi>To</hi> us <hi>a child is born, to</hi> us <hi>a Son is given,</hi> Isa. 9.6.

He finds nothing in us that is <hi>lovely,</hi> when he comes to bestow his Son upon us. For it is said, <hi>Rev</hi> 1.5. <hi>That Christ loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.</hi> He doth first cast his eyes upon us, when we are unwashed; as I may say, <hi>unwashed</hi>

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. That is, when Christ comes to <hi>cast</hi> his <hi>affections</hi> on us, and to <hi>wed</hi> us unto himself, he finds us <hi>polluted,</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> not with a <hi>rag</hi> on us. Full of <hi>filth,</hi> just <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> have we, he takes us with <hi>nothing</hi>; nay, we are worse than nothing: So that here is the point; what ground is there whereby a man that is dead, and hath no goodness in him, (m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t? Yes, <hi>To as many as received him, to them he gave the power to become the sons of God. First, The receiving of Christ, and then comes Believing.</hi> It is the receiving of this gift, that is the means, whereby Christ is <hi>offered</hi> to us. The Apostle joyning the first and second <hi>Adam</hi> together, makes the benefit we have by the second to lye in the point of receiving; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>If it be a free gift, why is faith required?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Because faith takes away nothing from the gift. If a man give a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar an Alms, and he <hi>reach</hi> out his hand to receive it, his <hi>reaching</hi> out the hand makes the gift never the less, because the hand is not a <hi>worker,</hi> but <hi>an instrument</hi> in receiving the free gift. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. <hi>If through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded unto many in Jesus Christ.</hi> And <hi>vers.</hi> 17. <hi>If by one man's offence death raigned by one, much more they that receive abundance of grace shall raign in life by one Jesus Christ:</hi> Here's the point then, God is well pleased, and therefore sends to us. Wilt thou have my Son? with <hi>him</hi> thou shalt have <hi>abundance of Grace,</hi> and <hi>everlasting life,</hi> and <hi>my love too.</hi> There's no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this place, but this shall be made good unto, if he can find in his heart to <hi>take</hi> Christ; thou shalt have a warrant to receive him. Now to <hi>receive</hi> Christ, is to <hi>believe</hi> in his name, and to draw near unto him. (The word <hi>Receiving</hi>) is a <hi>taking</hi> with the hand, with free entertainment; as <hi>vers.</hi> 11. immediately before the Text. It's not so properly <hi>Receiving,</hi> as <hi>Entertaining. He</hi> came to his own, and his own <hi>received</hi> him not; they were like the foolish <hi>Gaderens,</hi> that preferred their <hi>pigs</hi> before Christ; they would rather have his room, than his company: and so, when Christ comes, and thou hast rather be a <hi>free man,</hi> as thou thinkest, and wilt not have him to <hi>raign</hi> over thee, then thy <hi>case</hi> is <hi>lamentable</hi>: Then <hi>self-will, self-have.</hi> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It's a shame-faced bashfulness, that makes a man <hi>draw back</hi>; its <hi>unbelief,</hi> if any <hi>draw back,</hi> and to <hi>believe,</hi> is to <hi>go on with boldness; We are not of them which draw back unto perdition, but of them,</hi> &amp;c. What an excellent encouragement is this, <hi>to come with boldness unto the Throne of Grace, that we may find help in time of need?</hi> So that now let thy estate be what it will; if thou wilt not hold off, but dost entertain Christ, <hi>though thy sins be as red as scarlet,</hi> be not discouraged, <hi>they shall be made as white as wool, Isa.</hi> 1.18. The very <hi>sinner against the Holy Ghost</hi> is invited; and why is that <hi>unpardonable?</hi> Can any sin be so great, as to <hi>over-top</hi> the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Christ's blood? There is not so much wretchedness in the heart of man, as there is <hi>Grace, Goodness</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> in Christ: But then it is unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable; Why? Because it is the nature of the disease, that will not suffer the <hi>plaister</hi> to stick on. <hi>It counts the blood of the Covenant, wherewith we should be sanctified, an unholy thing, Heb.</hi> 10.29. If this sinner would not <hi>pluck off</hi> the plaister, and tread it under foot, he should be saved: but this is it, when God is <hi>liberal,</hi> and Christ is <hi>free,</hi> we have not the <hi>heart</hi> to take him at his word, and come. To open this Word, this is the point of all, this is the free preaching of the Gospel indeed; when a man hath nothing desirable in him, but is <hi>stark naught,</hi> and <hi>stark</hi> dead, and is not worth the taking up; that yet he may challenge Christ, and be sure of all. Unless thou hast Christ thou hast nothing by <hi>Promise,</hi> not so much as a <hi>bit</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> by <hi>Promise</hi>; if thou hast it, it is by <hi>Providence; All the Promises of God are in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. that is, Christ, <hi>yea, and Amen: Ye are the Children of the Promise in Christ,</hi> Gal 3.29. and 4.28. but you have nothing till you be in Christ.</p>
                     <p>The Question is, <hi>What must I do in this case?</hi> What encouragement shall I have in my <hi>rags,</hi> when I am <hi>abominable, worth nothing?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are certain things that are preparations to a Promise; such as are Commands, Precepts, Entreaties, which encourage them to it; and then comes a proposition: I being a Believer, shall have eternal life; If Christ be mine, I may <hi>challenge forgiveness of sins,</hi> the <hi>favour of God,</hi> and <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life:</hi> But how is Faith wrought? believe not that foolish conceit that is too common in the world; that <hi>faith is only, a strong perswasion that God is my God, and my sins are forgiven</hi>; this is a foolish thing, a fancy, a dream, unless it be grounded on the Word of God. Its but a <hi>dream,</hi> else that will lead thee unto <hi>a fool's Paradise.</hi> Nothing can uphold faith, but the Word of God: here's the point; I being as <hi>bad</hi> as <hi>bad</hi> can be, what ground have I out of the Word of God, of an Unbeliever to be made a Believer? Now we must not take every Text, but such only as may be appliable to a <hi>dead man,</hi> one that hath <hi>no goodness</hi> in him, that is yet <hi>out of Christ</hi>; we were all swimming at liberty till this Word catched us in; we never thought of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99037:52"/>
business before, till we were thus taken. Now there are certain degrees to get faith in us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first word is a <hi>general proclamation, whereby Christ gives any one leave to come and take him.</hi> Christ is not only a <hi>Fountain sealed,</hi> as in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> but a <hi>Fountain open for sin and for uncleanness,</hi> as in <hi>Zachary:</hi> So that now, when he keeps <hi>open house,</hi> he makes proclamation that none shall be <hi>shut out.</hi> He puts none back; sins, not the greatest that can be, can keep thee back: This is the first thing; and to confirm it, we have our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's own proclamation; <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho! every one that thirsteth, come you to the waters; and he that hath no money, come, buy, and eat: yea, come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price.</hi> A strange contradiction, one would thing; What! buy, and yet without money, and without price. The reason is, because there is a certain thing which fools esteem a price, which is none; <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. <hi>I counsel thee to buy of me gold which is tryed in the fire:</hi> Why? How must this be done? Truly <hi>thus</hi>; whensoever a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner comes to Christ to have his sins pardoned, and to be a Subject of Christ's Kingdom, thou must not then be as thou <hi>wast,</hi> but thou must be <hi>changed.</hi> Thou must not live as thou didst before, in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>rebellion.</hi> Now to leave sin is not worth a rush, it is not a sufficient price; but yet we see a <hi>fool</hi> will esteem his own <hi>bables:</hi> I must lay down my lusts, I must lay down my covetousness, intemperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a man thinks it a great matter thus to do; and to leave the <hi>freedom</hi> that he had before, though it be a <hi>matter of nothing.</hi> When a rebel receives his <hi>pardon,</hi> is the King's <hi>pardon</hi> abridged, because he must live like a <hi>Subject</hi> hereafter? Why should he also seek for the benefit of a Subject? This is said in respect of the <hi>foolish conceit</hi> of man, who thinks it a great <hi>price</hi> to forsake his <hi>corruptions.</hi> Again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37. with the same loud voice, <hi>Christ cryed when he offered himself a Sacrifice for sin: he cryed at the time of the great feast, that all should come. In the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood, and cryed, saying, if any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.</hi> In <hi>ult. Rev.</hi> there is a <hi>quicunque vult</hi>; that is it I pressed: It is a place worth <hi>gold.</hi> And these are the places which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applyed, make you of <hi>strangers,</hi> to draw near: but now these are not appliable to a man before he hath <hi>grace</hi>; every one cannot <hi>apply</hi> them. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forget that place while you live; it is the close of God's Holy Book, and the sealing up of his Holy Book: What's that? It is in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride say, come, and let him that is a thirsty come, and drink of the water of life freely.</hi> Whosoever will, let him come: what wouldst thou have more? <hi>Hast thou no Will to Christ?</hi> No Will to salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? then it is pity thou shouldst be saved. No man can be <hi>saved</hi> against his <hi>Will,</hi> nor <hi>blessed</hi> against his <hi>Will:</hi> If thou wilt not have Christ, if thou wilt try conclusions with God, then go further, and fare worse; but <hi>whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will,</hi> let him come. Oh! but I have a <hi>Will:</hi> Why, then thou hast a <hi>warrant</hi>; take Christ.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But, O Sir, you are a great Patron of Free will: What? doth it all lie in a man's Will? Will you make the matter of taking Christ lie there?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I say, if thou seest thou hast a Will, then thou hast a warrant; I say not that this <hi>Will</hi> comes from thy <hi>self.</hi> It is not a <hi>blind faith</hi> will do thee good; the <hi>Word of God works</hi> faith in thee, thou hast not a <hi>Will to it born in thee.</hi> It is not a flower that grows in thine own Garden, but is planted by God; <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come unto me, except the Father which hath sent me, draw him.</hi> What? Will Christ offer violence to the Will, and draw a man against his Will? No, there is no such meaning. It is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the 65th. verse. <hi>No man can come unto me, except it were given him of my Father.</hi> By this Christ sheweth what he meant. If thou hast a Will to come, thank the Father for it; for of <hi>Him,</hi> as in the <hi>Philippians, we have both the Will and the Deed.</hi> Take for example that general Proclamation in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99037:52"/>
the book of <hi>Ezra, Whatever Jew would, might be free,</hi> Ezra 1.3. So said the King that had power to make them free; <hi>Who is there among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, <hi>and build the house of the God of Israel.</hi> Then we read, <hi>vers.</hi> 5. <hi>Then rose up the chief of the Fathers of</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Benjamin, <hi>and the Priest, and the Levites, with all them whose Spirit God had raised up to go up.</hi> Observe here, though the <hi>proclamation</hi> were <hi>general,</hi> yet the <hi>raising up of the Will</hi> was from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Lord.</hi> We must not by any means take our Will for a ground: the <hi>Will</hi> cometh from <hi>God</hi>; but if thou <hi>hast the Will,</hi> thou hast <hi>a warrant.</hi> Whoever <hi>will, let him take the water of life freely</hi> without cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting: say not if thou hadst but a measure of faith, and such a measure of humiliation; for that were to <hi>compound with Christ:</hi> away with that; <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will, let him come.</hi> Christ keeps open house; <hi>Whosoever will, let him come: whosoever comes to him, he will in no wise cast out,</hi> Joh. 6.37. If thou hast a heart to <hi>come</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> he hath a willing heart to <hi>receive thee</hi>; as it was with the <hi>Prodigal</hi> Son, <hi>the Father stays not till he comes to him, but runs to meet him:</hi> he is <hi>swift</hi> to shew <hi>Mercy,</hi> and to meet us, though we come <hi>slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> on towards him. But this is not all, there is a second gracious Word that is preached to a man, not yet in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi> A man that keeps <hi>open house,</hi> he seldom invites any particularly; but if he come, he shall be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Christ, he keeps <hi>open house</hi>; but some are <hi>so fearful,</hi> and <hi>so modest,</hi> that unless they have a special invitation, they are <hi>ashamed</hi> to come to Christ; they reason thus, <hi>if my case were an ordinary man's,</hi> I should come; but I am so <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>wretched,</hi> that I am <hi>ashamed</hi> to come; my sins have been so <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and so <hi>heavy,</hi> that I am not able to bear so great <hi>a weight</hi>; they are <hi>more in number than the hairs of my head</hi>; and yet farther, alas they are <hi>crying</hi> ones to. But hearken, here's a second word; Dost thou think thy case more heavy, because thou art out of <hi>measure sinful.</hi> Lo, it pleaseth God to send thee a special <hi>invitation,</hi> who findest thy self discouraged with the <hi>great bulk</hi> and <hi>burthen</hi> of thy sins. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. Though all apply it not to this use, <hi>Come unto me all you that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</hi> You, of all others, are they that Christ looks for. Those that can walk bolt upright in their sins, that desire to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>die</hi> in them, they will not <hi>look upon me,</hi> and I <hi>will not look upon them</hi>; they <hi>scorn</hi> me, and I <hi>scorn</hi> them: but you, that are <hi>heavy laden,</hi> and feel the <hi>burthen</hi> of your <hi>sins,</hi> are invited by Christ. Let not Satan then couzen you of the comfort of this word; that which Christ makes the <hi>latch</hi> to open the door to <hi>let himself in,</hi> we do usually (by our foolishness) make the <hi>bolt</hi> to <hi>shut him out.</hi> Let thy wound be never so great, thou hast a warrant to come, and be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: be of good comfort then, as it was said to blind <hi>Bartimeus, Mar.</hi> 10.49. So it is to thee; <hi>Loe, he calleth thee.</hi> When Christ <hi>bids</hi> thee come, and gives thee his Word, that he will <hi>heal</hi> thee, <hi>Come,</hi> let not the Devil, or thy <hi>corruptions</hi> hinder thee, or make thee <hi>stay back</hi>; haste thee to this <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>Refuge,</hi> he hath engaged his Word for thee, and he will ease thee. But now, after all these there is a</p>
                     <p>Third Word, that though Christ keeps open house, so that who will, may freely come; and though he sends special invitations to them, that are most <hi>bashful,</hi> because their <hi>case</hi> is <hi>extraordinary:</hi> What do you think now, that Christ will come with his Soldiers, and destroy those that do not come in? He might do it, when he is so <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>invites</hi> thee, and thou turnest it back again into his hand: But yet here is another word of <hi>comfort,</hi> Christ doth not only send a Messenger to <hi>invite</hi> thee, who hast no goodness in thee, <hi>but he falls to beseeching and intreating thee</hi>; and that is a <hi>third word,</hi> whereby faith is wrought in an Unbeliever; 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5.10. <hi>Now then we are Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us</hi>; observe the place, <hi>We pray you in Christ's stead be reconciled unto God.</hi> This is the most admirable
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99037:53"/>
word that ever could be spoken unto a sinner. Alas! thou mayest say, I am afraid that God will not be friends with me; why? he would have thee to be friends with him: do not then, with the Papists, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Will the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists tell me, I am bold if I go to God, or lay hands on Christ? I am not more <hi>bold</hi> than <hi>welcome; Let us go with boldness to the Throne of grace,</hi> vers. 16. We are <hi>commanded</hi> to it. Do not think but that he had bowels to weep over <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and he carried the same into heaven; when thou liest <hi>groaning</hi> before him, he will not <hi>spurn</hi> thee. <hi>We pray you, and beseech you to be friends</hi>; therefore in this case make no doubt, it is God's good pleasure to <hi>entreat thee,</hi> and therefore thou hast <hi>warrant</hi> enough. Christ wept over <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and he is as ready to embrace thee. You have now three words to make a man of an <hi>Vnbeliever,</hi> a <hi>Believer:</hi> Is there, or can there be more than these; <hi>Open House-keeping, Special Invitations, Entreaties and Beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</hi> Yet there is more than all this; which if thou hast not a heart of <hi>stone,</hi> it will make thee <hi>believe,</hi> or make thee <hi>rue</hi> it. And that is,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. When God seeth all these things will not work with us, but we are <hi>slow of heart</hi> to believe, then he quickens us; and there comes a word of <hi>Command. God chargeth, and commands thee to come</hi>; and then if thou breakest his Command, be it to thy peril: It is the greatest sin, that can be committed.

Of all sins, this was the most notorious; this makes us keep all other sins in possession: It is not only one <hi>particular sin,</hi> but it <hi>fastens</hi> all other sins upon us, be they never so many. When faith comes, it will <hi>out them,</hi> but till then they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main <hi>in</hi> thee; where there is no Commandment, there is no sin. How could it be a sin in not believing, if I were not commanded so to do: But you shall hear more than so. When the Apostle speaks of excluding Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing under the Law; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.37. <hi>Where is boasting, then, saith he? it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: By what Law, by the Law of works?

There is a full testimony of this; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>And this is the Commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ.</hi> If a man should ask, may I love my Neighbour? would you not think him a fool? because he must do it, he is commanded. So should a poor soul come, and say to me, <hi>may I believe?</hi> thou fool, thou must <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> God hath laid a Command upon thee, it is not left to thy <hi>choice:</hi> The same Commandment that bids thee <hi>love</hi> thy brother, bids thee to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> on Christ. To Entreaty is added God's Command; and therefore, if thou shalt argue, what <hi>warrant</hi> have I to <hi>believe?</hi> Why, God <hi>enjoyns</hi> it thee, and <hi>commands</hi> it. As the impotent man said, so mayest thou; <hi>He that healed me, said unto me, take up thy bed, and walk.</hi> This is the very Key of the Gospel, and this is the way to turn it right. When being thus clean naked, we have as it were a <hi>Cable</hi> put in our hands, to <hi>draw</hi> our selves out of this flesh and blood.</p>

So there is grace given us to <hi>receive</hi> him. And as the greatest gift doth not <hi>enrich</hi> a man, unless he <hi>accept</hi> it, and <hi>receive</hi> it; so this is our case, God <hi>offers</hi> his Son unto us, as an <hi>earnest</hi> of his love; if we will not <hi>receive</hi> him, we cannot be the better for him: If we <hi>refuse</hi> him, and turn Gods <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi> which he offers us, back upon his hand, then Gods <hi>storms,</hi> and his wrath abides on us for evermore. That it is his good pleasure that we should <hi>receive Christ,</hi> it is no doubt, we have his word for it: All the point is, how we may receive him, and that is by <hi>Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in this Text is declared, how Faith is wrought, and that is by the Word of truth; <hi>In whom also you trusted, after you had heard the Word of Truth.</hi> Now after this Faith, there cometh a sealing by the Spirit of God; <hi>In whom also, after you believed, you were sealed by the Holy Spirit of Promise.</hi> Now lest a man should through <hi>ignorance,</hi> and indiscretion, be <hi>misled</hi> and <hi>deceived,</hi> there is <hi>faith,</hi> and there is <hi>feeling.</hi> Where this is not feeling I mean, I say not, that there is no faith; No: For <hi>feeling</hi> is an after thing, and comes after <hi>Faith.</hi> If we have <hi>Faith,</hi> we live by it; <hi>But after you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, you were sealed.</hi> You see then Faith is that, whereby we receive Jesus Christ, <hi>and to as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the Sons of God, to as many as believe on his name.</hi> The blood of Christ is that which <hi>cureth</hi> our souls, but (as I told you) it is by <hi>application.</hi> A Medicine heals not by being <hi>prepared,</hi> but being <hi>applied:</hi> So the blood of Christ shed for us, unless <hi>applied</hi> to us, doth us no good. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. Its called <hi>the blood of sprinkling</hi>: and that in the 51. <hi>Psalm,</hi> hath relation to it, where he saith, <hi>Purge me with hysop.</hi> In the Passover there was <hi>blood to be</hi> shed, not to be <hi>spilt, but to be shed:</hi> And then to be gathered up again, and put into a Basin, and when they had so done, they were to take a bunch of Hysop and <hi>dip</hi> and <hi>sprinkle, &amp;c.</hi> Faith is this bunch of Hysop that dips it self as it were into the Basin of Christs blood, and our souls are <hi>purged</hi> by being <hi>sprinkled</hi> with it. In <hi>Levit.</hi> 14.6. There was a bird to escape alive; but see the preparation for it, <hi>You shall take it, and the scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99037:54"/>
and the Cedar wood, and the Hysop, and shall dip them, and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And then you shall sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle on him, that is to be cleansed from the leprosie seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.</hi> We are thus <hi>let loose, cleansed</hi> and <hi>freed</hi>; but how? Not unless we are <hi>dipt,</hi> as the <hi>living</hi> bird was in the blood of the <hi>dead</hi> bird, there is no <hi>esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> unless we are <hi>dipt in the blood of Christ Jesus, this dead bird,</hi> and <hi>sprinkled</hi> with this <hi>Hysop,</hi> we cannot be freed.</p>
                     <p>So that now to come to that great matter, without which Christ profiteth us nothing, which is <hi>Faith.</hi> The <hi>Well</hi> is <hi>deep,</hi> and this is the <hi>Bucket</hi> with which we must <hi>draw.</hi> This is the hand by which we must put on Christ; <hi>As many as are baptized put on Christ: Galat.</hi> 3.27. Thus must we be made ready: We must be thus cloathed upon, and by this hand <hi>attire</hi> our selves with the Sun of <hi>Righteousness. Malac.</hi> 4.2. Wherefore I declared unto you that this Faith must not be a <hi>bare conceipt,</hi> floating in the brain; not a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of our own. The Devil taking hold on this, would soon lead a man into a <hi>fools Paradise.</hi> To say I am Gods Child, and sure I shall be saved, I am perswaded so: this the Devil would say Amen to, and would be glad to rock men <hi>asleep</hi> in such <hi>conceipts.</hi> Such are like the foolish Virgins, <hi>That went to buy oyl for their Lamps</hi>; And were perswaded they should come soon enouoh to enter with the Bride-groom; but their perswasion was groundless, and they were shut out. So such <hi>groundless perswasions</hi> and <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances</hi> in a mans soul, that he is the <hi>child of God,</hi> and shall go to Heaven, is not <hi>Faith</hi>; thou mayst carry this assurance to Hell with thee: This Faith is not Faith; <hi>For faith comes by hearing,</hi> and that not of every word or fancy, but by hearing the <hi>Word of Truth.</hi> Faith must not go a <hi>jot</hi> further then the <hi>Word</hi> of God goeth. If thou hast an <hi>apprehension,</hi> but no <hi>warrant</hi> for it out of the Word of God, it is not faith, for its said, <hi>After you heard the</hi> Word <hi>of Truth you believed.</hi> So that we must have some ground for it out of the Word of Truth, otherwise it is <hi>presumption, meer conceipts, fancy,</hi> and not <hi>Faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now I shew'd unto you the last time how this might be; for while a man is an <hi>Vnbeliever,</hi> he is wholly <hi>defiled</hi> with sin, he is in a most loathsom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; he is in his <hi>blood, filthy,</hi> and no eye <hi>pities</hi> him. And may one fasten comfort on one in such a <hi>condition,</hi> on a <hi>dead man</hi>? And this I shew'd you was our <hi>case:</hi> When Faith comes to us, it finds no good thing in us it finds us <hi>stark naked,</hi> and <hi>stark nought:</hi> yet there is a Word for all this to draw us unto Christ, from that miserable <hi>Ocean</hi> in which we are <hi>swimming</hi> unto perdition, if God <hi>catch</hi> us not in his <hi>Net.</hi> Hearken we therefore to Gods <hi>Call</hi>: There is such a thing as this <hi>Calling.</hi> God calls thee and would <hi>change</hi> thy <hi>condition,</hi> and therefore <hi>offers</hi> thee his Son. Wilt thou <hi>have</hi> my <hi>Son</hi>? Wilt thou <hi>yield</hi> unto <hi>me</hi>? Wilt thou be <hi>reconciled</hi> unto <hi>me</hi>? Wilt thou <hi>come</hi> unto <hi>me</hi>? And this may be preacht to the veriest <hi>Rebel</hi> that is. It is the only Word whereby faith is wrought. It is not by <hi>finding</hi> such and such things in us before hand, No, God finds us as <hi>bad</hi> as <hi>bad</hi> may be, when he proffers Christ unto us. He finds us <hi>ugly</hi> and <hi>filthy,</hi> and afterwards <hi>washes</hi> us, and makes us <hi>good.</hi> It is not because I found this or that good thing in thee, that I give thee interest in my Son, take it not on this ground. No he <hi>loved</hi> us first, and when we were <hi>defiled,</hi> he <hi>washt</hi> us from our sins in his own blood, <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <list>
                        <item>1. Of <hi>Commiseration.</hi>

                        <item>2. Of <hi>Complacency.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>That of <hi>Commiseration,</hi> is a fruit of love which <hi>tenders</hi> and <hi>pities</hi> the <hi>miserable estate</hi> of another.</p>
                     <p>But now there is another love of <hi>Complacency,</hi> which ariseth from a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99037:55"/>
between the <hi>qualities</hi> and <hi>manners</hi> of persons: for <hi>like will to like</hi>: and this love God never hath but to his <hi>Saints</hi> after <hi>Conversion,</hi> when they have his Image <hi>enstamped</hi> in them, and are <hi>reformed</hi> in their <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> and Wills, resembling him in both, then, and not till then bears he this love towards them. Before, he loves them with the love of pity: and so God lov'd the World, that is, with the love of Commiseration, that he sent his only Son, that whosoever believed in him might not perish, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life. And therefore he said in the Prophet <hi>Isaiah. In his Love and in his pity he redeemed them.</hi> chap. 63. ver. 9.</p>
                     <p>Now we come to the point of <hi>Acceptation:</hi> The Word is free, and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires nothing but what may consist with the freest gift that may be given. Although here be something that a man may startle at.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>Is there not required a condition of faith, and a condition of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Neither of these according to our common Understanding, do hinder the <hi>fulness</hi> and <hi>freedom</hi> of the <hi>Grace</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Not Faith, because Faith is such a condition, as requires only an <hi>emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand</hi> to receive a gift freely given. Now doth that hinder the <hi>freeness</hi> of the <hi>gift,</hi> to say, you must take it? Why, this is requisite to the freest gift that can be given. If a man would give something to a Begger, if he would not <hi>reach</hi> out his hand and <hi>take</hi> it, let him go without it, its a free gift still; so that the condition of Faith is such a condition as requires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but an <hi>empty hand,</hi> to receive Christ.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Obedience hinders it not. I am required, may some say, to be a <hi>new man, a new Creature,</hi> to lead a new life: I must alter my course: And is not this a great <hi>clog</hi> and <hi>burthen?</hi> And do you account this free? When I must <hi>crucifie lusts, mortifie Passions, &amp;c.</hi> Is this free, when a man must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his own <hi>Will?</hi> Yes; It is as free, as free may be; as a I shewed you the last time. The very <hi>touching,</hi> and accepting of Christ implies an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negation</hi> of former sinfulness, and a going off from other <hi>courses</hi> that are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to him. If the King give a pardon to a <hi>notorious Rebel</hi> for <hi>Treason,</hi> so that now he must live obedient as a Subject, the King need not in regard of himself to have given the pardon; if he give it, it takes not from its <hi>freeness,</hi> that he must live like a <hi>Subject</hi> afterwards; the very <hi>acceptance</hi> of the <hi>pardon</hi> implies it.</p>
                     <p>But now to declare <hi>Faith,</hi> and to open the <hi>Mystery</hi> thereof. Faith is a <hi>great thing</hi>: It is our <hi>life</hi>; our <hi>life</hi> stands in the practice of it: That as in the offering of Christ for us, there is given him a name above every name, <hi>That at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow</hi>: As, I say, in the <hi>purchasing</hi> of <hi>Redemption,</hi> so in the point of <hi>acceptation</hi>; God hath given unto this poor vertue of <hi>faith</hi> a <hi>name</hi> above all <hi>names. Faith</hi> indeed, as it is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>mean,</hi> and comes far short of <hi>love:</hi> and therefore by the Apostle, <hi>love</hi> is many degrees preferr'd before <hi>faith,</hi> because love fills the heart, and faith is but a bare hand, it lets all things <hi>fall,</hi> that it may <hi>fill</hi> it self with Christ. Its said of the Virgin <hi>Mary, That God did respect the low estate of his hand-maid</hi>: So God respects the <hi>low estate</hi> of Faith, that nothing is required, but a <hi>bare empty hand,</hi> which hath <hi>nothing</hi> to bring with it, though it be never so weak, yet if it have a hand to receive, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>a like precious faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. that of the <hi>poorest Believer,</hi> and the <hi>greatest Saint.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that we may come unto the point, without any more going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. In the words read, there is the point of <hi>faith,</hi> and a thing God confirms it withal, <hi>a seal: In whom also after that you believed, you were sealed.</hi> Faith is of it a self a thing unsealed: The sealing with the <hi>holy Spirit of Promise</hi> is a point beyond <hi>faith</hi>; its a point of feeling, and not only of believing of Gods Word, but a <hi>sensible feeling</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi>: A
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99037:55"/>
believing in my soul, accompanied with <hi>joy unspeakable,</hi> and <hi>full</hi> of <hi>glory:</hi> of which sealing we shall speak more hereafter. Observe for the first.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The Object of it, In whom you trusted.</hi> We speak of Faith now as it <hi>justifies,</hi> as it apprehends <hi>Christ</hi> for its <hi>Object:</hi> for otherwise <hi>Faith</hi> hath as <hi>large</hi> an <hi>Extent</hi> as all Gods Word. Faith hath a <hi>hand</hi> to receive, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God hath a <hi>mouth</hi> to speak. What is the Object? <hi>He in whom you trusted.</hi> It is a wonder to see how many are deceived, who make the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness</hi> of <hi>sins</hi> to be the proper <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>faith.</hi> A man may call, as long as he lives, for <hi>forgiveness</hi> of <hi>sins,</hi> yet, unless there be the first <hi>Act,</hi> to lay hold on Christ, in vain doth he expect <hi>forgiveness</hi> of sins. Until thou dost accept Christ for thy <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> thou hast no <hi>promise.</hi> We are never <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Promise,</hi> till we are found in him. The <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> Object of Faith is, first Christ, and then God the Father by him: For <hi>Faith</hi> must have <hi>Christ</hi> for its <hi>Object.</hi> I must believe in none else but <hi>God, in,</hi> and <hi>through Christ.</hi> Now that this is so, we may see in that famous place. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. When he had spoken of the precious blood of Christ, <hi>the Lamb without blemish,</hi> he goes on, and shews, <hi>that he was manifested in those last times, for you, who by him do believe in God, that raised up Christ from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God.</hi> There is no <hi>true believing</hi> in God the Father, but by the <hi>Son.</hi> The proper <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> and he that doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or hope, or trust in any thing else, there is <hi>Idolatry</hi> in it; we believe in God by him: so that the <hi>primary Object of Faith</hi> is Christ. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Ye are all the Children of God by Faith in Jesus Christ.</hi> What's my Faith then? If thou wilt be the Child of God, <hi>receive, hold</hi> Christ Jesus, accept him for thy <hi>Saviour,</hi> and for thy <hi>Lord:</hi> He is the proper Object of thy Faith. Again, you must have <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and <hi>him crucified,</hi> that should be the highest knowledge in our account. <hi>To know Christ, and him crucified,</hi> and by it to accept him. Hereupon the <hi>Apostle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> when he speaks of faith, makes the <hi>Object of</hi> it <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ crucified. Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood; to declare his Righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of God.</hi> Whatsoever then thou findest in Christ, is an <hi>Object of</hi> thy <hi>Faith. John</hi> 6. The point is, <hi>He who eats my fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> with <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. for its worth comparing. We are said to be <hi>justified by his blood,</hi> Rom. 5.9. <hi>By faith in his blood, Rom.</hi> 3.25. Now both these come to one, and they <hi>resolve</hi> the point, and <hi>clear</hi> the Question, whether Faith in it self, as a <hi>Vertue</hi> doth <hi>justifie,</hi> or in respect of its <hi>Object</hi>? surely its in respect of the <hi>Object.</hi> You that have skill in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> know, that heat, if considered as a quality, its <hi>effects</hi> are not so great; but considered as an <hi>instrument,</hi> it transcends the <hi>sphere</hi> of its own <hi>activity</hi>; it doth <hi>wonders</hi>; for its the <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>generation,</hi> and many other <hi>strange effects.</hi> So here, take <hi>faith</hi> as a <hi>Vertue,</hi> and its far short of <hi>love:</hi> but consider it as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, whereby Christ is applyed, and it transcends, it works wonders, beyond its <hi>proper sphere</hi>: for the meanest thing it <hi>layes hold</hi> on, is the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God. He that hath the Son, hath life,</hi> &amp;c. Some would think this an hard kind of speech, when we are justified by faith, we are justified by Christ, apprehended by faith: and yet that place is <hi>clear,</hi> to be <hi>justified</hi> by his <hi>blood:</hi> And <hi>faith</hi> in his <hi>blood</hi> becomes one faith. As if a man should say, I was cured by going to the Bath: So faith comes unto Christ; faith is the legs. A man is not said properly to be <hi>cured,</hi> by <hi>going</hi> to the <hi>Bath,</hi> nor justified by <hi>coming</hi> to Christ by the legs of faith: but the <hi>apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>Bath,</hi> the <hi>coming</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>applying</hi> of his vertue, to make
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99037:56"/>
him the <hi>Object</hi> of my faith, this is the way to be <hi>justified.</hi> As it is not the <hi>making</hi> and <hi>preparing</hi> of a plaister, that <hi>cures,</hi> but the <hi>applying</hi> it; so that this concludes this point, that the true Object of faith is <hi>Christ crucified,</hi> and <hi>God the Father in,</hi> and <hi>by</hi> him. Here then is the point, thou must not look for any comfort in faith, till thou hast Christ; and to think thou shalt ever have any benefit by God, till thou Christ, thou <hi>deceivest</hi> thy self. It is impossible for a man to receive <hi>nourishment</hi> by his <hi>beead</hi> and <hi>drink,</hi> till he partake of it in the <hi>substance:</hi> so thou must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Christ, before thou canst receive any nourishment by him. Christ saith not thou must have forgiveness of sins, or thou must have my Fathers favour, but <hi>take my body</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> take <hi>me crucified.</hi> Buy the <hi>field,</hi> and the <hi>treasure</hi> is thine: but thou hast nothing to do with the <hi>treasure,</hi> till thou gettest the <hi>field.</hi> This is preferment enough, to have the Lords Promise to <hi>Abraham, I am thy exceeding great reward: I am my well-beloveds, and my well-beloved is mine.</hi> There is a spiritual <hi>match</hi> betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>thee:</hi> There are many, who are matcht with Christ, and yet know not how rich they are: When a man reckons of what he shall get by Christ only, when all his thoughts are on that, he marrieth the portion, and not the person: thou must set thy love on Christs <hi>person,</hi> and then having <hi>him,</hi> all that he hath is <hi>thine:</hi> How rich Christ is, so rich art thou: he must first be thine. <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life,</hi> but the Son must first be had. Is there any now in this congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, who is so <hi>hardhearted,</hi> as to refuse such a <hi>gift</hi> as <hi>this?</hi> When God shall give thee his Son, if thou wilt take him, is there any so <hi>prophane,</hi> as with <hi>Esau</hi> to sell his birthright, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To pursue the <hi>poor pedling</hi> things of this life, and refuse <hi>salvation,</hi> so high a gift? A <hi>gift</hi> which is not given to <hi>Angels,</hi> they think it an honour, to wait at the <hi>Lords Table</hi>: They have not this <hi>precious food</hi> given to them; they never tast it: and therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Christians, on serious consideration would not change their <hi>estate</hi> for the <hi>estate</hi> of Angels. Why? Because hereby Christ is my <hi>Husband,</hi> I am wedded to him, he is <hi>bone</hi> of my <hi>bone,</hi> and <hi>flesh</hi> of my <hi>flesh</hi> which privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Angels</hi> are not capable of. Our <hi>nature</hi> is advanced above the <hi>Angelical nature: for we shall sit and judge the world with Christ, judge the twelve Tribes of Israel:</hi> And what an <hi>high preferment</hi> is this? Nay, observe this, and take it for a <hi>Rule.</hi> Never beg of God pardon for thy sins, till thou hast done this one thing, namely, <hi>accepted</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> from Gods hands. For thou ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We come now to declare;</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Acts of faith what they are, and there is some intricacy in that too: There is much ado made in what <hi>part,</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of the soul <hi>faith</hi> is: We must not proportionate the <hi>Act</hi> of faith according to our own fancy. For it's no faith, but as it hath relation to the Word: now look, how is the Word presented: <hi>After you heard the Word of Truth, the Gospel of your salvation.</hi> Now the word is presented under a double respect.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Its presented <hi>Sub ratione veri; After you had heard the Word of Truth</hi>; and there comes in the <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Then <hi>Sub ratione boni,</hi> as a good word, that so we should lay hold on it, and here comes in <hi>the Will.</hi> For the Will, we say, challenges that which is good, for its Object: Now the <hi>Gospel</hi> of <hi>salvation</hi> is a <hi>good Word; its glad tydings worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the World to save sinners.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. And now as the <hi>Word</hi> is presented, as a <hi>good Word,</hi> so must my Act of faith be answerable unto it. See in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. The act of faith answering hereto, <hi>These all dyed in faith, not having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Promises.</hi> What did their faith to them? It made them <hi>see the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99037:56"/>
Promises afar off, and they were perswaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims in the earth.</hi> So that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring place with place, it appears that first this Gospel was presented <hi>as the word of Truth, they were perswaded of it.</hi> It is the first Act of Faith, <hi>to perswade men of the truth of the Word:</hi> and then, as it is a <hi>good word, they embraced it:</hi> These are the two arms of faith; <hi>as true, it perswades me; as good, I embrace it.</hi> We must not now be too curious in bringing in <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Disputes,</hi> whether one Vertue may reside in two <hi>Faculties</hi>; whether Faith may reside in the Understanding, and the Will. The truth is, these things are not yet agreed upon; and shall we trouble our selves with things not yet decided in the <hi>Schools,</hi> as, whether the <hi>practical Vnderstanding</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> be distinct faculties or no? The Word of God requires that I should believe with my <hi>whole heart</hi>; Act. 8.37. <hi>As</hi> Philip <hi>told the Eunuch, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest.</hi> If with the <hi>heart</hi>; but with what faculties may you say? Why, I tell thee, believe with thy <hi>whole heart:</hi> And what! shall I piece and divide the heart, when the whole is required? Now, to come to those two: The Word is presented,

which was the Antecedent, must be in the conclusion; therefore our <hi>faith</hi> is a <hi>relying</hi> on God: and so in this place this trust is made the same with faith, as it is in the Text, <hi>in whom you trusted, after you had received the word of Truth:</hi> for our <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>belief</hi> there is the self same word, — <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium ne crede colori:</hi> this (<hi>Credo</hi>) is to have a great confidence in fleeting and fading things; and so it is in justifying faith, <hi>With respect to the unsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken truths of the incorruptible and unchangeable Word of his, which liveth and abideth for ever,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.23. If I have a <hi>knowledge</hi> of God, and <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment</hi> of him, and from my <hi>knowing,</hi> my <hi>will</hi> is conformed to <hi>accept</hi> Christ; and if when I have <hi>accepted</hi> him, I will not <hi>part</hi> from him: <hi>this</hi> is <hi>faith,</hi> and if thou hast <hi>this faith,</hi> thou wilt never perish.

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Not so <hi>easie a matter</hi> as you guess it to be. It were easie indeed, were there nothing but saying the word to make <hi>man</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi>; there are <hi>terms</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> to be agreed upon. God casts not his Son away, he looks there shall be <hi>conditions</hi> on thy side; he must be thy <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Head,</hi> if thou wilt have him to be thy <hi>husband.</hi> But what shall I get by him then, saith the wife? Get? there is no end of thy getting. <hi>All is thine, Paul, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos, Cephas, Life.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou art Christ's, and Christ is God's,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.22, 23. Every man will take Christ thus for the better; but there is somewhat else in the match. If thou wilt have him, thou must take him for <hi>better,</hi> for <hi>worse,</hi> for <hi>richer,</hi> for <hi>poorer.</hi> Indeed there are precious things provided for you; <hi>It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 12.32. Rom. 8.17. You shall be <hi>Heirs with Christ,</hi> but for the present, while you are in the Church <hi>Militant,</hi> you must take <hi>up</hi> your <hi>Cross</hi>; you must not look for great things in this world: In <hi>this world</hi> you must have <hi>tribulation,</hi> you must <hi>deny</hi> your <hi>selves,</hi> and your own <hi>Wills.</hi> What? would you have Christ the wife, and you the husband? No, if you think so, you mistake the match. Christ must be the <hi>Husband</hi> and the <hi>Head</hi>; and as the wife promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to obey her husband, to stick to her husband in <hi>sickness</hi> and in <hi>health,</hi> and to <hi>forsake</hi> all <hi>others</hi>; so Christ asketh, wilt thou have me? if thou wilt, thou must take me on these <hi>terms,</hi> thou must take my <hi>Cross</hi> with me, thou must <hi>deny</hi> thine own <hi>Will</hi>; yea, it may be thine own <hi>life</hi> also. Let a Christian consider all these things, these are the words, and these are the benefits, and then compare them together; and then if he can say, <hi>I will have Christ how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> for I shall be a saver by him: I will take him with all faults, and I know I shall make a <hi>good bargain,</hi> therefore I will have him on <hi>any terms,</hi> come what will; when a man can have his will so <hi>perpendicularly</hi> bent on Christ, that he will have him, though he leave his skin behind him: there is a <hi>true acceptation</hi> of him. We must not here distinguish with the Schools about <hi>Velleities,</hi> a general wishing and woulding, and <hi>true desires</hi> after Christ: Wishers and Woulders never thrive; but there must be resolution to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Christ through <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>thin,</hi> never to part with him: a <hi>direct Will</hi> is here required. And therefore Christ bids us consider before-hand what it will cost us. <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not Father and mother, Wife and Children, and his own life also, he cannot be my Disciple. Luk.</hi> 24.26. Do not think that our Saviour here would discourage men from love. Doth the

                        <hi>love</hi> teach us <hi>hatred?</hi> The phrase in the Hebrew is <hi>loving less,</hi> as it is said; <hi>Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated,</hi> Deut. 21.15. that is, loved less. <hi>If a man hath two wives, one beloved, and the other hated, and they have born Children, both the beloved and the hated:</hi> By <hi>hated</hi> is not meant, that the man <hi>hated</hi> one wife, but <hi>less loved her,</hi> than the other. So <hi>if any man come to me, and hate not father and mother</hi>; that is, if he love not all less than me; and that it is so, we may see it expounded by our Saviour. <hi>Mat</hi> 10.37. <hi>He that loveth father and mother more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> There Christ expounds it. He that will follow Christ in <hi>calm weather</hi> and not in a <hi>storm,</hi> is not worthy of him; <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.28. <hi>Which of you intending to build a Tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?</hi> What is that to the purpose? See <hi>vers.</hi> 33. <hi>So likewise whosoever he be of you, that forsaketh not all that he hath, cannot be my Disciple.</hi> It is a small matter to begin to be a Christian, unless you consider what it will cost you; <hi>Do you think it a small matter to be a King's Son?</hi> 1 Sam. 18.23. think not on so great a business without consideration what it will <hi>cost</hi> you. It will be the <hi>denying</hi> of your own <hi>wills.</hi> You must be content to follow <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> Christ <hi>nakedly</hi>; follow him in his <hi>persecution</hi> and <hi>tribulation,</hi> in his death and suffering, if thou wilt be conformable to him in glory. When this <hi>case</hi> comes, it makes many <hi>draw back,</hi> as the rich man in the Gospel, when he must <hi>forsake all,</hi> he <hi>drew back.</hi> When troubles arise, many are offended; so when it comes to a point of parting, they go back.</p>
                     <p>Now we come to speak one word of <hi>the sealing of the Text. After that ye believed, ye were sealed with the holy Spirit of Promise.</hi> This <hi>sealing,</hi> which is a point of <hi>feeling,</hi> is a distinct thing of it self from faith; no part of faith. If I have <hi>faith,</hi> I am sure of life, though I never have the other: these are two seals. We put to our seals to the counter-part that is drawn betwixt God and us.</p>
                     <p>The first <hi>seal is our faith.</hi> I have nothing but God's Word, and indeed I have no <hi>feeling,</hi> yet I venture my salvation, and trust God upon his bare Word. I will <hi>pawn</hi> all upon it; <hi>He that hath received his testimony; that is, (in effect) he that believeth,</hi> saith <hi>John, hath set to his seal that God is true,</hi> Joh. 3.33. If men <hi>doubt,</hi> and <hi>trust</hi> God no further than they <hi>see</hi> him, it is not faith. But when God gives me a good word, though I am in as much distress as ever, yet I <hi>trust,</hi> though it be <hi>contrary</hi> to all <hi>sense,</hi> or outward <hi>seeming,</hi> yet I <hi>put to my seal,</hi> and <hi>trust</hi> him still.</p>
                     <p>Then comes God's counter-part. God being thus honoured, that I <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> his <hi>Word,</hi> though contrary to all <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>feeling,</hi> even his <hi>bare Word</hi>; then God sets to his seal, and now <hi>the Word comes to particularizing.</hi> Before it was in general, now it comes and singles out a man, <hi>Say thou unto my soul, that I am thy salvation,</hi> Psal. 35.3. that is, as I did apply the generality of God's Word unto mine own case to bear me up against <hi>sense,</hi> and <hi>feeling:</hi> then comes the Spirit of God, and not only delivers generalities, but saith unto my soul, <hi>I am thy salvation.</hi> This is called in Scripture a manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when God manifests himself unto us; as in <hi>Isa.</hi> 60.16. <hi>Thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of Kings, and thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer,</hi> &amp;c. that is, when we have made <hi>particular application</hi> by Faith, God will put to <hi>his seal,</hi> that I shall know, that God is my <hi>strength</hi> and my <hi>salvation:</hi> I shall know it; <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will manifest my self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</hi> Christ comes, and draws the Curtains, and looks on with the <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aspect</hi> of his <hi>blessed countenance.</hi> When this comes, it chears the heart, and then there are secret <hi>love-tokens</hi> pass betwixt Christ and his beloved. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows, save he that receives it</hi>; that is, there is a particular intimation that I

                     <p>Now consider, sure there is such a thing as <hi>this joy,</hi> or else do you think the Scripture would talk of it, and of the Comforter, the Holy Ghost, <hi>by whom we know the things that are freely given us of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.12. There is a <hi>generation</hi> in the world, that hath this joy, though you that know it not, do not, nor cannot believe it; there is a <hi>righteous generation</hi> that have it: and why dost thou not try to get it? do as they do, and thou mayest obtain it likewise; <hi>The secrets of the Lord are revealed to them that fear him, and he will shew them his Covenant,</hi> Psal. 25.14. These are <hi>hidden comforts</hi>; do you think God will give this joy to those that care not for him? No, the way is to <hi>seek</hi> God, and to <hi>labour</hi> to <hi>fear him.</hi> The secrets of the <hi>Lord are revealed to such, and such only as fear him</hi>; do as they do, and follow their example, and thou mayest have it likewise.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>Many have served Christ long, and have not sound it.</hi>

                        <hi>Sol.</hi> It is long of themselves; you are straitned in your own bowels, or else, <hi>Open your mouths wide, and God will fill them.</hi> No wonder that we are so <hi>barren</hi> of these comforts, when we be <hi>straitned</hi> in our selves. There is a thing wondrously wanting amongst us, and that is <hi>Meditation.</hi> If we could give our selves to it, and go up with <hi>Moses</hi> to the Mount, to confer with God, and seriously think of the <hi>price of Christ's death,</hi> and of the <hi>joys</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Privileges</hi> of a <hi>Christian</hi>; if we could frequently medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on these, we should have these <hi>sealing</hi> comforts every day, at least <hi>oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> This hath need to be much pressed upon us; the neglect of this makes <hi>lean</hi> souls. He that is frequent in that, hath these sealing days often. Couldst thou have a <hi>parley</hi> with God in private, and have thy heart rejoyce with the comforts of another day; even whilst thou art thinking of these things, Christ would be in the <hi>midst</hi> of thee. Many of the Saints of God have but little of this, because they spend but few hours in Meditation. And thus, as this hour would give leave, have we proceeded in this point.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>These signs are for the strengthning of our faith,</hi> and therefore it is considered, as a seal. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Abraham received the sign of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, as a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had, yet being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised.</hi> It helps our <hi>understanding</hi> by being a sign, and is a <hi>confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> a <hi>seal</hi>: by vertue whereof Chrlst is passed, and made over to us, so that we have as true an <hi>interest</hi> and <hi>right</hi> to him, as to our <hi>meat,</hi> and <hi>drink:</hi> yea, he becomes as effectually ours, for every purpose in our <hi>spiritual life,</hi> as our <hi>meat and drink</hi> doth for our <hi>corporal.</hi> To which end these Elements are changed spiritually in their natures; not in <hi>substance</hi> but in <hi>use</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that which was but now a <hi>common bread,</hi> becomes as far different as <hi>Heaven</hi> is from <hi>earth,</hi> being <hi>altered in its use.</hi> For instance, the wax whereby the King passes over an inheritance to us, and by which conveyances of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states are made, that wax is but as another piece of wax differing nothing from that which is in the shop, till the King hath <hi>stampt</hi> it with his <hi>Seal</hi>: But being once <hi>sealed,</hi> one would not give it for all the wax in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for now it serves to another use; so is it here in these <hi>elements</hi>; but still know, the difference is not in the <hi>matter, or substance,</hi> but in the use. And this is the reason why this blessed <hi>bread,</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> is termed a <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> namely, because it is an instrument whereby Christ <hi>inflates</hi> me into himself, and whereby I have <hi>fellowship,</hi> and <hi>communion</hi> with him.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. A <hi>sin. If any man shall presume to eat that bread, or drink that cup unworthily.</hi> Its a dangerous thing, a great sin to eat and drink at the Lords Table in an <hi>unworthy manner.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>A punishment.

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>A reason, because he discerns not the Lords body,</hi> but takes them as <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things,</hi> deeming the elements not different from the bread and wine which we have at our Tables, not knowing that they are the <hi>dishes</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Christ is <hi>served</hi> in unto us, that by these the <hi>greatest gift</hi> is given us, and nourishment conveyed, for the maintenance of our <hi>spiritual life.</hi> This <hi>life</hi> was given us in <hi>baptism,</hi> but <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> these signs is conveyed <hi>spiritual nourishment</hi> for the continuance and maintenance of it, for the <hi>strengthning</hi> of our faith, and <hi>making</hi> us daily <hi>stronger</hi> and <hi>stronger</hi> to <hi>fight the Lords bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi>: Now, when we discern not this, nor by the eye of faith see Christ Jesus, crucified for us, and by these elements conveyed unto us, but take them <hi>hand over head</hi> without any consideration, we receive them unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and a fearful <hi>indignity</hi> is offered unto Christ, which he will certainly revenge.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99037:59"/>
that he is <hi>worthy</hi> to eat Christs <hi>flesh,</hi> and drink his <hi>blood?</hi> As for bodily food and entertainment, we are unworthy to present them to him; The <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> could say, <hi>I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof</hi>; How then comes this to pass, that he which eats and drinks the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>unworthily,</hi> eats and drinks damnation to himself? If we are not worthy to present <hi>bodily</hi> food unto him; can we be <hi>worthy</hi> to receive <hi>spiritual</hi> food from him?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> But here understand what is set down; <hi>worthiness</hi> is not alwayes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>for a matter of merit, or proportion of worth between the person giving and receiving</hi>; but in Scripture it's often taken for that which is <hi>meet, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and beseeming</hi>; And in this sense the Apostle uses it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.4. <hi>If it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. If it be meet:</hi> The word in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>worthy,</hi> which is here rightly translated <hi>meet</hi>; so in that Sermon of Saint <hi>John Baptist,</hi> Mat. 3.8. <hi>bring forth fruits meet for repentance</hi>; that is, fruits beseeming amendment of life. And in this sense are we said <hi>to walk worthy of God, who hath called us to his Kingdom and glory. Worthy of God,</hi> that is, worthy of that calling God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to us, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.12. And therefore to use the similitude as I have elsewere, If the <hi>King</hi> should vouchsafe to come into a <hi>Subjects</hi> house, and find all things fit and beseeming so great a <hi>Majesty,</hi> that Subject may be said to give the King <hi>worthy entertainment</hi>; not that a <hi>Subject</hi> is <hi>worthy</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain his <hi>Prince</hi>: But the meaning is, he provided all things, which were <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> for the entertainment of him. So is it here: if we prepare our selves with such <hi>spiritual ornaments</hi> to entertain the <hi>King</hi> of glory, as are requisite for those, who approach his Table, though our performances come far short of the <hi>worth</hi> of his presence; yet we may be said to <hi>eat</hi> his <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> his <hi>blood worthily.</hi> When the King in the Gospel had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his feast, two sorts of guests there were, who where <hi>unworthy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Those that made light of the invitation, who had their excuses, when they should come to the feast; One must go to his farm, another to try his Oxen,</hi> &amp;c. Luk. 14.18.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Others there were who came, and yet were unworthy guests, for coming unpreparedly; for in the midst of the feast the King comes in to view his guests, and beholds a man, that did not refuse to come, but yet came without his wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment,</hi> and so came <hi>unworthily</hi> for not coming <hi>preparedly.</hi> Ye see then there may be an <hi>unworthiness</hi> in those that do come, since they come <hi>unfitted</hi> and in a <hi>dress unbeseeming</hi> such a banquet. They are unworthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of the Lords body, and he accounts it an <hi>irreverent usage</hi> of him. In like manner may some say touching the <hi>Ministery</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi>; May not I read a good Sermon at <hi>home</hi> with as much <hi>profit?</hi> What needs all this stir? Why, here's the advantage and priviledge you get in the publick Ministery of the Word: God himself comes down, as a King amongst us, he views his <hi>guests,</hi> and considers, who comes with his <hi>wedding garment,</hi> who comes <hi>preparedly.</hi> Christ comes and looks on us, and <hi>where two or three are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together in his name, there he hath promised to be in the midst of them: Math.</hi> 18.20. <hi>He walks in the midst of the golden Candlesticks</hi>: The <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of</hi> his Word; he takes a special view of those, that <hi>come</hi> and <hi>frequent</hi> his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and is ready ever to <hi>reward</hi> them. You see then what it is to eat <hi>worthily</hi>; its to do it with that <hi>reverence,</hi> that is requisite where the <hi>King</hi> of Heaven is the <hi>Master</hi> of the Feast.

as openly profane ones, in whom it's <hi>high treason,</hi> Being God's <hi>vowed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> to take his <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> and put it to so vile a use: this, I say, deserves <hi>damnation</hi>; but then others there are that have <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> and a portion in Christ, yet coming <hi>unworthily</hi> to this feast, eat <hi>judgment</hi> to themselves: that is a <hi>judgement of chastisement.</hi> There is a twofold judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>One of revenge:</hi> for such a person that puts God's Seal to a <hi>wrong evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> having no faith to make Christ his <hi>portion:</hi> in such a one its <hi>high treason</hi> to put forth his hand to this <hi>tree of life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Another of chastisement,</hi> for such a one as hath <hi>repentance,</hi> and yet comes too <hi>unmannerly,</hi> and carries himself too <hi>carelesly</hi> at the Lord's Table: <hi>at this</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> aims in the Text; not at that <hi>judgment of condemnation,</hi> but at a <hi>judgment</hi> to prevent <hi>damnation</hi>; And this appears in the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, where we shall find the Apostle recounting up the particulars of this judgment of chastisement, <hi>For this cause many are weak, and sickly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and many sleep,</hi> ver. 30. Mark what's the judgment, he eats: why this? he's cast upon his bed of <hi>sickness,</hi> into a Consumption perchance, or some other <hi>corporal disease</hi>; a cause Physicians seldom or never look into: they look to <hi>Agues, Colds,</hi> or the <hi>like</hi>; they never once conjecture that their <hi>unworthy eating</hi> at the Lord's Table, cast them into the disease, and was the principal cause of the <hi>malady.</hi> Nay death it self too often is the punishment of such bold attempts, so that all the <hi>Physicians</hi> in the world cannot cure them, And thus God inflicts temporal judgments to free them from eternal, as appears farther in the 32 ver. <hi>When we are judged, we are chastned of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world,</hi> that is, we undergo a <hi>judgment</hi> of <hi>chastisement,</hi> to prevent the <hi>judgment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:</hi> which though it be a sharp and bitter pill, yet by the mercy of God we eat that whereby damnation is prevented. This <hi>judgment</hi> of <hi>condemnation</hi> is the portion of the profane person, who dares to meddle with that which belongs not to him, against whom <hi>the Angel of the Lord with a flaming sword stands to keep the way of this tree of life.</hi> Those that come that have faith, yet coming <hi>unpreparedly,</hi> they eat <hi>judgment too,</hi> yet by God's mercy it's that, which preserves them from the <hi>damnation</hi> of the <hi>soul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now before I come to the particulars, note how careful God is, that <hi>spiritual exercises</hi> should be <hi>spiritually performed.</hi> He's very angry, when he sees a <hi>spiritual</hi> duty <hi>carnally</hi> undertaken. <hi>For this cause many are sick, &amp;c.</hi> that is, because you that are <hi>believers:</hi> have <hi>faith, repentance,</hi> and a portion in your Saviour come <hi>irreverently,</hi> come <hi>unpreparedly,</hi> perform a <hi>spiritual</hi> work so <hi>carnally.</hi> We have presidents hereof in Scripture: and chiefly two: First, for <hi>circumcision,</hi> Exod. 4.24.

Why? what should he do then? how should the <hi>message</hi> be done, and fulfilled? But what was the reason hereof?

                     <p n="2">2. The next action requisite before my coming to the Sacrament, <hi>is the whetting of my appetite, and preparing of my stomach</hi>; I must come with an <hi>hungry desire,</hi> as a man that comes to his <hi>meat,</hi> that would live and be strong: We think meat very ill bestowed on him, that hath no stomach: Unless we <hi>eat Christs body, and drink his blood, we can have no spiritual life.</hi> All the <hi>question,</hi> and the main <hi>business</hi> is, whether I come <hi>hungry,</hi> &amp; <hi>thirsty,</hi> or not, as an <hi>hungry</hi> and <hi>thirsty</hi> man, with an <hi>Appetite</hi> after his <hi>meat,</hi> and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor</hi>; longing after Christ, <hi>as the Hart after the water brooks.

                        </gap>rs thee his Son, Christ Jesus. Take Christ my Son, <hi>dead,</hi> and <hi>crucified</hi> for thee. Consider, when thou seest the Minister set the bread and wine <hi>apart,</hi> how God from all eternity set <hi>apart</hi> his Son for us: If we have not done this, we must do it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.3. See the manner of the setting apart of the Lamb, which was a type of Christ; <hi>In the tenth day of the month they shall take unto them every man a Lamb, according to the house of their Fathers: This Lamb was to be set apart, and taken out of the flock.</hi> And in the fifth verse, <hi>It must be a lamb without blemish: then you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month. From the tenth day to the fourteenth it was to be kept:</hi> This typified that Lamb of God, that was so set apart. Then was the Lamb to be killed: by whom? <hi>Vers.</hi> 6. by all the <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi> And thus was Christ to be <hi>singled</hi> out, and to be <hi>slain:</hi> Every <hi>mother's son</hi> had a hand in killing this <hi>Lamb</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> He is set apart to suffer for sinners, picked out as a <hi>singled deer</hi>; which being designed to the <hi>game,</hi> the hounds will follow <hi>only,</hi> and no <hi>other.</hi> Thus was Christ hunted to death by <hi>one</hi> sorrow after <hi>another,</hi> till he gave up the Ghost upon the <hi>Cross.</hi> In the Gospel according to St. <hi>John,</hi> we read how the people took <hi>branches of Palm trees, and went forth to meet Christ,</hi> cap. 12.12, 13. and that was the day the Lamb was set apart; and he was so set apart, till the <hi>Jew's Passover.</hi> This concerns me, saith Christ. Christ saw himself typified in the Lamb that was set apart: Observe then on that very day, <hi>Father,</hi> sath he, <hi>Deliver me from that hour.</hi> On that very day in the Lamb he saw himself to be <hi>sacrificed</hi> by <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi> We were all of us actors in the business; not one here, but had a hand in the <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> up of the Son of God, in <hi>killing</hi> Christ Jesus.</p>
                     <p>Thus for these actions of the Minister, the <hi>setting apart</hi> of the <hi>bread</hi> and of the <hi>wine.</hi> Then follows the <hi>breaking of the bread, and the pouring out of the wine.</hi> At the breaking of the bread, consider <hi>Christ's flesh torn asunder,</hi> all the <hi>lashes</hi> which made such <hi>scratches</hi> in his flesh, the <hi>ruptures</hi> which were made by the <hi>nails,</hi> and the <hi>spear</hi> that pierced his <hi>side.</hi> The breaking of him by his Father; the word signifies, crushing him to powder: <hi>God would break him,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>even to powder,</hi> Isa. 53.10. At the <hi>considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> hereof how should our faith be <hi>stirred</hi> and set <hi>awake!</hi> Thou takest God's name in vain, if with a <hi>dull eye</hi> thou canst see things, and not take it to heart.</p>
                     <p>The next action, is <hi>The pouring out of the wine: This is my blood,</hi> saith
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99037:62"/>
Christ, <hi>Drink you all of this.</hi> Dost thou see the <hi>wine poured</hi> out? at that very instant, consider how much <hi>blood</hi> Christ <hi>spilt,</hi> how much he <hi>poured forth:</hi> and that not only in the very time of his passion, when he hung upon the Cross, when the spears pierced his sides, when the nails <hi>bored,</hi> and <hi>digged</hi> his <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>feet</hi>: But that which he shed in the garden in the cold Winter time, when he shed <hi>great drops, great clots</hi> of blood, thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est blood that <hi>pierc'd</hi> his <hi>garment,</hi> and <hi>ran down</hi> upon the ground. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how much blood he lost, when he was <hi>whipped,</hi> and <hi>lashed:</hi> When the <hi>spear</hi> came to the very <hi>Pericardium</hi>; thus let us weigh his torments, and it will be a means to make us much <hi>affected</hi> with his <hi>sufferings</hi> for us.</p>
                     <p>But this is not all, there is another thing yet in the blood: This was but the outward part of his sufferings. Yet some there are, who are against Christ sufferings in his soul; If it were so, say they, then something either in the <hi>sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>old-Testament</hi> or in the <hi>new Testament,</hi> should signifie it. What ever such persons object against it, I am sure there was as much in the sacrifices of the old Testament, as could possibly be in a <hi>Type</hi> to signifie it. Now that I may make this to appear, know that in every sacrifice, there were <hi>two parts,</hi> or two things considerable, and those were the <hi>Body</hi> and the <hi>Blood:</hi> The whole was to be made a sacrifice, <hi>viz.</hi> both <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi>; the <hi>body</hi> was to be <hi>burned,</hi> the <hi>blood</hi> to be poured <hi>forth:</hi> Now nothing in a beast can signifie the <hi>sufferings</hi> of Christ <hi>in soul,</hi> better then the <hi>pouring</hi> out of the <hi>blood. Lev.</hi> 17.11. The blood was the life, and this is that which had a <hi>relation</hi> to the <hi>soul,</hi> and was therefore, as in the same place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, poured out as an <hi>attonement</hi> for the soul. And to this in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayers, there is an allusion, viz. <hi>Grant us gracious Lord so to eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ and to drink his blood, that our sinful bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be made clean by his body, and our souls washed through his most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood.</hi> And in <hi>Isa.</hi> 53.12. The Metaphor holds, <hi>He poured out his soul unto death for us.</hi> So that whatever some have fondly thought, its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and manifest that Christ suffered both in soul and body: Both soul and body were made an offering for sin, in the fashion of sin, who knew no sin. I should have gone further, but the time cuts me off.</p>

                     <p>And now because it is a point of high <hi>moment,</hi> wherein all our <hi>comfort</hi> stands, and in which it lies, I thought good to resume it all again, so far as may concern our practice, that we may see what the work of God's Spirit is from the first to the last, and the conversion of a sinner from the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions and pollutions of the flesh in which he wallowed; and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose have I chosen this place of Scripture, wherein we are encouraged by God's <hi>blessed Word,</hi> that whatever we are, though <hi>accursed,</hi> and the <hi>greatest sinners</hi> in the world; and that whatever we want, we should come to <hi>God's throne of grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And we are to think that whatever sins are or have been committed, and though our sins are never so great, yet that they are not so great as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteness of God's mercy; especially having such, not only an <hi>Intercessor,</hi> but <hi>Advocate</hi> to plead the right of our cause, so that Christ comes, and he pleads <hi>payment</hi>; and that however our debts are <hi>great,</hi> and we run far in <hi>score,</hi> yet he is our <hi>ransome</hi>; and therefore now God's justice being satisfied, why should not his mercy have place and free course? This is the great comfort that a Christian hath, that <hi>he may come freely,</hi> and <hi>boldly to God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he comes but as for an <hi>acquittance</hi> of what is already paid. As a <hi>deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> will appear boldly before his <hi>creditor,</hi> when he knows his debt is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, he will not then be afraid to look him in the face. Now we may come and say, Blessed Father, the <hi>debt</hi> is paid, I pray give me <hi>pardon</hi> of my sins, give me my <hi>acquittance.</hi> And this is that <hi>boldness and access</hi> spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. <hi>In whom we have access by faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that I may not spend too much time needlesly, come we to the ground and matter in the words: Wherein there is

                           <item>1. <hi>A preparative for grace.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. <hi>The act it self whereby we are made partakers of the grace of God.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>First, the preparatives are two, <hi>The Law and the Gospel,</hi> and wrought by them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>first preparative.</hi>
                     </p>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99037:63"/>
by the operative power of the Law convincing us of sin, we are made sensible of our need and deep poverty: This is the first preparative, for a man to be brought to see he stands in <hi>great need</hi> of God's <hi>mercy,</hi> and Christ's <hi>blood</hi>; so that the sinner cries out, Lord, I stand in <hi>great want</hi> of mercy. His eyes being thus opened, he is no longer a stranger at home, but he sees the case is wondrous <hi>hard</hi> with him; so that he concludes, unless God be merciful unto me in Christ, I am <hi>lost</hi> and <hi>undone</hi> for ever. This is the first preparative; and till we come to it, we can never approach the throne of grace. The second is,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Wrought by the Gospel:</hi> I see I stand in <hi>great need</hi>; but by this second preparative we see <hi>a Throne of grace</hi> set up, and that adds comfort unto me: If God had only <hi>a throne and seat of Justice,</hi> I were utterly undone; I see my debt is extremely great; but the <hi>Gospel</hi> reveals unto me, that God of his infinite mercy, hath erected <hi>a Throne of grace, a City of refuge,</hi> that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self in need, my soul may fly unto.</p>
                     <p>And now to fit us for this, God's blessed Spirit works by his Word, to open unto us the rigour and strictness of the Law, and our <hi>wants</hi>; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten our understandings, that we stand in great need; to win our <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and open the Gospel and its <hi>comforts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore, <hi>first, for the time of need:</hi> The Law reveals unto us our <hi>woful condition,</hi> to be born in sin, as the <hi>Pharisee</hi> said, and yet not able to see it. Every man may say in generalities, I am a sinner; yet to say, and know himself to be <hi>such a sinner</hi> as indeed he is, to stand in such need; <hi>that</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do. This one would think to be a matter of sense, but unless God's Spirit open our eyes, we can never see our selves to be such sinners as we are; or else what is the reason that the child of God cries out more against his sin and the weight thereof after his conversion, than he did before? What, are his sins <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>more,</hi> than they were formerly? No, but his <hi>Light</hi> is greater; his eyes are opened, and now he sees more <hi>clearly</hi> what sin is. When the Sun shines, and its rays come in, what a number of <hi>motes</hi> do we discover, which before we saw not? Not as if the Sun-beams made them, or the Sun raised the dust; no, there are here as many <hi>motes,</hi> and as much <hi>dust</hi> flying about, as if the Sun <hi>shined</hi> here: What is the matter then; Why this; the Sun discovers them to us. So that here is the point, Our <hi>sins</hi> in our <hi>souls</hi> are as <hi>motes</hi> in the <hi>air,</hi> and are not more than they were before conversion; but we cannot see them, till the glorious beams of God's Spirit shine upon us. The <hi>sight</hi> of sin, and of the danger that comes by it, is the <hi>work</hi> of God's Spirit. The Spirit discovers sin unto us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. <hi>When the Spirit cometh, he shall convince the world of sin:</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Spirit shall convince them: And the same word is used, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. where Faith is said to be <hi>the evidence of things not seen,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Heretofore we had a slight imagination of our sins; but to have our mouth <hi>stopped,</hi> and to be convinced, is not a work of <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> but of <hi>God's Spirit, Rom.</hi> 3.19. Till we are awakened by his Spirit, we cannot <hi>see,</hi> nor <hi>feel</hi> the <hi>mountains</hi> and <hi>heaps</hi> of sins, that lie upon our souls. Thou art dead in sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Thou art in bondage; and to know it, is a <hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> not of <hi>nature.</hi> The spirit of bondage, what is that? Why, however we are all <hi>bond men,</hi> until the Son hath made us free, in a <hi>woful estate, slaves</hi> to sin and Satan; yet till <hi>God's Spirit</hi> convince us, and shew it us, and make us know it, we shall sleep secure, are not afraid, but think our selves the <hi>freest</hi> men in the world, and see not this to be a <hi>time of need.</hi> This therefore is the first preparative, when God brings his people by Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> Heb. 12.18. <hi>For you are not come unto the Mountain that may be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that burned by fire, nor unto the blackness, and darkness, and tempest:</hi> so <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.25. <hi>Mount Sinai is made a figure of the Law, which begets bondage.</hi> Not that Mount which might be touched, and that burn'd with fire, where
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99037:64"/>
was the sound of the Trumpet, and voice of words, such a sound as never before was heard, nor never will be till one day we shall hear the same. The sound of the Trumpet which sounded at the delivery of the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.19. where it is described; for when the voice of the Trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, that <hi>Moses</hi> heard, it was such a noise, a <hi>great noise</hi> at first, but it grew <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>higher,</hi> and at last it came to that heighth that it was almost <hi>incomprehensible</hi>; then <hi>Moses</hi> spake: And what spake he? The Holy Ghost sets not down what he spake in that place. Look in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.21. <hi>So terrible was the voice, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake,</hi> Such a kind of lightning and loud voice this was; the Lord commands such a voice as this, <hi>Esay</hi> 58.1. <hi>Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.</hi> When God shall sound with the voice of the Trumpet of his <hi>holy word,</hi> of his <hi>Law,</hi> and shew thee that thou art a <hi>trayterous Rebel,</hi> and there is an Execution gone out against thee, <hi>body</hi> and <hi>goods</hi>: when God sounds thus to a deaf ear of a <hi>carnal man,</hi> then cometh the <hi>spirit of bondage</hi> of necessity on him, which shews that we have a <hi>time</hi> of <hi>need.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> must have this <hi>operation</hi> before thou comest to the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>grace.</hi> None will flie to the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Refuge,</hi> till the <hi>revenger</hi> of <hi>blood</hi> be hard at his <hi>heels</hi>: Nor any to Christ, till he sees his <hi>want</hi>: Thus the Lord makes us know our <hi>need</hi> by turning the <hi>edge</hi> of his <hi>Axe</hi> towards us. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders when they are brought to the bar at <hi>Westminster</hi> for Treason, have the <hi>edge</hi> of the <hi>Axe</hi> turned <hi>from</hi> them; but wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If a man be in <hi>health</hi> and <hi>jollity,</hi> and on a sudden be proclaimed a <hi>Traytor,</hi> that he must lose his <hi>life</hi> and <hi>goods,</hi> is it possible it should be thus, and he not wrought on, nor have any alteration? So when news comes from the Law, that thou art a <hi>dead man,</hi> and everlastingly must perish, the <hi>Law</hi> then works <hi>wrath,</hi> that is, it manifests unto us the <hi>wrath</hi> of God. When it is thus, there follows a <hi>shaking</hi> and <hi>trembling,</hi> and it's impossible but with <hi>Moses</hi> thou shouldst <hi>exceedingly quake and tremble.</hi>

For all this, there is a <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> erected; God hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to be <hi>merciful,</hi> though thy sins be <hi>never</hi> so <hi>great</hi>: This is the next <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative</hi> for faith, namely, the discovery and acknowledgment of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Christ Jesus. We see in in <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.2. <hi>We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the Land; yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing; we have trespassed</hi>; What then? must we be the <hi>subjects</hi> of God's <hi>wrath?</hi> No: <hi>Yet notwithstanding though we have committed this great offence, there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.</hi> What though we have <hi>provoked</hi> God to <hi>indignation,</hi> must we be the <hi>matter</hi> for his <hi>wrath</hi> to work on? No: <hi>There is balm in Gilead?</hi> Jer 8. ult. <hi>Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no Physician there? Why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?</hi> What though then we are sick to death? yet there is an help <hi>in time of need. And this knowledge of the people, that there is a Throne of grace, is the first comfort comes to a

miserable and sinful soul.</hi> A man that hath a <hi>deadly disease,</hi> though the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician</hi> do him no good which he hath made use of, yet this he comforts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in, when he sees a <hi>Physician</hi> that hath cured the same disease, he sees then there is some <hi>hope.</hi> Thus it is with a sinful soul. When the welcome news of the Gospel comes, after the <hi>Law</hi> hath discovered his <hi>disease,</hi> and says, Be not discouraged, <hi>there is a Throne of grace</hi> prepared for thee: God hath a <hi>seat of justice</hi> to deal with <hi>Rebels</hi> and open <hi>Traytors</hi>; but if thou art weary of thy estate, if thou wilt submit to God, take Christ for thy <hi>King,</hi> and cast down all thy <hi>weapons,</hi> if thou wilt live like a <hi>subject,</hi> he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared a <hi>Throne of grace</hi> for thee. Christ is thy <hi>Attourney</hi> in the <hi>Court</hi> to plead for thee; he is not as the Papists make him, so <hi>stout,</hi> and one that <hi>takes</hi> such <hi>state</hi> on him, as that a man may not come near him. This is the highest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury that can be offered to Christ, to think that any creature hath more mercy and pity than he hath: It is to rob Christ of the <hi>fairest flower</hi> in his <hi>garden,</hi> when we rob him of his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>pity.</hi> Mark that place in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. that we may not think him austere, <hi>We have not an high Priest that cannot be touched with our infirmities, with the feeling of our infirmities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Christ is no <hi>hard-hearted</hi> man; when you were his <hi>enemies</hi> he loved you, insomuch that he <hi>humbled</hi> himself, and <hi>suffered death,</hi> even the <hi>death of the Cross</hi> for you. And he hath the self same <hi>bowels</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> that he had on <hi>earth</hi>; he <hi>wept</hi> over <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the self-same <hi>weeping heart</hi> carried he to Heaven with him, the self same weeping eyes: Believe not then the Papists, that he is so <hi>hard-hearted,</hi> or so <hi>stately,</hi> and that his <hi>Mother</hi> is more ready to speak for us; fie on it. This is to <hi>pervert</hi> the Gospel, and make Christ no Christ. <hi>We have not an High Priest that cannot be touched with the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our infirmities,</hi> Heb. 2, 17, <hi>In all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Priest,</hi> &amp;c. Alas, poor soul, saith Christ, what the <hi>malice</hi> of the Devil is, I know by mine own <hi>experience</hi> in the flesh; for Christ <hi>was tempted in all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to us, sin only excepted.</hi> I know what the <hi>temptations</hi> of the world are; but whereas we have three enemies, the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>world</hi> and the <hi>flesh,</hi> only the two former were his.

                     <p>And that thou mayst understand it the better, know that faith then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins first to work, when thou <hi>settest</hi> the first <hi>step</hi> towards the <hi>Throne of grace.</hi> And <hi>this is the hour in which salvation is come unto thy house,</hi> Luk. 19.9. <hi>None can come to me, saith Christ, except my Father draw him.</hi> If thou seest a <hi>vertue</hi> to come from Christ, and to draw thee as an <hi>Adamant,</hi> and thou <hi>feelest</hi> that <hi>loadstone</hi> working on thee, then begins <hi>faith</hi>: It makes thee draw near to Christ; whereas before thou wert a <hi>stranger</hi>: Till then thou art like thy <hi>Grandfather Adam,</hi> thou runnest away, and thinkest thy self most <hi>secure,</hi> when thou wast <hi>farthest</hi> from God; but now thou seest no <hi>comfort,</hi> unless thou draw nigh unto <hi>him</hi>; now as the Apostle saith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. <hi>It is he that worketh in us the will and the deed</hi>; this must must be wrought in us by God.</p>

                        <hi>First, a will,</hi> then the <hi>deed</hi>; and then it is not only <hi>I would do such a thing, but I do it</hi>: God works not only the <hi>will</hi> of coming, but the <hi>deed</hi> of coming; and all his <hi>acts</hi> are acts of faith, and have a promise; God makes no promise, till we be in Christ; till we have faith, we are no <hi>heirs</hi> of the <hi>promise</hi>; when a man sets his face towards <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and begins to set himself to go to Christ, all he doth then hath the promise; not a <hi>tear now</hi> that he sheds but is <hi>precious,</hi> God puts it into his <hi>bottle</hi>; not a <hi>cup of cold water,</hi> that now he gives, but shall have a great reward; this is a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thing, when every thing we do hath a <hi>promise</hi> annexed to it, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>step</hi> we step hath a <hi>promise</hi> made to it. Now then the will is the first thing that is wrought in us; this is that which makes the act of faith, that is, I have a will, a resolution to do this: And the Apostle makes it more than the very deed it self, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, 10. as I may so say, <hi>For this is expedient for you, who have begun before not only to do, but to be forward.</hi> So we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate it, but look in the Margent, and it's rendred, (<hi>to be willing</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, as the Greek hath it; as if the will were more than the deed it self; for a man to come <hi>unwillingly,</hi> 'tis nothing worth; the <hi>ground-work</hi> is the <hi>will,</hi> which is a greater matter than the <hi>deed.</hi> Nothing more separates a man from Christ, than to say, <hi>I will not have this man to reign over me,</hi> Luke 19.14. But if thou canst frame thy <hi>will</hi> that it shall go <hi>perpendicularly</hi> on the object, and accept Christ on the terms offered, <hi>that's faith</hi>; and <hi>that</hi> hath the <hi>promise.</hi> And therefore the Scripture compares it to <hi>conjunction</hi> with Christ. And as in the Sacrament, we <hi>spiritually</hi> eat his <hi>flesh</hi> and drink his <hi>blood</hi>; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction is between Christ and his Church. And therefore the Scripture compares our conjunction by faith to the <hi>mystery</hi> of wedlock. What makes a <hi>marriage?</hi> it's <hi>consent.</hi> Wilt thou have this man to be thy <hi>Husband</hi>? she answers, I will; that expression makes the <hi>marriage.</hi> The <hi>knot</hi> is <hi>knit</hi> by this <hi>mutual pledging</hi> of <hi>troth,</hi> all other things are but <hi>subsequents</hi> of it. So God saith, <hi>Wilt</hi> thou have my Son? Thou shalt have with him all his <hi>wealth,</hi> though for a time thou must go <hi>bare,</hi> and <hi>fare hard</hi>; yet thou shalt have a <hi>Kingdom:</hi> When a man considers deliberately, here is the <hi>loss,</hi> I must <hi>deny my self,</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him, but I shall have a <hi>Kingdom, God's blessing,</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>conscience</hi>; All things considered, casting the best with the worst, then the resolutioa is, <hi>this is a true saying, worthy of all acceptation,</hi> &amp;c. I'll take him on any <hi>terms,</hi> be they never so <hi>hard,</hi> for I shall be a <hi>saver</hi> in the end: when we take Christ, as it were, with all his <hi>faults</hi>; such his Cross, and the afflictions of the Gospel seem to our carnal apprehensions: though to S. <hi>Paul</hi> these were the chief, indeed the only matter of his boasting: <hi>God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> Galat. 6.14.</p>

                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:99037:65"/>When, I say, we can thus take Christ, this is the Will, &amp;c. this is the <hi>will</hi> which God requires. There is another comparison in Scripture, <hi>John</hi> 6.35. it's compared to <hi>hunger and thirst. Believing</hi> was expressed by <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Believing</hi> is expressed by <hi>hungring</hi> and <hi>thirsting.</hi> So when I see such a will and desire after Christ, that I <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirst</hi> after him, that a <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry</hi> man longeth not more for <hi>bread,</hi> nor the <hi>Hart</hi> thirsteth more for the <hi>water-brooks,</hi> than my soul doth for <hi>Christ</hi>; why then there is a promise made unto us; and a promise is never made unto us, till we be in Christ. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Esay</hi> 55.1. We find promises in them all; in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness; for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven, they shall be filled.</hi> Consider here what the nature of <hi>hunger and thirst is</hi>; they shall be <hi>filled,</hi> which implies they were <hi>empty</hi> before, but now they shall be <hi>filled.</hi> Suppose now I am not filled with Christ, what am I without him? No, I <hi>want</hi> him; yet there's a blessing to the <hi>hungry</hi> and <hi>thirsty,</hi> and there's no <hi>blessing</hi> without <hi>faith.</hi> If we be not <hi>heirs</hi> of the <hi>faith,</hi> we cannot be <hi>heirs</hi> of the <hi>blessing.</hi> Dost thou find in thy self an <hi>hungring</hi> and <hi>thirsting</hi> after Christ? Thou art blessed, this <hi>faith</hi> will <hi>save</hi> thee. Now faith will say, I am wonderfully <hi>pained, faint,</hi> and even <hi>starved,</hi> that I cannot be <hi>filled</hi> with Christ; yet be <hi>content</hi> man, thou shalt be <hi>filled</hi> with him; in the mean while thou hast him, and hast blessedness with him, and shalt be blessed. It's said, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.13. <hi>These things have I written unto you that believe in the Name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the Name of the Son of God.</hi> Mark how the Apostle distinguishes these two things; thou <hi>believest</hi> on the Name of Christ, yet sayst thou, though I <hi>believe,</hi> I am not <hi>sure</hi> of my <hi>salvation,</hi> I do not <hi>know it.</hi> Why, let not <hi>that</hi> much <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> thee, <hi>that's</hi> a <hi>consequent</hi> of it, and that the <hi>assurance</hi> will follow after; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you should not confound it with believing: <hi>These things have I written unto you that ye might know,</hi> &amp;c. then there is a conclusion to be deduced from the premisses, so that a man may have <hi>full hold</hi> of Christ, and yet not be <hi>fully assured</hi> of his <hi>salvation.</hi> So t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And whereas it is said that God <hi>takes</hi> the <hi>will</hi> for the <hi>deed,</hi> the place had need be well understood: When we say God takes the will for the deed, it is not alwayes true, unless it be thus understood. When a man hath done to the <hi>utmost of his power</hi> what he is able, hath endeavoured by all means, then God will <hi>take the will for the deed</hi>; but if there be <hi>ability</hi> in me, and I do not as much as I am <hi>able,</hi> I do not my <hi>utmost endeavour,</hi> then God will not take it; but now God works the <hi>will</hi> and the <hi>deed</hi>; when a man comes to the <hi>Throne of grace,</hi> and sets forward in his <hi>journey</hi> towards God, the first thing he doth is to come to the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> with <hi>Christ in his arms,</hi> and then having fast hold on Christ, he hastens &amp; delays not, having hold as <hi>Joab</hi> on the horns of the Altar, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.28. He <hi>hastens,</hi> he sees it's no time to <hi>delay,</hi> he sees its now a <hi>time</hi> of <hi>need</hi>; and <hi>Need,</hi> as the old proverb is, <hi>makes the old wife trot.</hi> Is it not need to make hast (when the pursuer of blood follows) to the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Refuge</hi>? who would make <hi>delays</hi> and <hi>demurs,</hi> and not run as <hi>fast</hi> as his <hi>legs would carry him</hi>? As soon as I apprehend my need, and see the <hi>golden Scepter</hi> stretched out, then I come with <hi>might</hi> and <hi>main</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi> in my <hi>arms,</hi> and present him to the Father, and this is the <hi>approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>drawing</hi> near in the Text, to the Throne of grace.</p>

will in no wise cast out,</hi> Joh. 6.37. But when we come thither, what must we do? why <hi>we must take unto our selves words,</hi> according to the Prophets expression, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Take unto you words, and go unto the Lord, and say, Take away all our iniquities, and receive us graciously, so will we render the calves of our lips.</hi> When he comes to the Throne of grace, the thing that he doth, is, he presents unto the Father Christ, <hi>bleeding, gasping, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, buried,</hi> and <hi>conquering death</hi>; and when he presents Christ to him, he <hi>opens</hi> his <hi>case,</hi> and confesses his <hi>sin</hi> to the <hi>full,</hi> and says, Lord, this is my <hi>case</hi>: As a <hi>beggar</hi> when he comes to ask an alms of you, he will make a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> and tell you his <hi>extremity</hi>; Sir, I am in great want, I have nor tasted a <hi>bit of bread</hi> in so many days, and unless you help me by your <hi>charity,</hi> I am <hi>utterly undone.</hi> Now when these two concur, that there is true need in the <hi>beggar,</hi> and <hi>liberality</hi> in him, of whom he <hi>begs,</hi> it encourages the <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> to be <hi>importunate,</hi> and he <hi>prevails</hi>; you may know when the beggar hath need by his <hi>tone, accent</hi> or <hi>language:</hi> The <hi>needy beggars</hi> tone and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent is different from the <hi>sturdy beggars</hi> that hath no <hi>need</hi>; but yet, though the beggar be in great misery, if he see a churlish <hi>Nabal</hi> go by him, he hath no heart to <hi>beg,</hi> and follows him not, nor <hi>begs</hi> so <hi>hard,</hi> because he hath but little hope to attain any thing from him. But I say let <hi>both these</hi> meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; first, that the beggar is in <hi>great need,</hi> then, that he of whom he begs, is <hi>very liberal,</hi> it makes him beg hard; but now cannot he pray without book? Think not that I speak against <hi>praying by the book</hi>; you are deceived if you think so; but there must be words taken to us besides, which perhaps a <hi>book</hi> will not yield us. A <hi>beggars need</hi> will make him speak, and he will not hide his <hi>sores</hi>; but if he hath any <hi>sore</hi> more <hi>ugly</hi> or <hi>worse</hi> than another, he will <hi>uncover</hi> it; good Sir, behold my <hi>woful</hi> and <hi>distressed</hi> case, he lays all open to provoke <hi>pity.</hi> So when thou comest before God in <hi>confession,</hi> canst thou not find out words to <hi>open</hi> thy self to Almighty God, not one word whereby thou mayst <hi>unlap</hi> thy <hi>sores,</hi> and beseech him to look on thee with an <hi>eye of pity</hi>? I must not <hi>mince</hi> my sins, but <hi>amplifie</hi> and aggravate them, that God may be moved to pardon me; till we do thus, we cannot expect that God should <hi>forgive us.</hi> A great ado there is about <hi>auricular confession,</hi> but it's a meer <hi>bable</hi>; It were better to cry out our sins at the <hi>high Cross,</hi> than the confess in a <hi>Priests ear.</hi> Thou <hi>whisperest</hi> in the <hi>Priest's</hi> ear; what if he never tell it, or if he do, art thou the better? Come and <hi>pour</hi> out thy heart and soul before Almighty God, confess thy self to him as <hi>David</hi> did, for that hath a promise made to it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight, that thou may be justified when thou speakest, and clear when thou judgest.</hi> Why so? Why, one main cause why we should confess sin, is <hi>to justifie God.</hi> When a sinner confesses, I am a <hi>child of wrath</hi>; and of <hi>death,</hi> if thou castest me into hell, as justly thou mayst, I have received but my due; when a man does thus (as the King's Attourney may frame a Bill of Inditement against himself) he justifies Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. He gives God the honour of that justice, which at the present he executes in pouring horrour into the conscience of the sinner, and hath farther in store in providing the Lake of fire and brimstone for the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Thus did <hi>David, Against thee, against thee,</hi> &amp;c. Now when we have thus <hi>aggravated</hi> our misery, comes the other part of <hi>begging,</hi> to cry for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with <hi>earnestness,</hi> and here's the <hi>power</hi> of the Spirit. It's one thing for a man to <hi>pray,</hi> and another thing for a man to <hi>say a prayer,</hi> but to <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>cry</hi> for <hi>mercy,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, in <hi>good earnest,</hi> to <hi>wrestle</hi> with God, to say, Lord, My life lies in it, I will never <hi>give thee over,</hi> I will not go with a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi>; this is termed <gap reason="foreign">

in the <hi>Ephesians</hi> we read of an Armour provided for all the parts of a man's body, yet will not serve the turn, unless prayer come in as the chief, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto with all perseverance,</hi> &amp;c. This is the <hi>prayer of faith,</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures <hi>forgiveness of sins</hi>; we must pray in <hi>faith,</hi> and in the <hi>Spirit</hi>; that is the language, which God understands. He knoweth the meaning of the Spirit, and knoweth none else but that: Many men are wondrously deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that which they call <hi>the Spirit of prayer.</hi> One thinks it is a <hi>faculty</hi> to set out ones desires in <hi>fair words,</hi> shewing earnestness, and speaking much in an <hi>extemporary prayer.</hi> This we think commendable, yet this is not the <hi>Spirit of prayer.</hi> One that shall never come to Heaven, may be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in this, than the <hi>child</hi> of God; for it is a matter of skill and exercise; the <hi>Spirit of prayer</hi> is another thing. <hi>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; the Spirit it self makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered,</hi> Rom. 8.26 What shall we think then, that the Holy Ghost <hi>groans</hi> or <hi>speaks</hi> in prayer? No: but it makes us <hi>groan,</hi> and though we speak not a word, yet it so <hi>enlarges</hi> our hearts, as that we send up a <hi>volley</hi> of sighs and groans which reach the Throne of grace. And this is the Spirit of prayer, when with these <hi>sighs</hi> and <hi>groans</hi> I beg, as it were, for my <hi>life.</hi> This is that ardent affection the Scripture speaks of. A <hi>cold prayer</hi> will never get <hi>forgiveness</hi> of sins; it's the prayer of faith which prevails. <hi>The prayer of the people availeth much, if it be <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, because that caught them up, and made them do actions not sutable to their nature; Prayer is a fire from Heaven, which if thou hast it, will carry all Heaven before it; there is nothing in the world so <hi>strong</hi> as a Christian thus praying: Prayers that are kindled with such a zeal, are compared to <hi>Jacobs wrestling with the Angel,</hi> Hos. 12.4. <hi>whereby he had power over the Angel.</hi> The Prophet expounds what this wrestling was, <hi>he wept and made supplication unto him; he found him in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel, and there he spake with him.</hi> This is the <hi>wrestling</hi> with God, when thou fillest Heaven with thy <hi>sighs</hi> and <hi>sobs,</hi> and <hi>bedewest</hi> thy couch with thy tears as David did; and hast thy resolution with <hi>Jacob, I will not let thee go except thou bless me.</hi> God loves this kind of <hi>boldness</hi> in a <hi>beggar,</hi> that he will not go away without an <hi>answer.</hi> As the <hi>poor Widow in the Parable</hi> that would not give over her suit, so that the <hi>Judge though he feared not God, nor cared for man, by reason of her importunity, granted her desire.</hi> Mark the other thing in the Apostle, he bids us <hi>pray with the Spirit, and with perseverance</hi>; and he that cometh thus hath a promise made to it: <hi>He that calleth on the Name of the Lord shall be saved. Call on me in the day of trouble, and I will hear thee</hi>; it's set down fully, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Ask and you shall have, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you; for every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</hi> One would think this were <hi>idem per idem,</hi> but it is not so. He bids us <hi>ask and it shall be given, seek and you shall find,</hi> &amp;c. There is a promise annexed to <hi>asking, seeking</hi> and <hi>knocking,</hi> but it is also proved by universal experience; <hi>for every one that asketh,</hi> &amp;c. It's very man's <hi>case</hi>; never any man did it yet, that hath lost his labour, in not <hi>attaining</hi> what he asked. If thou hast it not <hi>yet,</hi> thou shalt have it in the <hi>end</hi>; it is so fair a petition to ask, to have thy <hi>sins</hi> pardoned, that God would be <hi>friends with thee,</hi> and that Christ would make thee <hi>love</hi> him: and that God would be <hi>thy God,</hi> that God <hi>delights</hi> in it. This is the point then; Suppose God <hi>answer</hi> not <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,</hi> yet <hi>knock still, seek still</hi>; that is <hi>perseverance,</hi> the thing whereby it is distinguished from temporary asking. The hypocrite will pray in a time of <hi>need</hi> and <hi>adversity,</hi> but his prayer is not <hi>constant,</hi> Job 27.10. <hi>Will the hypocrite always call upon God?</hi> If they come and <hi>seek</hi> God, and he will not

Mark what a promise there is; <hi>It shall come to pass that before they call I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</hi> This is a great <hi>encouragement</hi>; but it may be God will not always do this, and what's the <hi>reason?</hi> Why, he hath a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>great delight</hi> to be <hi>wrestled withal,</hi> and to hear the words of his <hi>own Spirit</hi>; nothing is more <hi>delightful</hi> to him than this, when the <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,</hi> and will not give over. <hi>I will not let thee go, unless thou bless me,</hi> Gen. 32.26. It's said in the <hi>Canticles, honey is under the lips of the Church,</hi> Cant. 4.11. Why so? it's because there is no <hi>honey</hi> sweeter to the palate, than <hi>spiritual prayer</hi> to God. And therefore God delays to answer thee, because he would have more of it. If the <hi>Musicians</hi> come and play at our doors, or windows, if we delight not in their Musick, we throw them out money presently, that they may be gone; but if the Musick please us, we forbear to give them <hi>money,</hi> because we would keep them longer, for we <hi>like</hi> the <hi>Musick.</hi> So the Lord loves and delights in the sweet words of his children: and therefore puts them off, and answers them not <hi>presently</hi>: Now God's children, let him deny them never so long, yet they will never leave <hi>knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>begging</hi>; they will <hi>pray,</hi> and they will <hi>wait</hi> still, till they receive an answer. Many will pray to God, as prayer is a <hi>duty,</hi> but few use it as a <hi>means</hi> to <hi>attain a blessing.</hi> Those who come to God in the use of it as a means to attain what they would have, they will <hi>pray,</hi> and not <hi>give over</hi>; they will expect an Answer, and never give over <hi>petitioning</hi> till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. Concerning <hi>the nature of faith,</hi> I have spoken sufficiently already wherein it <hi>consists</hi>; but yet notwithstanding, there is a certain thing as like this faith as may be, and yet comes short of it. Many there are who are like <hi>the foolish Virgins,</hi> that thought they were <hi>well enough,</hi> and thought they should come <hi>time enough.</hi> So many think verily that they have faith; yea, and perchance go with such a <hi>perswasion</hi> to their very <hi>graves,</hi> and think they have <hi>grace,</hi> and that they <hi>labour after</hi> Christ, and <hi>lay hold</hi> on him, and are free from <hi>worldly pollutions,</hi> so as that they have a <hi>taste</hi> and <hi>relish</hi> of the joy of the world to come, and yet are carried all this while in a <hi>fool's Paradise,</hi> and think there is no fear of their safety; never knowing that they are <hi>cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways,</hi>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:99037:68"/>
till they come to the <hi>gates</hi> of <hi>hell,</hi> and find themselves by woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience <hi>shut out</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> And their <hi>case</hi> is woful, that are thus <hi>deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Know then, that it is not every <hi>faith</hi> that <hi>justifies</hi> a man; a man may have faith, and yet not be justified. The Faith that justifies, is <hi>the Faith of Gods Elect.</hi> Tit. 1.1. There is a faith that may belong to them that are not Gods <hi>elect,</hi> but that faith does not justifie. In the <hi>Epistle of Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> that faith which justifies, must <hi>be a faith unfegn'd,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5. 2 Tim. 1.5, Now here's the <hi>skill</hi> of a Christian to try what that faith is, which <hi>justifies</hi> him. Now this <hi>justifying</hi> faith is not every work of Gods Spirit in a mans heart: For there are <hi>supernatural operations</hi> of the Spirit in a mans heart, that are but <hi>temporary,</hi> that carry him <hi>not thorow,</hi> and therefore are <hi>ineffectual:</hi> but the <hi>end of this faith is the salvation of our souls.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. We read in the Scripture of <hi>Apostacy,</hi> and <hi>falling back.</hi> Now, they cannot be <hi>Apostates,</hi> that were never in the way of truth. This being an <hi>accident,</hi> we must have a <hi>subject</hi> for it; Now there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>people</hi> that have <hi>supernatural workings</hi>; some that are drawn <hi>up</hi> and <hi>down</hi> with every wind of Doctrine; these are they that have this cold and <hi>temporary</hi> faith; <hi>temporary,</hi> because in the end it discovers it self to be a thing not <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>permanent.</hi> We read in <hi>John</hi> 11.26. <hi>That they that are born of God</hi> (that is, <hi>that live, and believe in Christ) never see death,</hi> shall never perish <hi>eternally</hi>; but yet we must know withal, that there may be <hi>conceptions</hi> that will never come to the <hi>birth,</hi> to a <hi>right</hi> and <hi>perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery.</hi> And thus it may be in the soul of a man, there may be <hi>conceptions</hi> that will never come to a <hi>ripe birth</hi>; but let a man be born of God, and come to <hi>perfection of birth,</hi> and the case is <hi>clear,</hi> he shall <hi>never see death. He that liveth and believeth in me, shall not see death.</hi> And this is made a <hi>point</hi> of <hi>faith: Believest thou this?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is another thing called <hi>conception,</hi> and that is, <hi>certain dispositions</hi> to a <hi>birth,</hi> that come not to <hi>full perfection.</hi> True, a child that is <hi>born</hi> and <hi>liveth,</hi> is a <hi>perfectly alive</hi> as he that <hi>liveth</hi> an <hi>hundred years:</hi> yet I say, there are <hi>conceptions</hi> that come not to a birth. Now, <hi>the faith that justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, is a living faith</hi>: there is a certain kind of <hi>dead faith</hi>; this is a <hi>feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> that an <hi>unfegned</hi> faith; <hi>The life that I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</hi> Dost thou think a <hi>dead faith</hi> can make a <hi>living soul</hi>? Its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reason. A man cannot <hi>live</hi> by a <hi>dead thing,</hi> not by a <hi>dead faith.</hi> Now a <hi>dead faith</hi> there is. A faith that doth not <hi>work</hi> is a <hi>dead</hi> faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Seest thou how faith wrought with his works and by his works was faith made perfect</hi> for verse 26. <hi>As the body without the spirit is dead, (or without breath is dead) so faith without works is dead also.</hi> See how the Apostle compares it, <hi>as the body without the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</hi> The Apostle makes not works the form of faith, as the soul is the form of the man: But as the <hi>body</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>spirit</hi> is <hi>dead,</hi> so <hi>that</hi> faith, that worketh not, that hath no <hi>tokens</hi> of <hi>life,</hi> is dead; but then doth not the other word strike home? <hi>Faith wrought with his works.</hi> It seems here is, as the Papists say, <hi>fides informis,</hi> and works make it up as the <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> of it. But compare this with the other places of the Scripture and the difficulty will be cleared, for instance weigh that place. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. Where the Apostle pray'd to God, <hi>that the messenger of Satan might be removed from him; and he said unto him, My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> What? Does <hi>our weakness</hi> make <hi>Gods strength</hi> more perfect, to which nothing can be added? No, it is, My <hi>strength</hi> and the <hi>perfection of it,</hi> is made known in the <hi>weakness</hi> of the <hi>means</hi> that I made use of for the <hi>delivery</hi> of mans soul from <hi>death.</hi> So here the <hi>excellency</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of our faith is made known by <hi>works</hi>; when I see that it is not an <hi>idle,</hi> but a <hi>working</hi> faith, then I say it is made <hi>perfect</hi> by the <hi>work</hi>: When it is a <hi>dead</hi> faith,

The most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith</hi>: not <hi>holy</hi> only, but <hi>most holy.</hi> That faith which must bring a man to God the <hi>holy of holies,</hi> must be <hi>most holy.</hi> It's said, <hi>that God dwells in our hearts by faith. Ephes.</hi> 3.17. Now <hi>God</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> dwelling in a heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that heart must needs be <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>clean. Faith</hi> makes the heart <hi>pure:</hi> It were a most dishonourable thing to entertain God in a <hi>sty</hi>; a <hi>filthy</hi> and <hi>unclean heart:</hi> but if <hi>faith</hi> dwell there, it makes a fit <hi>house</hi> for the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of the <hi>King of Saints,</hi> therefore it <hi>purifieth</hi> the <hi>heart.</hi> Well then, dost thou think thy sins are <hi>forgiven thee</hi>; and that thou hast <hi>a strong faith,</hi> and yet art as <hi>prophane,</hi> and as <hi>filthy</hi> as ever? How can it be? It is a <hi>most holy</hi> faith that <hi>justifieth,</hi> it is not a faith that will suffer a man to lie on a <hi>dunghil,</hi> or in the <hi>gutter</hi> with the <hi>hog.</hi> There may be a <hi>faith,</hi> which is somewhat like this, but it is but <hi>temporary,</hi> and cometh <hi>short</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p>But now there is another thing which distinguishes it: it is the peculiar work of faith. <hi>In Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but the new creature,</hi> Gal. 6.15. and again Gal. 5.6. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumcision nor uncircumcision availeth any thing, but faith which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love.</hi> It's twice set down. Now what is a <hi>new creature?</hi> Why, he that hath such a <hi>faith,</hi> as works by <hi>love</hi>: not a <hi>dead faith,</hi> but a faith <hi>that works</hi>; but how does it <hi>work?</hi> it not only <hi>abstains</hi> from evil, and does some good acts, which a <hi>temporary</hi> may do, but its such a <hi>faith as works by love. The love of God constrains him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. and he so <hi>loveth</hi> God, as that he <hi>hates evil</hi> for Gods sake; the other does it not out of love to God; all the love he hath, is self-love: he <hi>serves</hi> his <hi>own turn</hi> on God rather than hath any <hi>true love</hi> to serve him.</p>
                     <p>Now that we may the better distinguish between these two, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to shew you how far <hi>one</hi> may go farther, than the <hi>other.</hi> I know not a more difficult point then this, nor a case more to be cut by a thread, then this; it being a <hi>point of conscience</hi>; therefore, First, I declared unto you the nature of faith; How God first works the will and the deed, and that there is a <hi>hungring</hi> and <hi>thirsting</hi> after Christ. First, I say there is a <hi>will</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> to be made partaker of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; then there is the <hi>deed</hi> too. We are not only <hi>wishers</hi> and <hi>woulders,</hi> but do <hi>actually</hi> approach unto the <hi>Throne of grace,</hi> and there lay <hi>hold</hi> on Christ, touch the Golden Scepter, which he holdeth out unto us; but,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> Now you will ask, Is there not an earnest and good desire in a temporary faith, a desire unfeign'd?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Yes, there may be for a time, a greater and more vehement desire in a <hi>temporary,</hi> then in a true <hi>believer,</hi> then in the <hi>elect</hi> themselves, all <hi>their</hi> life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> Where's the difference then? I thought all had been well with me, when I had such a <hi>desire,</hi> as I could scarce be <hi>at rest,</hi> till it were <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I answer, beloved, It is a hard matter to tell you the difference: but you must consider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>From whence this desire flows; whether it come from an accidental cause</hi>; as if <hi>by accident</hi> my heart be made more <hi>soft,</hi> and I more <hi>sensible</hi> of my condition, or <hi>whether my nature be changed</hi>; to give you an instance, in <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>: when <hi>iron</hi> is put into the <hi>forge</hi> it is <hi>softned,</hi> and as soon as it's taken forth, we say <hi>'tis time to strike, while the iron is hot</hi>; the fire hath made a change in it, it's <hi>malleable,</hi> the <hi>hammer</hi> is able to work on it; but let the <hi>fire</hi> be gone, and it's as hard as before; nay, we say <hi>steel</hi> is harder, so that there is no change in the nature of <hi>iron,</hi> it's hard still, <hi>redit ad ingenium,</hi> it <hi>goes back</hi> into its <hi>own estate.</hi> If it be softned, it is by an <hi>accidental cause</hi>; so here, as long as the <hi>temporary faith</hi> is in the <hi>furnace</hi> of <hi>afflictions,</hi>
                        <pb n="120" facs="tcp:99037:69"/>
when God shall let <hi>loose</hi> the cord of his <hi>conscience,</hi> and makes him <hi>see</hi> that there is no <hi>way</hi> for <hi>salvation</hi> but by Christ, then the <hi>sense</hi> of his <hi>torture</hi> will make him <hi>desire</hi> with all the <hi>veins</hi> in his heart to have Christ. See a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar example of this temporary desire in <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.34. <hi>When he slew them, then they sought him, and returned and enquired early after God.</hi> So Prov. 1.27. <hi>When their fear was on them as desolation, and their destruction as a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind: when distress and anguish cometh upon you, then shall they call upon me,</hi> &amp;c. Not with a <hi>feigned desire,</hi> but in truth and reality they <hi>desire relief; They remembred then that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer</hi>; they saw a Redeemer when he was slaying of them, and they <hi>believed</hi> that God would <hi>free</hi> them, though it was but <hi>temporary: Nevertheless they flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him with their mouths, and lied unto him with their tongues; for their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his Covenant.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve then this was but a <hi>temporary case,</hi> a <hi>temporary change</hi>; there was no <hi>new creature,</hi> no <hi>new nature</hi> wrought: but being in the <hi>furnace of affliction,</hi> as long as the <hi>fire</hi> was <hi>hot</hi> they were <hi>pliable</hi>; they were not <hi>stedfast in his Covenant.</hi> Let this be an <hi>admonition</hi> to them that think they never can have true faith, till God slay them. I am not of that opinion. God sometimes useth this means, but it is not so necessary, as that it cannot be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>herwise; and to speak truly, I had rather have faith that comes another way: The difference is this, The <hi>temporary believers</hi> will have Christ while God is <hi>slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of them, whilst they are in the furnace of afflictions: but the other in <hi>cold blood,</hi> when God's hand is not on them. The true believer <hi>is sick of love,</hi> and when he hath <hi>no affliction,</hi> nor <hi>God's hand</hi> on him, with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>he accounts all things dung and dross for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus,</hi> Philip. 3.8. There is an ardent desire, when this <hi>external cause</hi> draws not. If when thou art out of the <hi>forge,</hi> thou hast thy heart <hi>soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> and findest this work of grace and faith to drive thee to Christ, thou hast a <hi>faith unfeigned,</hi> and so the <hi>faith of God's elect.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, there is not only <hi>this desire</hi> in him who hath a <hi>temporary faith</hi>; but having understood the Word, he so desires it, that when he knows there is no having <hi>Christ,</hi> nor <hi>happiness</hi> or <hi>salvation</hi> by him, unless he deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and part from his <hi>evil ways,</hi> being perswaded of this, out of <hi>self-love he</hi> would have Christ; and seeing these be the <hi>terms,</hi> that he must <hi>turn a new leaf,</hi> and <hi>lead a new life,</hi> or <hi>go to hell,</hi> therefore he will do <hi>this</hi> too; this is much: yet I say, he doth this too; but how shall this be proved? most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. <hi>For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain intangled and overcome, the latter end with them is worse than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> Here is that <hi>Apostacy,</hi> and here is the subject of the <hi>temporary faith. It had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them</hi>; this was a temporary conversion, as <hi>Ephraim, like a broken bow, turned back in the day of battel,</hi> Psal. 78.9. Observe what they did; they were <hi>like the foolish Virgins, they kept their maiden-heads in respect of the pollutions of the world</hi>; they lived very civilly, <hi>they escaped the pollutions of the world,</hi> and no man could challenge them of any filthy act: they knew that Christ was the King of Saints, <hi>and had the knowledge of him</hi>: they knew that it was not fit that the <hi>King of glory</hi> and <hi>holiness</hi> should be attended on by the <hi>black guard,</hi> that they must have sanctity that will follow him; and therefore they laboured to be fit to attend him: <hi>They escaped the pollutions of the world,</hi> but yet it continues not: Why so? <hi>For it happened to them according to the true Proverb, the Dog is returned to his vomit, and the Sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> Mark, <hi>the Dog turns again to his own vomit.</hi> This proceeds from some <hi>pang</hi> in his stomach, that enforceth that filthy beast to <hi>disgorge it</hi> self, that it may have <hi>some ease</hi>; but he quickly gathers it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99037:69"/>
as soon as the <hi>pang</hi> is over. Some there are, that would be content to <hi>hide their iniquity under their tongues,</hi> at <hi>Job</hi> speaks, <hi>chap.</hi> 20. <hi>vers.</hi> 12. but there comes a <hi>pang</hi> sometimes, a <hi>pang</hi> in their consciences, which forceth them to <hi>vomit</hi> up their sweet <hi>bits</hi> again: but well, the <hi>fit</hi> is gone; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone, they, like the <hi>filthy dog,</hi> return to their vomit again, considering the pleasure which they took in that filthy thing: that they did <hi>disgorge</hi> themselves, was but from that <hi>pang</hi> and <hi>present pinch,</hi> not from the <hi>loathing</hi> or <hi>hatred of</hi> the thing, and therefore they return again unto it.</p>
                     <p>By the way then take notice of the <hi>filthiness</hi> of sin; how filthy is it, that the Lord compares it to the <hi>vomit</hi> of <hi>a dog?</hi> Then there follows another comparison of it: <hi>It is as the Sow that is washed, and returns to her wallowing in the mire:</hi> See another <hi>loathsome resemblance</hi> of this <hi>temporary faith</hi>; the <hi>Sow</hi> was <hi>washed,</hi> but <hi>how?</hi> her <hi>swinish nature</hi> was not <hi>washed</hi> from her; as long as the <hi>Sow</hi> is kept from the <hi>mire,</hi> in a fair <hi>Meadow</hi> with the <hi>Sheep,</hi> she looks as <hi>sleek</hi> and <hi>clean</hi> as they: she was <hi>washed</hi>; there is an <hi>external change,</hi> but her <hi>nature remained:</hi> bring the <hi>Sow</hi> and the <hi>sheep</hi> to a <hi>puddle,</hi> the <hi>sheep</hi> will not go in, because it hath no <hi>swinish nature</hi>; but the <hi>other,</hi> retaining its <hi>swinish nature,</hi> though before in outward appearance, as clean as the sheep was, yet she goes again to her <hi>wallowing</hi> in the <hi>mire.</hi> There may be the <hi>cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away</hi> of a man's <hi>sins,</hi> and yet no <hi>new creature</hi> wrought in him. That I may shew this to you, take this example. A man known to be as <hi>covetous</hi> a man as liveth, he loveth his <hi>money</hi> as well as his God; yet perchance this man is brought in <hi>danger</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and must be <hi>hanged</hi> for some <hi>misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> committed; this man, to <hi>save</hi> his <hi>life,</hi> will part with all he hath: What, is his <hi>disposition changed?</hi> no, not a <hi>whit</hi>; he is as covetous as before, he is the <hi>same man,</hi> he doth it to <hi>save his life,</hi> and to this end he is content to part with his <hi>money.</hi> The same mind had those in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, <hi>who in a storm cast their wares into the Sea with their own hands,</hi> Act. 27. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. <hi>willingly,</hi> and yet <hi>half unwillingly</hi>; for the saving of their lives they would part with these things, yet it was with a great deal of <hi>repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> and <hi>reluctancy.</hi> As we read of <hi>Phaltiel,</hi> when his wife was taken from him, <hi>he followed behind weeping,</hi> 2 Sam. 3.16. till they <hi>bid him be gone,</hi> and <hi>return back.</hi> So these men forsake their <hi>sins,</hi> and <hi>hate them,</hi> but it is but <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly</hi>; they <hi>part</hi> with them, but they <hi>part weeping.</hi> Well, at this <hi>parting</hi> there may be a <hi>great deal of joy</hi>; it may taste not only the sweetness of the Word of God, but because they are in a disposition and way to salvation, they may have some kind of <hi>feeling of the joys,</hi> and taste of <hi>the powers of the world to come</hi>; as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>It is impossible for those who were once enlightned, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Holy Ghost,</hi> &amp;c. There is a <hi>supernatural</hi> work wrought in them, and they have <hi>tasted</hi> the good Word of the Lord; they begin to have some <hi>hope,</hi> and rejoyce in the <hi>glory</hi> of the <hi>world to come:</hi> What is the difference then? here is a tasting; but as it is <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.54. it is not said, he that <hi>tastes</hi> my flesh, and <hi>tastes</hi> my blood; but <hi>he that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, hath eternal life.</hi> There is a difference betwixt <hi>tasting and drinking,</hi> there may be a <hi>tasting</hi> without <hi>drinking</hi>; and the Text saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.34. When they gave Christ Vinegar, he <hi>tasted</hi> thereof, but would not <hi>drink.</hi> He that can take a <hi>full draught of Christ crucified, he shall never thirst, but shall be as a springing fountain that springeth up to everlasting life</hi>; but it shall not be so with him that doth but <hi>taste.</hi> The <hi>Vintner</hi> goes round the <hi>Cellar,</hi> and <hi>tastes</hi> every Vessel; he takes it into his mouth, and <hi>spits</hi> it out again, and yet knows by the <hi>tasting,</hi> whether it be good or bad; the wine goeth but to his <hi>palate,</hi> it reaches not the <hi>stomach.</hi> So a temporary believer <hi>tastes</hi> and <hi>feels</hi> what an <hi>excellent thing</hi> it is to have <hi>communion</hi> with Christ, and to be made partaker of his glory; but he does but <hi>taste</hi> it. Look in <hi>Hosea</hi> 5.15. where we have another instance of this temporary Believer: Ye would
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99037:70"/>
think they sought in God in a <hi>good sort,</hi> and in as good a <hi>manner</hi> as one could desire: well, but how did they seek him? It was only upon <hi>occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in time of <hi>affliction: I will go and return to my place until they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their offence, and seek my face; in their affliction they will seek me early</hi>; and again, <hi>Hosea</hi> 6.4. The Lord complains of them notwithstanding. <hi>They will in their affliction seek me early:</hi> Was not this a fair returning? <hi>Come</hi> (say they) <hi>let us return unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal us, &amp;c.</hi> What a deal of comfort did they seem to gather from the wayes of the Lord! But see what follows, <hi>Hosea</hi> 6.4. <hi>O Ephraim, saith the Lord, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah what shall I do unto thee? For your goodness is as the morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away</hi>; that is, it is but a <hi>temporary</hi> thing, wrought by <hi>affliction,</hi> which will not abide. As when a <hi>wicked man</hi> on his <hi>death-bed</hi> desires that God would <hi>spare</hi> him and <hi>restore</hi> him to his health, and that he would become a <hi>new man,</hi> all this comes but from the <hi>terrours</hi> of <hi>death</hi>; for it oft proves, that if God restores him he becomes as <hi>bad,</hi> if not <hi>worse,</hi> than ever he was before. But that I may not hold you too long;</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Take this for another difference: <hi>That Gods children can as earnestly desire grace as mercy; The temporary desire mercy, but never desire grace.</hi> The believer desires <hi>grace</hi> to have his <hi>nature healed,</hi> to <hi>hate</hi> his former <hi>conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The <hi>temporary</hi> never <hi>had,</hi> nor never <hi>will have</hi> this <hi>desire</hi>; should one come to the <hi>temporary</hi> believer, and tell him God will be merciful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, you may go on, and take your <hi>fill</hi> of sin, you shall be sure of <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>; he would like this well, and think it the welcomest news as could be, because he only fears <hi>damnation,</hi> and <hi>self-love</hi> makes him only desire free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from that; but now the child of God <hi>hates</hi> sin, though there were no <hi>Hell, Judge</hi> nor <hi>Tormentor</hi>; he begs as hard of God for <hi>grace,</hi> as for <hi>mercy,</hi> and would do so, were there no <hi>punishment.</hi> His nature being <hi>chang'd,</hi> he desireth <hi>grace,</hi> as well as <hi>mercy,</hi> which the <hi>temporary</hi> never does.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The last mark is from the words of the Apostle, <hi>Neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love. Love</hi> and the <hi>new creature</hi> puts Gods children <hi>on work</hi>; their hearts are first <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> and <hi>changed</hi> by being made <hi>new creatures.</hi> As the Scripture saith, his flesh is <hi>circumcised,</hi> he is a dead man; dead, not, as formerly, in trespasses and sins, but dead unto them. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.1. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Deadness</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth <hi>impotency</hi> of doing those things which a living man doth; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>temporary</hi> will not sin for fear of <hi>after-claps,</hi> but this man <hi>cannot</hi> sin, his <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>changed,</hi> he is <hi>dead to sin</hi>; we see how both ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from sin, but the <hi>temper</hi> and <hi>disposition</hi> is not alike. The temporary <hi>believer</hi> perchance commits not the sin, but he <hi>could find in his heart</hi> to do it; he saith not with <hi>Joseph, How can I do this great wickedness and sin against my God?</hi> The <hi>other</hi> saith, I could do <hi>this evil</hi> well enough, but I will not. <hi>Thou canst not be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now he <hi>that is born of God cannot sin,</hi> there is that seed, that spring in him, that for <hi>his life</hi> he cannot sin, but it turns his heart from it; <hi>for his life</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how to swear, lye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or <hi>joyn</hi> with others in <hi>wickedness</hi>; but this must be understood of the <hi>constant course</hi> of their <hi>lives</hi>; I speak not what they may do in <hi>temptations,</hi> when they are <hi>surprised,</hi> but in the <hi>course of their</hi> lives, they <hi>commit</hi> sin, as if they knew not how to do it; the other doth it <hi>skilfully</hi>; these <hi>coblingly,</hi> and <hi>bunglingly,</hi> they do it ill-favouredly; thus it is with a <hi>wicked man</hi> in doing a <hi>good</hi> work, he <hi>cobles</hi> it up. This is intimated unto us in the very Phrase of the Apostle, <hi>Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin:</hi> It is not the same thing to sin, in St. <hi>John</hi>'s acception, and to commit sin; committing sin is the action of the Artist, and Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

in the Trade; <hi>From this the seed of God, which abideth in the regenerate; secureth him,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. Psal. 32.12. Thy faith then must be a <hi>faith that worketh by love:</hi> Canst thou do those good works thou doest out of <hi>love?</hi> then, <hi>my soul</hi> for <hi>thine,</hi> thou art saved. Get me any <hi>temporary</hi> that loves God, and I shall say something to you. Hast thou then a faith that causeth thee to <hi>love God,</hi> a <hi>working</hi> faith, and a faith that will not suffer thee to do any thing displeasing to him? if thou hast such a faith, thou art <hi>justified</hi> before God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And so I come now to the point of justification, the greatest of all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings: <hi>Blessed is he</hi> (saith <hi>David) whose transgression is forgiven, and whose sin is covered; blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity:</hi> It is the most blessed condition that can be; it is set down by way of <hi>Exclamation. O, the blessedness of the man, to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity!</hi> or, as the Original imports; <hi>O, the blessedness of the man discharged from sin.</hi> Here are many blessings conceived in our justification from sin. For justification, see what it is; the Scripture in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, speaks of <hi>justification by faith</hi>; and in St <hi>James,</hi> of <hi>justification by works.</hi> Now it will be useful to us in this point to know whence <hi>justification</hi> comes; it comes from <hi>justice, Tsedeck,</hi> as the Original hath it, and <hi>Hitsdiq,</hi> to <hi>justifie</hi>; so that <hi>justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>righteousness</hi> depend one upon the other; for what is <hi>justification</hi> but the manifestation of the <hi>righteousness</hi> that is in a man? And therefore in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. they are put for one the same thing: <hi>For if there had been a Law given which could have given life, verily righteousness had been by the Law</hi>; that is, justification had been by the Law. Again, <hi>If righteousness be by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain,</hi> Gal. 2. that is, also, if justification had been by the Law, <hi>&amp;c. Justification is a manifestation</hi> of <hi>righteousness</hi>; and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways as <hi>righteousness</hi> is taken, so many ways is <hi>justification,</hi> which is a declaration of righteousness; so that if there be <hi>a double righteousness,</hi> there must be also a <hi>double justification.</hi> Beloved, I bring you no <hi>new doctrine</hi>; be not afraid of that; but I shew you how to <hi>reconcile</hi> places of Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and those things which the Papists bring against us in this <hi>point.</hi> It stands by reason, seeing justification is a declaration of righteousness, that there must be so many sorts of <hi>justification,</hi> as there be of <hi>righteousness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now there is a double sort of <hi>righteousness,</hi> Rom. 8.4. <hi>That the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law may be fulfilled in us</hi>; see then there is a double <hi>righteousness</hi>; there is a <hi>righteousness fulfilled in us, and a righteousness fulfilled by us, that is walking in the Spirit.</hi> The righteousness <hi>fulfilled</hi> in us, is fulfilled by <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and is made ours by <hi>imputation</hi>; so we have a <hi>righteousness without us,</hi> and a <hi>righteousness inherent in us: the righteousness without us, is forgiveness of sins,</hi> and pardon of them, which is a <hi>gracious</hi> act of God, <hi>letting fall</hi> all <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> againsts me, and <hi>accounting</hi> of me, as if I had never sinned against him all my life time; then there is a <hi>righteousness within me,</hi> an inherent righteousness. And if <hi>a righteousness,</hi> then justification; for that is but a <hi>declaration of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi> And so that which the Fathers call <hi>justification,</hi> is taken general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for <hi>sanctification</hi>; that which we call <hi>justification,</hi> they call <hi>forgiveness of sins</hi>; that which we call <hi>sanctification,</hi> they call <hi>justification</hi>: so that the difference is only in the terms. <hi>Justification</hi> we must know, is not taken only as opposed to condemnation, which is the first kind of righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.7. <hi>He that is dead, is freed from sin</hi>; if you look to the Greek, or to the Margent, it is, <hi>he that is dead, is justified from sin:</hi> This is not took in the first sense as opposed to condemnation, but in the other sense as it hath relation to final grace. The perfection of sanctification is wrought in me; for where there is final grace, there is a <hi>supersedeas</hi> from all sin; so <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. <hi>Let him that is righteous, be righteous still</hi>; the Greek is, <hi>let him that is righteous, be justified still.</hi> See then the <hi>difference</hi> between St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and St.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99037:71"/>
                        <hi>James.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of that which consists in <hi>remission of sins,</hi> as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the Apostle with <hi>David</hi> will appear, <hi>Blessed is the man whose sins are forgiven.</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> speaks of <hi>justification</hi> in the second acception. You need not fly to that distinction of <hi>justification before God,</hi> and <hi>justification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men</hi>: Think not that St. <hi>James</hi> speaks only of justification before men; <hi>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered up Isaac on the Altar?</hi> What, justified by killing his Son? this was a proper work indeed to justifie him before man, to be a parricide; to kill his son, though it were not so before God. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. we read how God accounted the act of <hi>Phineas for righteousness:</hi> Thus you see how works are accounted righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the second kind of righteousness. In the former righteousness we are justified by faith, for in righteousness inherent there is goodly chain of vertues; <hi>Add to your faith vertue,</hi> &amp;c. add one grace to another; <hi>Add to vertue, knowledge:</hi> Faith is but one part of the Crown. Now this justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the first sense, whereby my sins are forgiven, is called <hi>the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God,</hi> because of Christ which is God, because it is wrought by Christ, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. he is called <hi>an everlasting righteousness,</hi> which continueth for ever, world without end; for do not think the Saints in heaven have only the second kind of righteousness, for they have the same covering by justication by Christ in heaven, that they had before. God <hi>covers</hi> their sins, not <hi>here</hi> only, but <hi>there</hi> also; <hi>justification</hi> follows them for ever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Quest.</hi> But now, what parts hath justification in it? we are wont to say that there are two parts; one <hi>imputation of righteousness,</hi> the other <hi>forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> I answer; for my own part I think <hi>Justification is one simple act of God, and that it is improperly distinguished as parts; but rather as</hi> terminus a quo <hi>is distinct from</hi> terminus ad quem. And this I shall shew unto you both by <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> that faith is but one act.</p>
                     <p>Let none say that I take away the imputation of the righteousness of Christ: No; the bringing in of light, and the expulsion of darkness is not two acts, but one; but there is <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> and <hi>terminus ad quem.</hi> We are accounted <hi>righteous,</hi> and that is, we have our <hi>sins forgiven.</hi> And the reason is this; if sin were a positive thing, and had a being in it self, then the forgiveness of sin must be a thing distinct from the imputation of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Scholars know the difference between <hi>adversa</hi> and <hi>privantia, white</hi> and <hi>black</hi> are both existent, but <hi>darkness</hi> and <hi>light</hi> are not, but only a <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> one of another. <hi>Darkness</hi> is nothing of it self, but the <hi>absence</hi> of light; The bringing in of light is the suppression of it: You must understand sin hath no being, no entity; it is only an absence of righteousness, the <hi>want</hi> of that <hi>light</hi> which should be in the <hi>subject</hi>: Which want is either in our <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and then it is called <hi>original</hi>; or in our <hi>person</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> and then it is called <hi>actual transgression.</hi> Sin is an absence of that positive being, which is, as I said, either in our <hi>nature,</hi> or <hi>works.</hi> Then thus I will resolve you in another point, <hi>viz.</hi> If sin were a positive thing, all the world cannot avoid it, but God must be the Author of it; for there is nothing can have a <hi>being,</hi> but it must derive its <hi>being</hi> from the first <hi>being,</hi> God. Now, how can we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void God's being the Author of sin? Why <hi>thus</hi>; It is <hi>nothing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what, is sin nothing? Will God <hi>damn</hi> a man, and send him to hell for <hi>nothing?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answer, it is not such a <hi>nothing</hi> as you make it; a man is not damned for <hi>nothing.</hi> It is a nothing privative, an <hi>absence</hi> of that that <hi>should be,</hi> and that a man <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>have.</hi> As when a Scholar is whipped for not saying his <hi>lesson,</hi> is he <hi>whipped,</hi> think you, for <hi>nothing?</hi> Indeed he hath nothing, he cannot say a word of his lesson, and therefore it is he is <hi>whipped</hi>; it is for a thing he ought to have, and hath not. Well, if you will say there are two parts of <hi>justification,</hi> do if you please; but this I take to be the more proper and genuine explanation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:99037:71"/>Besides, it appears by testimony of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. <hi>As</hi> David <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth the blessedness of the man, to whom the Lord imputeth righteousness without works,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Saying, blessed are they, whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</hi> The Apostle cites the Prophet <hi>David. Psal.</hi> 32. Mark the Apostle's conclusion, and how he proves it. His conclusion is, <hi>That man is blessed, unto whom the Lord imputeth righteousness without works.</hi> His argument then must needs be thus framed.</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>He whom God forgives, is blessed;</p>
                        <p>But Him, to whom God imputeth righteousness without works, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives;</p>
                        <p>Therefore he is blessed.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>Now, how could this assumption hold, if <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>righteousness,</hi> and <hi>remission</hi> of <hi>sins</hi> were two distinct acts? for, not <hi>imputing righteousness,</hi> is, not to bring in a light which keeps out darkness. But observe, the Apostle to the <hi>Colossians</hi> and <hi>Ephesians,</hi> makes this <hi>forgiveness of sins</hi> the whole work, nay, foundation of our redemption. But here remember, I deny not the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of righteousness</hi>; for that is the <hi>foundation</hi> of the other; here is the point. How is Christ's righteousness imputed to me? that positive thing, which expels the other? Not so, as if Christ's righteousness were in me <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively</hi>; for it was wrought by his <hi>passion</hi> as well as his <hi>action.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle calls it <hi>faith in his blood</hi>; by faith in Christ, Christ's passive obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is imputed to me. What do you think the meaning is, that God doth esteem me, as if I had hanged on the Cross, and as if I had my <hi>side</hi> pierced? No, that would not stead me, or do me any good; that which was <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> and <hi>singular</hi> in him, did reach to us: So that the meaning is this, as it is in the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> That <hi>we are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by faith, and not for our own works and deservings</hi>; that is, <hi>for the merits of Jesus Christ, God is well pleased with the obedience of his Son, both active and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive: He is so far satisfied, as that he takes us to be in that state for his sake, as if we had fulfilled all his Laws, and never broken them at any time, and as if we owed him not a farthing:</hi> This is imputative righteousness, however the Papists may scoff at it. And this kind of <hi>justification</hi> must of necessity be by <hi>imputation:</hi> Why? because, when a man hath committed <hi>a sin,</hi> it cannot be <hi>undone</hi> again: God, by his absolute power, cannot make a thing <hi>done, undone</hi>; for it implies a <hi>contradiction.</hi> The act <hi>past</hi> cannot be <hi>revoked,</hi> nor the nature thereof changed; murther will be murther still, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How then can I be <hi>justified,</hi> the sin being past, and the <hi>nature</hi> of it still <hi>remaining?</hi> I say, how can I be justified in the first sense any other way than by <hi>imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> It is said in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was, in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them,</hi> &amp;c. This kind of <hi>justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which consists in remission of sins, cannot be <hi>imputative</hi>; sin cannot be <hi>changed,</hi> nor the thing <hi>done, undone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now cometh a greater question: if by justification our sins be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us, what <hi>sins</hi> are forgiven, I pray? sins <hi>past,</hi> or sins to <hi>come?</hi> we are taught by some, that in the instant of <hi>justification,</hi> all our sins <hi>past</hi> and to <hi>come</hi> are <hi>remitted</hi>; which is in my mind an <hi>unsound doctrine:</hi> For if we look narrowly into it, we shall find that in propriety of speech, <hi>remission</hi> of <hi>sins</hi> hath <hi>relation</hi> to that which is <hi>past</hi>; it is said therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.</hi> And remission of sins hath relation to those that are past, as appears by inevitable reason; for what is remission of sins, but <hi>sin covered?</hi> Now can a thing be <hi>covered</hi> before it be? <hi>blot out mine iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.1.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99037:72"/>
saith <hi>David</hi>; can a thing be <hi>blotted</hi> out, before it is <hi>written?</hi> this is the thing makes the Pope so ridiculous, that he will <hi>forgive</hi> sins for the time <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> they are <hi>committed</hi>; but what , do we get nothing for the time to come? yes, yes, when the sin is past, by faith we have a new access unto God; and having risen by repentance, we get a new act, not of <hi>universal ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,</hi> but of a <hi>particular justification</hi> from <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> particular sin.</p>
                     <p>But if there be forgiveness of sins past already, and I know that I am ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, and my sin remitted; may I now pray for forgiveness of sins past? The Papists say it is <hi>active infidelity,</hi> and as absurd as to pray to God to <hi>create</hi> the <hi>world</hi> anew, or <hi>incarnate</hi> his Son again.</p>
                     <p>But there is no <hi>remission</hi> where there is no <hi>praying</hi>; and there is need of <hi>praying</hi> for the <hi>remission</hi> of sins <hi>past,</hi> and against sin for the <hi>time</hi> to <hi>come,</hi> as I shall shew next time; as also, consider whether there be any interruption of the act of justification by falling into great sins. There is no man hath a mind more against <hi>quierks</hi> and <hi>quillets</hi> than I; yet for the opening of these things, and <hi>staying</hi> and <hi>setling</hi> the mind, and clearing the understanding, give me leave the next time to clear these things unto you.</p>

                     <p>Concerning the first of these I told you, that it was not every faith that <hi>justifieth,</hi> nor every kind of faith that a man can live by. There is a <hi>dead faith,</hi> and a man cannot live by a <hi>dead thing:</hi> And there is a <hi>living faith,</hi> and that is called <hi>a faith unfeigned.</hi> And though it be in Scripture called the <hi>faith,</hi> yet it is with some <hi>restriction; it is the faith of God's elect</hi>; and common to none besides. There is a faith also which is but <hi>temporary</hi>; that being touch'd with the sense of sin, and seeing there is no deliverance from the <hi>curse</hi> due to <hi>sin,</hi> but by <hi>Christ</hi>; and that there is no part to be had in Christ, but by renouncing all <hi>corruptions</hi>; the consideration of the <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness</hi> of his case without Christ, makes him <hi>long</hi> after him; and since he cannot have Christ without <hi>leaving sin,</hi> he will resolve on that too; he will make towards Christ, and perhaps he comes to taste of the <hi>sweetness</hi> of Christ, and <hi>feels</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> to come; he <hi>forsakes</hi> sin, and thereby comes so near the <hi>true believer,</hi> that a man must as it were, <hi>cut a hair</hi> to divide between them. And this is a thing very necessary to be considered of.</p>
                     <p>And I shewed unto you also that these are not <hi>moral things</hi>; not a faith that is wrought by the <hi>power</hi> of men, but by a <hi>work</hi> of God's <hi>Spirit</hi>; for it <hi>humbles</hi> a man for sin, and makes him <hi>make</hi> toward Christ, and seek him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, and having laid some hold on him, he escapes the <hi>pollutions</hi> of the world, and yet this faith is but <hi>temporary</hi>; a thing <hi>supernatural</hi> it is, yet it is <hi>without root.</hi> Now as I noted unto you, this is not <hi>different</hi> in the <hi>circumstance</hi> of <hi>time</hi>; for time alters not the thing. A child that <hi>liveth</hi> but half an hour, doth as <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>truly live,</hi> as one that <hi>liveth</hi> a <hi>hundred years.</hi> But it is called <hi>temporary,</hi> not that therein stands the <hi>difference,</hi> but therein it is shewn, and that proves the man to have <hi>something wanting.</hi> Our being <hi>united</hi> to Christ, and being nigh unto him, is as <hi>a graft</hi> or <hi>scyons</hi> put into a Tree; there are two <hi>grafts</hi> put into one <hi>stock,</hi> and each of them have all the several things necessary done unto them, as <hi>cutting, binding,</hi> &amp;c.

yet time discovers that the one <hi>thrives,</hi> and the other <hi>withers</hi>; so that there was a fault unseen; though he that put in the <hi>gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The use of it is in brief, this faith, (I mean the <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in the marks I shewed before that it was such a thing as may be likened to a <hi>conception</hi> which never comes to the <hi>birth</hi>; such a thing is this <hi>temporary faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among others let me add the tokens of love; it is twice set down in the <hi>Galatians, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision</hi>; &amp;c. but <hi>faith which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by love</hi>; and again, <hi>neither circumcision,</hi> &amp;c. but the <hi>new creature.</hi> They that have a temporary faith want nothing but the <hi>new creature</hi>; what's that? it's <hi>faith that worketh by love.</hi> They that <hi>love</hi> God, it's a <hi>sure token</hi> that God hath <hi>loved</hi> them first, and God never giveth this love to any but they have <hi>faith unfeigned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next thing is, he is ever <hi>careful</hi> to <hi>try himself,</hi> to <hi>prove</hi> himself. The <hi>temporary</hi> cannot endure to be brought to the <hi>touch</hi> or <hi>trial.</hi> He accounts every <hi>beginning</hi> of grace in himself very <hi>great</hi>; every <hi>Mole-hill</hi> to be a <hi>Mountain.</hi> Now God's children know that they may be deceived with counterfeits, and therefore they try themselves.</p>
                     <p>Mark the speech of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Examine your selves, prove your own selves; know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates?</hi> Let us understand the words; first, we see then it is a thing that is <hi>possible</hi> to be known, whether we are in <hi>the faith,</hi> or no; and this is <hi>flat</hi> against the <hi>Papists</hi>; for they think a man can have but a <hi>conjectural knowledge,</hi> that he hath <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>faith.</hi> It may be <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> they say, but it cannot be <hi>certainly</hi> known; but does not the Apostle say, <hi>Examine your selves, prove your selves, know you not your selves,</hi> &amp;c. No <hi>Papist</hi> can <hi>know</hi> it, yet it is <hi>possible</hi> to be known. <hi>Prove</hi> and <hi>try,</hi> you shall not <hi>lose</hi> your <hi>labour.</hi> If you take <hi>pains</hi> in it, you shall <hi>attain</hi> it in this world. <hi>Make your calling and election sure,</hi> saith the Apostle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. on God's part it is <hi>sure</hi> enough, <hi>for the foundation of God standeth sure,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. but make it <hi>sure</hi> unto your <hi>selves,</hi> in <hi>respect</hi> of your own <hi>knowledge. Know you not your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates:</hi> It is a thing may well be made <hi>sure</hi> of; therefore <hi>search, try, examine,</hi> &amp;c. Others are content with <hi>bare beginnings</hi> that never come to any <hi>maturity</hi>; but those that have <hi>true faith,</hi> are ever bringing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the <hi>trial</hi> and <hi>touch-stone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But may some say, I have <hi>tryed</hi> and <hi>examined</hi> my self, and I do not find that <hi>Christ is in me</hi>; what am I a <hi>reprobate therefore?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No: God forbid: I say not the man is a <hi>reprobate</hi> that cannot discern that Christ <hi>is in him</hi>; See what that is that will explain this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. <hi>For there

                        </gap>. But he which has this <hi>saving faith,</hi> he is ever putting himself to the <hi>trial.</hi> Again, God's child, not only useth the means in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>try himself,</hi> but he prayeth for the <hi>aid of God</hi> also; he knoweth that his <hi>own heart</hi> is <hi>deceitful,</hi> and may <hi>cozen</hi> him, but that <hi>God is greater than his heart, and knoweth all things.</hi> And therefore he cryeth unto God to try him, as Psal. 139.23. <hi>Try me, O God, and know my heart; prove me, and know my thoughts; look; look well whether there be any way of wickedness in me, and lead me in the way everlasting</hi>; there is an <hi>everlasting righteousness,</hi> and an <hi>everlasting way</hi> that leads unto it, about which these are not content to <hi>try</hi> themselves <hi>only,</hi> but they desire <hi>God</hi> to <hi>try</hi> them <hi>also</hi>; and to make them <hi>know</hi> the <hi>uprightness</hi> of <hi>their own hearts,</hi> and not to suffer them to be <hi>deceived</hi> thereby. Now that I have done with.</p>
                     <p>Consider now what <hi>that justification</hi> is, that is obtained by this <hi>true lively faith</hi>; I shewed unto you that <hi>justification</hi> is ordinarily taken for an <hi>acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> from <hi>a debt.</hi> It is derived from justice or righteousness; therefore I shewed that <hi>justification</hi> and <hi>righteousness</hi> are taken for one and the self-same thing; <hi>for if there had been a Law given which could,</hi> &amp;c. that is, justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been by the Law. Now as there is a <hi>double righteousness,</hi> so there is also a <hi>double justification.</hi> Not that I hold there is any <hi>other justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> as it comprehends remission of sins, but only one, but other ways, as <hi>many righteousnesses</hi> as there are, so many <hi>justifications</hi> there are. Now there is a <hi>double kind</hi> of <hi>righteousness,</hi> the one <hi>imputed,</hi> and the other <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>; the one is the righteousness of Christ, an <hi>act transient</hi> from <hi>another,</hi> which cannot be made <hi>mine</hi> but <hi>by imputation.</hi> Besides this, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is <hi>inherent,</hi> a righteousness in us. S. <hi>James</hi> speaks of the one, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> of the other. One is opposed to <hi>condemnation,</hi> and the other to <hi>hypocrisie.</hi> The soundness of the heart is respected of God for <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> in respect of the graces inherent in us.</p>
                     <p>Now to give you a touch of the <hi>difference</hi> between the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therein to declare the <hi>difference</hi> between us and <hi>Rome</hi>: Know then, that the question between us and <hi>Rome,</hi> is not Whether <hi>justification be by faith or no?</hi> but whether there be any such thing as <hi>justification or no?</hi> The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome is, that there is no such Grace as this.</p>
                     <p>But concerning the first of these, that <hi>justification which is by the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ's righteousness,</hi> I shewed unto you that imputation in this case, is, as when a man comes to hold up his hand at <hi>God's Bar,</hi> as it were, and it's demanded of him what he hath to say for himself, why he should not <hi>die</hi>; and then this <hi>justification by Christs righteousness is opposed to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> Then <hi>justification by faith,</hi> is, that when I come to stand before God, though conscience say I am guilty of a <hi>thousand sins,</hi> yet I may go <hi>boldly</hi> and <hi>plead</hi> my <hi>pardon,</hi> which will acquit me, as if I had never sinned at any time. <hi>God was thus in Christ reconciling us (the world) unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, not imputing their sins unto them.</hi> Now <hi>sin</hi> is a thing <hi>past,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>done,</hi> cannot be made <hi>undone,</hi> the sin remains still: murder is murder still; and adultery is adultery still; it cannot be undone again. Now how shall this man that is guilty of murder and adultery be made <hi>just?</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99037:74"/>
not possibly be but by not imputing his sin unto him, so that God should account it to him, as if it had not been done at all by him; he puts it upon Christ's account; <hi>Account</hi>: The word is used in the Epist. to <hi>Philemon,</hi> v. 18. where S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account.</hi> A mans sins being thus put upon Christ's account, he is <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi> of God as <hi>freely</hi> as if he had never <hi>owed</hi> him any thing, or as if he had never <hi>offended</hi> him. Now this is done by <hi>transferring</hi> the debt from one person to another; so that we see this <hi>imputation</hi> of sin to Christ, and of Christ's <hi>righteousness</hi> to us is most <hi>necessary.</hi> It must be so: And if there were no testimony for it in Scripture, yet reason sheweth that there can be no righteousness, but by God's acceptation of us in Christ, as if we had never sinned; there is the difference then. <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is accounted to him for righteousness.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But <hi>doth God justifie the ungodly?</hi> that's a hard speech; we read in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> 17.15. <hi>He that justifieth the wicked, and condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here we must understand this as we do some other Scriptures; we read in S. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.22. that <hi>the blind see, the lame walk, the dumb speak.</hi> It's impossible for a man to be <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>see,</hi> to be <hi>dumb</hi> and <hi>speak,</hi> all at once; yet take the chief of sinners, suppose <hi>Paul,</hi> and he was so in his own <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>; but the <hi>act</hi> of <hi>justification</hi> alters him. God <hi>justifies</hi> the <hi>ungodly,</hi> that is, him that was even now so; but by the <hi>imputation</hi> of Christ's righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness he is made righteous, that is, <hi>righteous</hi> in God's <hi>account.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>justification</hi> in S. <hi>Paul's</hi> acception, importing the <hi>remission of sins,</hi> the person justified must of necessity be supposed to have been a sinner; otherwise remission of sins would no more concern him, than repentance doth the holy Angels which never offended.</p>
                     <p>But in proceeding in this point I did reflect a little back. God finds a man with a <hi>number</hi> of <hi>sins, full</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> and forgives these sins; now I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded this; how <hi>far</hi> doth this <hi>justification</hi> and <hi>forgiveness</hi> extend? to sins <hi>past</hi> alone, or to sins <hi>past</hi> and <hi>to come</hi>? And I answered that we must consider this matter <hi>two ways.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, to justifie a mans person simply; and then to justifie a man from <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that particular act:</hi> The phrase is used in Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. <hi>And by him all that believe, are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the Law of Moses.</hi> There is justification from <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> thing: There is first, <hi>Justification of a man's person</hi>; he that was an <hi>enemy,</hi> is now made a <hi>friend</hi>; he is now no <hi>longer</hi> a stranger at home, but is in the list of God's houshold. Now this we say, no sooner doth a man <hi>receive</hi> it, but the self-same hour that he <hi>receiveth</hi> it, the <hi>bond</hi> is <hi>cancell'd,</hi> the <hi>evidence</hi> is <hi>torn,</hi> and <hi>fastened</hi> to the <hi>Cross</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and hangs up among the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,</hi> whereas before it was an <hi>evidence</hi> against us, and would have lain <hi>heavy</hi> on us at the <hi>bar</hi>; but now it is fastened to the Cross, as a <hi>cancell'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> the <hi>bond</hi> is become <hi>void.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, but now when we consider <hi>justification from this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act</hi>; I declared that so a man is only <hi>justified from sins past</hi>; for it is contrary to <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> that a man should be <hi>justified</hi> from sins to <hi>come:</hi> For Scripture, the Apostle hath it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God</hi>; and it is clear also from the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing.</hi> A <hi>thing</hi> cannot be <hi>remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> before it be <hi>committed,</hi> nor <hi>covered</hi> before it had an <hi>existence,</hi> nor <hi>blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> out before it be <hi>written.</hi> Therefore <hi>justification</hi> from <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such</hi> a fault, must have relation to that which is <hi>past</hi>; but for <hi>justification</hi> for the <hi>time to come,</hi> I will speak anon; there I left the last time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="tcp:99037:74"/>I have now <hi>faith,</hi> and I believe in Christ; I have now <hi>relation</hi> to him, and <hi>remission</hi> of sins past. But why then do I pray for it? to what end is that? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> objects that it is an <hi>act of infidelity</hi> to pray for it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but we do it, and we ought to do it; see <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>David</hi> made that Psalm after the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> had told him his <hi>sin</hi> was <hi>pardoned</hi>; See the title of it, (and we must know that the title is a part of God's word as well as the rest) <hi>A Psalm of</hi> David <hi>when</hi> Nathan <hi>came unto him, after he had gone in unto Bathsheba: Nathan</hi> told him <hi>that God had took away his sin:</hi> Yet he cryeth here throughout the whole <hi>Psalm,</hi> to have his <hi>sin pardoned</hi> and <hi>blotted</hi> out; so that though there were <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>assurance,</hi> yet he still <hi>prays</hi> for it. Now <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, this cannot be; but doth he dispute against our opinion? no, he disputes against the Holy Ghost; for <hi>David</hi> having received a <hi>message</hi> of forgiveness, yet <hi>prays.</hi> Therefore if the Jesuit had <hi>grace,</hi> he would joyn with us to salve the matter, rather than through our <hi>sides</hi> to strike at <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is a Fallacy to joyn these two together; for a man to <hi>pray</hi> for a <hi>thing past,</hi> it is an <hi>act of infidelity</hi>; as to <hi>pray</hi> that God would <hi>create</hi> the world, and <hi>incarnate</hi> his <hi>Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answer, there is difference between <hi>an act done, and an act continued</hi>; when the <hi>World was made by God, God had finished that work.</hi> And when <hi>Christ took our flesh upon him, the act was done</hi>; but the <hi>forgiveness of sin is a continued act,</hi> which holds to <hi>day</hi> and to <hi>morrow,</hi> and <hi>world without end.</hi> God is pleased not to <hi>impute</hi> thy sins, but <hi>cover</hi> them; Now this covering is no <hi>constant act,</hi> but upon a supposition of <hi>constant indulgence,</hi> which ought to be solicited by <hi>constant prayer.</hi> I may cover a thing <hi>now,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it <hi>again</hi>; now forgiveness of sin being an <hi>act</hi> not <hi>complete,</hi> but <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,</hi> and continued world without end (and therefore we say the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven are justified by <hi>imputative righteousness, God's continuance of his act of mercy.</hi>) The point then is this; As long as we continue in the world, and by contrary acts of disobedience continue to <hi>provoke</hi> God to <hi>disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his former acts of mercy,</hi> and our sins being but <hi>covered,</hi> therefore <hi>so long</hi> must we pray for <hi>forgiveness.</hi> When the servant had humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self before his Lord, it is said, <hi>The Lord of that servant loosed him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave him the debt,</hi> Mat. 18.27. But though he forgave him, yet he did ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act that caused his Lord to <hi>discontinue</hi> his <hi>pardon,</hi> Matth. 18.33. <hi>Shouldst not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant, as I had pity on thee</hi>? He had pity on him; yet since he doth another act, which turns his Lord's heart against him, therefore <hi>he is now cast into prison, and he must not come out thence till he hath paid the utmost farthing.</hi> He had <hi>forgave</hi> him <hi>to day</hi> and <hi>to morrow,</hi> and would have <hi>continued</hi> his <hi>forgiveness,</hi> if he had not thus <hi>provoked</hi> him; we must pray to God to <hi>continue</hi> his <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>mercy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we continually provoke him by <hi>new acts</hi> of <hi>rebellion.</hi> Add to this, The King grants a <hi>pardon</hi> to a man; In all <hi>Patents</hi> of <hi>pardon</hi> there is a <hi>clause</hi> that the man must <hi>renew</hi> his <hi>Patent.</hi> If <hi>forgiveness</hi> may be <hi>renewed,</hi> then those things are to be <hi>renewed</hi> again, by which the <hi>renovation</hi> of my <hi>remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> may be wrought. God would have me <hi>renew</hi> my <hi>acts</hi> of faith; and if of faith, why not of <hi>repentance,</hi> and of <hi>prayer?</hi> There is a singular place in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.29, 35, 37. that makes it plain, That though God intends to do the thing, yet he appoints this to be the means. <hi>Thus saith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them</hi>; (i.e.) though I <hi>have</hi> done it, and <hi>intend</hi> to do it, yet will I do it by the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>prayer.</hi> Howsoever that God had promised <hi>Eliah, that rain should come upon the face of the earth</hi>; yet he goes upon the Mount, and saw no shew of a cloud.

So we see the <hi>mediate cause</hi> is <hi>prayer</hi>; so though the Lord will do this, yet <hi>for all this he will be enquired of:</hi> It is not with <hi>God</hi> as with <hi>men</hi>; men, who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, would be loth to be sued to, not to <hi>break</hi> their <hi>promise</hi>; they <hi>account</hi> that a <hi>dishonour</hi> to them, but it is <hi>not so</hi> with God; God hath <hi>promised,</hi> yet thou shalt have no benefit of it, until thou sue to him for it; therefore thou must go to God and say, <hi>Lord fulfil thy promise to thy servant, wherein thou hast caused me to trust.</hi> God loves to have his <hi>bond</hi> sued out. Lord, <hi>make good</hi> this word, perform that <hi>good word</hi> that thou hast spoken. God would have his <hi>bond</hi> thus <hi>sued out.</hi> And as thy <hi>faith, repentance, prayer</hi> is <hi>renewed,</hi> so is thy <hi>pardon renewed.</hi> When God will make a man possess the sins of his youth; when a man is <hi>careless</hi> this way, it pleaseth God to <hi>awaken</hi> him. <hi>Thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of my youth,</hi> Job 13.26. When a man <hi>forgetteth</hi> the <hi>iniquities</hi> of his <hi>youth,</hi> and <hi>reneweth</hi> not his <hi>repentance,</hi> and hath not <hi>new acts</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>petition,</hi> then God maketh him to <hi>possess the iniquities of his youth</hi>; he makes his <hi>sins</hi> stand up and <hi>cry out</hi> against him, and by this means his <hi>old evidences</hi> are <hi>obliterated.</hi> When a man hath a <hi>pardon,</hi> and it's almost <hi>obliterated,</hi> the <hi>letters</hi> almost <hi>worn out,</hi> that they cannot be <hi>read,</hi> he would be glad to have it <hi>renewed,</hi> to have a new <hi>exemplification.</hi> Every sin it puts a <hi>great blur</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thine old <hi>evidences</hi> that thou canst not read them, They may be <hi>firm in Heaven,</hi> and yet perhaps be so <hi>blurr'd</hi> that thou canst not read them, and therefore if thou wouldst get them clear'd again, thou must go to God by prayer, and <hi>renew them</hi> again; so that whether our <hi>evidences</hi> be <hi>blur'd,</hi> or whether it be that God will make us <hi>possess the iniquities of our youth,</hi> it is necessary to pray for the forgiveness of those sins, which have been before forgiven.</p>
                     <p>But now you will say, when I have sinned <hi>afterward,</hi> how come I then to be <hi>justified</hi>? Then a man would think <hi>repentance</hi> only doth it, and without <hi>repentance</hi> a man cannot be <hi>justified.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But you must <hi>understand, repentance</hi> is <hi>not an instrument</hi> at all; <hi>faith</hi> only is the <hi>instrument, faith justifyeth</hi> me from sin <hi>hereafter,</hi> as well as <hi>before.</hi> The case is this, faith brings lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>What do then new sins do?</p>
                     <p>There are two sorts of sins; one of <hi>ordinary incursion,</hi> which cannot be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided</hi>; these <hi>break</hi> no <hi>friendship</hi> betwixt <hi>God, and</hi> us; these only <hi>weaken our faith,</hi> and make us <hi>worse at ease.</hi> But there are other sins which <hi>waste</hi> a mans <hi>conscience</hi>; A man that hath committed <hi>murder, adultery,</hi> and lives in <hi>covetousness,</hi> which (in the Apostles) is <hi>Idolatry</hi>; as long as a man is in this <hi>case,</hi> he cannot exercise the <hi>acts of faith</hi>; we must know faith <hi>justifieth not as an habit,</hi> but as an <hi>act applying</hi> Christ to the comfort of the soul. Now a <hi>wasting sin</hi> it <hi>stops</hi> the <hi>passage</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> it cannot <hi>act</hi> till it be <hi>opened</hi> by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>; Physicians give <hi>instances</hi> for it. Those that have <hi>Apoplexies, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsies,</hi> and the <hi>Falling sickness,</hi> are thought to be dead for the time, as it was with <hi>Eutichus,</hi> yet saith Saint <hi>Paul, his spirit was in him,</hi> Act. 20.13. Every one thought him <hi>dead,</hi> yet his <hi>spirit</hi> is in him; however in regard of the <hi>operation</hi> of his <hi>senses</hi> it did appear he was <hi>dead.</hi> So, if thou art a careless man and lookst not to thy <hi>watch,</hi> and to thy <hi>guard,</hi> but art over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in some <hi>gross,</hi> and <hi>grievous</hi> sin, thou art taken for <hi>dead.</hi> I say not, a <hi>man can lose his life that once hath it</hi>; but yet in the <hi>apprehension</hi> of others, and of <hi>himself</hi> too, he may appear to be dead. As in <hi>Epilepsies,</hi> the <hi>nerves</hi> are hindred by <hi>obstructions</hi>; so <hi>sin obstructs</hi> the <hi>nerves</hi> of the soul, that there cannot be that <hi>life</hi> and <hi>working,</hi> till these sins be removed.

                     <p>In sin, we must consider <hi>two things</hi>; the <hi>fault</hi> and the <hi>punishment.</hi> Now consider <hi>sin</hi> as it is in it self, and as it respects the <hi>sinner,</hi> as <hi>acted</hi> by him, as respecting the fault of the sinner, it is <gap reason="foreign">

If he live an hundred years, he is a <hi>murderer</hi> still, and an <hi>adulterer</hi> still, the <hi>guilt follows him</hi>; and nothing can take away the murder, or adultery from the soul, but the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Christ applied</hi> by <hi>faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, God takes away the punishment. <hi>There is now</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit; Rom.</hi> 8.1. what, nothing in him worthy condemnation?

                     <p>This is a great matter, but I tell you there is more; <hi>we are not only freed from the guilt of the punishment, but, which is higher, we are freed from the guilt of the fact.</hi> I am now no more a <hi>murderer,</hi> no more a <hi>lyar</hi>; when I have received a <hi>pardon</hi> from the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ, he frees me from that <hi>charge,</hi> the <hi>world</hi> is <hi>changed with me now.

Imputation</hi> is without <hi>augmentation</hi> or <hi>diminution.</hi> Those things which have divers <hi>contraries,</hi> cannot be <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> thing. <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> have divers <hi>contraries.</hi> The contrary to justification is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi>; but the contrary to <hi>sanctification</hi> is <hi>wickedness,</hi> and false deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. <hi>Aristotle</hi> distinguisheth <hi>homonymous</hi> words, and bids you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their <hi>contraries</hi>; thus you see the difference between these two.</p>
                     <p>I should now come and descend unto the dependence one hath on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in what respect doth <hi>faith justifie?</hi> Is faith an <hi>instrument</hi> to work justification, or to <hi>receive</hi> it only?</p>
                     <p>The answer is clear, it <hi>justifieth</hi> in regard of the <hi>object.</hi> If you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the two places I bid you compare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood</hi>; is that all? compare this place with <hi>chap.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him</hi>; we are justified by <hi>his blood,</hi> and by <hi>faith in</hi> his <hi>blood</hi>: here are <hi>two acts</hi> which signifie the same thing. It is no more then to say, I was cured by the <hi>Bath,</hi> or by <hi>going</hi> to the <hi>Bath,</hi> so that saith is the legs of the soul, that bring a man to Christ. And so my faith is an <hi>instrument,</hi> not to <hi>procure</hi> my justification, but to <hi>receive</hi> it; so then seeing faith is an instrument, to receive <hi>justification,</hi> and not to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi> it, then the <hi>weakest</hi> faith carrieth away as much forgiveness as the <hi>strongest.</hi> A <hi>strong faith</hi> rids a great deal of work, because it is an <hi>active instrument.</hi> The <hi>stronger faith</hi> worketh the <hi>greater work</hi>; but in the point of <hi>justification,</hi> it is an instrument, whereby my <hi>justification</hi> is wrought, an instrument, whereby Christ is received. And the <hi>weakest</hi> hand may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> a piece of gold as well as the <hi>strongest</hi>; we must know that in the point of <hi>receiving,</hi> we live on <hi>Gods alms.</hi> All our <hi>justification</hi> is his free gift, and faith is that <hi>Palsie hand,</hi> which receives all our comfort. It is not then a strong faith that <hi>justifieth,</hi> but <hi>faith</hi>; it is called by <hi>Peter, a like preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faith.

Now, when God hath taken away our <hi>dross,</hi> then to think we shall be put in a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining fire</hi>; that an <hi>entire</hi> soul that hath no <hi>blot,</hi> that one that hath no <hi>spot,</hi> should be purged after <hi>final grace</hi> hath made him <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>whole,</hi> this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>common sense.</hi> They might have learned better of their own <hi>Thomas</hi>; all the <hi>fire in the world will never put away sin without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of grace.</hi> This by the way concerning them.</p>
                     <p>I shewed besides, that these <hi>two</hi> being both righteousnesses, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> confounds them both together: Saint <hi>James his justification with</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls.</hi> They confound <hi>inherent righteousness</hi> which is begun, and shall be perfected in final grace, with the <hi>other</hi>; so that the point is not between <hi>us</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> Whether <hi>faith justifieth by works</hi> or <hi>no?</hi> but Whether it justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth at all? In <hi>truth</hi> that is the <hi>state</hi> of it: The question is this, whether there be such a grace as justification that is distinguished from <hi>sanctification,</hi> or whether there be another grace of sanctification? Do not think that we are such <hi>block-heads</hi> as to deny <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>sanctification</hi>; yet <hi>faith</hi> is but a piece or part of that <hi>train</hi> of vertues. There justification is taken for san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; we acknowledge a man is justified by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>works</hi>: but the question is between us and them, whether there be any <hi>justification</hi> besides <hi>sanctification? (i. e.</hi>) whether there be any <hi>justification</hi> at all or <hi>no?</hi> we say <hi>sanctification</hi> is wrought by the <hi>Kingly</hi> office of Christ; he is a King that <hi>rules</hi> in our hearts, <hi>subdues</hi> our <hi>corruptions, governs</hi> us by the <hi>Sceptre</hi> of his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi>; but it is the fruit of his <hi>Priestly</hi> office which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> strikes at: (<hi>i. e.</hi>) whether Christ hath reserved another righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness for us, besides that, which as a <hi>King,</hi> he works in our hearts; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath wrought <hi>forgiveness</hi> of sins for us? we say he hath, and so saith all the Church, till the new <hi>Spawn</hi> of Jesuits arose. They distinguish not <hi>remission of sins, from sanctification. Bellarmine</hi> saith, <hi>remission of sins is the extinguishing of sin in the soul; as water,</hi> though it be <hi>cold,</hi> yet the bringing in of <hi>heat</hi> extinguishes the <hi>cold</hi>; and so <hi>remission</hi> of sins is the bringing in of <hi>inherent righteousness,</hi> which <hi>extinguisheth</hi> all <hi>sin,</hi> which was before. A <hi>strange thing,</hi> and were it not that the Scripture does speak of <hi>a cup in the hand of the Harlot of Rome, whereby she makes drunk the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the earth with the wine of her fornication,</hi> Rev. 17.4. &amp; 18.3. except the men of her communion were <hi>drunk,</hi> it were impossible that a <hi>learned men</hi> should thus shake out an Article of our and their Creed, which hath ever been believed by all the Churches. When the Scripture speaks of forgiveness of sins, see how it expresseth it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.32. <hi>Be ye kind one to another, Brethren, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Observe, <hi>in the Lord's Prayer,</hi> we pray that the <hi>Lord would forgive us
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99037:78"/>
our trespasses, as we forgive those that trespass against us.</hi> Let him that hath <hi>common understanding</hi> judge: Do we <hi>forgive</hi> our Neighbours by <hi>extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing sin in the subject?</hi> I <hi>forgive</hi> you; (<hi>i. e.</hi>) I take away the <hi>ill office</hi> you did me: Doth he forgive thus? Alas no! forgiveness is without a man. I have an <hi>action</hi> against you, perhaps an <hi>action</hi> at <hi>Law</hi>; I will let <hi>fall</hi> my suit, my <hi>charges</hi> I will <hi>forgive</hi>; this is <hi>forgiveness. God justifieth, who shall condemn?</hi> Though God has just cause to <hi>proceed</hi> against me as a <hi>Rebel,</hi> yet he is content to let <hi>fall</hi> his <hi>action,</hi> to fasten it upon the <hi>Cross</hi> of his Son; there to fix the <hi>Chirographum, the hand-writing against us,</hi> Colos. 2.14. He will let <hi>fall</hi> that which was the ground of a <hi>suit against</hi> us, all that he could say against us.</p>
                     <p>That you may understand the thing the better, there are two things, two <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>righteousness</hi>; the one of <hi>justification,</hi> the other of <hi>sanctification.</hi> The Holy Ghost distinguisheth them by several terms, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who is made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</hi> You see here are two distinct graces, <hi>righteousness and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi>; they make them but one, <hi>sanctification</hi> and <hi>remission of sins. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified,</hi> Rom. 8.30. Here <hi>justification</hi> and <hi>glorification</hi> are nothing else but justification and sanctification. St <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of a thing <hi>past,</hi> not of the <hi>glory to come</hi>; them he <hi>glorified,</hi> not <hi>shall glorifie:</hi> he means <hi>sanctification,</hi> which is <hi>inchoate glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> For what is the glory we shall have in heaven, but the <hi>enlargement</hi> of those <hi>inherent graces</hi> God begins in this world? Here is the <hi>seed,</hi> there is the <hi>crop</hi>; here thou hast a <hi>little knowledge,</hi> but there it shall be <hi>enlarged</hi>; now thou hast a <hi>little joy,</hi> there thou shalt <hi>enter</hi> into thy Master's <hi>joy</hi>; here <hi>some knowledge,</hi> but there thou shalt have a <hi>full knowledge,</hi> and a <hi>full measure.</hi> Here glory dwelleth in our Land, but there we <hi>shall with open faoe behold as in a glass the glory of the Lord, and be changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>(i. e.</hi>) we are more and more <hi>conformed</hi> to the image of Almighty God, by <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>holy qualities</hi> infused into us, that we grow from one degree of <hi>sanctification</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>another.</hi> And so you see how these are distinguished by their terms. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi> and <hi>glorification, justification</hi> and <hi>sanctification.</hi> There is another place in St. <hi>John,</hi> an hard place; but yet as I take it, these two righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that have the same name for justification and sanctification, are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesses both of them, to be distinct in their <hi>terms,</hi> in that place it is said, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. <hi>That when the Spirit shall come, he shall reprove; or</hi> (as we should translate it, and as you read it in the margin) <hi>he shall convince the world concerning sin, righteousness and judgment.</hi> Thus I say it should be <hi>translated,</hi> for it is of no sense to say that God should <hi>reprove</hi> the world of <hi>righteousness</hi>; on what occasion this was spoken, we must not stand to speak: but <hi>righteousness</hi> and <hi>judgment</hi> is <hi>justification</hi> and <hi>sanctification.</hi> And the <hi>drift</hi> of the place is this; when the Spirit shall come, how? not upon me or thee; but the Spirit here spoken of is that Spirit that should come upon the Apostles, it shall begin at the day of <hi>Pentecost</hi>; and these 1. should set forth like twelve <hi>Champions</hi> to <hi>conquer</hi> the world, and to bring them unto the <hi>Sceptre</hi> of Christ. He shall convince the world; <hi>(i e.</hi>) when the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit shall come on you, and your tongues be <hi>tipped</hi> with that <hi>spiritual fire,</hi> which shall be <hi>active</hi>; it shall convince the world of three particulars, <hi>of sin, righteousness and judgment:</hi> Of the point of humiliation for sins, the point of <hi>justification by righteousness imputative</hi>; and the <hi>glory of sanctification in judgment, and righteousness inherent.</hi> This method St. <hi>Paul</hi> useth in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to stop every man's mouth. First, <hi>He convinceth the Gentile, which was easie to be done; after he convinceth the Jew, that there is righteousness to be had in another, though none in my self.</hi> He shall convince the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

As if he should say, To be shut up under <hi>unbelief,</hi> is to be <hi>convinced</hi> of all sins. Now consider what is the nature of <hi>unbelief</hi>; it is to fasten all sins up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man: and when I have <hi>faith,</hi> all my sins are put out of <hi>possession,</hi> they <hi>are</hi> as if they were <hi>not</hi>; but if we are shut up under <hi>unbelief,</hi> we are <hi>dead.</hi> The second work of God's Spirit, is the <hi>Ministry of the Word; He shall convince the world that there is righteousness to be had by a communion with another; though we are guilty in our selves,</hi> yet he will set us free; and the reason is, <hi>because I go to my Father.</hi> As <hi>if he should say,</hi> though you be convinced of your sins, that you are wholly dead in trespasses and sins, and have no means in the world to put that away; yet notwithstanding, the second work of God's Spirit, is to <hi>convince of righteousness</hi>; that there is a righteousness to be had in Christ, because he was our <hi>Surety,</hi> arrested for <hi>debt</hi>; he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to prison, where he could not come out, till he had paid the utmost farthing.

Yes, <hi>to convince the world that there is judgment or righteousness inherent.</hi> There is a hard place, I shall speak of it; it is usual in Scripture to joyn <hi>righteousness and judgment toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The words of the Lord are righteousness and judgment.</hi> And the <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity</hi> of a man's heart which is opposed to <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> is called <hi>judgment; as God liveth who hath taken away my judgment,</hi> Job 27.2. How did God take away his <hi>judgment?</hi> is it meant that he had taken away his <hi>wits?</hi> No, but he hath put his heavy hand on me, that hath put a conceit in the mind of my friends that I am an hypocrite; though, to confront the error of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging friends, he was resolved to persist in his integrity; <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>My righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness I hold fast, and will not let it go; my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</hi> His <hi>judgment</hi> was taken away, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the <hi>opinion they had of his integrity:</hi> And this will expound another place in <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.20. <hi>A brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed reed shall he not break, and smoaking flax shall be not quench, until he send forth judgment unto victory?</hi> What is that, <hi>until he send forth judgment?</hi> This <hi>judgment</hi> signifies nothing but those <hi>inherent graces,</hi> those <hi>infused quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> that God sends into the heart of a Christian; which being produced in the children of God by the spirit of judgment, through which they are e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to judge what is right and acceptable to God in Christ, who is their wisdom, are themselves called judgment. You read therefore, of washing away the filth of the Daughters of <hi>Sion,</hi> and purging the blood of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which is the sanctification of the Church, by the spirit of <hi>judgment,</hi> Isa. 4.4. In a man's first <hi>conversion</hi> there are but beginnings of grace: what is <hi>faith, hope, patience</hi> and <hi>fear?</hi> it is like a <hi>smoaking flax, (i. e.</hi>) like the <hi>smoaking wick</hi> of a candle made of <hi>flax:</hi> as when a <hi>candle</hi> burns in the <hi>socket,</hi> it is now <hi>up,</hi> now <hi>down,</hi> you know not whether it be <hi>alive</hi> or <hi>dead</hi>; so in the first conversion of a Christian, <hi>infidelity</hi> and <hi>faith, hope</hi> and <hi>despair</hi> mount <hi>up</hi> and <hi>down.</hi> There is a <hi>conflict</hi> in the <hi>beginning</hi> of <hi>conversion,</hi> but he will not give it over until he bring forth <hi>judgment,</hi> until he get the <hi>victory</hi> of all opposition from the flesh. And what is the reason? <hi>Because the Prince of this world is judged.</hi> He shall convince the world of an <hi>inherent righteousness</hi> in <hi>spite</hi> of the Devil's <hi>teeth,</hi> because he is <hi>condemned.</hi> He that before worked in the children of <hi>disobedience,</hi> is now <hi>cast down.</hi> The <hi>strong man</hi> is cast out, and therefore, upon that ground you have the third point. Besides the grace of justification following upon Christ's death, there is <hi>another</hi>; the grace, I mean, of sanctification, through which the Devil shall be <hi>disposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>;

the Devil is strong where he doth <hi>wicked things,</hi> but he shall be <hi>disar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> he shall not touch thee, the wicked one shall not <hi>hurt</hi> thee, thou shalt overcome him.</p>
                     <p>I now go forward.</p>
                     <p>The third thing I noted besides faith and justification, was, Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> we must observe <hi>what relation one hath to the other; and how it comes to pass that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification is attributed to faith,</hi> there being more <hi>noble graces</hi> in us, than <hi>faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answer; the reason is because <hi>faith</hi> is brought as <hi>the only instrument, whereby we receive our justification,</hi> purchased by the <hi>merits</hi> of Christ's death. When we say faith is an <hi>instrument,</hi> we must <hi>understand</hi> it right well; we say not faith is an <hi>instrument</hi> to <hi>work</hi> my <hi>justification,</hi> Christ <hi>alone</hi> must do <hi>that</hi>; it is no <hi>act</hi> of <hi>ours,</hi> nothing is in us; <hi>faith</hi> is said to be an <hi>instrument,</hi> whereby we get our <hi>justification</hi> in respect of the <hi>object,</hi> it is a <hi>nearing</hi> us to Christ; it is the instrument of <hi>application,</hi> the only instrument whereby we <hi>apply</hi> the <hi>medicine,</hi> and the <hi>plaister</hi> of Christ's <hi>blood</hi>; whereby we that were <hi>strangers</hi>

Justification is attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to faith; Look on the word (<hi>only</hi>) whether it doth determine <hi>the subject or the predicate; doth faith which is alone severed from good works, justifie?</hi> so the proposition is false. First, that faith which is alone, separated from love and the fruits of good works, doth not justifie; but let the (<hi>alone</hi>) be put to the <hi>predicate; faith justifieth alone</hi>; (i. e.) <hi>faith is the only ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the soul whereby a man is justified,</hi> that is true: As if a man should say, the <hi>eye alone seeth,</hi> 'tis true; if we put it thus, the eye severed from the members of the body, seeth, it is false. If the eye were taken out of the head, it would neither see alone, nor at all; but the meaning is this, the living eye is the organ whereby a man discerns a visible object; so faith, though joyn'd with other graces, yet takes not other with it for helps of <hi>Justification.</hi>

                     <p>First, in respect of God.</p>
                     <p>I say 1. <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the Law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</hi> Rom. 4.16. so that here are <hi>two</hi> strong <hi>reasons</hi>; one in respect of God, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> God by so mean a thing as a beggars hand, should bring a man to <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi>; and the other in respect of <hi>faith</hi> it self, that it might be by grace, for when thou bringest nothing but a bare hand ready to receive a pardon, this must needs be of grace. If God say thou must <hi>love</hi> me, this were an <hi>exchange,</hi> not a <hi>free gift.</hi> I <hi>lay down</hi> something, and I <hi>take up</hi> something for it. <hi>Faith</hi> is that naked hand which fills it self with Christ, it layeth fast hold on Christ crucified with all his merits.</p>
                     <p>As if a man were ready to be <hi>drownd,</hi> there is a <hi>cable</hi> cast to him to <hi>lay hold</hi> on, and he <hi>laying hold on it,</hi> is drawn <hi>safe</hi> to the Land; but a man when he lays hold on the <hi>cable,</hi> must <hi>let go</hi> all his other <hi>holds</hi> which he <hi>laid hold on</hi> before. Thus must a man let go all other <hi>holds,</hi> and lay <hi>fast hold</hi> on <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Faith hath <hi>two faculties</hi>: 1. It <hi>opens its self</hi> to <hi>let fall</hi> all other things: And then 2. When it is a <hi>naked hand,</hi> it <hi>layeth hold</hi> on <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>then it is filled with Christ,</hi> when the believer esteems <hi>all dross in comparison of Christ</hi>; it hath all fulness by grace: <hi>Where is then rejoycing and boasting?</hi> Rom. 3.27. <hi>it is excluded; by what Law? of works? nay, but by the Law of faith.</hi> And then <hi>chap.</hi> 4.2. <hi>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory but not before God; faith taketh away all boasting. Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord. Therefore it is of faith that it might be of grace.</hi> This is the reason in respect of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In respect of our selves; <hi>To the end the promise might be sure to the seed</hi>; what is the reason why people doubt and think nothing sure; it is because they come not with <hi>a naked hand</hi>; I must have <hi>such</hi> a measure of <hi>humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> of <hi>patience</hi>; all to bring somewhat with us; whereas if we look on
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99037:80"/>
these things, we shall never be heard. If the bare <hi>acceptation</hi> of Christ, with a <hi>trembling</hi> hand will not make thee <hi>sure,</hi> thou understandest not the excellency of that very <hi>treasure</hi> whereof thou art possessed; what canst thou have more than the <hi>bare receiving</hi> of such a gift by faith? The reason why we are not more sure, is because we come not with a <hi>naked hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the way there are many means, some (<hi>à priori</hi>) others (<hi>à poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori.</hi>)</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For the first; they are those things by which faith is wrought, though they are not so <hi>evident,</hi> yet they are most <hi>sure</hi>; when I consider God calls me in <hi>my blood,</hi> having <hi>nothing</hi> in me, and will be <hi>friends with me,</hi> bids me take his Son, and I do not, bids me take his <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> with him, and I <hi>refuse</hi> it, though this be a matter not so evident, yet it is most <hi>sure.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>What this peace is.</hi> You know the point of <hi>peace</hi> is a great matter; it is the Apostolical Benediction: <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> in all the Epistles; <hi>Grace and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 Thes. 1.2. and chap. 3.16. <hi>Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace by all means always.</hi> This is a thing <hi>by all means</hi> to be desired, you must <hi>labour</hi> to get it; this was the <hi>Angels song</hi> when Christ was born, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14. <hi>Glory be to God on high, on earth peace, good will towards men.</hi> This <hi>peace</hi> is a thing by all means to be sought after, and what it is, you may know by the contrary; you know what a <hi>miserable</hi> thing <hi>war</hi> is; God grant you may not know it <hi>too soon:</hi> You know what it is to have an <hi>enemy</hi> among us. This is our case, till we be <hi>justified,</hi> we are at <hi>daggers drawing,</hi> at <hi>point</hi> of <hi>hostility</hi> with God. It is a foolish conceit for a man to think that by reason of God's <hi>predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> he is <hi>justified</hi> before he was; this is a <hi>foolish conceit</hi>; until thou art <hi>justified by faith,</hi> thou art not <hi>justified</hi> at all. God's <hi>predestination</hi> doth not make a <hi>change</hi> in the subject; if I <hi>intend</hi> to inrich a <hi>beggar,</hi> he is in <hi>rags</hi> still, for all my <hi>intention,</hi> till my <hi>intention</hi> be put in <hi>execution. Paul</hi> was <hi>elected</hi> before the <hi>foundation</hi> of the world; but till he was converted, he was an <hi>enemy,</hi> and <hi>a persecutor, the chief of sinners,</hi> as he speaks of himself, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. so the Scripture speaks in that point: <hi>If when we were enemies, we were reconciled unto God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life?</hi> Before the time of peace came, we were <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, enemies,</hi> in the <hi>state</hi> of <hi>enmity,</hi> when as before, God was thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, as soon as thou hast <hi>touched</hi> Christ by a lively faith, presently all the <hi>actions</hi> he had against thee are let fall; God is <hi>friends</hi> with thee; this is a <hi>high</hi> and a <hi>deep peace,</hi> and this comprehends all kind of blessings; <hi>Amasa,</hi> 1 Chron. 12.18. one of the valiantest Captains that <hi>David</hi> had, speaks there of peace; one would think it not so proper, it belongs not to them to talk of peace, but because <hi>peace</hi> comprehends all <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>blessing,</hi> it is said, <hi>Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Amasa, who was chief of the Captains, and he
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99037:80"/>
said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side thou Son of Jesse; peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be unto thy helpers, for thy God helpeth thee.</hi> This is a speech from a Soldier to a Soldier, and this is done in a military way; <hi>Peace</hi> is welcome though coming from a Warrior, because it comprehends all manner of Blessings; It's said, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.7. <hi>That when Vriah came unto David, David demanded of him how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.</hi> Look unto the Margin according to the original, and it is, <hi>He demanded of the peace of Joab, and the people, and of the peace of the War.</hi> A man would think it a contradiction that he should demand of the <hi>peace</hi> of the <hi>war</hi>; so then this peace which we have with Almighty God, after we are <hi>justified</hi> by faith, is the comprehension of all manner of good. This having peace with God is the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>But with whom is this peace? <hi>with God</hi>; it is not peradventure so with thy self: thou mayst have a turbulent conscience, insomuch that thou wouldst give all the world to have it quiet, to be assured that there is peace between God and thee; that's not the point: The thing thou gettest by faith <hi>is peace with God</hi>: When thou art troubled with thy self, and hast but a weak act of faith, yer if thou believest, thou art more afraid than hurt; thou art cock-sure, and shalt be calm and quiet in God's good time.</p>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> But why should Christians be so foolish, so troubled? what's the reason the children of God do disquiet themselves?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sol.</hi> Because they are fools, they stand in their own light, are straitned in their own bowels. God is liberal and free, but there is some hope of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness in us, and we do things we should not do. We are always <hi>poring</hi> on our selves, and do not bring a <hi>naked hand</hi>; and this is the reason we are so full of <hi>distractions</hi>: for he that seeks justification (I mean remission of sins) by his own performance, will never attain it. Observe what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaketh upon this point, <hi>Israel which followed after the law of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law.</hi> This was their <hi>stumbling stone,</hi> as he there saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32.</p>
                     <p>Again, it is the nature of many <hi>peevish</hi> people amongst us, that they <hi>will</hi> not be <hi>comforted</hi>; when news was brought to <hi>Jacob</hi> that <hi>Joseph</hi> was slain and lost, it is said, <hi>All his sons and daughters rose up to comfort him, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son, mourning,</hi> Gen. 37.35. They have a kind of <hi>pettishness,</hi> and <hi>peevishness,</hi> and <hi>wilfulness</hi>; they will not be <hi>comforted,</hi> and it may be there is some kind of <hi>pride</hi> in it too; they would perhaps be thought to be the only <hi>mourners</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> of the Kingdom. <hi>As Rachel mourned for her children, and would not be comforted,</hi> Matth. 2.18. they shut up their eyes against all comforts; God commands them to be comforted, and they will not; it is no marvel then that they eat the fruit of their own hands; it is a part of our office to bring comfort, we have an injunction to it; <hi>Comfort ye, Comfort ye my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, saith the Lord; we bring the tydings of peace, and our feet should be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,</hi> Rom. 10.15. we bring good news, all is well; as <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an <hi>Olive branch</hi> in her mouth. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye, cry aloud, spare not.</hi> If you stop your ears, who can help it? the Lord is gracious and chargeth us to comfort you: and can there be any better news than to say, All is peace, all your sins are done away. <hi>I have blotted as a thick cloud thy trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions:</hi> as who should say, it is the tydings of such good things, as all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee is too little to praise the Lord, and therefore it is not a thing to be slighted over; <hi>blessed is the man whose sins are forgiven,</hi> Psal. 32. which is no Noun Adjective, nor of the singular number neither; it signifieth <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesses,</hi> as it were an heap of blessings. They commonly call it the eight beatitudes, it is but varied upon divers subjects; were there eighty eight, that were all one: To have thy sins forgiven thee, is the comprising of all
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99037:81"/>
happiness; and he whose <hi>iniquity is covered,</hi> hath interest in them all.</p>
                     <p>Again, when a man sets his eyes too much upon his sins; more upon his sins than upon the mercies of God freely offered in Christ, this is a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hinderance of the peace; Thou lookest on the wrong object, looking too much on thy sins, when thou shouldst look on Christ, that brazen Serpent offered unto thee; then 'tis no wonder that thou seest not Christ though he be near thee: <hi>Mary Magdalen complains and weeps</hi> (as she thought) <hi>to the Gardener, that they had taken away her Lord, and she knew not where they had laid him, when as he stood at her elbow; her eyes were so full of tears that she could not behold her Saviour.</hi> Now therefore stand not in thine own light, but look upon Christ as well as upon thy sins; observe, though there be a peace and a calm, yet presently all turmoils will not cease after humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation: When there is a great storm at Sea which lasts perhaps twenty four hours, and then ceaseth, what are the waves presently quiet, as soon as the storm is over? no, there will be tossing and rolling many hours afterwards, because there must be a time of setling; and so though there be peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and thee, and the storm over, yet there must be a time of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                     <p>I should now shew you the difference between the peace that wicked men have and this other peace; theirs is not peace: <hi>There is no peace to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>: It's a truce only, and we must make a great difference between a truce and a peace. A truce when it is expired, commonly ends in more bitter War. With them there is a cessation of trouble, their consciences do not accuse them, but when the time limited is over, and conscience again breaks loose, it will be more unquiet and unsetled than ever before; it will be at open war against them.</p>

                        </gap> excellency by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there is no <hi>misery</hi> in the world like that, as when a man stands at enmity with God: <hi>Do we provoke the Lord? Are we stronger then he</hi>? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.22. <hi>If a man sin against a man,</hi> saith <hi>Eli, the Judge shall judge him; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man may take up the quarrel, but if a man sin against God, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie be between God and us, who shall intercede for us?</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. Were it not for this our <hi>peace-maker</hi> Christ Jesus, we should be in a <hi>woful condition,</hi> unless he put to his hand, and took up the matter.</p>
                     <p>Now it is a great matter to come to the fruit of peace; <hi>the fruit of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is sown in peace of them that make peace; Jam.</hi> 3.18. We have this <hi>fruit</hi> of peace from righteousness, we do not sow <hi>fruit</hi> but <hi>seed,</hi> the <hi>fruit</hi> comes afterwards. It is not so with a Christian, he is as sure, as if the thing where in hand, he <hi>soweth</hi> not only the seed, but the fruit of peace in righteousness, that is, in that application of Christs <hi>righteousness,</hi> to his <hi>justification</hi>; as soon as he is <hi>justified,</hi> at that instant, he hath the <hi>fruit of peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So we have peace, but with whom is it? it is between <hi>God and us.</hi> God, and a <hi>justified</hi> man is at peace through Jesus Christ; at the very same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant that a man is <hi>justified,</hi> he is at peace with God. <hi>This peace,</hi> as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto you, is a <hi>gift</hi> of an high nature, which belongs not to every man, but to the <hi>justified</hi> man only; he who is justified by faith, he only
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99037:82"/>
hath peace. In the <hi>Ephesians</hi> and <hi>Isaiah</hi> there are general proclamations of peace; <hi>Peace be unto them that are near, and unto them that are afar off:</hi> and <hi>Isa.</hi> 57.19. The word the Apostle useth in the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> hath allusion to this in <hi>Isaiah, vers.</hi> 19. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to them that are afar off, and to them that are nigh, saith the Lord, and I will heal them; but the wicked are like a troubled Sea, that cannot rest. There is no peace (saith my God) to the wicked.</hi> Though the <hi>proclamation</hi> be never so general to Jews and Gentiles, yet it belongs only to those who have peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able minds towards God, those who will not stand on <hi>terms</hi> of <hi>rebellion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: What madness is it to think, that if I stand in point of <hi>rebellion</hi> against God, I should have <hi>peace</hi> with him? But I must cast down my <hi>arms,</hi> renounce my <hi>treasons,</hi> and I must come with a <hi>subject's mind,</hi> then there will be <hi>peace,</hi> otherwise no <hi>peace.</hi> When <hi>Jehu</hi> came to revenge the quarrel of God, <hi>Joram</hi> asked him, <hi>Is it peace, Jehu?</hi> he answers, <hi>What peace so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezabel, and her witch-crafts are so many!</hi> 2 King. 9.22. As long as thou continuest in a course of <hi>rebellion,</hi> what hast thou to do to talk of <hi>peace?</hi> Why thinkest thou on <hi>peace,</hi> when thou art the <hi>chief rebel?</hi> As long as wickedness continues in thy heart, thou hast no <hi>peace of God</hi> by Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>Now it may fall out that there may be a <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>quietness</hi> in the <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of a wicked man; but we must make a great difference between a <hi>peace</hi> and a <hi>truce</hi>; a <hi>truce</hi> is but a <hi>cessation</hi> of <hi>war,</hi> for such a time; and many times when the <hi>truce</hi> is over, it ends in greater <hi>war,</hi> because they have the <hi>more time</hi> to gather <hi>strength,</hi> and increase their <hi>Forces:</hi> So there may be a peace or a truce between God and wicked men, but it is the highest judgment that can be upon a wicked man to be thus <hi>let alone</hi>; but it is not so with <hi>godly men</hi>; God breaks their <hi>peace,</hi> and hedges up their way with <hi>thorns,</hi> and many times <hi>torments</hi> their <hi>conscience,</hi> and <hi>breaks</hi> their <hi>peace</hi>; but when God suffers a <hi>sinner</hi> to <hi>thrive</hi> in sin, when he suffers him to go on so long, that his own <hi>honour</hi> is almost <hi>touched; I held my peace, saith God, then thou thoughtest me to he such a one as thy self,</hi> Psal. 50.21. God holds his peace, then the <hi>sinner</hi> saith, God <hi>doth not heed.</hi> However the preacher amplifies these things, <hi>God</hi> is not so <hi>terrible</hi> as they make him: Well, but though God hold his peace long, yet at last he will speak; <hi>Oh, consider this, ye that forget God, lest he tear you in pieces, and there b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now there is a great difference between the <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>God's children,</hi> and this little <hi>cessation of war</hi> in the <hi>consciences of wicked men: When the strong man armed, keeps the house, the goods that he possesseth are in peace,</hi> Luk. 11.21. When <hi>Satan</hi> is the <hi>Master,</hi> and thou dost his <hi>will,</hi> and he hath thee at command, he doth not <hi>trouble thee</hi>; when he keeps the house, the goods are in peace; <hi>but when a stronger than he comes, and puts him out of possession, then comes the strife and debate.</hi> Look therefore to thy peace; is it such a peace as thou hast never found any conflict, any stirring, striving betwixt the <hi>strong man</hi> and <hi>the weak?</hi> suspect <hi>that peace</hi>; that is not the peace of a <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified man,</hi> but of such a one who is held by the <hi>Prince</hi> of darkness.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Again, how comes this peace to wicked men? they consider not the <hi>wrath</hi> of God, nor the <hi>danger</hi> of sin; they consider not that <hi>Tophet is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of old,</hi> Isa. 30. <hi>ult.</hi> if they did but consider <hi>this,</hi> it would <hi>spoil</hi> their <hi>sport,</hi> and <hi>break</hi> their <hi>peace</hi>: but now a <hi>justified man,</hi> he <hi>knows</hi> what <hi>sin</hi> is, and what <hi>hell</hi> is; and at that very time, when he is thinking of his <hi>sins,</hi> and of

                        <hi>damnation,</hi> when he knoweth that this is the reward of God's enemies, he hath <hi>peace even then.</hi> This proceedeth from the sense of God's frank and free remission in Christ, with which the children of God are much affected. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> cries out, <hi>Quid retribuam Domino, quod recolit haec memoria mea, &amp; anima mea non metuit! inde diligam te Domine, &amp; gratias agam, &amp;c.</hi> Confess. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Now to speak something to them that have this <hi>true</hi> and <hi>sound peace,</hi> this <hi>peace</hi> is <hi>with God</hi>; I shewed you the last time that <hi>this peace</hi> is not always in their <hi>own conscience,</hi> but it such on God's <hi>part,</hi> which is the <hi>safe part</hi>; many reasons there are, why God doth not shew it unto them; though all be quiet betwixt God and them, yet they have not an <hi>apprehension</hi> of it in their <hi>consciences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shewed that this is <hi>many times their own fault,</hi> because they will not be <hi>comforted</hi>; all their thoughts are bent upon their <hi>sins,</hi> and their provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, and they have not an eye open, to look upon the <hi>mercies</hi> of Christ; they put it off, and will not comforted: and if they put it <hi>off</hi> from <hi>themselves,</hi> no marvel if they have not <hi>peace</hi> in their <hi>consciences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may come by <hi>reason of the great conflict before in the conscience:</hi> God raiseth a great storm, and when he intends to bring a man to some <hi>great work,</hi> or to a great <hi>deal of joy,</hi> he first humbleth him; the Prince of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was consecrated by <hi>afflictions,</hi> and we must be <hi>conformable</hi> unto Christ out Head; When the <hi>storms</hi> are <hi>past,</hi> the Sea will continue <hi>raging</hi> for a while; and when you have turned the wheel round, If you <hi>take</hi> away your <hi>hand,</hi> it will <hi>go round</hi> it self for a <hi>time:</hi> So when you are <hi>justified by faith,</hi> the <hi>storm</hi> is over, yet the <hi>roaring of the waves</hi> will continue; it will be so with the children of God; though there be a <hi>calm,</hi> yet there will be some remainders of a <hi>storm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, they are in <hi>travail,</hi> and that is a painful thing; <hi>My little children with whom I travail,</hi> Gal. 4.19. They have the <hi>pangs</hi> of the new <hi>birth,</hi> and it is a good while before they can find that quietness their heart doth long for.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>God purposely doth, though he be friends with them, take away from them the sense of peace, because he takes delight to find that strength of faith:</hi> Faith is manifest that way, faith is most strong when there is least sense. <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Psal. 22.1. the less sense, the faster the hold; and God loves this <hi>at life,</hi> that when he <hi>spurns</hi> and <hi>frowns,</hi> he will not let go, nor be put off; let him <hi>kill me,</hi> he shall <hi>kill me</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi> in my <hi>arms,</hi> I will not <hi>let go</hi> my <hi>hold</hi>; God cannot <hi>fail,</hi> he hath given me his <hi>Word,</hi> and therefore I will <hi>not let go.</hi> Such a strong faith had <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> contrary to reason; God's Word is true, he gives me his Word, and I will trust him: So a child of God will not be <hi>put off</hi>; though God write <hi>bitter things</hi> against him, he will not <hi>forego</hi> him. We have an excellent

example in the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi>; the end of it is, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith,</hi> Matth. 15.28. But how doth the <hi>greatness</hi> of it appear? <hi>Lord, have mery upon me, my Daughter is grievously afflicted,</hi> &amp;c. Why not rather, <hi>Lord have mercy on my daughter?</hi> the reason is because she was <hi>afflicted</hi> in her <hi>daughter's affliction.</hi> By the way we may hereby understand the meaning of the Commandment, where it is said, <hi>he will visit the iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate him:</hi> But why to the <hi>third and fourth generation?</hi> because, <hi>I may see the third and fourth generation,</hi> and may see the <hi>judgment</hi> of God on them, and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my sin, for which they are <hi>plagued</hi>; the <hi>case</hi> is <hi>mine,</hi> and not <hi>theirs</hi> only; <hi>Lord have mercy upon me, for my daughter is diseased:</hi> I see my own sin is punished by the judgment on her in <hi>my sight.</hi> Poor woman, Christ will not <hi>hear her</hi>; she might have been <hi>dashed out of countenance,</hi> the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were weary of her <hi>clamorous cryes,</hi> and say, <hi>Send her away, for she troubleth us:</hi> What, saith Christ? <hi>Is it fit to take the children's bread, and cast it unto dogs?</hi> This was enough to <hi>dash</hi> her quite; before she was <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged</hi> by silence, but to be called <hi>dog,</hi> it were enough quite to discourage her: but see the fruit of faith; she seeks comfort of that which would have undone another: What, am I a dog under the table? there I shall get a <hi>crum</hi>; others of the children that are better, let them have the <hi>loaves:</hi> I account my self happy if I may but get a <hi>crum. O woman, great is thy faith:</hi> This is great faith when it goes contrary to all sense; that when God calls me <hi>dog,</hi> when he spurns at me, and frowns on me, I will not be <hi>put off.</hi> Faith is of the nature of the <hi>Vine,</hi> if it have but the least <hi>hold</hi> on the <hi>wall,</hi> it makes use of it, and climbs <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>higher:</hi> So out of the <hi>least thing</hi> that drops from her Saviours <hi>mouth,</hi> she raiseth her faith higher: So though we have this peace with God, yet oft times he with holds the <hi>notification</hi> of it to us.</p>

The last thing is to note the difference between the peace of a <hi>carnal</hi> and a <hi>spiritual</hi> man; <hi>carnal peace is mixed with a great deal of presumption and pride; but the more spiritual peace thou hast, the more thou art dejected in thy self, the more cast down:</hi> see it in <hi>Ezekiel, Ezek.</hi> 16.60, 61, 62, 63. <hi>I will establish with thee an everlasting Covenant; then shalt thou remember thy ways, and be ashamed when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thy elder, and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy Covenant: and I will establish my Covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, that thou mayest remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I am pacified towards thee, for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord:</hi> When God is pacified, yet they hold down their heads, and are ashamed; when a man knoweth that God hath <hi>pardoned</hi> his sins, he is <hi>ashamed</hi> that he hath carried himself so wickedly against God, of whose mercy he hath now such experience: <hi>When God is pacified, a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members his former sins, and is confounded</hi>; as it is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. <hi>Then shall you remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good; and shall loath your selves in your own sight fer your iniquities, and for your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations in that time when I am pacified toward you.</hi> That which would work in a carnal man <hi>security</hi> and <hi>pride,</hi> (for he never thinks himself better than when there is peace within) will work in the child of God the grace of humiliation. In the last Chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> God had manifested himself <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully</hi> to <hi>Job</hi>; and however before he had very <hi>sharp afflictions,</hi> his <hi>suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in soul</hi> were next to the sufferings of Christ. I believe never any man suffered so much as <hi>Job</hi> did, insomuch that <hi>the arrows of the Almighty stuck in him, the poyson whereof</hi> (saith he) <hi>drinketh up my spirit,</hi> Job 6.4. This was the case of <hi>Job,</hi> and he stood upon terms of justification; <hi>he wished that God would dispute with him,</hi> that God would either be the <hi>Opponent</hi> or the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer.</hi> If God would <hi>answer,</hi> he would <hi>oppose</hi>; or if God would <hi>oppose,</hi> he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99037:83"/>
would <hi>answer.</hi> God comes as he would have him, and <hi>Job</hi> is not at that <hi>point</hi> that he was before; when God draws nigh unto him, he saith, <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye seeth thee,</hi> Job 42.5. Well, this may make thee a proud man, and elevate thee: no, saith he, <hi>now I abhor my self in dust and ashes.</hi> The <hi>nearer</hi> God draws unto us, and the more <hi>merciful</hi> he is unto us, by that light we the more discern our <hi>own abominations.</hi> That which would make another man proud, brings <hi>Job</hi> to the <hi>knowledge</hi> of his <hi>vileness. Therefore I abhor my self, and repent in dust and ashes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Now another thing is, <hi>Who is this peace-Maker?</hi> This I shall but touch: <hi>We have peace with God: But how? Through our Lord Jesus Christ; he is our peacemaker,</hi> and interposeth between his Fathers wrath and us, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.14. <hi>For he is our peace; who hath made both one, and hath broken down that partition wall between us</hi>; we have not only <hi>peace with God through Christ,</hi> but <hi>Christ is the very peace</hi>; not only the <hi>peace maker,</hi> but the <hi>peace.</hi> There was a <hi>middle wall of partition</hi> between the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; and between <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>us</hi>; Christ breaks it down; sin shall no longer be a wall of partition. <hi>Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances, for to make himself of twain one new man, so making peace, and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the Cross.</hi> There was hatred between God and us. Christ hath crucified that hatred with the <hi>nails</hi> wherewith he was <hi>fastened</hi> to the <hi>Cross</hi>; he hath <hi>kill'd</hi> it by his <hi>crucifixion,</hi> and now enmity being slain, <hi>peace</hi> must needs be <hi>alive</hi>; there is <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>reconciliation</hi> made. <hi>You are come</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>to the blood of sprinkling; Heb.</hi> 12.24. whereas <hi>the blood of</hi> Abel <hi>cryed for vengeance against</hi> Cain <hi>the murtherer: This blood cries for peace,</hi> it <hi>out-cries</hi> all our sins; sin hath a <hi>voice</hi>; its said, <hi>The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah went up into the ears of the Lord</hi>; Every sin thou committest hath a <hi>voice</hi> to <hi>cry,</hi> but the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ hath a <hi>shriller voice,</hi> and <hi>out-cries</hi> the <hi>cry</hi> of thy sins; it is so <hi>preheminent,</hi> it speaks for <hi>peace,</hi> and doth <hi>out-cry</hi> the voice of our <hi>sins</hi>; the high Priest was a type of Christ, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. <hi>He must have on his frontlet Holiness to the Lord</hi>; as one which bears the iniquity of the holy things of the Children of Israel representing the holy one of the Lord and standing in the person of Christ; <hi>Moses</hi> saith (when there was wrath gone out from the Lord) unto <hi>Aaron,</hi> ver. 46. <hi>Take a censer and put fire therein from off the Altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the Congregation, and make an atonement for them, for there is wrath gone out, the plague is begun</hi>; So when the wrath is gone out, the High Priest comes and offers up himself a sweet incense acceptable unto God. <hi>And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and came into the midst of the Congregation, and behold the plague was begun among the people, and he put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense and made an atonement for the people.</hi> When <hi>wrath</hi> is come out from the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and his <hi>Army</hi> is sent out for to destroy the <hi>Rebels,</hi> now our <hi>High Priest</hi> stands between the <hi>living</hi> and the <hi>dead,</hi> and offers up himself an <hi>obligation</hi> to Almighty God to make peace: Look to the case of <hi>Balaam</hi>; when the people had committed fornication, <hi>Phineas</hi> executed judgment; wherefore the Lord saith, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.12. Phineas <hi>hath turned away my wrath from the people</hi> and if that one act of <hi>Phineas</hi> his zeal for the Lord, in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the <hi>Fornicators</hi> before the Congregation, if this, I say, appeased Gods wrath for the whole Congregation; how much more doth our <hi>Phineas who hath fulfilled all righteousness, whom the zeal of Gods house had eaten up?</hi> He is nothing but <hi>zeal</hi> it self, and all that he doth in our name unto his father, is for our good. How much more shall Christ pacifie Gods wrath, who hath received the <hi>gash</hi> of Gods <hi>Sword</hi> upon his <hi>own body,</hi> and would not have himself spared, that he might do it? <hi>As Jonah was three dayes and three nights in the Whales belly, so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the

                     <p>Now follows in the next place in the Text; <hi>By whom we have access by faith into this grace, wherein we stand, and rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God.</hi> These are the two privileges that a justified man hath; he hath <hi>a gracious access unto God</hi>; Suppose he be in a fault, (as who is not?) <hi>if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This is the state of a <hi>justified man</hi>; though he do by his <hi>relapses</hi> provoke God, yet he is in the state of a subject; though he be a disobedient subject, yet a subject, not a foreigner as before; but now ye <hi>that were not a people, are become the children of the living God,</hi> Rom. 9.26. A child of God in the midst of rebellion no sooner repenteth but he is <hi>sub misericordia</hi>; as soon as he is in the state of grace, he is under God's protection, he is no <hi>stranger:</hi> and as soon as he converteth unto his heavenly father, though he hath his blood about his ears, and is in his rags, yet he may with an humble boldness come to God; <hi>By Jesus Christ he may come boldly to the throne of grace, that he may find help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4.16. The Apostle in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.18. sets down twice the great privileges Christians have, <hi>For through him we both have an access by one Spirit unto the Father:</hi> It is Christ which makes the way. To have a <hi>friend</hi> at the <hi>Court</hi> is a great matter, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially when a man hath need of him; <hi>Christ is gone before us, and he lives for ever to make intercession for us,</hi> and we need no other <hi>Mediator:</hi> thus he <hi>bespeaks</hi> his Father; Father, this is one of mine that I <hi>shed my blood</hi> for, one of those that <hi>thou gavest me</hi>; I beseech thee have <hi>pity</hi> upon him, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee give him <hi>audience:</hi> Ephes. 3.12. <hi>By him,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>through Christ, we have access by one Spirit unto the Father, in whom we have boldness by the faith of him, and access with confidence.</hi> I go not now <hi>doubting</hi> unto God, I prefer my suit with <hi>boldness.</hi> Mark the Apostle St. <hi>James; If any man want wisdom, or any other thing, let him ask it of God that gives to all men liberally, and upbraideth not:</hi> It is otherwise with men; when one hath done a <hi>great man wrong,</hi> and comes to desire a favour at his hands: Oh Sir! saith he, do you not remember how you used me at such a time, or in such a place? that he is presently upbraided with, it is cast in his dish: but it is not so with God; <hi>he gives liberally, and upbraids no man:</hi> so there is a free and a bold access with <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>confidence, by whom we have boldness and access:</hi> let him not doubt or waver; that is a notable place; here is bold access by faith unto God, and by that we may be assured of whatever we ask; if it be <hi>forgiveness of sins,</hi> we may be sure they are <hi>forgiven</hi>; if we ask in <hi>faith</hi> we may be <hi>assured.</hi> By the way take notice of the folly of the Papists, who think that a man can have no confidence or assurance that his sins are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>This is our confidence, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:</hi> Now, is it not <hi>according to his will</hi> to ask <hi>forgiveness</hi> of our <hi>sins?</hi> Doth not he enjoyn us to do it? Therefore what infidelity is it, not to be assured of it? And what impudency is it in them, to go about to cut off that which is the whole comfort of a Christian? The assurance of his salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus it is indeed with those that have no <hi>feeling</hi> nor <hi>confidence,</hi> as those who are in hell think there is no heaven; and they who teach such <hi>uncomfortable Doctrine</hi> can <hi>receive</hi> no <hi>comfort</hi> farther than the Priest giveth it them. It 's true, there is not true assurance, but in the true Church; but there it may be found.</p>
                     <p>And as I began with <hi>sowing in tears,</hi> so I would end with <hi>reaping in joy</hi>: that is the next thing in the Text, for which I pass over the other part of it. I <hi>begin</hi> with <hi>humiliation,</hi> but <hi>end</hi> with <hi>joy</hi>; and not only that joy which we

shall have in the <hi>Kingdom of heaven,</hi> but on earth while we have these things but in <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>expectation.</hi> A man that would <hi>reckon up</hi> his <hi>estate,</hi> doth not only <hi>value</hi> what he hath for the present, but he <hi>reckons his reversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> also; what he shall have after such <hi>a time,</hi> what will come to <hi>him</hi> or his <hi>heirs.</hi> God's children, they have a <hi>brave reversion; glory,</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> and a <hi>Kingdom: It is your Father's good pleasure to give you a Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 12.32. <hi>We are all the children of God, but it doth not appear what we shall be: when he appears, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>He shall change our vile bodies, and make them like his glorious body..</hi> We are here <hi>sons,</hi> but yet, but in a strange Country, no body <hi>knoweth what he is,</hi> and therefore he meets with many <hi>affronts.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> when he was in <hi>France,</hi> went for an attendant on the <hi>Duke,</hi> and is he troubled at it? No, he knew that the world knew it not, they knew not what he was; and therefore he is not troubled at it. So is it with children of God; <hi>but when they shall appear, they shall be advanced,</hi> and their enemies <hi>ashamed.</hi> By the way, let not the people of God be discouraged by the <hi>taunts, jeers</hi> and <hi>reproaches</hi> of wicked men; they know not what you are, and therefore <hi>make light</hi> of you; as they did of <hi>Christ himself.</hi> Well, besides what we have in <hi>reversion,</hi> the very present hope of it works <hi>wonderful joy</hi> in the heart of a <hi>Christian. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did not live to see the glory of <hi>Solomon's Temple</hi>; but he made provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it, and cast the <hi>model of it,</hi> and he took much delight in the <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation</hi> of what it would be. The consideration of these hopes <hi>makes my flesh rest in hope, and my heart rejoyce,</hi> Psal. 16.9. The consideration of the <hi>resurrection</hi> made <hi>David</hi>'s heart <hi>rejoyce:</hi> The <hi>consideration</hi> of that which is to come, should bring <hi>abundance of joy</hi> unto a Christian, these are strange things, not like the joy of a <hi>natural man</hi>; for <hi>his heart is sad in the midst of laughter,</hi> Prov. 34.13. but <hi>these rejoyce with a joy unspeakable, and full of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. Here are some <hi>sparks,</hi> some <hi>beginnings</hi> of the glory of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and of that <hi>great joy</hi> which we shall have hereafter; but I cannot speak of these things in an hour.</p>
                     <p>But forasmuch as the Devil <hi>transforms himself into an Angel of light,</hi> there is no work of God's Spirit in the <hi>hearts of his children,</hi> but Satan, like an <hi>Ape,</hi> labours to imitate in the <hi>hearts of wicked men,</hi> to make them <hi>secure:</hi> we must know that there are joys in some who are not regenerate. <hi>They that receive the Word on the Rock, received it with joy.</hi> The Word, if it be apprehended, and hath but the <hi>least footing,</hi> brings <hi>joy</hi> with it.</p>
                     <p>But now to know how I may get this joy, how beneficial a thing is it to have such a comfort on earth, as to know that I have this true joy! and to be able to distinguish this <hi>joy</hi> from the false <hi>joy,</hi> from the <hi>flashes,</hi> those <hi>fleeting joys</hi> of the wicked, which are but <hi>as the crackling of thorns under a pot,</hi> Eccles. 7.6. for theirs is but as a <hi>blaze</hi> that suddenly goeth out. Now if thou wouldst know thy joy aright, and whether it differ from that <hi>counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit joy</hi> which flesh and blood, and the Devil suggests: Look to the things that go before, and produce this joy.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first thing that goeth before true joy, and produceth it, <hi>is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening unto Christ when he knocks at the door of thy heart:</hi> As in that famous place, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me.</hi> There is, if thou open, a <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>familiar communication</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Christ and thee; he communicates himself at <hi>dinner</hi> and <hi>supper.</hi> A man comes not <hi>melancholy</hi> to <hi>meals</hi>; Christ will come, and make <hi>merry</hi> with thee, he will <hi>sup</hi> with thee <hi>familiarly.</hi> But how is it with thee? Hath Christ <hi>knocked,</hi> and thou hast given him a <hi>slieveless</hi> answer, and hast thou <hi>joy?</hi> it is a <hi>false joy.</hi> But when Christ <hi>knocks</hi> at the <hi>door</hi> of thy <hi>heart,</hi> there must be an opening the <hi>door</hi> on thy part, when he knocks by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit:</hi> And dost thou give such an answer as the Spouse in the <hi>Canticles,</hi>
                        <pb n="152" facs="tcp:99037:85"/>
Cant. 5. <hi>I am come into my garden, my Sister, my Spouse, I have gathered my myrrhe with my spice, I have eaten my honey-comb with my honey.</hi> Now Christ coming to Supper, knockt at the door, and would bring in a great deal of joy: <hi>I sleep,</hi> saith the Spouse, <hi>but my heart waketh; it is the voice of my well-beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my Sister, my Love, my Dove, my Vndefiled.</hi> When God comes and wooes us, and desires to <hi>communicate</hi> himself unto us, and desires us to put <hi>off</hi> our <hi>cloaths,</hi> dost thou look for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort if thou openest not? <hi>At last I opened to my Beloved</hi>; vers. 6. <hi>But he had withdrawn himself, and was gone; my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</hi> When thou givest not Christ entertainment when he comes, thou mayest seek, and not meet with him. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t is observed that <hi>the Keepers of the Wall</hi> are the greatest <hi>strikers:</hi> Those whom God hath set to be Watchmen, instead of comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they smite; <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>The Watch-men that went about the City, they found me, they smote me, they wounded me, they took my vail from me:</hi> She gets <hi>raps</hi> from them who should <hi>protect</hi> her, because she did not entertain Christ: if thou findest any comfort after Christ hath knocked, and thou hast opened unto him; then it is true joy, and thou mayest make much of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If it be true joy, <hi>there goeth faith before it; for being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> So that the exercising of the <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> is a <hi>spiritual means</hi> to raise <hi>comforts</hi> in our souls; <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. I had need to speak of this, for there is want of the <hi>exercises</hi> of faith: Is it enough, think you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o have faith once <hi>exercised? He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him:</hi> It is not enough to eat <hi>once a year.</hi> A man will not be in good liking that eats but <hi>once a year,</hi> but a man must eat <hi>once a day</hi> at least. A Christian should feed on Christ every day, make him his ordinary food, renewing every day the acts of <hi>faith,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ crucified, by faith, every day. If a Christian would consider that God offers Christ unto him every day, and thou renewest thy faith, and claspest him every day, it would be a special way whereby joy should be raised in the soul. It is said in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>We rejoyce in the hope of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God: Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Thus when thou hast exercised the acts of faith in believing, and then upon that rejoycest, then it is <hi>seasonable</hi> and <hi>true joy,</hi> and not the <hi>counterfeit joy</hi> of the wicked: when it arises and springs from believing, when that procureth it, it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise distinguishes it from all <hi>false joys.</hi> The Apostle tells us, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Having this confidence, I know that I shall continue with you all, for your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance and joy of faith.</hi> It is called <hi>the joy of faith,</hi> because it springs from that principle of rejoycing, from that mother-grace, that your <hi>rejoycing</hi> may be <hi>the more abundant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The preaching of the Word whereby faith is wrought, brings abundance of joy. That place of St. <hi>Peter</hi> is remarkable; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now you see him not, yet believing, ye rejoyce with joy unspeakable, and full of glory:</hi> Yet believing; that is, yet <hi>exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> the acts of faith, which we too much <hi>neglect.</hi> If we did <hi>exercise</hi> these acts every day, we should have our <hi>Charter of joy</hi> renewed every day; <hi>yet believing, ye rejoyce.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Pray and be thankful; praise and thanksgiving are those fruits which ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil all our joy.</hi> When thou prayest, thou conversest with God, thou speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est with him <hi>face to face,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> did. He who can pray spiritually, and pray hard unto God, <hi>as</hi> Moses <hi>face shined when he talked with God,</hi> so will thy soul thrive, praying hard, and being thankful: There is no greater means than this to get this joy; <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.1. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord, O ye righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for praising is comely for the upright.</hi> Upon this hangs all our comfort; <hi>praise</hi> always brings <hi>rejoycing</hi>; the one begets the other. In <hi>Isaiah,</hi> The
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99037:85"/>
comfort there that God's children receive, is the changing of rayment; <hi>Christ preaching the acceptable year of the Lord to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oyl of joy for mourning, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of praise for the spirit of heaviness,</hi> Isa. 61.3. The ground of <hi>praise</hi> is <hi>joy</hi>; one follows the other: Observe, God will give us the oyl of joy; <hi>Christ was anointed with this oyl above his fellows:</hi> Christ hath <hi>fulness</hi> of joy; this oyl doth not come on his <hi>head</hi> alone, but it trickles down unto the <hi>lower most hemm</hi> of his <hi>garment,</hi> even upon all the <hi>lively members</hi> of his <hi>mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will add in the last place, when a man considers the <hi>great things</hi> which are given to him by God, and what an <hi>estate</hi> we get by Christ.

                     <p>Answering that threefold work of the spirit in <hi>John</hi> 16. where Christ promiseth that when the comforter should come he should reprove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he world of Sin, of Righteousness, of Judgment.</p>
                     <p>First, he shews the Comforter shall work a conviction of Sin, a making of a man as vile, empty and naked as may be; not a bare confession of sin only, (which a man may have and yet go to hell) but such a conviction as stops a man's mouth that he hath not a word to speak, but sees a sink of sin and abomination in himself, such as the Apostle had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing.</hi> To attain to this sight and measure of humiliation, there must be a work of the spirit First therefore in the first Chapter the Apostle begins with the Gentiles, who failing grosly in the duties of the first Table, God had given over also to err in the breach of all the Duties of the second Table. Then the next Chapter, and most of the third he spends on the Jews: they bragged of many excellent privileges they had above the Gentiles, as to have the Law, Circumcision, to be leaders of others, to have God among them, and therefore despised the Gentiles. The Apostle reproves them, shewing that in condemning the Gentiles, they condemn'd themselves, they having a greater light of knowledge than the Gentiles, which should have led them to the true and sincere practice of what they were instructed in. Then he goes on and shews all <hi>naturally</hi> to be out of the way, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes them to be under sin, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God. This is the end of the first part.</p>
                     <p>This being done, in the latter end of the Chapter he proceeds to speak of the second work of the Comforter. To convince the world of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; but on what grounds? <hi>Because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more,</hi> that is, he shall assure the conscience that now there is a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of better things purchased for us: that Christ was <hi>wounded, arraigned</hi> and <hi>condemned</hi> for us; that he was imprisoned, but now he is free, who was our surety; yea, and that he is not free, as one escaped, who hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prison and run away, (for then he could not have stayed in <hi>Heaven</hi> no more than <hi>Adam</hi> could stay in Paradise after his fall) but now that Christ remains in Heaven perfectly, and for ever reconciled with the Father: this is a sure sign to us that the debt is payed, and <hi>everlasting peace</hi> and <hi>righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> brought in for our <hi>salvation.</hi> This the Apostle enlargeth and shews this to be that righteousness which <hi>Adam</hi> had, and which we must trust all unto. And this he doth unto the sixth Chapter.</p>
                     <p>From whence the Apostle goes on to the third point, convincin the world of judgment and of righteousness, unto the ninth Chapter, which are two words signifying one and the same thing; but because he had named righteousness before which was the righteousness of justification (without a man) in Christ Jesus; he calls the third judgment, which is that integrity which is inherent, bred and created in us, to wit, sanctification, as we may see in <hi>Esay</hi> 42.3. where it is said of Christ, <hi>A bruised reed shall be not break, and the smoaking flax shall he not quench, till he bring forth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto victory.</hi> Where he shews judgment to be a beginning of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness in sanctification, even such a one as can never be extinguished. So <hi>Job</hi> 27.2. The word is taken where <hi>Job</hi> expostulateth the matter: <hi>As the Lord liveth who hath taken away my judgment, &amp;c. all the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils, my lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue deceit. God forbid that I should justifie you, till I die I will not remove my integrity from me, my righteousness I will hold fast, and will not let it go, &amp;c.</hi> Here you see by judgment is meant integrity, and that righteousness which is created and inherent in us; so that the substance of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99037:88"/>
that place in <hi>Esay</hi> is, that God will never give over so to advance and make effectual that weak righteousness and sanctification begun in us, until it shall prevail against and master all our sins and corruptions, making it in the end a victorious sanctification. And the ground hereof is, for the Prince of this world is judged; he is like one manacled, whose strength and power is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited: So that now, though he be strong, yet he is cast out by a stronger than he; so that he cannot, nor shall he ever rule again as in times past.</p>
                     <p>This strain of Doctrine the Apostle follows in this Epistle, shewing that as the righteousness of Justification by the blood of Christ is a thing without us, so the righteousness of Sanctification is a thing created and inherent in us, and the ground of the witness of our spirits, as we shall shew in its own place. So that the blood of Christ doth two things unto us; in Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it covers our sins, and in Sanctification it heals our sins and sores; that if there be any proud or dead flesh, it eateth it out, and then heals the wound. Therefore the Apostle says <hi>You are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> He that sees the Law is satisfied by another, and all to be of free grace, he will not much stand on any thing in himself for his Justification; but as a poor beggar, be content all should be of mere grace: Therefore he concludes, <hi>Sin shall not have dominion over you; for ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this the Apostle goes on to other particulars, shewing divers things, especially the twelfth Verse of this Chapter, where he drives unto the point of sanctification, as though he should say you are freed from the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as it is a Judge of Life and Death, but yet the Law must be your Counsellors; you are debtors of thankfulness (seeing whence you are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped) that you may not live after the flesh, and then he proceeds to shew them how they should walk, that seeing they had received the spirit, they should walk after the spirit; now that they had received that which should subdue and mortifie the flesh and the lusts thereof, they should be no more as dead men, but quick and lively in operation, by living after the spirit, otherwise they could not be the Sons of God, <hi>vers.</hi> 16. and he comes to the words that I have now read, <hi>For ye have not received the spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father: for the spirit it self beareth witness with our spirits, that we are the children of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where the Apostle shews the ground of our Union and Communion with Christ, because having his spirit we are of necessity his, as S. <hi>John</hi> speaks, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> us.</hi> What ties together, and makes one, things far asunder, but the same spirit and life in both: so that spirit which is in Christ a full run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over fountain descending down, and being also infused into us, unites us unto him; yea, that spirit communicated unto me in some measure (which is in him such fulness) that spirit doth tie me as fast unto Christ as any joynt ties member to member, and so makes Christ to dwell in my heart; as the Apostle speaks to this purpose, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.21. That thus by one spirit we are built up and made the <hi>Temple</hi> of God, and come to be the <hi>Habitation</hi> of God through the spirit; so that by this means we are unseparably knit and united unto him; for what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> it makes one member to be a member to another? not the nearness of joyning or lying one to, or upon another, but the same quickening spirit and life which is in both, and which causeth a like motion: for otherwise if the same life were not in that member it would be dead, and of no use to the other; so that it is the same spirit and life in the things conjoyned, which unites them together; yet to explain this more (as I have often in the like case said) Imagine a man were as high as Heaven (the same spirit and life being diffused into all his parts) what is it now that can cause his toe to stir, there being such a huge distance betwixt the head
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99037:89"/>
and it? Even that self-same life which is in the head being in it; no sooner doth the head will the toe to stir, but it moves. So is it with us; that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry spirit which is in Christ being in us, thereby we are united unto him, grow in him, live in him, and he in us; rejoyce in him, and so are kept and preserved to be glorified with him. He is the second <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom we receive the influence of all good things; showring down and distilling the graces of his spirit upon the least of all his members. That look, as it was said of <hi>Aaron</hi> (who was a type of the second <hi>Adam</hi>) and of that holy Oyl (representing the graces of his spirit) <hi>Which did not only run down his head and beard, but the skirts of his garment also, and all his rich attire about,</hi> Psal. 133.2. So when I see the Oyl of Christ's graces and spirit not only rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head, but also descend and run down upon the lowest of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; making me now (as one of them) in some sort another man than I was, or my natural state could make me; by the same spirit I know I am united unto Christ. To this purpose is that which Christ to stands upon (in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.) unto the Jews; where speaking of the <hi>eating of his flesh, and that bread of life which came down from heaven,</hi> (lest they should be mistaken) he adds, <hi>It is the spirit that quickneth, the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life:</hi> So that we see it is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that gives a being to a thing. And therefore the Apostle proceeds to shew, <hi>As many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.13. That look as Christ is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ue natural Son of God, so we as truly (by conveyance) of the same spirit into us, are his Sons by Adoption, and so heirs with God, yea, and joynt heirs with Christ; this he begins to shew, <hi>vers.</hi> 13. So that being in this excellent estate, they were not only servants and friends (a most high Prerogative) but they were now the Sons of God, having the spirit of Adoption, whereby they might boldly call God Father. In which Verse the Apostle opposeth the spirit of bondage, which doth make a man fear again, unto the spirit of Adoption, which frees a man from fear.</p>
                     <p>Now two things may be observed hence: 1. The order the spirit of God keeps e'er it comforts; it shakes, and makes us fear. This the Apostle speaks to <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. where he shews, that the end of Christ's coming was, <hi>That because the children were partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself took part of the same; that through death, he might destroy him that had the power of death; that is, the Devil: and deliver them, who through fear of death, were all their life time subject unto bondage.</hi> The first work then, of the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, to put a man in fear. 2. Here is shewed, that until the spirit doth work this fear, the heart will not stoop. The Obstinacy is great; yea, so great, that if hell gates were open, ready to swallow up a man, he would not yield until the spirit set in to convince the heart. Therefore St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. <hi>That when the spirit it come, he will reprove the world of sin</hi>; that is, he will convince and shew a man that he is but a bond-man: and so from this sight he makes us to fear. No man must think this strange, that God deals with men at first after this harsh manner; to kill them as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he make them alive: nor be discouraged, as if God had now cast them off as none of his: For this bondage and spirit of fear is a work of God's spirit, and a preparative to the rest, yet it is but a common work of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and such a one, that unless more follow, it can afford us no comfort.</p>
                     <p>But why then doth God suffer his children to be first terrified with this fear?</p>
                     <p>I answer, That in two respects this is the best and wisest course to deal with us; or else many would put off the matter, and never attain a sense of mercy.</p>
                     <p>First, in respect of God's glory.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in regard of our good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:99037:89"/>First in respect of God's glory; and that first because, as in the work of <hi>Creation,</hi> so in the work of <hi>Redemption,</hi> God will have the praise of all his attributes: for as in the work of <hi>Creation</hi> there appeared the infinite <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, goodness, power, justice, mercy</hi> of God, and the like; so will he in the work of our <hi>Redemption</hi> have all these appear in their strength and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: and when we see and acknowledge these things to be in G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d in the highest perfection, hereby we honour him; as on the contrary, when we will not see and acknowledge the excellency of God's infinite attributes, we dishonour him: yea, and I may safely add, that the work of Redemption was a greater work than the work of Creation; for therein appeared all the treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge in the conveying of it unto the Church. Herein appeared first, infinite <hi>Wisdom,</hi> in ordering the matter so as to find out such a way for the Redemption of Mankind, as no created understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding could possibly imagine or think of. And secondly, for the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God; there could be none comparable to this, in not sparing his own Son, the Son of his Love, that so he might spare us who had so grievously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him. And thirdly, there could not be so much <hi>Justice</hi> seen in any thing as in sparing us not to spare his Son, in laying his Son's head (as it were) upon the block, and chopping it off: indeed the death unto which he gave his Son was not only more vile than the loss of his head, but far more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and terrible to nature, the death on the Cross; in renting and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that blessed body of his; even as the Veil of the temple was rent, (which was a type of him) so was he rent, and tore, and broke for us, when he made his soul an offering for sin. This was the perfection of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. And thus was he just, as the Apostle speaks, and the Justifyer of him him that believeth in Jesus. God would have Justice and Mercy meet and kiss each other; and that for two reasons, for the magnifying of his Justice, and for the magnifying of his Mercy.</p>
                     <p>First, For the magnifying of his <hi>Justice.</hi> The spirit must first become a spirit of bondage and fear for the magnifying of God's Justice: Thus the Prophet <hi>David</hi> having sinned, was driven to this practice, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight, that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.</hi> Thus he, a holy man, was brought to confess his sin, to give God the glory of his Justice. And so to this end, that a man might pass through or by (as it were) the gates of hell unto heaven, the Lord will have his Justice exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the full; for which cause lessening, or altogether (for a time) ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting all sight of mercy, he turns the Law loose to have its course. And thus, as in the work of Redemption, he would have the height of Justice appear; so would he have it appear in the application of our Redemption, that Justice should not be swallowed up of Mercy. But even as that woman, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. <hi>Who had nothing to pay, was threatned by her Creditors to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way her two Sons, to put them in prison.</hi> So though we have nothing to pay, the Law is let loose upon us, to threaten Imprisonment and Damnation, to affright and terrifie us; and all for the magnifying of God's Justice: which also, we satisfie not by what we suffer, yet it is meet we should acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and learn thereby more highly to value the suffering of our Saviour. But farther, God hath set forth many terrible threatnings in his Word against sinners; shall all these be to no purpose? The wicked, they are insensible of them; must they therefore be in vain? Some people there must be, on whom they shall work: <hi>Shall a Lyon roar,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>and we not be afraid,</hi> Amos, 3.8. Since then those who should, will not, some there be who must tremble, and those even of God's own dear Children. This the Prophet excellently sets forth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.2. where the Lord sheweth who he will regard; <hi>But to this man will I look, even to him that is of a contrite spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and trembleth at my word.</hi> So that you see, even some of his own must
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99037:90"/>
tremble, and be thus humbled of necessity: and that it is not without a just cause, that God doth deal with his own Children after this manner, though it be sharp in the experience. We must fear, tremble and be humbled, and then we shall receive a spirit not to fear again. That vain courage which some brag they have, so as not to fear Death, is not it which is meant here; f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> alas such braggers, out of ignorance of the thing, and desire to be out of misery in this Life, may embrace Death unwillingly, hoping it may put an end to their sorrows. But this spirit not to fear again, is such a spirit that assures me of the forgiveness of all my sins, shewing me my freedome by Christ Jesus from Hell and eternal Damnation, making me live a holy Life, and from hence not to fear, and so sealing me up unto the day of Redemption, as you shall hear more, when we come to speak of the witness of the spirit. This now is for the glory of Gods Justice.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is requisite that the comforter should first work in men a fear, for the <hi>glory</hi> of Gods <hi>mercy</hi>; which would never be so sweet, relish so well, nor be so highly esteemed of by us, if the awful terrour of Justice had not formerly made us smart: As we may see in that parable (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto our Saviour likeneth the Kingdom of Heaven) of the man that owed ten thousand Talents unto the King his master (he shews him mercy) and forgives him all; but what did he first? Why first he requires the whole debt of him, and because he had nothing to pay; he <hi>commands him,</hi> his <hi>Wife</hi> and Children, <hi>and all that he had to be sold, that payment might be made</hi>; first he would have him pincht throughly, that he might know much he was indebted, and (in that case) how great that favour was which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in having all that he owed forgiven him. Thus a King many times casts men in Prison, suffers the sentence of condemnation to pass on them, and perhaps orders them to be brought to the place of execution, before he pardons them, and then mercy is mercy indeed, and so God deals with us many times, he puts his Children in fear; shews them how much they owe him, how unable they are to pay, casts them into prison and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens condemnation in Hell for ever, after which when mercy comes to the Soul, then it appears to be wonderful mercy indeed, even the riches of exceeding mercy. Why do so many find no savour in the Gospel? Is it because there is no sweetness, or matter of delight in it? No, it is because such have had no tast of the Law, and of the spirit of bondage, they have not smarted, nor found a sense of the bitterness of sin, nor of that just pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment that is due unto the same. Even as the King will suffer the Law to pass on some greivous malefactor for high Treason, bring him to the place of Execution, and lay his head on the block, before a pardon he produced (as we have had experience in the Country of a man who otherwise would not cry nor shed a tear for any thing; Despising Death, and not affraid to meet an host of men.) Such a one having now at an instant a pardon brought from the King, how wonderfully doth it work upon him, causing softness of heart and tears to flow from his eyes when nothing else could; whilest the wonder of this mercy, which now appeareth so sweet, and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>onable is beheld and admired, he is so struck that he knows not what to say: for this cause therefore God shews us first a Spirit of bondage to prepare us to relish mercy, and then he gives a Spirit of Adoption not to fear again: And thus by this order the one is magnifyed and highly esteemed by the foregoing sense of the other.</p>
                     <p>If therefore this terrour and fear be hard and troublesome unto us, yet if it be for Gods glory, let us endure: If he will give me over to a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed terrified conscience, to <hi>fears, tremblings, astonishments,</hi> yea or to draw me into the fire it self, or any other punishment, so we see he dealt with his Church of old, he brought her through the fire and water before she came into a wealthy place. <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.12. Since it is for his glory, I must
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99037:90"/>
be contended. But what do I say? He gets nothing by us of all that we do, all is for our selves; our Acknowledgments of him, make him no <hi>stronger, wiser, juster,</hi> or <hi>better</hi> then he is, but in glorifying of him we do glorify our selves, and so pass from glory to glory, until we come to be fully trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into his Image. And herein consists our happiness in acknowledging of his wonderful Attributes, that by the reflex and knowledge of them, we grow up in them as much as may be. God was as glorious, powerful, wise, just, happy and good before the World was made as now, and if the case be put concerning glorifying of him, the three persons of the Trinity were only fit and worthy of so great honour, not we; as we may read <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. There wisdom shews how it was with the Father, before all time, and that they did mutually solace themselves in the contemplations of one anothers glory. Then (says Wisdom) <hi>Was I by him as one brought up with him, and I was dayly his Delight, rejoycing always before him,</hi> and in 17 <hi>John.</hi> There we read the same thing in effect, where Christ prays, <hi>And now O Father glorifie thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the World was.</hi> So that the Admiring, beholding and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying of Gods glory (as much as may be) labouring to be like him is our glory, and thus much of the glory of God in beginning of this work in us by fear.</p>
                     <p>The second thing was to prove that this course was for our good, and this appears two ways. 1. In our Justification. 2. In our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>For the first, we are such strangers unto God, that we will never come unto him till we see there is no other remedy, being at the pits brink ready to starve, hopeless of all other helps, being frozen in the dregs of sin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in our ways; as we see in the parable of the prodigal son, who would never think of any return to his Father till all other helps fayled him, <hi>money, friends, acquaintance,</hi> and all sorts of food; nay if he might but have fed upon husks with the Swine, he would not have thought of returning any more unto his Father: but this being denied him, (the text says) he then came to himself, which shews us that whilest men run on in sinfull courses they are mad men of themselves, even as we see those in Bedlam, are beaten and kept under, and comforts denied them, till they come to themselves. And then what says he? <hi>I will arise and go to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, confessing that he had sinned, and I will say, Father, I have sinned,</hi> &amp;c. 15. Luke. So is it with us, until the Lord humble us and bring us low in our own eyes shewing us our misery and sinful poverty, and that in us there is no good thing, (that we be stript of all help in and without our selves and must perish for ever unless we beg his mercy) we will not come unto him. As we see it was with the Woman that Christ healed of her bloody issue, <hi>Luke.</hi> 8.43. How long it was before she came to Christ, she had been sick twelve years, she had spent all her substance upon physicians, and no body could help her, and this Extremity brings her to Christ. So that this is the means to bring us unto Christ, to drive us on our knees, hopeless as low as may be, to shew us where help only is to be found; and make us run unto it. Thus therefore when men have no mind to come to Christ he sends (as it were) fiery Serpents to sting them, that they might look up unto the brazen Serpent, (or rather unto Christ Jesus of which it was a type) for help, so unto others being strangers unto him, he sends variety of great and sore afflictions to make them come to him that he may be acquainted with them; as <hi>Absolom</hi> set <hi>Joabs</hi> Corn on fire because he would not come at him, being twice sent for. So God deals with us before our Conversion many times, as with iron Whips lashes us home turning loose the avenger of blood after us, and then for our Life we run and make hast to the City of Refuge. Thus God shoots off as it were his great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99037:91"/>
against us to make us run unto him. Thus John the Baptist, came preaching of Repentance, in attire, speech and dyet all being strong and harsh, cloathed with a Camels hair and with a girdle of skin about his loyns, his meat Locusts and wild Honey, the place, was in the wilderness, his speech harsh and uncomfortable, thundring with his voice, calling them a generation of vipers, and telling them that now also was the ax laid to the root of the tree, that every tree that brought not forth good fruit was hewn down and cast into the fire. As also we know in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Lord came Elijah. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.11 <hi>First a great strong wind rent the mountains, and break in pieces the Rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind, and after that went an Earthquake, but the Lord was not in the Earthquake; and after the Earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the</hi> fire: (these were as a peal of great Ordinance, shot off to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way, shewing the King was a coming) and after the fire a still small voice, and there the Lord was. So the Lord rends tears, and shakes our Consciences and rocky hearts, many times to prepare the way for him, and then he comes to us in the still and soft voice of Consolation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for our Sanctification, it is good for us that the Comforters first work be to work fear in us, for we are naturally so frozen in our dregs, that no fire in a manner will warm and thaw us. We wallow in our blood, and stick fast in the mire of sin, that we cannot stir; so that this fear is but to pull us from our Corruptions and make us more holy. As we see if a man have a Gangrene beginning in his hand or foot which may spread farther, and be his death if it continue so, he is easily perswaded to cut it off, lest it should go farther. So doth God deal by us with this fear of bondage, that we might be cloathed anew with his Image in Holiness and Righteousness. Now to effect this, the sharpest things are best, such as are the Law, the threatnings of Condemnation, the opening of Hell, the racking of the Conscience and a sense of wrath present and to come. So hard-hearted are we by Nature, being as children of the bondwoman, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom violence must be used. Even as we see a man riding a wild and young Horse, to tame him, he will run him against a wall (that this may make him affraid) ride him in deep and tough Lands, (or if this will not do) take him up into the top of some high Rock, when bringing him to the brink thereof he threatens to throw him headlong, make him shake and quake, whereby at last he is tamed. So deals the Lord by us, he gives us a sight of sin, and the punishment due thereunto, a sense of wrath, sets the Conscience on fire, fills the heart with fears, horrours, and disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etness, opens Hell to the Soul, brings a man as it were to the gates thereof, and threatens to throw him in, and all this to make a man more holy, and to hate sin the more. So that you see there must be a strong mortifying and subduing of us by a strong hand to bring us unto Christ for our Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nothing but a fiery furnace can melt away that dross and tin which cleaves unto such corrupt metal as we are. See this method excellently set forth in the Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.19.20. Because ye are all become dross, behold I will gather you into the midst of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as they gather Brass, and Iron and Lead and Tin into the midst of the Furnace to blow the fire upon it to melt it, so will I gather you in mine Anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there and melt you.</p>
                     <p>Before I proceed farther, give me leave to answer an Objection of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled soul which may arise hence, O may a soul say, what comfort then may I have of the first work of the Spirit in me? For as yet I have found none of these things; I have not been thus humbled, nor terrifyed, nor had such experience as you speak of in that state under the spirit of bondage.</p>
                     <p>I answer, though this be a work of the spirit, yet it is not the principal justifying and saving work of the spirit, yea the children of the Devil may
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99037:91"/>
come to have a greater measure of this then Gods own dear Children, whom (for the most part) he will not affright nor afflict in that terrible manner as he doth some of them, but the consequence of this is more to be accounted of, then the measure, to see whither that measure I have, (what ever it be) leads me. <hi>For if the measure were never so absolutely necessary to salvation, then all Gods. Children should have enough of it.</hi> But I make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference still between humiliation and humility, which is a grace of it self, and leads me along with comfort and Life. Thus therefore I think of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, if I have so much of it as will bring me to see my danger and cause me to run to the medicine, and City of refuge for help, to hate sin for time to come, and to set my self constantly in the ways and practice of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, it is enough. And so I say in the case of Repentance, if a man have a sight of sin past, and a heart firmly set against all sin for the time to come, the greater and firmer this were, the lesser measure of sorrow might suffice for sins fore-past. As we see a wise Father would never beat his Child for faults that are past, but for the prevention of that which is to come, for we see in time of Correction, the Child cryes out, O I will never do so any more. So God deals with us, because our resolutions and promises are faint and fail, and that without much mourning, humiliation and Stripes, we attain not this hatred of sins past, and strength against them for time to come, therefore it is that our humiliation and sorrow must be proportionable to that work which is to be done, otherwise any measure of it were sufficient which fits us for the time to come.</p>
                     <p>But I will add, there are indeed divers measures of it, according unto which the conscience is wounded or eased; when there is a tough melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly humour that the powers of the soul are distracted, good Duties omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the heart so much the more hardned: When upon this the Lord lets loose the band of the conscience, oppressing the same with exceeding fears and terrours, this the Lord uses as a wedge to cleave in sunder a hard piece of wood. God then doth shew us, because we would not plough our selves we shall be ploughed. If we would judge our selves (saith the Apostle) we should not be judged, and therefore the Church confesses and complains, <hi>Psalm</hi> 129.2. <hi>That the ploughers ploughed upon her back and made deep furrows,</hi> Why? How came this, she did not plough up her own fallow ground, wherefore the Lord sent her other strangers and harsh ploughers, that ploughed her soundly indeed. Wherefore doth God thus deal with his Children, because he is the great and most wise <hi>Husband-man,</hi> who will not sow amongst thorns. Therefore when he is about to sow the seed of Eternal Life in the soul (which must take deep root and grow for ever) he will have the ground throughly ploughed.</p>
                     <p>The way then to avoid these things, that are so harsh and displeasing to flesh and blood, is to take the Rod betimes and beat our selves, for when we are slow and secure and omit this, God doth do the work himself: But yet God makes a difference of good education in those who have kept themselves from the common pollutions, and gross sins of the times, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God, saith comes into them, they know not how, nor the time, Grace drops in by little and little, now a little and then a little by degrees, sin is more and more hated, and the heart inflamed with a desire of good things in a conscionable Life. But in a measure (I say) such must have had, have, or shall have fears and terrours; so much as may keep them from sin, and quicken them to go on constantly in the ways of holiness; or when they fly out of the way they shall smart for it and be whipped home again; yet for the main they find themselves as it were in Heaven they know not how. But if a man have stuck deep and long in sin, he must look for a greater measure of humiliation and fear, and a more certain time of his calling, there must be hawling and pulling such a man out of the fire with
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99037:92"/>
violence; and he must not look to obtain peace and comfort with ease, God will thunder and lighten in such a man's conscience in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he speak peace unto him in Mount <hi>Zion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A second time there is also, of a great measure of humiliation; which is (though a man may be free from great, gross sins, and worldly pollutions) when the Lord intends to shew the feeling of his mercy and the sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to any in an extraordinary measure, or to fit them for some high services, then they shall be much humbled before, as we see St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.9. <hi>God did thunder upon him, and beat him down in the High way to the ground, being stricken with blindness for three days after.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus much shall suffice to have been spoken of the 15th verse, touching the Spirit of Bondage, and the spirit of Adoption. The Apostle tells them, they may thank God the spirit of fear thus came, that hereafter they might partake of the Spirit of Adoption to fear no more; he stirs them up (as it were) to be thankful, because now they had obtained a better state: Why, what estate? A very high one, <hi>vers.</hi> 16. <hi>The Spirit it self beareth witness with our spirits, that we are the children of God.</hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving spoken concerning the Spirit of Bondage and the Spirit of Adoption in the former verse, the Apostle, in these words that I have now read, doth as it were stir up those unto thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; to whom he writes, because they had now attained to a better state; The Spirit it self bearing witness with their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that they are the children of God.</p>
                     <p>The thing then is, to know our selves to be the children of God, there must be sound evidences; here then are two set down, whose Testimony we cannot deny. I will touch them as briefly as I can, and so will make an end.</p>
                     <p>First, the witness of our spirit.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the witness of God's Spirit with our spirits.</p>
                     <p>These are two Evidences, not single, but compounded; wherein you see there may be some work of our spirit.</p>
                     <p>But some may say, our spirit is deceitful; how then can our own spirit work in this manner to testifie?</p>
                     <p>I answer, In this place (our Spirit) is as it were an evidence of God from heaven, as a loud token given, assuring me upon good grounds, that I have not mis-applyed the promises; but though God do write bitter things against me, yet that I love him still, and cleave unto him, that for all this I know that I still hunger and thirst after Righteousness; that I will not be beaten off, nor receive an ill report of my Lord and Saviour; that I rest, wait, fear and trust in him still. When thus our valour and faith is tryed, then comes the same spirit, and seals with our spirit, that we are the children of God: When our seal is first put, then God seals with our spirit, the same thing by his spirit. To this effect is that in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. we read three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are set down, the Spirit, the Water, aand the Blood; and these three agree in one. These three witness that we have everlasting life, and that our names are written in heaven. How do these three agree with these two Witnesses? very well: St. <hi>John,</hi> he ranks them according to the order of their clearest evidence; first the Spirit, then the Water, then the Blood: the Apostle here, he ranks them according to their natural being; first, our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Justification and Sanctification, and then God's spirit. For the spirit, of all other, this is the clearest evidence; and when this is bright and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, there needs no more, the thing is sealed. So the Testimony of Water is a clear evidence, (whereby is meant Sanctification) this is put next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Spirit; for when the Spirit is silent, yet this may speak: for though I have many wants and imperfections in me, yet if my spirit can testifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me that I have a desire to please God in all things, that I resolve upon and set up his service as the pitch of all my utmost endeavours, that with allowance I willingly cherish no corruption, but set my self against all sin; this Water will comfort and hold up a man from sinking; as we see in all the sore tryals of <hi>Job, Job</hi> 28.2. Still he stood upon the integrity of his own
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99037:93"/>
spirit, and would not let that go, though he were sore beaten of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and slandered for a wicked person. But the water may be muddy, and the strugling of the flesh and spirit so strong, that we happily shall not be able to judge which is master: What then? Then faith lays hold of the blood in Justification, (which though it be the darkest testimony) yet is as sure as any of the other. Now in comparing of these witnesses together in St. <hi>John</hi> and in my text, I rank the water and the blood with the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our spirit. And the Spirit mentioned in St. <hi>John</hi> and in my Text, to be all one; not as though we wrought them, but we believe them to be so. If a man ask how I know that I am sanctified, the answer must be, I believe and know it to be so: the work producing these things in me comes of God; but for the work of discerning (this is certain) how our affections stand in this case; it comes of us, but yet to come nearer the matter.</p>
                     <p>The testimony of our spirit I conceive to be, when a man hath taken a survey of those excellent things belonging unto <hi>Justification</hi> and <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> when according to the substantial truths which I know in the Word, I observe and follow as fast as I can what is there commanded; when I take the <hi>Candle</hi> of the Word, and with the bright burning <hi>lamp</hi> search into the Word, what is there to be done, and so bring it home to my self, thereby mortifying my corruptions; this is the ground-work of the witness of our Spirit. First, (as in the blood) with my spirit I must see what is needful to be done in order unto Justification, what free promises of invitation belong thereunto; I must see how God justifies a sinner, what conditions on our part are required in Justification; I must see what footings and grounds for life, and what way of hope there is for a graceless man to be saved; yea, even for the worst person that may be. In this case a man must not look for any thing in himself as a cause, Christ must not be had by exchange, but received as free gift; as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that it may be by grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed.</hi> I must there bring unto the receiving of Christ a bare hand. It must be of grace: God for this cause will make us let fall every thing before we shall take hold of him. Though qualified with humiliations, I must let all fall; not trusting unto it, as to make me the worthier to receive Christ (as some think.) When thus (at first for my Justification I received Christ) I must let any thing I have fall, to lay hold of him; that then he may find us thus naked as it were, in our blood; and in this sort God will take us, that all may be of mere grace. Another thing the Apostle adds, and that is, that the promise may be sure: If any thing in us might be as a cause or help to our Justification, a man should never be sure; therefore it is all of grace, that the promise might be sure. As though God should say, I care for nothing else; bring me my Son, and shew me him, and then all is well. And in this case you see he doth not name hope, or love, or any other grace, but faith; for the nature of faith is to let fall all things in laying hold on Christ: In Justification, faith is a sufferer only; but in Sanctification, it works and purgeth the whole man; and so witnesses the certainty and truth of our Sanctification, and so the assurance of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Hence from the nature hereof in this work, the Apostle in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. writes to them <hi>who had obtained like precious faith:</hi> In this case it is alike to all in vertue in this work, whatsoever the measure be. And I may liken it thus, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> you know, writes, <hi>With these hands I get my living.</hi> Now, though strong hands may work more than weak hands, and so earn a great deal more; yet a beggar who holds out his hand, may receive more than he or any other could earn. So faith justifies only receiving, not working; as we may see, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>But to as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God; even to them that believe in his Name.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99037:93"/>
him; that is, believe in him; How? Come and take him: How? as it is in <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. <hi>And let him that is athirst come; and whosoever will, let him come, and take of the water of life freely.</hi> Now, when I see that God keeps open house, come who will, without denying entertainment to any, and when God's spirit hath wrought the will in me, what lets me now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ? Now, when the spirit hath wrought this will in me, and I come, and take God at his word, and believe in Christ; laying hold by degrees on the other promises of life, winding and wrapping my self in them as I am able, it is faith: But that perswasion only which many have, that they shall go to heaven, is not faith, but rather a consequent hereof. The promise is made unto those that believe in Christ; <hi>For in him,</hi> says the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>all the promises are yea, and Amen.</hi> If a man weep much and beg hard for the remission of sins, he may weep and be without comfort unto the end of his life, unless he have received Christ, and applyed his vertues home unto his trembling soul. A man must first receive Christ, and then he hath a warrant to interest himself in all the promises. So that now this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, if such a man were asked, hast thou a warrant to receive Christ? Yes, I have a warrant, says the soul, for he keeps open house unto all that come, wellcoming all, and I have a will to come, this is a good and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient warrant for me to come, if I have a will wrought in me, and then if I do come, this is the first thing to be observed in the witness of our Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Now if a man do stagger for all the King keeps open house, so as he will not, or does not come, then in the second place comes Invitation, because we are slow to believe, therefore God invites us, as in <hi>Matthew</hi> 11.28. Come unto me all ye that Labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Many object, O I am not worthy to come, but you see here is invitation to encourage me to come, yea the sorer and heavier my load is, I should come so much the rather: So that in this case, if the question should be asked of such a one, friend how came you hither? What warrant had you to be so bold? Then he shews forth his ticket, (as if he should say) Lord thou gavest me a word of comfort, a warrant of thy invitation, in obedience to thy word, and faith in thy promise, I come hither. Now this invitation is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to them who as yet have no goodness in them, when then my Spirits warrants this much unto me, that upon this word of promise, and invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have come in for releif and ease of may miseries unto Christ Jesus, the great Physician, relying on him for cure, and lying as it were at his feet for mercy, this is the testimony of my Spirit that I do believe, and a ground for me to rest on, that now I am in the way of life, and justified by his grace.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, sometimes Christ meets with a dull and slow heart, lazy and careless (in a manner) what becomes of it, not knowing or weighing the dangerous state it is in, making excuses; here Christ may justly leave us, (for is it not much that the King should invite us for our good) as he did these in the Gospel, who for refusing to come to his Supper were excluded from ever tasting thereof, strangers being fetched in, in their places. God might so deal with us, but you see in 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.20. God sends as Embassage to entreat us, (erects as it were) a new office for our sakes, saith he: <hi>Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead to be reconcile unto God:</hi> This may seem to be needless, we being weaker than he. Ambassadours for the most part are sent unto those that are stronger. The Apostle reasons the matter, are we stronger than he, do we provoke the Lord to anger? But here we see and may admire his infinite rich goodness, that he comes and sues to us to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, as we see it is a kind of indignity for a great Monarch to sue for peace to them that are far below him and his inferiours. This dishonour God is willing to put up at our hands, and sues unto us first, when it rather
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99037:94"/>
became us upon our knees to beg and sue first unto him. The effect of the Embassy is, that we would be friends with him, and receive that which is so highly for our advancement; when therefore I see that this quickens in my heart, so that as (S. <hi>James</hi> speaks) of the engrafted word, that is able to save our souls) I can bring it home, having some sweet relish, and high estimation of it in my heart, that it begins to be the square and rule of my life, then I am safe. If this or any of these fasten upon the soul, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I yield and come in, it is enough to shew that I am a justified person. And from hence our spirit may witness, and that truly: this is a third thing in the witness of our spirit.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if none of all this will do, then comes a farther degree, a command from the highest, you shall do it; as in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>And this is his commandment that we should believe on his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another as he gave us commandment.</hi> In the Parliament of Grace there is a Law of Faith, which binds me as strictly to believe, as to keep any of the commandments: Says the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>Where is boasting then? it is excluded, by what Law? of works? nay, but by the Law of Faith.</hi> So that if I will not believe on the Lord Jesus, who eases me of the vigour of the Law, and so is my righteousness, I must perish for ever. What? may one object, must I needs believe? Yes, thou art as strictly bound to believe, as not to murder, or not to be an Idolater, not to steal or commit adultery: nay, I will add more, that thy infidelty and contempt of that gracious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, thy disobedience to the Law of Faith is greater than thy breach and disobedience to the Law of Works, when thou dost fling God's grace in his face again, and (as it were) trample under foot the blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: See for this <hi>John</hi> 16.9. What is that great sin which Christ came to reprove? even this infidelity (saith he) <hi>because they believe not in me:</hi> which in two respects is a great sin. First, because it is a sin against God's mercy. Secondly, because it is a chain which links and binds all sins toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus our Faith is sure when it relies on the word, otherwise all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoughts are but presumption, and will fail a man in the time of need; for what is faith but my assent to believe every word of God he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to believe, and so endeavour the practice of it.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, if none of these prevail, there comes threatning; then God swears, that such as refuse shall never enter into his rest. If a Prince should sue unto a Beggars Daughter for marriage, and she should refuse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn him, do you think he would be well pleased? So it is with us, when the King of Heavens Son sends unto us. Will you be married to me? if we refuse, the Son takes it wonderfully ill. Therefore <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.12. he says, <hi>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little, blessed are all those that put their trust in him.</hi> So in the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> God swore, that because of infidelity, those unbelieving Jews should never enter into his rest. All the rest of the threatnings of the Law were not backed with an oath, there was some secret reservation of mercy unto them upon the satisfaction of Divine Justice; but here there is no reservation, God hath sworn such shall never come into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Look not for a third thing in God, now as a mitigation of his oath, it cannot be, he hath sworn that an unbeliever shall never enter into his Rest.</p>
                     <p>These five things are the grounds of Faith, even unto the worst and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiest persons that may be, and by all or some of them he creates Faith in us, which once wrought in the heart by the spirit of God secretly, and we discerning the same, this is the witness of our spirit.</p>
                     <p>Now our spirit having viewed all these things, and the promises upon which they are grounded; thus it witnesseth, as if one should demand of a man, Are these things presented to thy view, true? Yes, will he say, true
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99037:94"/>
as true as the Gospel: then the next thing is, is all good and profitable? O yes, says he, all is very good and desirable; then the upshot is, I; but is this good for thee? If your soul answer now, Yes, very good to me; if then thou accept of this, and wrap and fold thy self in the promises, thou canst not wind thy self out of comfort and assurance to be Christ Jesus; for pray what makes up a match but the consent of two agreeing: so the consent of two parties agreeing (upon this message) makes up the match betwixt us and Christ, uniting and knitting us unto him. There are also (being now incorporated) other means to make us grow up him, by which time discovers what manner of ingrafting we have had into him: for we see four or five scions are ingrafted into a stock, yet some of them may not be incorporated with the stock, but wither. So many are by the Word and Sacraments admitted as retainers and believers of the promises, who shrink and hold not out, because they never were throughly incorporated into Christ, but imperfectly joyned unto him. But howsoever all that come to life must pass this way, if they look for sound comfort. And thus much shall suffice for the witness of our Spirit in Justification.</p>
                     <p>But the testimony of our spirit goes further, wherein I might shew how in sanctification our spirit saith, Lord, prove me, if there be any evil in me, and lead me in the way everlasting: he loves the Brethren, and desires to fear God, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> pleads, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name.</hi> This is the warrant that I am partaker of that inward true washing, and not of that outward only of the Hog, which being kept clean and in good company will be clean, till there be an occasion offered of wallowing in the mire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. But when I find that though there were neither Heaven to reward me, nor Hell to punish me, if opportunity were offered, yet my heart riseth against sin, because of him who hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it; this is a sure evidence, and testifies that I am a child of God. This is for the first thing in bringing of a man in, to survey the promises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Justification and Sanctification, wherein our spirit seeing it self to have interest, doth truly and on sound judgment witness the assurance of our Salvation. Secondly, when I find Christ drawing me, and changing my nature, that upon the former reasonings, view, and laying hold of Christ, making me now have supernatural thoughts and delights, (for this a man may have;) then certainly my spirit may conclude that I am blessed: for saith the Scripture, <hi>Blessed is the man whom thou chusest, and causest to come unto thee.</hi> But some like Dreamers do dream of this only, I know not on what grounds, but do I this waking with my whole soul? doth my spirit testifie it upon good grounds, why then I may rest upon it, it is as sure as may be. Thus much is the testimony of our spirit. Now it is clear how faith is wrought, briefly two ways, which the Lord useth to bring a man to the survey of those grounds upon which our spirit doth witness.</p>
                     <p>First, he works upon the understanding.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, On the will and affections.</p>
                     <p>It is a strange thing to consider how this work is begun and finished? so that we may say hereof as the Lord poseth <hi>Job</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> 38.37. <hi>Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who hath given understanding to the heart?</hi> And in another place, <hi>Where is the way where light dwelleth, and as for darkness where is the place thereof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, God enlightens the understanding with the thunderings of the Law, when he shews a man such a sight as he could not have believed, and convinceth hem in general, that his estate is not good, that without mercy Hell attends him; this is a flash of Lightning from Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> Secondly, comes a Thunder-clap, laying all down, laying flat the will and affections, dejecting a man; so that this first secret work of faith is a captivating of the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99037:95"/>
understanding, will and affections. Now the act both of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the will is set forth in this case, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.13. <hi>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, were perswaded of them, and embraced them,</hi> &amp;c. In this Scripture is set down the two hands and arms of faith. First, believing Christ out of sight. Secondly, laying hold and embracing the promises. They in the old Testament did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ in the flesh, and so are said to look afar off: as the Apostle speaks 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Whom ye having not seen ye love, in whom though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoyce,</hi> &amp;c. But the Apostle adds they were perswaded of the promises, and embraced them. This is the work of the spirit upon the understanding, convincing the soul of sin, shewing there is a remedy, tells the soul all is marvellous true that God hath revealed in his word; and then draws to this conclusion, Christ came to save sinners, whereof I am chief; therefore he came to save me.</p>
                     <p>Yet all this while the will may be stubborn and rebellious, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections disordered; therefore here comes in the second arm of faith, not only being perswaded of the word as a word of truth, but as a good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of good things to me: so that here is another degree of the working of the spirit to compel the will and affections, so sweetly grace having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved that perversness and disorder which governed them before. Now this gentle enforcing and often beating upon the will again and again what the understanding hath rightly conceived, this at last works upon the will, and moves it; for we see the wickedest man in the world lays hold on the worst things as good and profitable unto him: so when the best thing is presented to the will as the best thing, and the necessity thereof urged by dangers ensuing inevitably, if I will not, then it apprehends that, and says of it, as <hi>Peter</hi> at the Transfiguration; <hi>It is good for us to be here, and let us build Tabernacles.</hi> Hence you see what faith is in this working, An act of the understanding forcing in that way of conviction which we mentioned, the will and affections. And thus when the understanding is captivated, and the will brought to be willing, then the first act of faith is past. From whence we proceed to the second, which is the running to the City of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, the application and believing of the promises, and so to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending of Christ, surveying of the promises belonging to justification and sanctification, and bringing them home to the soul, from whence comes the witness of our spirit.</p>
                     <p>Before we come yet to speak of God's spirit witnessing with our spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause betwixt this work there may be many times, and is an interposing trial, ere the spirit of God witness with our spirit, we will first touch that. When our spirit hath thus witnessed in Justification and Sanctification, God may now write bitter things against me, seem to cast me off, and wound me with the wounds of an enemy, remove the sense of the light of his countenance from me; what then is to be done? why, yet I will trust in him though he kill me, sure I am: <hi>I have loved and esteemed the words of his mouth more than mine appointed food,</hi> (as <hi>Job</hi> speaks) I have laid hold of Christ Jesus by the promises, and believe them: I have desired and do desire to fear him, and yield obedience to all his Commandments: if I must needs die, I will yet wait on him, and die at his feet. Look, here is the strength of faith, Christ had faith without feeling, when he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> When sense is marvellous low, then faith is at the strongest. Here we must walk and live by faith, we shall have sense and sight enough in another world. The Apostle tells us, <hi>Now we walk by faith, and not by sight, and by faith we stand.</hi> As we may see a pattern of the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Matth. 15.22. First she was repulsed as a stranger, yet she goes on, then she was called a dog, she might now have been discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged so as to have given over her suit; but see this is the nature of Faith,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99037:95"/>
to pick comfort out of discouragements; to see out of a very small hole those things which raise and bring consolation: she catches at this quickly, Am I a dog? why yet it is well, for the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their Master's Table. Thus Faith grew stronger in her, and when this trial was past, Christ says unto her, <hi>O woman,</hi> not O dog now, <hi>great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi> And thus have I done with the testimony of our spirit.</p>
                     <p>Then from our believing of God in general, believing and applying the promises, and valourous trustings of God, and restings upon God, taking him at his word, comes the testimony of <hi>Gods spirit witnessing with our spirit that we are the children of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I say this being done, and God having let us see what his strength in us is, he will not let us stand long in this uncomfortable state, but will come again and speak peace to us, that we may live in his sight (as if he should say) what, hast thou believed me so on my bare word? Hast thou honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me so as to lay the blame and fault of all my trials on thy self for thy sins, clearing my Justice in all things? hast thou honoured me so as to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie mercy to wait and hope on it for all this? hast thou trusted me so as to remain faithful in all thy miseries? Then the Lord puts unto the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our spirit the seal of his spirit, as we may read <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.13. Says the Apostle, <hi>In whom also ye trusted after that ye heard the word of truth, the Gopel of your Salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with the holy spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance,</hi> &amp;c. Here is the difference betwixt faith and sense, faith takes hold of general promises, draws then down to particulars, applies them, and makes them her own, lives and walks by them, squaring the whole life by them in all things. But sense is another thing; even that which is mentioned <hi>Psalm</hi> 35.3. When there is a full report made to the soul of its assured happiness, <hi>Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.</hi> When a man hath thus been gathered home by glorifying him, and believing his truth, then comes a special evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the soul with an unwonted joy, and saith, <hi>I am thy salvation,</hi> which in effect is that which Christ in another place speaks, <hi>John</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifest my self unto him.</hi> And as it is in the Canticles 1.2. <hi>Then he will kiss us with the kisses of his mouth,</hi> so as we shall be able to say, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> When God hath heard us cry awhile till we be throughly humbled, then he takes us up into his arms, and dandles us.</p>
                     <p>So that a meditation of the word being past, a man having viewed his Charter and the promises, surveying Heaven, the priviledges of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and the glory that is to come; then comes in the Spirit and makes up a third, with which comes joy unspeakable and glorious in such a measure, that for the present we can neither wish nor desire any thing else, the soul resting wonderfully ravished and contented. This cannot, nor shall not always continue, but at sometimes we shall have it, yet it remains always so, as it can never finally be taken away, as our Saviours promise is <hi>John</hi> 16, 22. <hi>And ye now therefore have sorrow, but I will see you again; and your heart shall rejoyce, and your joy shall no man take from you.</hi> This is the root of all consolation, that God will not forsake for ever: But will at last come again, and have compassion on us, according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
                     <p>But here some may Object: What? Doth the spirit never seal but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some such hard tryals after the witness of our Spirit?</p>
                     <p>I answer, the sealing of Gods Spirit with our Spirit is not always tyed to hard foregoing tryals immediately, for a man may be surveying Heaven and the glory to come, or praying earnestly with a tender and melting heart, applying the promises, and wrastling with God, and at the same time Gods
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99037:96"/>
seal many times may be and is put unto the same. For as the Wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where it listeth, and no man discerneth the coming thereof: So may the Spirit seal at divers times, and upon divers occasions; yea and why may it not seal in time of some great suffering for the truth, as we read of the Apostles in 5 <hi>Acts</hi> 41. <hi>Who went away from the Council, rejoycing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly for tryal we must now see how to distinguish this Testimony of the true Spirit, from the counterfeit Illumination of the Anabaptists and some Fryars who will have strange suddain Joys, the Devil no question then transforming himself into an Angel of light unto them. This tryall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is made by three things going before, and three things following af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, For the things that go before.</p>
                     <p>First see that the ground-work be true. If a man be in the faith, and do believe the word, if upon believing and meditation, there be an opening unto the knock of Christ at the first, and not a delaying him like the lazy spouse in the Canticles, if in this case the spirit come and fill the heart with joy, then all is sure and well, it comes with a promise, for then Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to enter, but if a man have a dull dead delaying ear, and therewith great fantastick Joys, he may assure himself the right Spirit hath not wrought them, they are but idle speculations, but if this joy comes upon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying of our Charter and evidences, it is sure we may build upon it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A man must consider, if he hath as yet overcome strong passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and tentations, and passed thorough much hazard and peril for Christ, having been buffeted with divers temptations of which he hath obtained mastery; for the seal of Gods Spirit with our Spirit, comes as reward of service done, as you may see <hi>Revelat.</hi> 3.17. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, and I will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereby he means he will give a secret love token to the soul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it rests assured of the unspeakable love of God, and freedom from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Now what was this white stone? The <hi>Athenians</hi> had a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, when Malefactors were accused and arraigned, to have black and white stones by them, and so according to the sentence given, those condemned had a black, and the acquitted had a white stone given them, unto this the Holy Ghost here alludes, that this stone, this seal shall assure them of absolute acquittance from condemnation, and so free them of the cause of fear. Again he tells us Christ will give a man a new Name, that is, write his Absolution in fair letters in the white stone, with a clear evidence: As if he should say (when Christ hath seen a man overcoming, and how he hath conflicted with tentations, and yet holds out, pressing for the Crown unto the end of the race.) Christ will come in then and stroak him on the head, easing him of all his pains and sores with such a sweet refreshing as is unspeakable. When a man hath won it, he shews he then shall wear it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if the Spirit seal after Meditation on the word, it is right, the Apostle says <hi>in whom after that ye believed ye were sealed,</hi> &amp;c. Examine the root of this joy, the Spirit gives no comfort but by the word. If a man do meditate on the promises, and thereupon have a flame of love kindled, this is sure a man may say, the word did stir it up: if it be Gods Comfort, God will have his word to make way unto it, some there are who find no sweetness in the word, what is the cause thereof? Because they chew not the word to imprint it on their memories and in their heart. If comfort come whilst a man meditating on the promises doth wedge it home upon his heart; it is of God, otherwise it is counterfeit and false. These are the forerunners to this seal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:99037:96"/>In the next place, there are three things that follow after this sealing which the Spirit leaves behind it. As,</p>
                     <p>First, (humility) as in his knowledge, so in his sense, it makes a man more humble. There is naturally in all a certain pride, which must be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome: (says the Apostle) <hi>What hast thou that thou hast not Received?</hi> But by the contrary the nearer a man comes unto the glory of God, he finds so much the more rottenness in his bones, as we see in Job, <hi>I have heard of thee</hi> (say he unto God) <hi>by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth thee,</hi> his inference is <hi>therefore I abhor my self and Repent in dust and ashes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, another thing the Spirit leaves behind it (if it seals rightly) is a prevention of security for time to come. In this case we must look for a new encounter, a false perswasion makes a man to fall into security be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Satan is then most malicious and busy, a man must stand faster then ever. The Devil hates them most that are most endued with Gods Image, whom because he cannot reach he persecutes in his members. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this case it must be with us as it was with <hi>Elias.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.8. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such an enlightning a man must now think that he hath a great Journey to go, and so walk on in the strength of that a long time. The Devil we see watcheth a man, and when he is at the best then endeavours to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. As we may see in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> no sooner were they placed in that estate of Innocency but he tempts them, how much more a man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a sweeter tast of the Spirit, and less strength now, may he look to be set upon. And therefore in these feasting days he had need to be more on his watch and pray more: for we have more given us then <hi>Adam</hi> had, we have a new Name given us, a secret Love token, further we see Christ says <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I stand at the door and knock, if any man will open unto me, I will come in and sup with him and he with me.</hi> Now in this case if we be such persons who let our hearts fly open to let him in, we are safe; as if he should say, if you would be sure of reconciliation to be at peace with me, sup with me and I will sup with you: For we know if men who were enemies be once brought to keep company together and to eat and drink one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, we use to say all is done and wrapped up in the table cloath, all old reckonings are taken away, now they are certainly become friends. But if like the spouse in the Canticles, <hi>we let him stand knocking and will not let him in, we also</hi> may have great and sound knocks and blows our selves before we find him again; as we read it befel the Church there, <hi>whom the Watchmen found, beat and took away her veil, as she was seeking Christ.</hi> If we would have comfort therefore, let us mark the knocking of the spirit, and not grieve him by withstanding holy motions; and then we shall find him sealing up our salvation, <hi>witnessing with our spirits that we are the children of God.</hi> Men you see wait for the wind, and not the wind for them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they may wait long enough before they reach home: so must we watch the knockings of Christ, and let him in, that his spirit may seal us up to the day of Redemption.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly: Another thing the true witness of the spirit leaves behind it is Love. It makes a man more inflam'd with love to God. If a man do not love God more after such an enlightening it is false and counterfeit, <hi>Psalm</hi> 116. <hi>I will love thee dearly, O Lord my God, because thou hast heard my voice.</hi> And says the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The love of Christ constraineth us.</hi> And therefore if we be obedient Sons, we will shew it in loving and honouring our Father more and more, as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Malach.</hi> 6. <hi>A Son ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth his Father, and a servant his Master, if then I be a Father, where is mine honour</hi>? These are the trials before and after a true illumination to try it from the counterfeit, which that we may always find and observe in our selves, Let us pray, O Lord our God, &amp;c.</p>
