         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Going naked, a Signe.</head>
            <p>OH Church of <hi>England,</hi> This is unto thee, who liveſt in oppreſſion and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
pride and covetouſneſſe, a day of miſery is coming upon thee, thy
nakedneſſe and ſhame is coming upon thee as an armed Man, from which no
Man can hide thee, neither Hills nor Mountaines ſhall be able to hide thee in
this the Day of the Lord, neither ſhall the Clefts of the Rocks preſerve thee from
the Day of the Lords Controverſie with thee; Thy nakedneſſe and thy ſhame is
neare to come upon thee, from it thou ſhalt not flye: Oppreſſion and cruelty
hath been as a Staff for thee, but the Lord is riſen to break thy Staff of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and thou ſhalt be left naked though thou haſt ſeemed to be the glory of
the Nations with thy deceitfull Covers, but now thou ſhalt be left naked, and
Nations ſhall be aſhamed of thee: Howle and weepe yee Teachers, for the Lord
is gathering his people from you, and yee ſhall devour his flock no more: The
Day is coming upon you that none ſhall buy your Wares any more ye Merchants
of <hi>Babylon:</hi> All your ſcarlet colours the Lord our God is coming to take off:
Then your nakedneſſe ſhall appeare to many Nations, and you ſhall ſit as a Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and there ſhall be none to comfort you; Diſtreſſe and anguiſh ſhall take
hold upon you, and pain as a Woman in travell, and is not able to bring forth,
ſo ſhall your miſery come upon you: The Decree of the Lord is gone out againſt
all unrighteouſneſſe, he will ſurely reward every one according to their works,
for as a Troop of Robbers lye in waite for a Man, ſo a company of Prieſts by
conſent lye in waite to murther the innocent Lambs of God, and for their ſakes
the Lord is riſen in his mighty power to break the bonds of wickedneſſe, and
to ſet the oppreſſed free, for the Lord hath heard the groaning of his ſeed, and
he is riſen to deliver to bring it out of Captivity, and from under the Taskmaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
where his ſeed hath been long oppreſſed by unreaſonable Men: But the Lord
will ſpare no longer, but he will reward the Oppreſſors double into their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes,
and his ſeed he will deliver.</p>
            <p>Oh howle and weepe your day is far ſpent, Night is coming upon you that
you ſhall not have a Viſion, and nothing ſhall be left to cover you: As naked
ſhall you be ſpiritually, as my body hath been temporally naked in many places
in <hi>England,</hi> as a ſigne to the nakedneſſe and ſhame that is coming upon the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> who liveth in Oppreſſion and cruelty, and all who lift up a
weapon for her ſhall fall in the ſhame with her, which will ſurely come to paſſe;
So all ſober people conſider your wayes, and turn to the light which comes from
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> that with it you may be gathered unto the Lord from the falſe Teachers
to the teachings of the Lord, from the falſe worſhips to the worſhip of the Lord
in ſpirit and in truth; For a neceſſity was laid upon me from the Lord God of
life and power to be a ſigne: But before I was given up to the thing it was as
death unto me, and I had rather if it had been the Lords will have dyed then gone
on in this ſervice; But when the word of the Lord came unto me ſaying, Goe
on and proſper, It was ſweet unto me, as the honey and the honey Comb. And
bleſſed ſaith Chriſt are they that heares my word and keeps it.</p>
