         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SIR, I thanke you for
your Relation of <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi>
and to make you pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the like commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
I returne to you a
true report of a fresh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
of State, happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
here with vs; memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for the strangenesse
of the matter, and the
great signification it cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with it of Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
and most visible prouidence; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
woorthy to be damned to perpetuall obliuion, as
well for the detestable nature of the fact, as yet more
(if more were possible) for the impietie of the perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
such as I assure you, a man ought to make scruple
to infame the times, or infect mens cogitations with
the repetition of it, were it not that these workes of
darknesse are framed and forged in such a deepe vawte
of hypocrisie, as there is more danger, that they should
be vnreuealed or vnbeleeued, then that being brought
to cleare light, they should prouoke an imitation in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
of that which is so odious and foule.</p>
            <p>And this Sir you may beleeue, that as I haue had
good meanes, to informe my selfe to the full, of that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1303:3"/>
which passed in this matter, and the trueth of all the
particulars, aswell those which were opened at the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignment
of <hi>Edward Squire,</hi> one of the offenders, as
those which were reserued, so I haue set downe this
Narration, rather abridged of some circumstances,
then any wayes amplified or inlarged.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Squire</hi> dwelt in <hi>Greenwich</hi> diuers yeeres, and
tooke vpon him the practise of a Scriuener, yet rather
as a helpe to maintaine himselfe for a time, then that
he bare a minde to settle in that trade. He obtained
also before his going to Sea, for some two yeres space,
an imployment about the Queenes Stable, by way of
deputation to one <hi>Kaies,</hi> a Purueiour of those prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But being of a wit aboue his vocation, disliked
with that condition of life, and put himselfe into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by Sea, in the last voyage Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> made
into the <hi>Indies;</hi> in which voyage, it was his hap, that
the <hi>Frances<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> (a small barke wherein he went) was scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
from the Fleet about <hi>Guadalupe,</hi> and taken by
<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iue Spanish frigots. And so was <hi>Squire</hi> brought pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
into <hi>Spaine,</hi> where soone after he was set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</p>
            <p>Not long after his inlargement, he became known
to <hi>Richard Walpoole</hi> an English fugitiue, and by order
a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> a man of principall credit there, and a kinde
of Vicar generall to <hi>Parsons</hi> in his absence. This <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poole,</hi>
carrying a waking &amp; waiting eye, vpon those of
our Nation, to discouer and single out sit instruments
for the greatest treasons, obserued this <hi>Squire,</hi> found
him a man of more then ordinarie sence and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
for his qualitie and education; found him a man,
that had passed his middle age, well aduised, and yet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1303:3"/>
resolued enough, and not apprehensiue at all of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
(for I doe affirme this vnto you, that neuer man
answered vpon his triall for life and death, with lesse
perturbation, nay scarsely with any alteration, as if he
vnderstood not his perill and calamitie, and yet as
sensible for speech, as insensible for passion.) But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the disposition and temper of the man, <hi>Walpoole</hi>
discerned in him two conditions of speciall aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
The one, that comming into <hi>Spaine</hi> a prisoner,
and not a fugitiue, his returne into <hi>England</hi> would be
subiect to lesse suspition: The other, that he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
<hi>Squire</hi> had formerly had some attendance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Queenes Stable, which he streight caught
holde of, as an opportunity.</p>
            <p>Yet neuerthelesse, the better to prepare him, and
worke him to his purpose; and the better also to giue
couler,(when <hi>Squire</hi> should returne into <hi>England</hi>) that
he was a man that had suffered in <hi>Spaine</hi> for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
subtilly he compassed, that vpon a quarrell
picked, <hi>Squire</hi> was put into the Inquisition. By this
meanes, when he had got his heart into his handes,
mollified by distresse, and became secure of him, that
he was a fixed and resolued Papist.</p>
            <p>After probation and preparation sufficient, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to open himselfe vnto him; and first for introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
fell into the ordinary burden or song, of that
kinde of people, touching the tyrannies and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
exercised here in <hi>England</hi> against Catholiques;
though Sir, you know very well, the distinction and
moderation of the proceedings here in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
causes, with what lenitie, and gentlenesse, it hath
bene caried, except where it was mixed with matter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1303:4"/>
of State; for els I would gladly learne, what should
make the difference, betweene the temper of the
Lawes in the first yeere of the Queene, and in 23. or
27. but that at the one time, they were Papists in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and at the other they were growne Papists in
faction; or what should make the difference at this
day in Lawe, betweene a Queene <hi>Mary</hi> Priest, and a
<hi>Seminarie</hi> Priest, saue that the one is a Priest of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ition,
and the other is a Priest of sedition. But to
the purpose; After the <hi>Iesuite</hi> had at sundry confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
discoursed his pleasure of the miseries of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
here in <hi>England,</hi> and of the slanders of the
gouernment, and vpon how fewe persons liues, the
State here did stand; and <hi>Squire</hi> on the other side,
(who wanted no witte to perceiue which way hee was
ledde) had first made some signification, and after
some more serious and vehement protestation of his
minde and deuotion, to doe seruice to the cause, when
the wicked Frier fawe hee was gotten into the true
circle, hee began to charme; and yet not hauing the
power to fall vpon the highest point first, without a
gradation or bridge, <hi>It were no doubt</hi> (saith hee) <hi>an
acte <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ery meritorious to kill the Earle of</hi> Essex, <hi>but</hi> Vnum
necessarium, <hi>One thing is necessary.</hi> And hauing kept
him in suspence a while, brake with him plainely,
and tolde him, that hee would put a seruice into his
hands, that he might execute and accomplish, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any euident perill of his life, because it was to be
done, what time the Queene her selfe should not bee
in presence; (which I thinke he spake as hauing heard
that which is very true, of some Conspirators, that
hauing vndertaken and vowed her Maiesties destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1303:4"/>
haue neuerthelesse at the very instant of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
and opportunitie, bene stricken with astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and had no power to execute their malice.)
Nay further he said, that he should not need to feare,
in the doing thereof, to be seene or obserued, by any
persons of care or iudgement, but such as might be
easily conuersed withall, without suspition: And it
was the impoysonment of the pommell of the
Queenes Sadell, at such time as shee should ride a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;
her Maiestie being like to rest her hand there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
for a good time together, and not vnlike for her
hand to come often about her face, mouth, and nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrils;
and this by reason of his former acquaintance
and seruice about the Stable, he thought hee might
easily performe, and safely; And yet he said, <hi>If im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
death should insue thereupon hee might not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
of it, as beeing assured that hee should exchange
his present state, with the state of a glorious Saint in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi>
Vnto which accursed proposition after that
<hi>Squire</hi> had assented, then did the Frier vse all diligence
to confirme and binde him to resolution and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
And to that ende, at sundry confessions
tooke his vow and promise to be constant; caused him
to receiue the Sacrament vpon it; renued his diuelish
perswasions, varying them in all fourmes to besiege
his minde and cogitations, that he might finde no
way to get out of this wicked purpose; Telling him
<hi>that he stood now in the state of damnation, if he did not
his vttermost endeuour to perfourme his vowe.</hi> And bid
him remember <hi>how that sinne did seldome obtaine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;
and if he did but once make doubt of the lawfulnesse
or merit of the acte, it was enough to cast him headlong
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1303:5"/>
downe into hell;</hi> And if he did cast any difficulties or
terrors, he wished him to consider <hi>What it did auaile
a man to winne the whole world, and to leese his owne soule.</hi>
So as now <hi>Squire</hi> must not descend into himselfe, he
must make no obiections, cast no doubts; but the eyes
of his vnderstanding blinded and sealed vp, he must
onely contemplate vpon these vowes and adiurations.
And for a conclusion and finall benediction of this
most execrable plot, <hi>Squire</hi> kneeling before <hi>Wallpoole</hi>
at confession, he lifted him vp, hugde him about the
necke with his left arme (such were <hi>Squires</hi> owne
wordes) and crossing him with the other hand after
some wordes mumbled in Latine, sayd distinctly to
him in English, <hi>God blesse thee and giue thee strength my
sonne; be of good courage, I pawne my soule for thine, and
thou shalt haue my prayers dead and aliue.</hi> And vpon this
imbracement and inchantment, this desperate wretch
and this blasphemous Exorcist parted for that time.</p>
            <p>Then doeth he giue him ful instructions for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of this poison; shewing him that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it in a double bladder, and when it should bee
vsed, hee was to pricke the bladderfull of holes vpon
the vpper part, and so to carie it within the palme of his
hand with a thicke gloue for the safegard of his hand:
and in the instant when it was to be applied, he should
turne it in his hand <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he vpside downe, and so presse
it hard vpon the pommell of the saddell: telling him
further of the nature of it, That it would lie and tarrie
long where it was laide; and that it would not be chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
by the aire. And lastly vpon his comming away,
deliuered him the confection it selfe in such a bladder
as was before described.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1303:5"/>This was the true maner of the subornation of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Squire</hi> by <hi>Richard Wallpoole</hi> as it was confessed by
the same <hi>Squire</hi> almost in the same wordes, as well for
the perswasions as for the instructions. Which confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
I doe affirme vnto you vpon knowledge was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
without torture or shewe of torture: and was
roundly and sensibly vttered with all circumstances of
a credible narration for that part which concerneth
the maner of the impoisonment: and for that part
which concerneth the manner of the perswasion was
set downe by an aduised declaration vnder his owne
hand, and the same as farre as hitherto we haue gone,
was mainteined and confirmed, and in no point re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
or disauowed, either at his trial or at his death.</p>
            <p>It seemes also that <hi>Wallpoole</hi> in some of his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
did insist vpon the impoisonment of the Earle
of <hi>Essex,</hi> the rather to defeate the voyage by Sea, then
exspected (for these things past about May 1597.) So
as <hi>Squire</hi> conceiued it, there could bee no one thing
more acceptable in the second degree.</p>
            <p>Nowe after that <hi>Squire</hi> had receiued both poisons,
as well the spirituall poison of wicked resolution, as
the materiall within the bladders; and that <hi>Wallpoole</hi>
had interlaced some promise to him of rewardes and
comforts, besides those of the other world, and had
schooled him for secrecie, which he made to be parcel
of his vow, there rested onely his dispatch for <hi>England.</hi>
Whereunto to giue an apt colour, it was deuised that
there should be a permutation treated, by the meanes
of a Chanon in <hi>Ciuill</hi> of two <hi>Spanish</hi> prisoners here, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
at <hi>Cales,</hi> friends of the saide Chanon, for <hi>Squire</hi>
and <hi>Rowles</hi> nowe Prisoner in the Towre, who came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1303:6"/>
with him<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> wherby it might be caried, farre off from
suspition, that <hi>Squire</hi> did not returne as a man imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but vpon that priuate occasion. According to
which proiect he was sent away conueniently money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he might be the better in heart, and yet not so
abundantly as might make him loue his life too well,
and to goe away with his fare quietly, though indeed
there were more money stirring, but not in that hand.</p>
            <p>And being arriued here in <hi>England</hi> about a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
before the Earles setting foorth towardes the
Ilandes, hee did addresse himselfe to a Counseller of
Estate here, both to shew himselfe to the end to auoid
suspition, and with pretence also of some aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to the ende to winne the better opinion and
trust; and finding his comming well conceiued of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his desire, hee did craftily and subtilely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
with himselfe, that if he could finde any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
to execute his purpose before the Earle went,
(supposing that the poyson could not worke but in
some space of time) it would be more securitie for him
to be absent, and in the voyage, left percase some suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
tokens of poison<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> appearing, somewhat might
fall out (vpon such diligent inquisition as in such a case
were like to bee made) to bee discouered against
him; and therefore made his meanes to goe with the
Earle in his Shippe<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and obtained his sute. So as nowe
making his reckoning to haue the peril vpon his back,
he did but watch his time.</p>
            <p>And it pleased God for the manifestation of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that the Mundaie seuennight next after <hi>Squires</hi>
comming home out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> he vnderstood that the
horses were making readie for her Maiesties riding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1303:6"/>
Whereupon, full of those euill spirites where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
so many exorcismes had possessed him, hee came
into the Stable yard where her Maiesties horse stood
ready sadled, and in a familiar and cheerefull maner in
the hearing of diuers that stood thereby, hauing all
things ready according to his instructions, he laied his
hand vpon the pommell of the Saddle, and sayd, <hi>God
saue the Queene,</hi> (wherein it pleased God to take his
words and not his meaning) and bruized the poison as
he was directed.</p>
            <p>Thus was her Maiesties sacred and precious life by
the All-haile of a second <hi>Iudas</hi> betrayed, the attempt
put in act, and all the Conspirators part plaied to the
vttermost line and title; there rested onely Gods part:
For so it was, that her Maiesties going abroad held; &amp;
as the Viper was vpon S. <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, and shaked off
without hurt; so this done, was in <hi>Iuly</hi> in the heate of
the yeere, when the poores and veines were openest to
receiue any maligne vapor or tincture, if her Maiestie
by any accident had layd her hand vpon the place. And
as the Heathenish people at that time did argue and
conclud<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thereupon, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was a God, so wee
may christianly inferre that it was Gods doing and
power who hath defended his Handmaid and seruant
by his secret and more then naturall influence and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiue
from so actuall &amp; mortall a danger, speaking
by these signes to all her disloyall Subiects and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enemies, That as he hath done great things by her,
past ordinarie discourse of reason, so he hath done, and
will doe as great things for her, beyond the course of
his ordinarie prouidence.</p>
            <p>For surely, if a man consider how many times her
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1303:7"/>
life hath bene sought and assailed, since the beginning
of her raigne, by violence, by poisoning, by superstici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Votaries, by ambicious Vndertakers, by singular
Conspirators, by Conspirators combined, (speaking
of those that haue bene reuealed, besides a number (no
doubt) of the like which haue groueled in darkenesse,
and neuer came to light) hee will not find the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
of Gods fauour in any Soueraigne Prince that
hath reigned.</p>
            <p>But in the meane time you see the strange mysteries
of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> doctrine that haue mingled heauen and
hel, and lift vp the hands of Subiects against the anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God; arming them with the inuisible armour of
Scriptures, Sacraments, Vowes, Prayers and Blessings
against their naturall Soueraigns. Wherein there is
great difference betweene the spirite that wrought in
<hi>Dauid,</hi> and this that worketh in them. For <hi>Dauid</hi> when
relation was made to him (by one that thought he had
done <hi>Saul</hi> the last good office) how <hi>Saul</hi> had fallen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his owne sword in battell, and being in the anguish
of death, and carefull not to fall aliue in the handes of
the <hi>Philistims</hi> a people vncircumcised desired this sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour
to make an ende of him, who did so, and was
therefore by <hi>Dauid</hi> adiudged to die, because hee dared
to lay his hands vpon the anointed of the Lord: and
yet was <hi>Saul</hi> a king forsaken and abandoned of God;
he had taken his mortall wound before, so as this soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
tooke from him his paine, and not his life; and it
was to a good ende, least a heathenish people should
reproch the name of God by insulting vpon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Saul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And surely for my part I doe wonder that Princes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1303:7"/>
doe not concurre in loosing these bands, and suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
this Sect, which maketh a traffique of their sacred
liues, concluding and contracting for them with these
blinded Votaries in the secrecie of confessions and
shrifts. For I doe not see that Pirates (whom the <hi>Ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
account to be <hi>Publici hostes societatis humanae,</hi> and
therefore Princes bound as they affirme, though they
be otherwise in no league one with an other, yea and
though they be enemies, to ioyne in the suppressing &amp;
extirpation of them) are any such disturbers of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
societie as these are. Neither doe I thinke, that
the order of the <hi>Templers</hi> (that was put down through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Christendome in a fewe weekes) were euer offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in so high a degree. And I find somewhat strange
that the bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> (if it were but to auoyd the
aspersion of so great a slander and imputation to that
Religion) should not purge out this leauen so strange
and odious.</p>
            <p>But to returne: within fiue or sixe dayes after this
fact committed, <hi>Squire</hi> went to Sea in the Erles owne
ship, and belike as <hi>Tacitus</hi> sayth, <hi>Ferox scelerum quia
prima prouenerant,</hi> taking the remaine of the same poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with him in a little pot in his portmantue, when
the Earle was at Sea betweene <hi>Faial</hi> and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Michael,</hi> he
bestowed it vpon the pommels of a chaire of wood,
where the Earle vsed to dine and sup: but thankes be
to God nothing came of it neither.</p>
            <p>Now let me acquaint you a little with the maner of
detecting of this matter, which God did likewise
strangely bring about. <hi>Squire</hi> slept now in securitie:
for although he failed of successe, yet he tooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be out of danger: thinking because it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1303:8"/>
betweene his Confessour and him, it could neuer
be reuealed. But his Confessour whom it imported
not so much to keepe it secret as it did <hi>Squire,</hi> tickled
belike with the ioy, that he had such an iron in the
fire, imparted it (for his owne glory) to some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
of the fugitiues there; This raised a great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in them of some effect to insue. When time pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and nothing came of it, they made construction
of it, that <hi>Squire</hi> had beene false to them. One of the
more passionate of them inueyeth bitterly against
<hi>Squire,</hi> telles how he was trusted, and how he had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
the cause; and the better to be reuenged on him,
is content that one (that they let slip hither as if he had
fled from them) should giue information of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
not with the circumstances, but generally against
<hi>Squire,</hi> partly to win himselfe credit, partly to wrecke
themselues on <hi>Squire.</hi> And this fellow, because hee
would be thought to do the better seruice, would not
bring this in his mouth, but in a letter, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to haue stolne out of one of their Studies. This
letter compared with another letter that the same
man brought as written from a seuerall person, both
which letters had one and the same busie knot to both
names, is suspected to be counterfeited; it is so found.
Heereupon it is collected that this was but an engine
against <hi>Squire,</hi> and that he was an honest man. Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was a tender matter, <hi>Squire</hi> was sent for and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.
For a time he denieth; after, he commeth to
some circumstances, which concurring with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
tale, it gaue it to be vnderstood that there was
somewhat true, and that all was not an inuention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him: Holde was taken of that; and thereupon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1303:8"/>
               <hi>Squire,</hi> not knowing how farre his Confessor had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
trust with him, by good perswasion, and Gods
good working, disclosed all without any rigour in the
world.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut vpon a second aduise being a man of a very
good reach, finding that it had bene his wisest way to
haue confessed the whole plot and subornation which
was knowen to <hi>Wallpoole,</hi> and there to haue stopt, and
not to haue tolde of the putting of i<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in execution,
which was onely knowne to himselfe, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
was wonne from him by good following, hee
endeuoured at his arraignment to haue distinguished,
and auowching the first part, to haue retracted the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
pretending that although he vndertooke it, yet
he had not any purpose to performe it.</p>
            <p>Whereupon one of the Commissioners being wel
acquainted with all the particular circumstances, did
set before him the absurditie of his deniall against his
former confession which was voluntarie, particular,
and needlesse (otherwise then in conscience of trueth)
vpon which speech hee being stricken with remorse,
and conuicted in himselfe, acknowledged and iustified
the trueth of his former confession in the hearing of all
the standers by.</p>
            <p>Thus Sir, I haue interteined you with a discourse,
which I thinke in reading will affect you diuersly, as it
did me in writing; But in the ende I thinke wee shall
ioyne in congratulating for our good deliuerance,
and desiring of God the continuance of her
Maiestie, in whom our good
dayes do consist.</p>
