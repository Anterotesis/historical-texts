            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE EPISTLE.</head>
            <p>SInce <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Knaves</hi> are the major part of the World, I muſt expect abundance of Enemies upon the Account of the following Poem; but as I hate the one, ſo I don't fear the other, and ſhall be unconcerned at the Reſentments of both. Truth is a thing no Man need to be aſham'd of, and he that's afraid to defend it deſerves not the Title of a good Patriot. If theſe ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Shot hit ſome, they have no reaſon to complain, ſince I could have as eaſily deſcended to particulars as have wrote in general Terms. I'm ſure all honeſt wiſe Men must agree with me, that none are ſo fit to ſupport a juſt Government, as thoſe who oppos'd the Tyranny of an arbitrary One, and purchas'd a juſt and legal Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the expence of their Blood and Money. 'Tis in vain to form a Government on the moſt Rational Principles of Human Policy, ſuited to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Benefit of Mankind, if the Adminiſtration thereof be put into the hands of ſuch Men, who have neither Wiſdom to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand, nor Honour nor Honeſty enough to Support it: The very Being of that Prince is precarious, whoſe Government is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Knaves.</hi> The firſt are not able to give him Advice, yet through their folly may betray his Councils, which is equally as bad, as the others making themſelves a piece of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb facs="tcp:58956:3"/>
on purpoſe to rend the whole. There is as much difference betwixt Buſineſs and Grimace, the Combing of a Periwig, and the Exerciſe of right Reaſon, as there is betwixt the two greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries in the World. To prefer a Man becauſe he is a Fop, a Beau, or intreſted by Marrying a Caſt Chamber-maid, is very ridiculous: Or to prefer a Knave to Cheat a third King, becauſe he has Cheated two before, is monſtrous indeed, whilſt noble Patriots, and Defenders of the Liberties of their Country, are perhaps forc'd quietly to ſee the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of their Labour and Toil raviſh'd out of their hands, and nothing left to do but to contemplate on their Misfortunes, and can hardly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt their Fates, Hanging under Tyrannical Princes, and Starving under a Juſt One. They may look back, with an envious Eye, upon ſuch of their Companions, who have made their <hi>Exit</hi> at the Gallows, whoſe fatherleſs Children are ſo far from being Rewarded, that the Memory of their Parents is a Bar to their Preferment; And to conſider that a Righteous and Good Government is founded upon the Ruins of thoſe very Patriots, makes the Scene yet more black and diſmal. He only, that Governs the World, knows what will be the effect of ſuch Management; But I ſadly remember, it has been ſaid, <hi>Quos Deus vult perdere, prius dementat.</hi>
