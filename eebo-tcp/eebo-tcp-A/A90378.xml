            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PEMBROKES Enaration, a little before his Death, or, his
Remonſtrance to all his fellow Rebells, with his Caution
to the City of LONDON.</head>
            <l>DAm me what ſhall I doe? me thinkes I find,</l>
            <l>The Pangs of Hell, all in a troubled mind;</l>
            <l>Blood cryes for Blood; nay, 'tis the K. blood too,</l>
            <l>That gripes my Soul, and ſpeaks my fatall woe:</l>
            <l>Zounds, I did Covenant, to maintaine his Right,</l>
            <l>And to defend him, with my utmoſt might,</l>
            <l>Plague take the Foole, 'twas I, with many more,</l>
            <l>Like Lordly Fooles, that did his Death implore,</l>
            <l>Cauſe was (Gods Blood) becauſe he was too wiſe,</l>
            <l>Too good for's all, and would not Sympathiſe;</l>
            <l>Or to ſpeake home, God dam me give conſent.</l>
            <l>For to ſubſcribe our Acts of PARLIAMENT.</l>
            <l>When We a headleſſe Number, oft did meet,</l>
            <l>For to ſubject the Head, unto the Feet;</l>
            <l>Vnder pretence, that We, were joyntly bent,</l>
            <l>To give to him, and all; all juſt content.</l>
            <l>Confuſion take me, I was fool'd to this,</l>
            <l>Vnder the motion that We all were his;</l>
            <l>But now unto my hearts great griefe I find,</l>
            <l>That I was led, juſt like a man was blind.</l>
            <l>With thouſands more, who all did then combine,</l>
            <l>To ſhorten him, who to us gave the Line;</l>
            <l>Shewed us the way how we might prevent,</l>
            <l>Enſuing Evills, and ſpeake full content,</l>
            <l>God dam me, to us all: curſt be the houre,</l>
            <l>That I did ere rebell, (againſt his Power)</l>
            <l>A Catalogue I could name of thoſe,</l>
            <l>God dam my Soule, that were this mortall Foes;</l>
            <l>Some Brewers, Tinkers, and ſome other were</l>
            <l>Broome-men and Coblers, and I dare to ſweare,</l>
            <l>Some of unknowne Birth; the beſt but baſe,</l>
            <l>And yet we all ſhooke hands, to runne one Race.</l>
            <l>I like a Lordly Foole, had no more wit,</l>
            <l>But as the Commons bid me, ſtand or ſit;</l>
            <l>And now (Gods Blood) I know not what to doe,</l>
            <l>Death ſweares he'le have me, and ſome others too:</l>
            <l>Though made of Steele, or Iron, 'tis all one,</l>
            <l>The State muſt fall too, when he cryes come, come,</l>
            <l>Zounds, whether ſhall we goe, Dam me old <hi>Nick.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I feare will ſhew us all, a plaguy Trick.</l>
            <l>Gods Blood in Heaven, there cannot be a place,</l>
            <l>For any of us Round-Heads, the Royall Race,</l>
            <l>Such as for <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> did manly fight,</l>
            <l>Will keepe us out, proteſting 'tis their Right.</l>
            <l>Why, whether then (Gods Zounds) muſt <hi>Pembroke</hi> goe,</l>
            <l>With all the reſt, <hi>Pluto</hi> doth onely know.</l>
            <l>Ah, how Death haules me to ſome fatall Place,</l>
            <l>Where I obſcur'd muſt be for want of grace;</l>
            <l>Sinke me, my Councell, to the next ſhall be,</l>
            <l>By flying ſomewhere, to gaine Libertie;</l>
            <l>For when young <hi>Charles</hi> (Gods Blood) ſhall hither come,</l>
            <l>Dam me, I feare they will be all undone,</l>
            <l>Gods Plague hangs o're them, and the Cities curſe,</l>
            <l>Attends them all; who at the firſt did Nurſe</l>
            <l>This Brat, Rebellion; but now they ſee,</l>
            <l>They were but bull'd, to fight for Libertie,</l>
            <l>For all the Liberty to them that's left,</l>
            <l>Is, that they are, of all their Wealth bereft:</l>
            <l>When that the Commons pleaſe to vote it ſo,</l>
            <l>Theſe ſilly Cowards dare not to ſay no;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pride</hi> doth attend them menacing their fall.</l>
            <l>If they withſtand, when he for ought ſhould call.</l>
            <l>God dam me (if they'l be advis'd by me)</l>
            <l>Ile tell them how to gaine their Libertie:</l>
            <l>Aud's blood (in ſome time) how they may obtaine,</l>
            <l>The Honour once they had, unto their fame.</l>
            <l>Submit to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> give King <hi>Charles</hi> his Due,</l>
            <l>Next under <hi>God,</hi> his Right muſt come from you.</l>
            <l>But if you doe withſtand, and bow to the State,</l>
            <l>God dam me (you will all repent too late</l>
            <l>For why Gods Zounds) his Fathers blood doth call,</l>
            <l>For ſpeedy Vengeance to light on you all,</l>
            <l>All I doe meane, who durſt to enterpriſe,</l>
            <l>Againſt their Soveraigne (the leaſt Armes to raiſe)</l>
            <l>The blood of Nobles, Gentry, and all thoſe,</l>
            <l>Who in mad fury you did once oppoſe,</l>
            <l>Zounds, cryes for Vengeance, and ſvre you muſt,</l>
            <l>If not repent in time, prove all accurſt;</l>
            <l>Gods blood (I've ſaid enough) be wiſe in time,</l>
