            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is hoped that if you will duly and well Conſider theſe things you will not only Renounce your Teachers Errors, but gladly embrace the Doctrine and Religion of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to which you are hereby ſincerely Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted.</hi>

               <hi>From the above-cited Quotations, it is plainly evident that the</hi> Quakers <hi>Belief in theſe Ten Articles is as followeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>COncerning their Infallibility:</hi> They affirm that they are Infallible, that God hath given to them his Attribute to know Men's Hearts, and that they are equal with God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Concerning the Holy Scriptures:</hi> They ſay that the Scriptures are Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and that no command in them is in itſelf obliging, that what they ſpeak is of greater Authority than the Holy Scriptures, that the Goſpels of St. <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> are Duſt, and the Serpent's Meat, <hi>that is the Devil's Meat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Concerning the Holy Trinity:</hi> They damn the Holy Trinity to the Pit of Hell, and call it Conjuration, affirming the Three Perſons of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt are Three Nothings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Concerning Chriſt and his Blood:</hi> They utterly deny that Jeſus Chriſt who ſuffer'd under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> was properly the Son of God, or that we are to be ſav'd by his Merits, but affirm that the Light which every Man brings with him into the World, is ſufficient for every Man's Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation without any thing elſe; and that the Blood of Chriſt is no more than the Blood of any Saint.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Concerning Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper:</hi> They affirm that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lord's Supper are no more Duties to Chriſtians than Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is, which they renounce <hi>(as they ſay)</hi> by the ſame Spirit, by which St. <hi>Paul</hi> renounced Circumciſion. They call Infant Baptiſm the Doctrin of Devils, and the Lord's Supper the Table of Devils.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Concerning the Reſurrection:</hi> They deny the Reſurrection of the Body after Death, calling that Article of our Faith as abſurd as the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation is.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Concerning Chriſt's coming to Judgment:</hi> They deny the Article of Chriſt's coming to Judgment at the end of the World, ſaying, that there will be no other coming of Chriſt, than what has been already, or that be within Men.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They deny any other Heaven or Hell than what is within Men, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all other Mahometiſm.</p>
            <p n="9">9.

Great Miſt. p. 77. <hi>viz: And for any being moved of the Lord, to take away your Hour-glaſs from you, by the eternal Power it is owned,</hi> Note by the ſame pretence, they may take away the Church Plate, or any thing elſe, for as <hi>E. Burrough</hi> their Prophet ſaith, <hi>Our</hi> HEIRSHIP <hi>is to poſſeſs the uttermoſt part of the Earth,</hi> in a Declaration of the Quakers ſigned by <hi>E. Burrough</hi> and 15 more, p. 9. which is the ſame Principle with <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leiden,</hi> and other <hi>German</hi> Enthuſiaſts, that all right to any worldly Subſtance is founded on Grace, and that none had a right to any thing but the Saints.</p>
            <p n="10">10. For theſe Reaſons they call all Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his Goſpel (always excepting themſelves) by moſt unchriſtian and uncharitable Names.</p>
            <p>The Quakers are not wronged in any one Citation, and it is left to the Judgment of all ſerious Chriſtians, whether theſe are not the Doctrines which are contain'd in them. All good Chriſtians are deſired to have this Sheet in their Houſes, and as they have opportunity to ſhew the poor deluded Quakers their Errors, which 'tis hoped many of them do not know, and will reonunce aſſoon as they do.</p>
            <p>☞ <hi>Note Reader,</hi> 1ſt. <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>have printed a most fallacious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this Sheet, to which they give this Title,</hi> The Chriſtianity of the People called Quakers aſſerted, <hi>&amp;c. containing ſundry Quotations out of my former Books, writ by me, when I was too much leavened with the Errors of Quakeriſm, (though I thank God I never had the worſt of their Errors, nor ever denied any of the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity as they have done, whereof this Sheet is a Suffitient proof) all which I have retracted in Print ſeveral Years ago. and therefore they are most unfair and unjust, either to charge me with them, or make what I then writ te be their defence.</hi> 2d. <hi>That they have not in all their Printed Sheet diſcovored one unfair Quotation, in that called a</hi> Serious Call, <hi>only blamed two or three Marginals wrongly paged, that are in this Sheet Corrected.</hi>
