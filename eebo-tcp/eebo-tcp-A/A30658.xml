            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Books have <hi>Antonii,</hi> perhaps by the usuall fault of the Transcribers, whereby they often confound <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Constantinus. Ierome Surita</hi> a very learned Spaniard, prefers this Work to <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Son of <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> by reason of the mention of certain places of BRITAIN: but Critiques contend, and the strife is still before the Judge. Now it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that such an Itinerary was composed for the Captains and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with the Proconsulls and Pretors marching into the Provinces, least they should mistake their way, and fall into ambushes, mistaking the right way. How necessary these Itineraries were <hi>Fl.

            <p>Now that which here chiefly we shall take into our cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, will be, first, To examine who this <hi>Aethicus</hi> was; and secondly, Whether <hi>Cuspinian,</hi> and <hi>Malleolus,</hi> and others, who take upon them to have seen an <hi>Itinerary,</hi> or Description of the World under <hi>Iulius Caesars</hi> name, do not mean this very peice of <hi>Aethicus,</hi> with <hi>Antoninus</hi>'s <hi>Itinerary,</hi> as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly joyned together.</p>

And this name <hi>Julius,</hi> which <hi>Cuspinian</hi> perhaps, and <hi>Malleolus</hi> found before their Books (for they mention not the name of <hi>Aethicus)</hi> as also their finding of the Senates Decree procured by <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> for the surveying of the Roman Empire, in the very Preface of this Work, made them (as it is very likely) inscribe it with the following <hi>Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary,</hi> which goes usually under <hi>Antoninus's,</hi> to <hi>Julius Caesars</hi> name. For that these two peices are joyntly intended by them, appears plainly by the words of one of them before cited: <hi>[Gentes, &amp; civitates singulae in Itinerario]</hi> We referring the word <hi>Gentes</hi> to <hi>Aethicus,</hi> in whom you have <hi>Oceani Orientalis gentes.

               <hi>Flodoardus</hi> the Presbyter seems to make both these but one mans work; For <hi>Aethicus</hi> is quoted by him for two severall Journeys, which are not to be found other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where then in <hi>Antoninus.</hi> In like manner is <hi>Ethicus</hi> cited by the learned Welchman <note n="*" place="margin">Powel in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>br.

               <hi>Caspar Barthius,</hi> the flourishing Philologer of this age, tells us plainly, he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that <hi>Aethicus</hi> was the Author of both Peices.</p>
            <p>Now from the foregoing Discourse, all that we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, comes to thus much; That, although the Title of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicus</hi> be exploded and utterly cashired from having any thing to do with these Writings, as <hi>Salmasius</hi> (contrary to what <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> imagines) will have it; yet for all that we cannot (with <hi>Felix Malleolus)</hi> absolutely say, that <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> was the Author of them, or <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> of the latter part, as most do; and that (not to urge other reasons) because the names of many Cities and Places are to be found in both of them, which had not any Being till long after their times. However, we being none of those who dare <hi>Litterarum monumentis consecrata,</hi> as <note n="k" place="margin">Val: Maxim. lib. 1. cap: 9.</note> he sayes, <hi>Perinde ac vana refugere.</hi> Though we have the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but of an <note n="l" place="margin">Incertus auctor quem Aethicum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.

               <hi>uncertain Author,</hi> we are bold from thence to affirm, that some such Description, or <hi>Itinerary</hi> was publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Caesars</hi> authority, and in following times by <hi>Antoninus</hi> also, collected and framed; out of which, after many alterations and additions, and interpolations by the injury of time, and bad hands, we have only continued to us these unperfect, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Peices, which in some Copies may perchance have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their names, by whose appointment such Works were first instituted and begun, though now in a manner wholly changed, and different from their first Originalls.

And to confirm it, <hi>Suetoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> here sayes, It is very observable out of his own <note n="*" place="margin">Caes: de bello Gal lib 1.</note> words, that when in his expedition against <hi>Ariavistus</hi> the <hi>German,</hi> not only his Followers, and Friends, Centurions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of Horse, but beaten Souldiers would out of Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize have abandoned the Service; yet pretending, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, <hi>angustias itineris,</hi> the troubles and casualties of the March, he roundly takes them up and answers them, That they dealt saucily to cloak their fears with a false conceit of the difficulty of the waies; that it was his duty to look to that, which they ought by no means to make question of; <hi>Haec sibi curae esse: de itinere Ipsos brevi tempore judicaturos;</hi> They should ere long see that he had well enough provided for that. Which he could not do better, then by sitting and preparing <hi>Itinerary</hi> Tables and Descriptions to that purpose.

by the Romans, containing all, they say, from Tine to Humber; were otherwise named EBORACA; which yet seemeth not to me. To have done; we finde in a very antient and credible Writer, <hi>Sextus Aurelius Victor,</hi> who hath succinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written the lives of the Emperors, that <hi>Eboracum,</hi> which is known by all, to have been a Colony, was a <hi>Municipium</hi> too, or Free Town, which two have no coincidencie, or suteable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. It is in <hi>Severus</hi> life, where he speaks of his death, which all agree was at <hi>York; Neque multo post Britannia Municipio, cui</hi> Eboraci <hi>nomen, annis regni duo deviginti morbo extinctus est.</hi> A <hi>Municipium</hi> was, as <note n="x" place="margin">Agel.

                     <hi>Agellius,</hi> one of the antients, teaches us, where the inhabitants lived, as so Rome, making use of their own Laws and Constitutions, capable onely of Honorarie Title in the State of Rome, and thence called, <hi>Municipes,</hi> otherwise bound to no duties by any Law of the people of Rome.

                     <hi>Nero.</hi> But that <hi>Eboracum</hi> was ever such a Colonie, or turned into a <hi>Municipium,</hi> it is not this place of <hi>Aurelius Victor;</hi> nor these precedent places alledged, can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to be perswaded. <hi>Camden</hi> truly our learned Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tells us; that this difference of names in the History of the Emperors, is not altogether so exactly observed, but that one and the same place may be found indifferently called both a <hi>Municipium.</hi> and a Colony; which if so, I judge it rather the Historians oscitancie, and supine negligence, then so in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nature of the thing. But to expedite and clear the whole businesse: We are to know, that there were two sorts of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; one civil, drawn out from among the gowned Citizens, as well as the miscellane sort of people. The other Military, taken out of Legions, and cohorts, when they were past service, and settled in towns, or elsewhere, for a reward of their blood spent for the Commonwealth. The former of these became many times <hi>Municipia</hi> or <hi>free Burroughs,</hi> but the later not so; it being thought derogatory, that such as had born arms,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57088:45"/>
should admit of an inferiour, and lesse glorious condition. Much lesse when a whole Legion had, by the Emperours bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence and large indulgence, sate down any where; as here at <hi>Eboracum.</hi> Yet they were called out upon any service, as exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of affairs required, and after returned to their quarters again. As this Legion, after their assisting to raise the <hi>Wall,</hi> (which not long before his death, <hi>Severus</hi> reared from Sea to Sea, to divide the Provinciated part of the Iland from the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:) which we may very well conclude from an old Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on digged up there by, LEG. VI. VIC. P. F. F. that is, <hi>Pia felix fecit.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Wall,</hi> there is a place of <hi>Aelius Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus,</hi> an old Writer, in his life: <hi>Post Murum, aut Vallum mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum in Britannia, quam ad proximam mansionem rediret, non so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum victor, sed etiam in aeternum pace fundata.</hi> He saies, that <hi>Severus,</hi> after his Wall drawn in manner aforesaid, (the place is no way questionable;) retired into the <hi>next mansion.</hi> That this <hi>proxima mansio</hi> was <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Carliel,</hi> appears, in that it was at that time, not only the chiefest Mansion, and so continued quite along to be of a durable fate; but was also indeed, as neer as any other to the Wall, even when in after ages they had placed frequent stations about it. Now, that the VI. Legion attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him hither to <hi>Carliel,</hi> having dispatcht the work they had been about, themselves have left a clear monument, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, a Stone there inscribed thus, with very fair and large letters:

                  <p>That they also departed thence with him to <hi>York,</hi> where not long after he died, is a probability, as good as certainty. Great was the trust which <hi>Severus</hi> reposed in them; great was the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he had of their valour and service in the affairs of the Iland: no lesse, perhaps, then <hi>Iulius Coesars</hi> of the X.

                  <p>This gallant <hi>Sixth Legion</hi> remained an Age or two, if not more, at <hi>York.</hi> This Inscription, as <hi>Camden</hi> hath transcribed it, witnessing its residence there, seems not to me to be of the earliest antiquity; that is, very suddenly after the Legions coming thither:

                     <hi>Forcatulus,</hi> a French Antiquary, and not indiligent, affirms that the <hi>Praetorium,</hi> or Tribunal at <hi>York,</hi> was very happy in that it heard <hi>Papinian,</hi> the Oracle of Right and Law. So <hi>Camden</hi> out of him: for his own book is not now at hand. What special Authority therefore <hi>Forcatulus</hi> had for this, I cannot sufficiently tell. But confidently I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that here he was, and one of those grave Friends of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus,</hi> whom <hi>Herodian</hi> told even now, he joined to his son <hi>Geta,</hi> for assistance in Civil matters. That <hi>Forcatulus</hi> was in the right herein, that also doth prove, that <hi>Severus</hi> on his death Bed left <hi>Papinian</hi> a kind of Guardian to both his Sons.

                  <p>The fame, and known wisdom of <hi>Papinian,</hi> wherever dead, procured so high <hi>Elogies</hi> to his Name, that nothing can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived above them. <note n="c" place="margin">Zosim. Hist lib. 1.</note>

                     <hi>Zosimus</hi> tells us, that when he was <hi>Captain of the Guard,</hi> (if at least we do well in rendring <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus Praetorio</hi> in those words) he was held in great suspition by <hi>Antoninus,</hi> for no other cause, but for that he, observing him to bear a deadly disaffection toward his Brother <hi>Geta,</hi> did what he could to hinder his designs, and preserve <hi>Geta.</hi> Therefore that <hi>Antoninus</hi> to remove this block out of his way, by the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers plotted <hi>Papinians</hi> death; and so having gained opportunity slew also his Brother. <hi>Spartian</hi> writes he was beheaded with an Ax in <hi>Antoninus</hi> sight, because he would not excuse <hi>Geta's</hi> death: by which relation, his murther should seem to precede <hi>Papinians;</hi> contrary to what <hi>Zosimus</hi> delivers. <note n="f" place="margin">Dio lib. 77.</note> 
                     <hi>Dio</hi> tells us that <hi>Antoninus</hi> was much offended with the Soldier who put <hi>Papinian</hi> to death with the Ax, being ordred to do it with the Sword. In old time Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesactors were beheaded with the Ax; afterwards with the Sword. This punishment seemed the lighter, and more honorable.

                     </gap>, without Author or Abettor of sufficient age, that it will be cast forth and rejected.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are, who referring the History of <hi>Lucius</hi> almost to <hi>Severus</hi> time, do leave him no place in <hi>Britain,</hi> except the more Northern parts beyond <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> his Wall, which he made of Turfe to sever, and shut out the barbarous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reduced Britains from the Province: induced perhaps thereto, by the authority of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who indeed wrote under <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and in whom you have these words: <note n="m" place="margin">Tertul. lib. ad versus Iudae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os cap. 7.</note>

                  <p>We must then seek for the first Bishop of <hi>York</hi> but not 'till <hi>Constantines</hi> daies; and we shall find him at <hi>Arles</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel there held about the year CCCXIV. whither as himself writes in his Epistle to <note n="*" place="margin">Apud.

and described by our Monks, We see nothing therein but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, and great uncertainty; We rather adhere to what our learned Antiquary supplies us with, where he informs us with more polite conceit, and judicious authority, that they were a work of the <hi>Romans,</hi> for the better and more convenient mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of their Souldiers, from Station to Station, and therefore called by them, <hi>Militares viae;</hi> as also <hi>Consulares, Praetoriae, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae, &amp;c,</hi> This we may easily beleeve if we do but think how untaught, how uncivilized, how little seen and furnished they were in regard of publick conveniencies any way. The Britains themselves make it their complaint, by the mouth of their gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Prince <hi>Galgacus,</hi> in his brave <note n="a" place="margin">Apud.

And now it being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted (for indeed so it must) that the High-waies of <hi>Britain</hi> were of the <hi>Romans</hi> raising, it cannot seem likely that in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince so abounding with Stations, or Camps, Fortresses, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be seen in this <hi>Itinerary</hi> and elsewhere, should have so few as four waies of any note in it; the Stations being very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them to be marched into by courses, no way holding with these principal Waies; whereof they speak so confusedly.</p>
               <p>I may adde that we have sufficient testimonies by our eyes from the ruins of many such, which yet visibly remain and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the Traveller; besides such as we read of. As of <note n="*" place="margin">Camden. in Siluribus.</note>

But neither number will neer agree with the particulars, if you sum them up together; for they come to 510. <hi>Surita</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who used good store of Manuscripts, of which yet we are wholly destitute, brings us here among his <hi>Var. Lectiones</hi> (for so <hi>Thua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> had rather call them, then <hi>Commentarii,</hi> as himself doth:) no help, or direction by them. That no fault should happen among so many worthy Transcribers, was a thing not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. But our good <hi>Antoninus</hi> hath been so unlucky (which is the complaint of all that have had to do with him:) as to be corrupted in things least curable by the very <hi>Chirons</hi> of Criticism, yet most proclive to error in such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and heedless hands, <hi>Numbers</hi> I mean, and proper <hi>Names,</hi> of which yet he only consists.</p>
                  <p>Have the whole Journey therefore, as it is in the vulgar E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. As we go along, we will take notice of what may be rectified, in hope to reconcile the particular numbers, with the summary, if possibly it may be.</p>

                  <p>RUTUNIUM. M, P.

I have no more then to say of it, but that the divers reading of the old name <hi>[Rutimio]</hi> which is found in the <note n="s" place="margin">Quo usus <hi>Hier. Surita,</hi> doctiss.

                  <p>So that now whereas consuming <hi>Time</hi> hath wrought all its other usual despites upon it, according to that of the Poet:
<q>

                        <l>And doth their natures, names, and faces change.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet doth its Name still survive, a happiness which but with a few other Stations, this can yet boast of: But let it have been as great as it will, there onely remains now the shadow of a Name. And there will be a time, when that too shall expire: howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; if that be any comfort, it will be the last thing left.</p>

                     <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> her principal Historian, and witnesse. Tragicall effects the most naturall matter of renown. Prosperous successes vanish in the warmth of their own fruition. His memorie therefore deserves a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial honour there. And if ever the most Civil, pompous, and thankfull uses of the magnificent Acts of Statuarie, Founding, Mowlding, Musive, and Graving, prevail to come up here, as among the Greeks and Romans, both he and others shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly enjoy it. In the words last cited the excellent Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian telleth how the Roman General, or Pro Pretor, out of an apprehension of the scarcity of his Souldiers, not daring to stand <hi>Boadicia's</hi> Forces, quite abandoned and deserted <hi>London</hi> to the cruelty and rape of the enemies, neither would be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded otherwise by any tears or intreaties of the Citizens. And out of his positive words, we may know that <hi>London</hi> was not a Colony, <hi>Londinium cognomento quidem Coloniae non insigne:</hi> wherefore <note n="h" place="margin">Onuphr.

                     <hi>Onuphrius</hi> can be no way excused, who expresly against <hi>Tacitus</hi> words, saith, there was a Colony there. But there are two several translations, each of them in Print, who out of that very place of <hi>Tacitus</hi> would make <hi>London</hi> seem a Colony. If there be any hope, that he could have such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; it must shine from out of other words in his <hi>Agricola,</hi> where summing the hurts, and mischiefs of <hi>Boadicia's</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, he speaks plurally, as if Colonies were destroyed, and not one Colony alone. That reading of the place being lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally urged, <hi>London</hi> then may best put in for that title, with <hi>Camalodunum.</hi> But some of the most learned neither read the Latin Word as in the number of multitude, and there is also another commodious answer; figure of speech; which not rarely admits a plural for a singular, as a gracefull excesse. <hi>London</hi> was never said to be a Colony. The honour so much the more, that having no such support, it should grow so super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively eminent. These are some few among the infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations of Translators. Description of Places is an express office of History, as the clearing of doubts, a necessary right of description.</p>

Besides what hath been said hitherto concerning this famous City, matters gallant and magnificent enough, there remain many other great and glorious things concerning it, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly challenge, as their due, room also in this place; but that I have formerly, wherewith too I have acquainted the Reader in more then one place, confined my self to the limet and bound of a certain set time, while the Romans exercised their power and bore sway here in the Island. I have all along for that space been very scrupulous and circumspect what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities I made use of: Hence it is, that where I found not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof for what I met with, were it never so specious for the honour and interest of <hi>Britain,</hi> I rejected it as unvalid.

And he hath to back him that prudent and learned Lawyer, who lived not long after him, and who also wrote the description of his own Country <hi>Kent, Will.

the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was either to bury (the bodies of the richer sort being first imbalmed:) or to burn: though indeed the later, through the increase of <hi>Christians,</hi> began soon after <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus</hi> his time to grow much out of use every where.

I would not note it, (I must confess) as a thing that I thought worth noting (for I think there can be nothing more common:) but that I am glad to take this occasion to impart unto the Reader a memorable curiosity in matter of antiquity, which by the learned Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries beyond the Seas, I am sure, would be much esteemed.

All that I can say of it, is, that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants shew a place, to which they say that in former times the water came, as indeed by many circumstances it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable: and that <hi>Milton</hi> (a Town before the conquest of great fame, and of very great antiquity) is not above two miles from it. About a quarter of a mile before you come to <hi>Newington,</hi> not much above a stones cast from the high-way, on the right hand as you come from <hi>Sittingburn,</hi> there is a field, out of which in a very little compass of ground, have been taken out by digging within these few years, <hi>Roman</hi> Pots and Urns, almost of all sizes and fashions, and in number very many: some thousands, I have been told upon the place; but many hundreds I am sure I may say, and speak within compass. And though so many have already been found, and carried away, yet doth the field afford them still (as I am told) now and then, according as you prove either skilful or lucky in the digging. The figures of some of them I have here caused to be represented to the Reader.</p>

The words of the Inscription of that first (as neer as they could be imitated) are these:

As for the sense and meaning of the words, though not so obvious perchance as might be wished, yet must I (because few words will not serve) suspend my opinion till some fitter opportunity. That in the middle, with the Inscription COCCILLIM <note n="*" place="margin">Vide A D ANSAM in sequentibus Itin. 4.</note> was by the means of a worthy friend, M. <hi>Dr. Winston,</hi> (that great ornament of his profession)
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57088:105"/>
procured unto me from the Right Honourable (for his worth, and love to learning as well as by his place,) <hi>Richard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> Lord High Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. whom, with some other rare Antiquities it was sent unto, some years ago. I was desirous to compare these that I had (for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions sake especially) with some others of the same kind. But I find this difference, That whereas mine were much peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and worn by age, such was the brightness and smoothness of this middle (of the cover of it I mean, which is of a read coloured earth) as that it rather resembled pure Coral, then ordinary red earth: and as for the Letters of the Inscription, that they were not as mine rudely ingraven in with the hand, but in the same mould, and at the same time when the cover it self was formed, very artificially printed, or imbossed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? as by these figures, that are represented you may in part perceive. Since that, when I passed last by <hi>Newington</hi> coming from <hi>London,</hi> among many other fragments of Antiquity in M. <hi>Dearings</hi> Garden I found the pieces of just such another Cover (but that the color of it is nothing so fresh) with this Inscription in the middle likewise, PRISCIAN. Now as the multitude of these <hi>Newington</hi> Urns (for I do not remember that ever so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in so narrow a Compass of ground were found: is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; so is the manner of their laying in the ground. They that have been present often at their digging up, have observed, that where one great Urn is found, divers less vessels are; some within the great, some about it: all covered either with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cover of the same Earth and making as the pot it self is; or more coursly, but very closely stopped up with other Earth. Of all those small vessels of what fashion soever that are found either in or about these Urns, I know no other use (to satisfy in some part their curiosity, that wonder at them when they see them) that was ordinary among the Romans, but either to contain some fragrant odoriferous liquor, and durable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; or that <hi>libatio</hi> of wine and milk, that they used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their dead; or lastly (not to speak here of those burning Lamps that have been found in some antient Urns and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which so many have largely written and disputed of) to receive and preserve the tears that were shed by the friends of the deceased for grief of their death, as for the difference of the greater and lesser Urns, <hi>Fabricius</hi> in his <hi>Roma,</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi> in his Topographieal description of the same, are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that when Urns of different bigness are found in the same place; the greater were for the greater and richer, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and <hi>Patroni;</hi> and the lesser, for the poorer and inferiour, as the Servants and Clients.

same place, as every mans particular conceit or humor served him. And therefore it were hard to determine any thing as certainly and generally true. But as for these <hi>Newington</hi> Urns this seems to have been the custome there used. One great Urn was appointed to contain the bones and ashes of all one, either houshold or kindred. As often therefore as any of them dyed, so often had they recourse unto the common Urn, which so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten was uncovered. To prevent this, I find that the fashion hath been in some places, to let in the ashes through some holes made and fitted for that purpose See <hi>Gruter fol.</hi> 814. Now besides the great and common Urn, it is likely that every particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that dyed, had some less Urn or Vessel, particularly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to his own memory, whereby both the number of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, and the parties themselves might the better be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. There might be also another use of these lesser pots, in my judgement very necessary, and that is, that by them the common great Urns, might the better be known and discerned one from another, which being so neer, in so small a compass of ground, and not much unlike one another, might otherwise easily be mistaken. And this is the more likely, because of those many hundreds that have been taken up of the lesser sort, scarce have there been found any, of one and the same making, I hear not of any thing that hath hitherto been found, in these <hi>Newing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Urns besides bones, and ashes: and sometimes clear water. And so do I read of Urns or Earthen Vessels <hi>plenis limpidissima aqua,</hi> that have been found elsewhere, as that which is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Gruterus, fol.</hi> 927. I doubt not but many would be glad as well as I) to know certainly what this place hath formerly been. But alass, how should we (who are of yesterday and know nothing) without the help of ancient Records, recall the memory of things forgotten so many hundred years ago? Thus much we may certainly conclude: First, from the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of these Urns, that it was once a common burying place for the Romans. Secondly, from the History of the Romans in this land, that no Urn is there found, but is 1200. or 1300. Years old, at the least: so many ages of men have these poor Earthen Vessels (of so much better clay for durance then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodies are) outlasted both the Makers of them, and the persons to whose memory they were consecrated. Lastly, from the place, which is upon an ascent (and for a good way beyond hilly,) not far from the Sea, and neer the High-way: we may affirm in all probability, that it was once the Seat of a Roman Station. If any man can teach me more of it, I shall heartily thank him. Since this was written, I made another journey to the place, and spent some time there in digging, but with no success. However, that I might not return home empty, the same Mr. <hi>Dearing</hi> gave me a piece of Urn, which hath this Inscription, FUL. LINUS.</p>

But such it was sometime, as some of our own Writers still extant can make it good; and I will cite one of the antientest of them, <hi>Ethelward; In Limneo poriu constituunt puppes, Apoldre</hi> (so I read, for the Print is corrupted) <hi>loco con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicto Orientali Cantiae parte, destruuntque ibi prisco opere caestrum propter quod rustica manus exigua quippe intrinsecus erat, illicque hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berna castra confirmant.</hi> And <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntington</hi> shall follow him, who lands the <hi>Danes</hi> (whom <hi>Ethelward</hi> means) <hi>ad Portum Limenecum</hi> CCL. <hi>navibus, qui porius est in Orientali parte Cent juxta magnum nemius Andredslaige.</hi> In which two several narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you need not take notice of any difference, more then the transposition of Letters in the name.

               <p>Two excellently learnedly men, and most diligent, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the matters of their own Countrey, <hi>Talbot</hi> and <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> do seek for this our <hi>Caesaromagus,</hi> according as the <hi>ratio Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raria</hi> doth require it, yet in several places: of whom the <note n="m" place="margin">Talbot. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in Itiner. Antonin. MS.</note> first, believes it was that Town, which now commonly is called <hi>Chensford,</hi> or <hi>Chernsford.</hi> The distance, saith he, (for I do not think it much to translate his words hither, because his <hi>Lucubra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> upon <hi>Antoninus</hi> are hitherto unpublished) very fitly agree; for it is from <hi>London</hi> by modern computation XXV. miles, which indeed will make XXVIII. Italick miles (as you have in this Itinerary) neither doth the name very much ablude. And in the IX. journey <hi>Caesaromagus</hi> is placed in the way which leads from <hi>Colchester</hi> to <hi>Londinium.</hi> But you will say, who at this day being to take his journey from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Carlisle,</hi> doth chuse his course by <hi>Chensford?</hi> I answer, that perhaps they did so some times formerly. For also the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as we have heard, were wont to come up to the Parliament here this way, and that they, or some one of them, built a Covent of the order of <hi>Dominicans,</hi> or preaching <hi>Friers;</hi> as they did also a house of Nunnes at <hi>Elstow</hi> or <hi>Elinstow</hi> by <hi>Bedford.</hi> Adde more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that the Author of this Itinerary, who ever he was, seems not to have followed the shortest cuts, and straitest waies, but thereafter as he attended the <hi>Proconsul</hi> or <hi>Legate,</hi> who for his pleasure, or business sake; as, either to hold Courts of justice, or to list more forces, or sometimes to confirm his Souldiers, turned aside into greater Towns not quite out of his way; might seem to have set down those places, through which the <hi>Legate,</hi> or <hi>Propraetor</hi> passed. And this very journey, which we have now in hand, seems to be of such an one: wherein he rode through <hi>Essex, Suffolk, Cambridge-shire</hi> and <hi>Huntington-shire,</hi> to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and thence to <hi>York,</hi> and so to <hi>Carlisle:</hi> other wise what meant it, as it is here, two hundred and fifty miles, more or less? when as in the next journey to this, from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> there are but an hundred, and fifty.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we must confess, by what hath been said, that here the Pro-consul, or what Magistrate soever, took his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney through the Eastern, and more noted Cities of the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Countries; and so perhaps they used to set forth: but in the return, they visited the more <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> or <hi>Midland</hi>

                  </note> and Western places: or on the contrary these in their setting forth, the others in their return. And hence perhaps it is, that in the second journey between <hi>York</hi> and <hi>London</hi> there is so great a distance: a brief and <hi>compendium</hi> whereof he sets down after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; namely in the third journey after this. This wheeling
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57088:113"/>
and fetching compass about, must needs be on this side <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lincoln,</hi> by reason of the breadth of the Island there, that the people might more conveniently appear before the Magistrates: beyond <hi>York</hi> there was no necessity of it, by reason of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowness of the Island in those parts, that they might meet from both the Seas to some one Town, as <hi>Cataractonium,</hi> or the like, without any great grievance of the people. <hi>Casaromagus</hi> seems to have signified as much as <hi>Caesaris Burgus;</hi> as <hi>Neomagus</hi> in <hi>Ptolemy, Novns Burgus; Rotomagus</hi> as much as <hi>Rotonis burgus,</hi> &amp;c.

LINDO. M. P. XXVI.] <hi>Robert Talbot</hi> confesseth himself here at a great loss, about the antient site of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Lindum,</hi> in <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who sets it down for a City of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritavi,</hi> and one of them, which by him are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And no lesse appears by <hi>Antoninus,</hi> in whom we have the VI. journey from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Lindon,</hi> which confirms what <hi>Ptolemy</hi> saies: there is also in him another City, of the very same name, in the more Northern part of the Island: but of that in its own place, when we shall come to it. The great doubt of <hi>Talbot</hi> was whether of the two he might resolve on; for the old situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Landum: Nottingham;</hi> or <hi>Lincoln,</hi> or <hi>Lindecoln,</hi> as it was most antiently called. But he rather pitched on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, thinking that it was <hi>Nottingham:</hi> and we will acquaint you with his particular reasons therefore.</p>
               <p>First, saies he, <hi>Nottingham</hi> was as antient as any place of note hereabout; and may be thought equal with the time of the <note place="margin">Robert Talbot Annot. in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonin. anecdotis.</note> Saxons entrance. As for the old Town, whatsoever the name thereof was in old time, the inhabitants shew it, with a well fortified Castle also, a most certain argument of Antiquity. What ever it was none rather, or more probably, comes into my thoughts then <hi>Lindum.</hi> The River which through <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi> runs into the <hi>Trent</hi> is at this day called <hi>Lin,</hi> or rather <hi>Lind;</hi> which rising out of <hi>Lindwood,</hi> a little above the Village <hi>Linsey,</hi> by the Priory of <hi>Newsted,</hi> in a small Tract of ground, suddenly encreased with the sources of many springs, becomes an handsome River: then running down by <hi>Lenton,</hi> or <hi>Lynton</hi> Town, <hi>Nottingham,</hi> it is swallowed into the <hi>Trent,</hi> before it hath well finished twelve miles from the Spring. But by <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> I think, saies he, that <hi>Lindum</hi> in this place is meant: for <hi>Nottingham</hi> is very neer thereunto, so that it may seem some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to have been part therof: as which at this day is scarce one mile distant: what if we should say, that the old Town was there; for it is not a thing unseldome seen, that famous Towns have degenerated into little villages. And bringing several ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, for the Antiquity of <hi>Lenton,</hi> as also of <hi>Nottingham:</hi> as that from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> no body will chuse his road through <hi>Lincoln,</hi> but ordinarily through <hi>Nottingham.</hi> Then that the distance from <hi>Nottingham</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> according to the Itinerary, suits at this day exactly, so also from <hi>Danum,</hi> or <hi>Dancaster,</hi> not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss: nothing more conveniently: but from <hi>Lincoln</hi> to <hi>York</hi> and <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>oaster,</hi> it doth not hit out so right. Again, by longitude in <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> it is plain, that <hi>Lindum</hi> is not so much stretched out to the East, as <hi>Eboracum.</hi> But <hi>Lincoln</hi> is just so much: but not so <hi>Nottingham:</hi> now though all this may be well answered: yet by these arguments, saies he <hi>si qui <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

But <hi>Camden</hi> is none of those, who will come to be of the same opinion with him: he then placeth <hi>Lindum,</hi> or <hi>Lincoln,</hi> at the Foss way, where it, and the River <hi>Wytham</hi> meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the Britains called this City <hi>Lynd-coit,</hi> from the woody situation thereof, for which you have it misnamed in <hi>Ninnius, Luit-coit.</hi> The Many believed it called <hi>Lindum</hi> from the River <hi>Wytham,</hi> which by an antienter name they say was <hi>Lindis:</hi> but they have no authority for it of any standing. With the <hi>Saxons</hi> it was <note n="*" place="margin">Vide omnino Galfrid. Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth. Hist. Brit. lib. 9. cap. 3.</note>

               <p>In our great Antiquaries judgement, this place possessed the banks of <hi>Trent</hi> in <hi>Nottinghamshire,</hi> where at this day <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleborough</hi> (a little Town, but very antient) stands, and that upon second cares. At this day it is famous for nothing more, then for the frequent pass of the River there. That the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans held it, there are many things which cause a belief. For the Military Way went here, and the Tract of the Walls yet appears to be seen, which yet the Inhabitants, such is their

Then there is so great plenty of Roman Coynes in the neighbouring Feilds, that they are often rooted up by the very Swine: whence it is that they are commonly called Swine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pennies. The distance moreover from <hi>Lindum</hi> to <hi>Agelocum,</hi> or <hi>Segelocum,</hi> makes us not at all to doubt; although the same learned man write, in the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> of his Work, or former edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it was <hi>Idleton,</hi> a Countrey Village, which is no where else to be found but by the River <hi>Idle;</hi> whence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is the Name: And it produced his Conjecture, whereby he would in <hi>Antoninus</hi> have <hi>Adelocum,</hi> restored for <hi>Agelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Agelocum, Aulerton</hi> in <hi>Sherwood,</hi> is the divination of <hi>Robert Talbot. William Fulk,</hi> for some small <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>DANO. M. P. XXI.] This was that Station, which in after ages was called <hi>Dancaster,</hi> and the Name shewes as much. It is <hi>Talbots</hi> conceit, that the Water which runs here under a stately Bridge, was <hi>Ptolemies</hi>

Chrispiana,</hi> saith <hi>Pancirolus,</hi> is a Town of <hi>Pannonia</hi> in this Itinerary; whence these <hi>Crispiani</hi> may seem to be taken: except, as he thinkes, we had better read for them <hi>Chrestini,</hi> out of <hi>Velferus</hi> his old Papers, who are a People of the Countrey of <hi>Dorilania</hi> in <hi>Belgica</hi> along the <hi>Rhine,</hi> whence these might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be brought hither.

                  <hi>George Buchanan</hi> doth notably <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirare,</hi> as became a man of such imperiousness, and insolency.</p>
               <p>It is not very certain how the <hi>Brigantes</hi> became first subject to the Romans; but certain it is, they were often conquered by them. It is worth the while to consult <hi>Tacitus,</hi> from whom we have a full relation of their Affaires. They were doubtless in the defection of <hi>Boadicia,</hi> and a considerable part among the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in that their revolt. <hi>Galgacus</hi> the <hi>Caledonian</hi> in his speech to his men to animate them against the Romans, shews as much: <note n="u" place="margin">Tacit. In vita Agricola.</note> 
                  <hi>Brigantes,</hi> saith he, <hi>Femina duce exurere Colonias, expugnare castra, &amp; nisi felicitas in secordiam vertisset, exuere jugum potuere.</hi> Now whereas for the <hi>Brigantes</hi> in this place, <hi>Camden</hi> doth sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> I could wish that he had not done it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the authority of all books: <hi>Galgacus</hi> his meaning is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite his <hi>Caledonians</hi> to Valour, and the study of liberty, by the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57088:119"/>
example of other Britains, all whom he calls <hi>Brigantes,</hi> who were better known to his men, being a great deal the neerest unto them, and the most populous people of the whole Island. But they were not wholly subdued till <hi>Vespasians</hi> time, as we find by the same Author; when <hi>Petilius Cerealis</hi> fought against them <hi>multa praelia, &amp; aliquando non incruentia; magnamque Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantum partem aut victoria amplexus aut bello.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Hadrinans</hi> daies, therefore a main defection of all the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains hapned out. Now if there be any place for conjecture, the <note place="margin">(x) Aelius Spartian. in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driano,</note> 
                  <hi>Brigantes</hi> seem to have revolted, when <hi>Julius Severus</hi> was called out of <hi>Britain,</hi> where he was President to go against the Jewes, who then also rebelled. <hi>Dio,</hi> or rather <hi>Xiphilin</hi> out of him, is our Author for it: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. But finally <hi>Hadrian</hi> himself in person came hither, who <hi>conversis, regio more militibus Britanniam petiit: in qua multa correxit, murumque per octoginta millia passuum primus duxit, qui Barbaros Romanosque divideret. Et compositis in Britannia rebus, in Galliam transgressus est,</hi> as <hi>Spartianus</hi> writes. And in our daies too there are extant, taken up amongst the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> very many Antiquities which speak <hi>Hadrians</hi> being here, and his doing many things amongst them. Yet though subdued by him, they took Heart again, and as the Poets say, <hi>victis redit in praecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia virtus:</hi> for under <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> they over-ran <hi>Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>There are many other things of Antiquity, which I might set down concerning the <hi>Brigantes;</hi> as of their Nymph <hi>Verbeia,</hi> and their Topick God <hi>Dui:</hi> but as I said, I will refer the Reader to my other Work which I have inscribed BRITANNIAE RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANORUM, where I have at large treated of them.</p>
               <p>The other Stations of this Journey are formerly sufficiently spoken of in their places: onely here let me tell you, that <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavio</hi> would better be <hi>Brovo,</hi> as being abbreviated for <hi>Brovonacis,</hi> which you have in the second Journey.</p>

And within these ten years, neer unto the Town, somewhat deep in the ground, was found a piece of Work of stone arched over; the stones very small, about an inch long, and half an inch broad and thick, finely joined together with a thin morter. It was in length about five or six yards, in breadth about four, the roof covered with a square kind of quarry with small Earthen Pipes therein. This I guess to be a Stouphe or hot-house to bath in, for as <hi>Vitrivius</hi> writeth, the <hi>Romans</hi> growing to the excesse of riotousnesse and excesse, through the abundance of their wealth, used these kinde of Bathes in a wantonness to purge and clarifie themselves.

               <p>In this City, as our own Historians relate, was that Monk <hi>Constans</hi> in the Roman time, whom his Father <hi>Constantinus,</hi> who had put on the Purple against <hi>Honorius,</hi> out of a meer conceit and confidence of his own name, had designed first to be <hi>Caesar,</hi> and afterward <hi>Augustus:</hi> For, for a good while before this, as <hi>Zosimus</hi> hath it, speaking of that very time the Monks had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Colledges, as well in Cities as Country Towns, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before lurking up and down, and haunted Mountains, Woods, and solitary places forlorn, whence also they had their name. Now those ancient remainders of Walls which are yet to be seen of such a thickness, and lastingness, at the Western-door of the Cathedrall, seem to have been the ruines of that Colledge.

It may be therefore that the Legion it self being cut off, yet the name thereof might remain continued from a new choice, and muster. The same Legion also is frequently spoken of by <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his <note n="a" place="margin">Tacit.

               </p>
               <p>But let us come to what we would, and see what antient Authors have concerning the deduction of this Colony, and their doings, a little more accurately observed, with the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of affairs. <hi>Tacitus</hi> therefore in his <hi>Agricola</hi> thus: That <hi>Caius</hi> had a meaning to invade Britanny, it is certainly known. <hi>Claudius</hi> did first with effect prosecute the matter, transporting Legions and Aides, and assuming <hi>Vespasian</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the action, which was the beginning of the Greatnesse whereunto he after attained: some Countreys were subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, some Kings were taken, and <hi>Vespasian</hi> made known to the world.</p>
               <p>The first Lievtenant General was <hi>Aulus Plautius,</hi> then <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius Scapula,</hi> both excellent Warriours: and so by little and little was the neerest part of the Island reduced to the form of a Province? and besides a Colony of old Souldiers established there. <hi>Publius Ostorius</hi> in subduing the <hi>Silures,</hi> made use of their help. The nation of the <hi>Silures,</hi> saith <note n="b" place="margin">Annal. lib. 12. &amp; 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Tacitus, Non atrocita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, non clementia mutabatur; quin bellum exerceret, castrisque legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnum premenda foret.

                  <hi>Seneca</hi> also mentions this Temple: <hi>Parum est quod Templum in Britannia ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, quod hunc barbari colunt &amp; ut deum orant.</hi> For <hi>Ara</hi> in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> it pleased <hi>Justus Lipsius</hi> to write <hi>Arra,</hi> as if he called that Temple a pledge or assurance of lasting servitude: but <hi>Valens Acidalius</hi> rather pleased to have it <hi>Arx.

unfortified, which was not circumspectly forseen by our Captains, whilest they had a greater care of pleasure, then good government.

                  <note n="f" place="margin">Tacit. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. lib.

He sent not above two hundred men, and those hadly armed, and the number not great which was there before, trusted to the franchise of the Temple. And those hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57088:132"/>
which were confederates of the secret conspiracy, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled their designments: for they neither made trench nor ditch, nor sending away the old men and women, and keeping the young men only, being as secure as it had been in a full peace, they were surprized with a multitude of barbarous people, and all overthrown, and wasted with violence, or consumed with fire: the Temple only excepted, into which the Souldiers had fled, which also within two daies was besieged and taken. And the Britain being thus Conquerour, and meeting with <hi>Paetus Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>realis</hi> Lievtenant of the ninth Legion, which came to succour them, put to flight the Legion, and slew all the footmen: <hi>Cerealis</hi> with the horsemen escaped to the Camp, and defended himself in the fortresses. So the Romans found that to be of certain truth, which <hi>Strabo</hi> by a sagacious conjecture foresaw of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and as a south-telling Prophet also foretold: <note n="g" place="margin">Strabo Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph. lib.

               <p>But after so grievous an overthrow, <hi>Camalodunum</hi> yet after a few years began to flourish again; which we may conjecture out of <hi>Pliny:</hi> for he makes mention thereof as of a Town very famous in his daies: <hi>In Mona,</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Plin. Natur. Hist. lib. 2. cap. 715.</note> saith he, <hi>qua distat à Camalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duno Britanniae oppido circiter ducentis millibus;</hi> For <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> in the Thirteenth Chapter of the same Book, makes
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57088:132"/>
mention of the third Consulship of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> which happened in the tenth yeare after the overthrow of <hi>Camalodunum:</hi> so that here it is nothing necessary to urge that the same <hi>Pliny</hi> dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Naturall History to <hi>Vespasian,</hi> when as such Inscriptions for the most part, and Preambles which no body is ignorant of, were wont to be made, when all was done. Again, if the Colony yet standing, <hi>Pliny</hi> wrote this, he seems not likely to have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the name Colony, as a thing that deserved not to be left out.</p>
               <p>From this time to <hi>Constantines</hi> age, the memories of ancient things being lost, there is wholly silence concerning it; but that <hi>Antoninus</hi> here in this place makes mention of it, as also the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Itinerary Table of <hi>Peutinger,</hi> which <hi>Scaliger</hi> thought was compiled thence, as is observed before: whence no weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture may be brought that it is ancienter then the <hi>Notitia Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciarum,</hi> which they will have to be written under <hi>Theodosius</hi> the younger: because therein those strengths were recorded by the Sea-side, which were appointed for the repelling of the pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Incursions of the Saxons: And they were <hi>sub dispositione viri Spectabilis Commitis littoris Saxonici per Britanniam.</hi> Yet for all that therein is no mention made of it, the site being known well enough out of <hi>Dio,</hi> the matter it self I am sure seemed to require it, if it had been still standing: It is doubtfull therefore whether or no, some grievous calamity, and very neer to totall ruine might not in this mean while have so afflicted and prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, that if it made it not wholly equall to the ground, yet it might seem to have strucken off its head and Gallantry. But certainly <hi>Camulodunum</hi> appears under the Empire of <hi>Constantine M.</hi> to be mentioned with high praise and worth; the name of <hi>Colony</hi> being also added: which thing I see pleases an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary man, and one born for the promotion of better Letters.

               <p>CANONIO. M. P.

It is a Town at this day spatious enough at the confluents of the <hi>Chelmer,</hi> and as some call it of the <hi>Can,</hi> which if they say right, this <hi>Can</hi> gave name to the old place. The same <hi>Camden</hi> in the <hi>Proecdosis</hi> of his Work, makes it to be <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonden;</hi> quite on the other side of the Countrey, only the name somewhat alluding. <hi>Talbot</hi> before him, had set down to it <hi>Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> or else <hi>Esterford,</hi> of which we have <hi>Fulks</hi> testimony: for in his own book no such thing appears: but himself sets down <hi>Coune</hi> to it: truly in the antient Military <note n="n" place="margin">Marco Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sero Editore; dein aliis.</note> Table, about the place of its site <hi>Caunonium</hi> stands to be seen instead thereof.</p>

Having said so much concerning the Bath, I should highly offend against gratitude if I should here omit his name whose house in <hi>London</hi> is as another Akemanchester, and so would prove if <hi>Merlins</hi> prophesie should be fulfilled, which I neither beleive nor fear. The gentle cure of the Palsie effected upon me this year makes me never think of him, but withall I have a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the excellent Physitian <hi>Apis</hi> who cures <hi>Aeneas</hi> in <hi>Virgils</hi> twelfth Book, these are the excellent Verse wherein he describes him.
