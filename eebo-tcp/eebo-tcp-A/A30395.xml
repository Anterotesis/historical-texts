            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N obedience to your Commands, I send you herewith a Copy both of the Pope's last Brief to the Clergy, and of the Protestation made by them. But I know these will not fully answer your expectation, nor satisfie your Curiosity, unless accompanied with a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of the state of that affair, such as a stranger who is not yet so happy, as to be let in to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93095:3"/>
much of the Conversation of this place, could pick up in so short a time. It is true, the <hi>French</hi> are apt to talk, and upon this occasion, it is no hard thing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them into much discourse, especially when their fears do not check the freedom of Speech that is so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to the Nation: for being now safe under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Kings Authority, and secured under the covert of Edicts and an Assembly of the Clergy, they are ready enough to speak out what they formerly disguised, or trusted only to a few confiding persons.</p>
               <p>As for the Generality of the Inferiour people here, and the Women, they appear to be more addicted to the See of <hi>Rome</hi> than could have been imagined. The Popes Infallibility passes among them for an Article of Faith; so they are much scandalized at the reports which are secretly set about by the Monks and Fryars, as if the King were like to be abused by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and engaged in a Schism from the Chair of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and it is said, that that Prelate hopes by these means, to be made Patriarch of <hi>France,</hi> and so to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very little Inferiour to the Pope himself; and in time, if the design of the Universal Monarchy goes on, which is the common discourse of this Court, then as the Patriarch of the <hi>French</hi> Empire, he may pretend at least, to be made in all things equal to the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as the Bishops of <hi>Constantinople</hi> were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when that City was made the Seat of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. It is true, the Precedence was then granted to the Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> because it was the chief City, and the Empire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> carrying its name from <hi>Rome,</hi> no wonder if the Bishop of the Capital City had the Right-hand still reserved to him. But if <hi>Paris</hi> becomes the Metropolis of this Fifth Monarchy, then I do not see, but it may so fall out, that the Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> may even dispute Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93095:3"/>
with his Holiness at <hi>Rome;</hi> that City having now retained little more of its ancient Greatness, than the Name: and it is not like to be ever esteemed the Metropolis of the New Empire, which is now so much talked of here.</p>
               <p>In a word, the people here that are most zealous against Heresie, have been so managed by the Jesuites and the begging Fryars in Confessions, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most universally look on the Pope as Infallible: and every one remembers, that about twenty year ago there was scarce any other Doctrine to be heard, but that which extolled the Popes Infallibility, not only in Points of Faith, but also in Matters of Fact: and the falling from the submission due to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, was called <hi>the root and source of all heresie,</hi> which was aggravated with all that could be invented to make the <hi>Iansenists</hi> the more odious, who were then looked on as ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to that See.</p>
               <p>This is so fresh in all peoples remembrance, and is now so often repeated by those who bear no good will to that <hi>Order,</hi> that if they were not a sort of men very incapable of the Impressions which modesty and shame make on most people, they would scarce know how to lift up their heads. It is not unpleasant to hear how those that rally them, make Apologies for them from their own principles: Some tell us, that the Intention according to their Casuistical Divinity, justifies the means used to accomplish a good end; and since the promoting the honour of the <hi>Society,</hi> is the end they aim at, it is said, that when the complementing the See of <hi>Rome</hi> may promote, that it is lawful to do it: but if the depressing that, and extolling the Regal Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more necessary for the Interests of the <hi>Society,</hi> the good Intention will secure all still: and there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93095:4"/>
to doubt, but they seriously intend the good of their Order, and as little to question, that this is a good thing. So here the Doctrine of Intention serves them to very good purpose.</p>
               <p>Their other celebrated Maxim of Probability, is no less useful to them, that in a probable Opinion a man may with a good Conscience follow either side, and that any approved Doctor's being of any side, makes that Opinion probable. From which, those that divert themselves with them, say in their defence, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Doctors having been of both sides in the Point of the Pope's Infallibility, a man may with a safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science chuse either side, as he finds it is most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him. Thus the two Doctrines of Intention and Probability joyned together, make a very substantial Apology for them; and indeed it is all I hear said to vindicate them in this particular: for to tell you truth, It is very hard to get any of them to talk of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: those that are meer Scholars, are still for the Pope; but they are so restrained by the Political Fathers, that they will not enter upon this discourse: and for those that play their Game at Court, you may as soon make those of <hi>Whetstones-park</hi> among you blush, as put them out of countenance. They do now value themselves upon their Zeal for the King, and upon his Zeal for the Catholick Religion against Heresie: and one can draw nothing from them on this subject, but high Elogies of their King, as, <hi>That he who has given peace to all</hi> Europe, <hi>will never raise a War in the Church; and who can think, that a Prince who employes all his authority for the Extirpation of Heresie, will ever turn it against the Church?</hi> Upon this occasion I could tell you a great deal of Mr. <hi>Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>'s Eloquence, who is so full of Raptures when he engages in this discourse, that if he thinks what he sayes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93095:4"/>
will be reported either in the Kings hearing, or before any of his Ministers, he grows almost Ecstatical on that head.</p>
               <p>These things are not said only by the <hi>Canaille,</hi> but by those of the highest condition; and even the <hi>Queen</hi> and <hi>Dauphiness,</hi> as we hear, grow apprehensive that a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture may happen between those two great Luminaries the Pope and the King: but I assure you, whatever the Popes presumption might be in former Ages, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himself to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the Temporal Princes to the <hi>Moon,</hi> that would now pass here for a piece of high presumption: for this Glorious Monarch would think it a strange degradation, if he, to whom so many of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Sun</hi> have been ascribed by hungry Flatterers, were now to be compared to the <hi>Moon.</hi> It is reported, that these two Illustrious Princesses have expressed their Zeal on this occasion, and have told the Arch Bishop of <hi>Paris, That they were informed, he and some others of the Clergy intended to break with the Pope: they might do what they pleased, but for their parts, they were resolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to be good</hi> Roman <hi>Catholicks.</hi> Others say, the King is a <hi>Good Catholick,</hi> the <hi>Most Christian King,</hi> and the <hi>Eldest Son of the Church,</hi> full of Zeal for it, but he sees by other mens eyes: and as the common style in <hi>England</hi> of those who are displeased with the Government, is only an arraigning of the Ministers, the King himself being treated with the respect of Civil words, even by those who study most to expose his Government; so here the Zealots take the freedom to speak very liberally of the Clergy. Indeed the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> carries the heaviest load; the former parts of his life have been such, that he is not proof against censure: and upon all such occasions, if there has been just grounds given for some ill reports, malice and envy improves these with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93095:5"/>
great industry, even to a pitch that is scarce credible: But I love not to dwell much on so unfavoury a subject. I shall therefore say no more of him, but that as he is certainly a man of great and polite thoughts, and a very dexterous Courtier; so there is nothing to be imagined neither for impiety nor lewdness with which he is not openly charged here, not only in discourses, but in Prints, of which the Authors are known, and some that are in the <hi>Bastile</hi> for them, offer to justifie all that they have aspersed him with.</p>
               <p>For the rest of the Clergy, I understand they may be reduced to three Ranks or Classes. The first and greatest, is of those who have neither Learning nor Piety, nor common Morality: Some of the greatest of them where they think they may use freedom, speak of Religion with all the Insolence of blasphemous scorn possible: they are men of quality who have taken Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders meerly for the Dignity and Wealth that they aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to; and do scarce observe the common decencies of their profession. In short, the King is all the God they serve, and so they are ready to advance any thing that will recommend them to his favour, or contribute to their promotion.</p>
               <p>The second Class is of the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophers, who approve of the Morals of the Christian Religion, but for Miracles or Mysteries, they believe very little; and consider the several Institutions of Religion, only as they do Laws and received Customs, which are not to be rashly changed for fear of the Convulsions that may follow; but as to their own perswasions of things, all opinions and practices in the Ritual part of Religion seem indifferent to them. So that when some gross things are objected to them, they are Ingenuous enough to confess, there is a great deal of reason in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93095:5"/>
but after all, they will comply with their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, and this not so much out of an Atheistical temper, as because they consider all the Institutions of Religion, only as matters of Policy and Law.</p>
               <p>A third Class, which as it is much the best, so it is much the least, is of those who are both Learned and Good Men, and are fully convinced of many Errors in their Church, which they think need Reformation: but what by a weakness of temper, what by some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which they have carried too far against every thing that seems to lead to Schism, they have not Spirit enough to own the freedom of their thoughts, and say they hope that God will forgive their temporizing, since they know not how to emancipate themselves: Nor do they see a party to which they can turn. They have great prejudice against the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> both as to the first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of their Churches, and several other things that are among them: but I am confident if they were in <hi>England,</hi> they would be more inclined to come over to the Church there: and indeed I hear only two excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Church of <hi>England</hi> among them; the one is the positive definition against the Corporal Presence in the Sacrament, which they wish were left in general terms without positive definitions either one way or another; the other is, that there is not such a Spirit of Devotion and Mortification and exemplary Piety among the Church-men, as ought to be. They speak of Pluralities and Non-Residence and of the Aspiring and Pomp of Church men with horror: And it is certain that this Church could not have subsisted so long, if the gross scandals that are given by the Bishops and Abbots of the Court were not counterballanced by the shining examples of some of their Prelates, which I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, is far beyond any thing I ever saw.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:93095:6"/>You may wonder, that in this Enumeration I do not reckon up the Bigots; but really there are so few of those among the Superiour Clergy, that they scarce make a Classis. I have not heard of one of them that believes the Pope Infallible, or is perswaded of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation. I heard one pleasantly declaim against the folly of the <hi>Messieurs of Charenton,</hi> for writing such Learned Volumes in confutation of these things, <hi>which,</hi> said he, <hi>none of the Catholicks believed any more than They did, so they might well spare the pains.</hi> But he reckoned the Revenues of the Ecclesiasticks in their communion were fifty Millions a year; <hi>In that,</hi> said he, <hi>is the strength of our cause: Let Mr.</hi> Claude <hi>answer that, and then Mr.</hi> Arnauld <hi>will be a feeble party to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the Monks and Fryars there is something very like Bigotry, though there is so little sincerity among them, that it is very hard to know when they may be believed. I confess, one thing I heard put to one of them that seemed unanswerable, and it pressed them hard in this point of the Popes Infallibility. The great Topick they use, and that is in every bodies mouth against the Hereticks, is, that men must not trust to their own opinions, but submit all to the Church: and that truth could not be preserved, if there were not a living Infallible Judge on earth; and by this great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of well meaning <hi>Hugonots</hi> are drawn over. It has an appearance that is apt to work on an humble and well disposed mind. Now the people alwayes thought that this was to be understood of the Pope, to whom all the Bishops were to make their application for the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of such controversies as might arise; and so the argument had still some effect: but now that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Constance</hi> are declared for, that lodged this Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility in a General Council, the Church has lost her
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93095:6"/>
great advantage against Hereticks: for there is no such Council in being, there has been none that pretended to that Title now almost one hundred and twenty years; and it is not probable there shall ever be another, so there is no living Infallible Judge. The Fryar said so little in answer to this, that I clearly perceived, he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the belief of the Popes Infallibility as the Basis or the Center of the Church. But they are so much afraid of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> his Spies, and of the rigour of the Court of Parliament, that they speak of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only in dark Figures or Riddles.</p>
               <p>One of them would say no more, but <hi>that it was safest to stick to the root of the tree:</hi> another said, <hi>all things will return to their center.</hi> The truth is, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars are much concerned in the maintaining of the Popes authority, for all their exemptions depend upon it. And there is no Heresie of which they are so appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive, as that of losing their priviledges, and being brought under the Jurisdiction of their Bishops: and this the Bishops do all so openly pretend to, that it would be the first step that would be made after a rupture with <hi>Rome,</hi> to bring them in all points, within the care, and under the authority of their Diocesans. This present Assembly of the Clergy had this matter under their consideration, and by this time it is probable they would have made some progress in it, if the King had not ordered them to adjourn for some time. So you need not doubt, but that they are very careful to possess all people in such secret methods as they dare venture on, with very tragical apprehensions of the Issue of the present contest with <hi>Rome.</hi> And if the severity against the Protestants were not interposed, as a signal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Kings Zeal for the faith, it is probable this meeting with the other things that raise so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93095:7"/>
in this Kingdom, might have produced more considerable effects than have yet appeared. That this may be alwayes in the peoples eye, new Edicts come out every day, which shew, that the King is resolved to make his <hi>Hugonot</hi> Subjects grow weary either of their lives, or of their Religion.</p>
               <p>Two came out the other day: the one was, that no Protestant may have the Relief of an <hi>Evocation</hi> (or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal) from any Court of Justice where he finds himself aggrieved. The other is, that no Sea-man nor Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shall offer to go out of the Kingdom without leave, under the pain of being sent to the Gallies. So that it is resolved, that all who profess that Religion, shall be miserable, if they stay in the Kingdom; and much more so, if they offer to fly out of it. These things give the people some comfort, who cannot be easily made to doubt of their Kings firmness to their Religion, as long as he continues true to one main branch of it, which is persecuting those of other perswasions.</p>
               <p>But upon the whole matter, it is not probable, that all this business, on which the World has now lookt so at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively for some time, will produce any great effect. The King does not meddle in matters of Speculation himself, and there is little reason to expect much from a man of the Arch Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> his temper. So that we begin generally to think, that some Expedient will be found. The King has declared, that he is resolved, not to break with the Pope, and he has lately received a Brief from him, writ in a more obliging strain, than those formerly sent. I have not yet seen a Copy of it, so I cannot send it; only the first words are much talkt of, for it begins thus, <hi>My Son give me thy heart.</hi> It seems it has made some impression on the King, and that he is in hopes of bringing the whole matter to an
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93095:7"/>
amicable conclusion; and therefore he takes cares that there be no new provocation given the Pope, and so he has ordered the Assembly of the Clergy to adjourn for some time, which they did on the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> last, and many think they will hardly meet again except it be for forms sake.</p>
               <p>Some begin also to talk of a Legate to be sent into <hi>France,</hi> for concluding this affair; and <hi>Azolini</hi> is the man most talked of, who is a very fit person for such an Employment, for he has the reputation of a very prudent and devout man. Last Winter he retired from all busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and gave himself wholly to devotion and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiom: So whether he will leave his retirement to do so great a service to his Church or not, we do not yet know. It is true I found at <hi>Rome,</hi> last Winter his character much lessened among the <hi>Italians,</hi> who look upon such retirements, as either the effects of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly or affectation: For indeed few there understand either the Philosophy, or the piety that should work such a change in a man dignified with the Purple. But the Pope has a much better sense of such things, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in this last promotion of Cardinals, which I found all at <hi>Rome,</hi> confess was the best that ever was made.</p>
               <p>This is the state of the affair of the <hi>Regale,</hi> which has set both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> in such a fermentation: But for the last Edict, touching the Popes authority over Princes, his Infallibility and the Superiority of General Councils over him, it is a harder Chapter: for as at <hi>Rome</hi> it is not to be imagined they can ever comply with it or endure it; so it is not likely this Court will ever suffer it to be altered or recalled. The temper that will be perhaps found, will be this the Edict will be still left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record; but there will be secret directions given not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93095:8"/>
to execute it. The Pope has by his Brief annulled all that the Assembly has done, and so he will look upon it as condemned by his authority; and perhaps will be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this, without proceeding to a more express condemnation. On the other hand a secret intimation from the Court not to proceed any further in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it, will be perhaps easily obtained; and so this which is the greatest difficulty may be so made up, that at present this difference will be carried no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Court of Parliament will think it enough that the Edict is past, and will advise the keeping it as a perpetual terrour for the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that hereafter, upon every disgust offered to this Crown by that Court, this Edict will be made use of; and by the shaking this Rod it may be thought the Popes will be kept to their good behaviour. Somewhat of this will appear within a few days, for many of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> have complained highly of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Parliament, and in particular of the making a Declaration on such points, and the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to Register it, without ever asking their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about them: They have not yet obeyed the Edict nor registred it; yesterday they were cited to appear before the Court of Parliament, and were required for the second time to call an extraordinary Assembly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ten days, and without further delay to put the Edict in their Registers. So whether they will give obedience, or whether the thing will be let fall, or at least delay'd, is not yet certain and therefore you must have a little pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence till the progress of this affair give you a better view of it, than can be done by such conjectures as are made here.</p>
               <p>In the mean while it seems the <hi>Iansenists</hi> expect a storm both because the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> is their declared and enraged enemy, and looks on them as the authors of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93095:8"/>
all those Libels that fly about <hi>Paris</hi> against him; and also because in this matter they do openly espouse the Popes interests. And this is represented to the King as an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of their Factious and restless tempers, and of the hatred they bear to his government. In this there is too much reason to justifie that imputation; for it seems as odd a thing to see them turn Champions for the Popes authority, as it is to see the <hi>Iesuites</hi> declare against it: And it shews but too evidently that interests and resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments govern both parties in their opinions as well as in their practices. The <hi>Iansenists</hi> are now mightily run down here, and beside the old Imputations of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too favourable to the Hereticks, this is now added to it, That they are too great friends to the liberty of the people; That they do not love the Kings Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Government, and, That they will be of any side that is against the King. It seems they expect nothing but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity; and therefore they animate their party to prepare for it, and to bear it patiently: For the famous Mr. <hi>Arnauld,</hi> though he has retired out of the world, so that it is not known where he lives, has of late published a continuation of his defence of the Translation of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> Printed at <hi>Mons;</hi> which he concludes with a bold and pathetick Discourse concerning the sufferings of that party, in which he rejoyces, and calls them the tryals of their Faith and patience, and a portion which the Church Militant must of necessity look for. And on this he enlarges with all the strains and figures of that Masculine Eloquence that is so natural to him. But that for which he is much blamed, is that he makes so bold with the King; he laments <hi>that he sees with other mens eyes, and that his Reign must be reckoned among the Reigns of persecution.</hi> In short, it is such a discourse, as would make a very pertinent conclusion to the Sermon
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93095:9"/>
of a <hi>Hugonot</hi> Minister, on a Fast-day, if he intended to spend the rest of his days in the <hi>Bastile. Iansenism</hi> is a thing now disowned almost by every body, and yet it spreads so universally among the Learned and Good men in this Church, that upon the first favourable conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, it will appear how considerable it is: Though those that now receive it, use almost as much precaution in owning it, as they would do in speaking of Treason. But though they dare not speak out in the condemned points concerning <hi>Grace;</hi> yet by many other things as so many <hi>Shibboleths,</hi> it is not hard to know them, as by their excessive commendations of St. <hi>Austin</hi> among the Ancients; and Cardinal <hi>Borromee</hi> among the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns: by their lamenting over the present corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Church, chiefly in the conduct of Penitents, and by their sharpness against the <hi>Iesuites:</hi> By these things they are generally known, and a mark is set on them, so that none of them are at any time raised to any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent promotion. The King considers them as men that love liberty, and so thinks them bad Subjects: And the Lewd Court-Bishops look upon them as their worst enemies, and do hate them much more than the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and consider all that is said of a Reformation, as intended on purpose to expose them; for guilt makes men very tender and jealous.</p>
               <p>I shall end this long Letter, with a passage that has fallen out here of late, that will perhaps give you some diversion, and make you more easie to forgive the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous length to which this Letter has run out.</p>
               <p>A woman that lives in <hi>Tours,</hi> and was melancholy and full of Vapours, desired to receive the Sacrament every day, in which she said she found most wonderful consolation. The Priest has the reputation of a very worthy man, and being a judicious person, he clearly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93095:9"/>
saw through the poor Womans weakness and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was willing enough to do what he thought an innocent fraud, that might both give the distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red person some ease, and yet not tend to a profanation of Holy things; so instead of the Sacrament, he gave her unconsecrated wafers which she received with her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary devotion, and they had their ordinary effects on her: But as Frenchmen are too apt to tell their own secrets; the Curate made himself merry with some of his friends upon this occasion, and told how he had deceived the Hypochondriacal Woman: So the thing got wind, and was lookt on as a great impiety in the Priest to suffer one to commit such Idolatry to a piece of bread, to which no doubt she offered the same ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that was due, if it had been Consecrated; so the Curate was cited before the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Tours,</hi> where he had met with a severe censure, if the esteem he is justly in, had not preserved him: He excused himself that he had not failed out of Malice, but out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and that he thought it best to comply with the weakness of a Woman, abused by melancholy, and since it would have encreased her distemper to have denyed her the Sacrament, and yet her condition was not such that it was fit for her to receive every day: He thought he took that course in which there was the least danger; but he was condemned to six months Imprisonment, yet it is thought the sentence will be mitigated, and upon his submitting to some severe penances, he will be set at liberty ere long.</p>
               <p>I leave it to you, and your most Learned Friend when you meet, to consider, if this is acknowledged to be Idolatry in the melancholy Woman, to worship a piece of bread, which she verily believed was the body of Christ; then whether it will not certainly follow
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93095:10"/>
that the whole Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is guilty of Idolatry, if Christ is not Corporally present in the Host, and that their adoring him as present, will not excuse them from Idolatry, if he is not really present. But I must not enter upon points of Controversie with you, much less will I encrease the trouble I have given you, by offering you a great many Apologies for what I have written; I know your Curiosity in this affair of the <hi>Regale</hi> makes you more than ordinary concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know the true State of it; and I was willing to enlarge much more copiously, than was perhaps ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, for one that knows so much of the Transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Kingdom: But as I demonstrate to you my readiness to obey your commands, so I am not unwilling so far to expose my self to you, as to let you see the use I make of my Travels, which will at least give you occasion to correct what you find amiss; and I shall be a great gainer by the exchange, if instead of a long scrible of News I have a return from you, that shall contain such reflections of yours, as may be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me to observe matters more exactly, and to judge more maturely of them. I shall afflict you no more, but shall only add that I am, with great sincerity,</p>

               <head>The Translation of the former Brief, directed to his Venerable Brethren the Arch-Bishops, and Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> assembled at <hi>Paris,</hi> bearing date the Eleventh of <hi>April 1682.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IT was very uneasie and bitter to us, by reason of the Fatherly affection which We bear to our dearest Son in Christ <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>most Christian King,</hi> and to your Churches and Persons, and that whole Kingdom, To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by your Letters, directed to us on the third of <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> that a great many of the Bishops of <hi>France</hi> (who were anciently a Crown and rejoycing to this most Eminent See) should now behave themselves so toward it, that We are sorced with many Tears to make use of these words of the Prophet, <hi>My Mothers Children have fought against me:</hi> Though in truth you rather fight against your selves, when you set your selves in opposition to us, in a Cause, in which the welfare and freedom of your Churches is so much concerned; and for which some pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and resolute men of your Order having appealed to us, We did without delay stand up for defence of the Episcopal Rights and Dignity in that Kingdom, which now for a great while We have maintained, having in that sought no private ends of our own; being set on to it meerly by that care that We owe to all the Churches, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93095:14"/>
the love that We bear to you, which is so deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our hearts.</p>
               <p>We perceived from the very beginning of your Letter, that there was nothing in it that could be either welcome to us, or worthy of that name you bear in the world: For not to insist on what you said of the Rule that was observed in the calling and managing of Councils, We observed that your Letter began from your fears, and that is a motive, by which Gods Priests are never animated to undertake any difficult or weighty cause, that concerns either Religion, or the Liberty of the Church, with that Courage that becomes them at first, or to persevere in it with that constancy, which they ought to hold to the last.</p>
               <p>And you were much mistaken when you thought you might pour out your fears into Our breast; for the Love of Christ ought always to dwell in Our breast, <hi>which casts out fear,</hi> and keeps it at a great distance: We have already demonstrated in many and signal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that Fatherly Love that is kindled in Our hearts towards you and the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> which We need not here reckon up. And if there is any thing in which our affection has deserved well at your hands, We think it has chiefly appeared in this business of the <hi>Regale,</hi> upon which if the matter is well considered, it will appear that the whole Dignity and authority of your Order doth depend. You were therefore <hi>in fear where no fear was:</hi> Whereas this only was that of which you ought to have been afraid, lest you might have been justly accused before God and men, for having been wanting to your Station and Honour, and the duty of your Pastoral charge. And you ought to have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the examples of Episcopal Constancy and Courage: which in the like cases, the ancient and most holy Bishops
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93095:15"/>
have set before you, for your instruction; and which have been imitated by many Bishops in every age, from their days. You ought also to have reflected on your own Predecessors, not only those who flourished in the times of our forefathers, but in Our own days. You cite the words of <hi>Ivon</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> but you ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to follow his actions, when there is occasion for it: You know what he both did and suffered in those troublesome &amp; dangerous contests, that were between Pope <hi>Urban</hi> and King <hi>Philip.</hi> He thought it became his Function, to endure the Kings displeasure, to bear the spoiling of his goods, and to suffer both Imprisonment and Banishment.</p>
               <p>It became your Function, even when others were forsaking the better cause, to have joyned your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to the Authority of the Apostolick See, and to have pleaded the cause of your Churches before the King; joyning the resolution that became Pastors, with the humility of Priests; and to have informed his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the whole matter, even though you had appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the danger of drawing his Displeasure upon you: That so for the time to come, you might without blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, use the words of <hi>David,</hi> when you address your selves to God in the daily Psalmody, <hi>I did speak of thy Testimonies before Kings, and was not confounded:</hi> But how much more ought you to have done this, when you had so well known, and so often tryed the justice and piety of your excellent Prince, of whom you your selves write, that he hears the Bishops with a singular gentleness, and that he is resolved to maintain the Episcopal Authority without suffering it to be entrenched upon; which We read in your Letter with great joy.</p>
               <p>We do not doubt, that in the defence of so just a cause you could either want Arguments fit to be used; or the King a heart tractable, and inclined to grant your
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93095:15"/>
desires. But now since you seem to have forgot both your own duty, and the Kings justice, and that you have been silent in a matter of so great consequence, we do not see upon what probable ground you can found that which you represent to us, that you have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to do what you have done, because you have been overcome in this Dispute, and have lost your cause. But how could he lose it that never stood to it? And how could he be overcome that never struggled? Who of you all did plead this weighty, this just, and this most Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Cause, before the King? Whereas your Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, even in the like danger, did defend it oftner than once with all freedom, both before the former Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and even before this King himself: And having carried their cause, they were dismist by their most just King, with rewards for having so manfully performed the duty of the Pastoral charge. But who of you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in this contest, that he might raise <hi>a Wall for the house of Israel?</hi> Who has had the boldness to expose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to envy? Who has uttered so much as one word, that savoured of the freedom of former times? The Kings Officers have indeed cryed aloud as you write, they have cryed aloud in an ill cause, for the Rights of the Crown; whereas you in the best cause, that was both for the Honour of Christ and the Church, have been silent: Nor is there any more weight in what you say, when you render us an account, or indeed rather offer us an excuse, for the things that have been done by you in this Assembly. You aggravate the danger of a breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Priesthood and the Civil Power, and the ill effects that may follow from thence, both in Church and State: <hi>And inferr that therefore you thought it became you to find out a mean for removing the difference that was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing, and that no mean appeared more convenient than those</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:93095:16"/>
                  <hi>remedies proposed by the Fathers of the Church for tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Canons by a prudent condescention according to the necessity of the times, in such things as might no way en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger either the truth of Religion, or the Rules of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality: and that you thought your Order and the whole</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane <hi>and indeed the Universal Church owed so much to a King that had merited so eminently of the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and who was daily desiring to merit further of it, and that therefore you passed from your Rights, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed them to the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We forbear to mention what you represent to us of the Appeal you made to the Secular Magistrate, by whom this Cause was judged against you; for We wish the remembrance of that might be buried in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, and would gladly have you dash out those words out of your Letters, so that they might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main upon the Records of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church to your eternal reproach.</p>
               <p>As for what you bring for your own defence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, <hi>Benedict</hi> the Twelfth and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> the Eighth, there have not been wanting some who have by Learned Treatises demonstrated how frivolous and foreign they are to this matter: and it is so notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously known, that it is needless to mention it, with what zeal and constancy those great Popes defended the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Church against the Secular Powers: So little reason have you to maintain your error by those precedents.</p>
               <p>We do readily allow of and commend the Resolution of relaxing the Discipline of the Canons according to the necessity of the times, where that may be done without any prejudice either to Religion or a good life: and we add with St. <hi>Austin, That things are to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times endured for the good of unity, which ought to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred,</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:93095:16"/>
                  <hi>if considered according to equity: Nor are the tares to be rooted out, if there is danger of plucking up the wheat likewise with them.</hi> But all this is so to be understood that it may be done only in some particular case, and for a time, and upon an urgent necessity as was done by the Church when she restored the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Donatists</hi> to their Churches, upon their abjuring their errors, that so the people that had followed them might be the more easily governed. But the case is very different from this, when the Discipline of the Church is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the foundation of the whole Ecclesiastical Discipline and Hierarchy is indeed overthrown through the whole extent of so great a Kingdom without any limitation of time, and with the manifest danger of establishing a precedent which may spread much further. These consequences must certainly follow, if We should suffer the things to be put in execution, which have been lately done by <hi>The Most Christian King,</hi> even with your consent, in the affair of the <hi>Regale</hi> (against the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the holy Canons, and chiefly against the General Council of <hi>Lions,</hi> and against Our mind that has been long ago signified to you in that affair, and contrary to that Sacred Tye of your Oaths by which when you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Episcopal character, you bound your selves to God, to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and to your own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches) and if we by delaying longer, should suffer this evil to become more inveterate; and should not, in imitation of the examples of our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, and according to that Supream Authority over the whole Church which is given by God to Our <hi>Meanness,</hi> condemn it: and that the rather, that by the abuse of the <hi>Regale</hi> the Discipline of the Church is not only overthrown, as is notoriously evident, but even the purity of the faith is brought in danger: which you
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93095:17"/>
may easily gather from the very words of the Kings Edicts, by which the Right of conferring Benefices is ascribed to the King, not as flowing from any Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Church; but as a Right innate and coaeval to the Crown: Nor could we read that part of your Letter without <hi>horror,</hi> in which you say, you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from your Rights, and have transferred them on the King; as if you were the Masters, and not the Guardians of these Churches that are trusted to your care; and as if the Churches themselves and the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Rights belonging to them could be brought under the yoke of the Secular Power, by the Bishops, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed rather ought to become slaves themselves for set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them at liberty. You your selves did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confess this truth, when upon another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion you declared, that the Right of the <hi>Regale,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in that branch of it that belongs to the Collation of Benefices, was a servitude that could not be brought upon the Church, but by her concession, at least by her consent. By what right then have you conferred that on the King? and since the holy Canons forbid the alienating the Rights of the Church, how could it enter into your minds to alienate these Rights? as if you could derogate from the authority of the Canons.</p>
               <p>Call to mind what that renowned Abbot of <hi>Clarevall</hi> writ excellently to this purpose, whom you justly call the Light not only of the <hi>Gallican,</hi> but of the Universal Church, when he was putting Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> in mind of his duty, <hi>He bids him remember that the Keys of the Church were delivered to him, but not the Sheep themselves: There were others that kept the Gates of Heaven, and were the Pastors of the Flock; but whereas every one of these have their several Flocks assigned them, to him were the whole trusted: one Flock under one Shepherd: and that</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:93095:17"/>
Eugenius <hi>was not only the Shepherd of the Sheep, but of the Shepherds themselves: and therefore according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the Canons the other Bishops were called to a portion of the care, but he to the fulness of the power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as it is expedient to give you warning of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and submission that you owe this holy See, which We, though unworthy, do now by the Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment govern; so our Pastoral care doth stir us up, now at last, to set about the discharge of our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Office, which we have hitherto delayed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by an excessive long suffering, being willing to give time to repentance.</p>
               <p>Therefore We through the authority of Almighty God committed to us, do by these present Letters <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, Rescind</hi> and <hi>Annul</hi> what has been done in this your Assembly in the affair of the <hi>Regale;</hi> together with every thing that has followed thereupon, or that may happen to be attempted for the future; and We declare them to be for ever Null and Void: though these things being of themselves manifestly Null, it was not necessary to interpose any Declaration for annulling them: Yet We hope that you your selves having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered better of this matter, will by a speedy retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion consult the good of your own consciences, and the honour of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Clergy: of which Clergy, as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto some have not been wanting, so we hope that for the time to come, others will not be wanting, who following the example of the good Shepherd, shall be ready to lay down their lives willingly for their Sheep, and for maintaining the Inheritance conveyed down to them from their Fathers.</p>
               <p>As for our part, We are ready according to the duty of our Function, and by the assistance of Divine Grace, to offer up the Sacrifice of Righteousness, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93095:18"/>
the Rights and Liberties of the Church of God, and the authority and Dignity of this holy See: not trusting in Our selves, but depending for all things on God, who comforts and strengthens Us, and who commanded <hi>Peter</hi> to come unto him, walking on the waters: <hi>for the fashion of this world passeth away, and the day of the Lord approacheth.</hi> Let Us therefore, Venerable Brethren and beloved Children, so behave Our Selves that when the great Master of the Family, and the Prince of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors shall make his accounts with his Servants, he may not require at their hands the blood of a broken and torn Church, which he redeemed with his own blood. We do again give you all Our Apostolical Blessing with much sincere and cordial affection, and pray that the Divine blessing may be added to it.</p>

               <head>The Translation of the former Protestation.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church governs her self by her own Laws, and does inviolably observe her own Customs, from which the Bishops of <hi>France</hi> and our Ancestors have thought that no Decision, and no Authority could derogate; and the Popes themselves have thought fit both to acknowledge and to commend them: But now those just Laws, which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient piety of <hi>France,</hi> and Venerable Antiquity have esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such as that they were never to be shaken, are almost enerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For we have seen (which cannot be mentioned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a most bitter and sensible affliction to us) that of late years, Letters from the Apostolick See, have been disseminated through the Provinces and Cities of <hi>France,</hi> in which the ancient Rights of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church and the appointments of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers are manifestly violated. By these We understand that an inspection into the affairs of this Kingdom and of our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, has been assumed against Our Customs; That judgements have been given without hearing the parties; That the Episcopal jurisdiction has been trodden under foot, and that the sentence of Excommunication has been threatned against a Metropolitan, contrary to the Ecclesiastical Canons, and the Customs of the most Illustrious <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gallicane</hi> Clergy is grieved and complains, that by these things, and by what has been since done pursuant to them, the Liberties of their Churches have been oppressed, and the order of the Church has been disturbed; That the Episcopal Office has been disgraced, and the Land-Marks have been broke through, which Our Fathers had fixed: And therefore that they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the imputation of having abandoned their Duty and Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or betrayed their own Dignity and the interests of their Churches, they have resolved to oppose these things by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Protestation, and so to free themselves from the guilt of a neglectful silence; that so according to the examples set them by their Forefathers, they may take care, that these things may not for the future prejudice the Rights and Liberties of the <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane</hi> Church. To this they are the more inclined because the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:93095:20"/>
present Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eleventh (so eminent for Excellent Vertues and a strict observance of the Discipline established by the Canons) will not suffer any thing to be done that shall be injurious to the Decrees of his Predecessors, and the Canons already promulgated; by which every thing is rescinded that hath been surreptitiously obtained, contrary to the proper Rights of Provinces; nor would they suffer the priviledges of Churches to be confounded, which ought to be constantly preserved.</p>
               <p>Therefore the said <hi>Gallicane</hi> Clergy having first made profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all Reverence and obedience, which she ever has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and ever will express to the Chair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in which she acknowledges <hi>a more Powerful</hi>

                  <hi>Principality,</hi> has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to Protest before the most renowned <hi>Iohn Baptist Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> Protonotary Apostolick, and Auditor of the Apostolick Nunciature in <hi>France,</hi> as in fact she does by these presents protest that the Popes Letters to the Bishop of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> bearing date the 2 of <hi>October</hi> 1680. and to the Chapter of <hi>Pamiers</hi> of the same date, and to the Bishop of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> bearing date the 1 of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1681. and the Letters to the <hi>Nuns,</hi> or Regular Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonesses of the Blessed Virgin of the Nunnery of <hi>Charron,</hi> bearing date the 7 of <hi>August</hi> and the 15. of <hi>October</hi> 1680. or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that have followed since that time, or any thing that has been acted or done by vertue of those, shall be no wayes hurtful or prejudicial to the Rights of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church, and shall turn to no Precedent or Warrant for doing the like in any other time or place; and that none may thereupon presume to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the ancient Canons of the Church, or the established Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of this Kingdom, or the received practices of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church, or think that he may lawfully do any thing, pursuant thereunto; and let none be ignorant, that these things notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Canons, Customs, Rights, and Liberties of the said Church, shall still remain and preserve their ancient Force and Authority entire: Hereby the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Clergy have thought fit to secure and preserve themselves and their priviledges, and this this they will have known to all persons, that so none may pretend ignorance.</p>

               <head>A Letter from <hi>Paris</hi> of the 20th of <hi>Iune</hi> New-stile, containing a further account of the Contests between the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>French King.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BY my last, which I sent by one that went from hence a fortnight ago, I gave you a large account of our Affairs here, which I hope has come to your hands before this time; but the great change of the present prospect We have of that matter, from that which appeared when I wrote last, needs not surprize you: For the secrets of State are not known here, so quick as with you, and they lie in so few hands, and those are so true to the Kings service, that the greatest persons here can penetrate no further into the Councils than as they are pleased to lay them open. You will not therefore wonder, if I now tell you that instead of the adjusting of that Affair, of which all people here seemed so assured that it was universally spoken of as a thing done, yet it appears now to be more desperate than ever. We now know the true cause of the sudden Adjourning the Assembly of the Clergy, and that it flowed not from any disposition to compose this difference, but that it was done to prevent a stroke, that might have put it past reconciling: The true reason was this, The Old resolute Pope sent a Courier to <hi>France</hi> to the Internuntio with a Bull of Excommunication, which he required him to carry into the Assembly, and there to fulminate in his Name against all the Assembly. This came to the knowledge of Cardinal d' <hi>Estree,</hi> who, to prevent the ill effects of so hardy a Step, sent presently a Courier with a strict charge to use all possible hast to get before the Popes Courier, that so the King might have timely notice of what the other was bringing; and this is now known to be the true reason of that sudden Adjournment. So by this you see this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is further from being composed than ever. As for the Affair of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> of which I gave you an account in my last, it has had another effect than was expected. On <hi>Monday</hi> last the Faculty met, where there was great opposition made to the Registring the Kings Edict, insomuch that they could not bring the Affair to any Issue at that time; but Adjourned the debate till next day, yet it was visible enough that those for the Negative were the stronger party; so at night the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93095:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Arch-Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Marquiss of <hi>Segnelay,</hi> the first President, and the Attorney General met, and it seems resolved on that which was put in execution next day; for when the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> was again assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and engaged in the debate, about eleven a Clock an Officer was sent from the Court of Parliament, requiring them to suspend their debates, and to send them 12 of their Number, who were named in the Order, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their Clerk and their Register; the persons were not left to their choice, lest they might have sent some that might have spoken too freely to the Parliament. When the persons thus called for, appeared, the first President made a most terrible harangue to them; he accused the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> of ingratitude and presumption, that they who were but a Faculty, that had no Authority, and had their meeting only by the Kings Connivence, should have arrogated an Authority to themselves, to have examined the matter of an Edict that was made by the Assembly of the whole Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> and was confirmed by the King, and verified by the Parliament. He therefore commanded their Clerk to insert it in their Register, and charged them not to Assemble any more, but as they should be required and authorised to it by orders from the Court: And told them that by the first of <hi>July,</hi> the Kings pleasure should be signified to them. Thus you see how firm the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> is in this matter, for the proceedings of the Court of Parliament are an open confession that the Majority of the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> would have refused to receive the Edict. I add no more but that I am intirely yours.</p>
