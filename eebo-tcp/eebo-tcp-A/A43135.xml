            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The contempt proceeded from the manner of your writing, wherein you regard not <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>It may be you will question, wherefore I have not answered your Second Part: It is ready for you, but I have not now thought fit to divulge the same; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because it hath been dealt in by some o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>AN ANSWER TO THE FIRST CHAP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; whereof the Title is this.</head>
            <head type="sub">That Succession to Government by nearness of blood is not by law of Nature or divine, but only by humane and positive Laws of every particular common-wealth: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that it may upon just cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, be altered by the same.</head>
            <p>HERE you begin, that other conditions are requisite for coming to Government by succession, besides pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity or priority of blood; which condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions must be limited by some higher autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity than that of the King, and yet are they prescribed by no Law of Nature or Divine. For otherwise, one that wanteth his wits or sences, or is a Turk in Religion, might suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in Government; which you affirm to be against all Reason, Law, Religion, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, conscience, and against the first end of Institution of common wealths. And that <hi>Byl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,</hi> who maintaineth the contrary, doth it in favor and flattery of some particular Prince.</p>
            <p>What conditions are requisit in succession besides priority of blood, and by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they are to be limited, I will then examin when you shall propound: but for your reason of this assertion, you must have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98890:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other men them <hi>Billay</hi> out of credit, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, law, conscience, and wisdom, before you carry it for clear good. As for entire contrariety in Religion, or difference in some particular points thereof, whether it be a sufficient cause of exclusion, or no, I will refer my self to that place, where you do strain your strength about it. In disabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to govern,<note place="margin">In. c. 1. tit. de success. feud.</note> 
               <hi>Baldus</hi> doth distinguish, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be natural, or accidental, affirming, that in the first case it sufficeth to exclude, because he that is incapable of government from his birth, had never any right of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession setled in him: in the other it doth not suffice; because he that is once inveited in right of succession, cannot be deprived thereof without his fault.</p>

But <hi>Iason, Angelus,</hi> and divers others do indistinctly hold, that the eldest Son of a King or other Governor, although he be born either furious, or a fool, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise defective, cannot therefore be excluded from his succession.</p>
            <p>These affirm, that any end of institution of Common-wealths is, if not fully, yet bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter satisfied, by appointing a protector of the state (as upon divers occasions it hath been usual) then by acknowledging another Prince; as well for other respects, as for that by continuance of succession in one discent, a fair and ordinary occasion is removed, both of mutiny and invasion. For enemies will

not readily attempt, and subjects do most willingly obey that prince, whose ancestors have worn out those humors both of hatred and contempt which do commonly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany new raised estates. I will not confirm this last opinion, by the example of <hi>Neptune</hi> the son of <hi>Saturn</hi>; who, although he was lame on both his legs, yet had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the sea allotted to him: but I will confirm it by the practise of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedaemon,</hi> the two eyes of <hi>Graecia,</hi>

                  </gap>; the Law of Nature. Cicero</hi> likewise saith: <hi>the consent of all Nations is to be esteemed the Law of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is to be taken, not as though all Nations have at any time observed one usage alike: it is not necessary saith <hi>Baldus,</hi> that the word <hi>all</hi> should carry so large a sence: neither hath it ever been brought into know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what customs all Nations have held in use. And it is most certain, that there is not one point or precept of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but, by reason, partly of the weakness, partly of the corruption, which the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> did fasten in his posterity, some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have at all times, either neglected or else depraved: some being so dull as they could not perceive, others so malicious as they would deny, that which nature did lay before them Yea, such is either the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or wilfulness of our judgment, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98890:8"/>
they who are not only admitted but admired for wise men, do many times disagree in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining what is most agreeable to nature: much less may we either expect or imagine, that all Nations, so different, so distant, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much as now, and yet not now fully discovered, should jump in one Judgment for uniform observation of any custom: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that no natural Right,<note place="margin">Socrat.</note> as <hi>Zenophon</hi> noteth, which many daily do transgress.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Donellus</hi> did unjustly reject the discription which <hi>Gaius</hi> gave of the Law of Nations,<note place="margin">In com. ju. 6.</note> by taking the word all in the amplest sence.<note place="margin">Ad ephes. 4. Tit.</note> S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and S. <hi>Hierom</hi> did in this sort declare it; that we are to take that for a Decree of Nations, which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively and at times hath been observed by all. But as for any one time, as it is to be judged the decree or custom of a whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which hath passed by consent of the most part, although all have not allowed, and some perhaps have opposed against it;<note place="margin">C 3. de decret. ab ord. fac. l. 32. de legi.</note> so is it to be esteemed the Law of Nations, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of the whole World, which most Nations in the World are found to imbrace.</p>
            <p>And because Government was not from the beginning, but induced as a consequence of the primary Precept of Nature; to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain human Society: therefore whensoever we speak of natural Government, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to mean the secondary Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is the received custom, successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all, and always of most Nations in the World.</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98890:9"/>Out of this we may gather, that three rules do chiefly lead us to the Knowledge of this Law.

               <hi>to appeal vnto sence</hi>: because there is no man but by the light of nature, hath some sence of that which nature doth allow. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>I know not by what conscience we feel these things</hi>: and likewise <hi>Tertullian: Nature hath tainted all Evil ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with fear or shame.</hi> Whereto agreeth that which S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith: <hi>although they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, they cannot but shew some tokens of shame.</hi> Hereupon the authors of the civil Law do reject that for unjust, which is not demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> shew of shame. For, as <hi>Cassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> writeth; <hi>God hath given all men such a sence of justice, that they who know not the Laws, cannot but acknowledge the reason of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But because this light of nature, in many men is exceeding dim; the next rule is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what hath been allowed by those who are of greatest both wisdom and integrity, in whom Nature doth shew her self most clear. For as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith; <hi>that is probable which proved men do approve.</hi> Among these, the first place pertaineth unto them, who by inspiration of God, have compiled the Books of holy Scripture: to whom as attendants we may adjoyn the antient Counsels and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church. The next place is to be given to the Authors of the civil Law; whose Judgment hath been these many hundred Years, admired by many, approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all, and is at this day accepted for Law,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98890:9"/>
almost in all states of the Christian common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. To these also we may adjoyn, as attendants, their interpreters of most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved note. The third place is due to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, Historigraphers, Orators and the like; who have not unprofitably endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to free nature of two clouds, wherewith she is often overcast: gross ignorance, and subtil Error.</p>
            <p>But because natural reason, as <hi>Alciate</hi> affirmeth, doth sometimes vary,<note place="margin">5. consil. 38.</note> according to the capacity of particular men; even as the Sun, being in it self always the same, giveth neither heat nor light to all alike: the third rule followeth,<note place="margin">

               </note> to observe the common Use of all Nations, which <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth; <hi>the voice of Nature</hi>: because as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath written, <hi>it is not done by chance which every where is done. Plato</hi> saith,<note place="margin">8. de legib.</note>

               <hi>I dare not disallow that which the World alloweth.</hi> And in this common Law or Custom of the World, three circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances are to be considered: antiquity, continuance, and generality.</p>

            <p>Your second is also true, for as <hi>Tully</hi> saith,<note place="margin">sine imperio nec domus ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, nec civitas, nec gens, nec hominem uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versum genus stare, nec re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum natura omnis nec ipse denique mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus potest. 3. de legib.</note>

               </note> and yet false. It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to have so large a consent of Nations, as I have declared before: and it is false that in all Times and Nations there have been Magistrates. After the deluge, Magistrates were not known until Kings did arise, as hereafter it shall appear. The Jews were often without either Magistrates or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Whereupon in certain places of the Book of Judges it is thus written:<note place="margin">ca. 17. ver. 6. &amp; ca. vit. in si.</note> 
               <hi>In those days there was no King in Israel, but what seemed right to every man that did he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes <hi>Democratical</hi> Government doth draw to a pure <hi>Anarchie</hi>; and so doth the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnum</hi> of elective principalities. <hi>Leo Afer</hi> reporteth, that in <hi>Guzala,</hi> a country of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick, the people have neither King nor form of Government; but upon days of mart, they elect a Captain to secure their traffick. The same Author delivereth, that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Mountain <hi>Magnan,</hi> upon the frontiers of <hi>Fez,</hi> have no form of common wealth, but do stay travellers (unpartial judges) to decide their controversies. <hi>Leo</hi> himself was arrested to be their judge, and when he had spent many days in determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98890:10"/>
their debates, he was in the end present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with hens, ducks, geese and other of their country commodities, which served only to discharge his host. And if this your reason should be of force then were not sociability natural, because many men have made choice to live alone.</p>
            <p>But how then, will you say, is nature im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable? It is in <hi>abstracto,</hi> but it is not in <hi>subjecto.</hi> Or thus: In it self it is not chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: in us, by reason of our imperfections, it is. Or else more plainly; it is not changed, but it is transgressed. But nature, you say, is alike to all. Not so, good sir, because all are not apt alike to receive her: even as the sun beams do not reflect alike upon a clean and clear glass, and upon a glass that is either fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or course: And in many, not only men, but nations, evil custom hath driven nature out of place, and setteth up it self in stead of nature.<note place="margin">L. si quis post. humo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Your third conclusion, that no particular form of Government is natural, doth not find so easie acceptance. Your only proof is, that if it were otherwise, there should be one form of Government in all Nations; because God and nature is one to all. But this reason I have encountred before: and yet you take pains to puff it up with many wast words; how the Romans changed Government, how in Italy there is, a Pope, a King and many Dukes; how <hi>Millaine, Burgundie, Loraine, Bavier, Gascoine,</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi> the less were changed from Kingdoms to Dukedoms, how
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98890:11"/>
               <hi>Germany</hi> was once under one King, and is now divided among Dukes, Earles, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther supreme Princes; How <hi>Castile, Aragone, Portugall, Barcelona</hi> and other countries in Spain, were first Earldoms, then Dukedoms, then several Kingdoms, and now are united into one; how <hi>Boeme</hi> and <hi>Polonia</hi> were once Dukedoms, and now are Kingdoms; how France was first one Kingdom, then divided into four, and lastly reduced into one. How England was first a Monarchy, under the <hi>Britains,</hi> then a Province under the <hi>Romans,</hi> after that divided into seven Kingdoms, and lastly reduced into one; how the People of <hi>Israel</hi> were first under Patriarcks, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> then under Captains, then under Judges, then under high Priests, then under Kings, and then under Captains and high Priests again.</p>
            <p>I will not follow you in every by way whereinto your errors do lead (for who would have adventured to affirm, that the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were under <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi>; and that the <hi>Britains</hi> at the first were under one King, whereas <hi>Caesar</hi> reporteth that he found four Kings in that Country which is now called <hi>Kent</hi>) but I will only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon the principal point, in regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all this bundel of words is like a blown bladder, full of wind, but of no weight.</p>
            <p>For first you do but trifle upon tearms, in putting a difference between Kings, Dukes, and Earls, which hold their state with Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power. We speak not of the names,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98890:11"/>
but of the Government of Princes. Supreme Rulers may differ in name; they may change name also, either by long use, or upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: and yet in Government neither differ nor change.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is a more vain jeast to put a difference (in this regard) between a great territory and a small. If a Kingdom be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged or streightned in limits, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not thereby changed; if many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms be united into one; if one be divided into many; the nature of Government is no more altered, then is the tenure of land, either when partition is made, or when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts accrewe into one. The knot of doubt is, whether it be not natural, that one state, be it great or small, should rather be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by one person, howsoever intitled, then by many.</p>
            <p>And if we descend into true discourse, we shall find, that the very sinews of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do consist, in commanding and in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But obedience cannot be performed, where the commandments are, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant or uncertain; neither can these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies be any ways avoided, but by union of the Authority which doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>This union is of two sorts; first, when one commandeth; secondly, when many do knit in one power and will. The first union is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; the second is by means of amity, which is the only band of this collective body, and the more they are who joyn in Government,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98890:12"/>
the less natural is their union, and the more subject to dissipation,<note place="margin">Arduum sem per eodem lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci potentiam &amp; concordiam esse .iiii. annal.</note> For as <hi>Taci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Natural reason teacheth us, that all multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude beginneth from one, and the ancient Philosophers have held, that from unity all things do proceed, and are again resolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same.<note place="margin">In principio lib. de vitis sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiisque Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophorum.

            <p>The whole world is nothing but a great state; a state is no other then a great family; and a family no other then a great body.

               <hi>Callimachus</hi> saith, that Kings proceed from God: <hi>Homer</hi> affirmeth, that they are cherished by God.

But what do you mean to acknowledge all this, and yet to deny that Monarchy is natural? do you take it to be above Nature? or how else is it most excellent and perfect? how is it most agreeable to Nature, and yet not natural? can any Action be most agreeable to Justice, and yet not just?

            <p>Let us now take a view of our present age.

            <p>What then shall we say of this so antient, so continual, so general consent of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? what can we say, but conclude with <hi>Tertullian these testimonies, the more true,</hi>

For it is not only lawful but honorable, for any people, either to right or reveng the breach of this Law; against them which contemn it, as monsters; against them who know it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98890:22"/>

            <p>You close your conclusion with this conceit, that the word <hi>natural Prince, or natural Successor,</hi> is to be understood of one, who is born within the same Realm, and that it is ridiculous to take it, as though any Prince had natural Interest to succeed.

            <head>TO THE SECOND CHAPTER, which is intituled,</head>
            <head type="sub">Of the particular Form of Monarchies and Kingdoms, and the different Laws where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are to be obtained, holden and governed in divers Countries, according as each Common-wealth hath chosen and established.</head>
            <p>IN this chapter you spend much speech in praising a monarchie, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it before the Government of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; which you do to no other end, but to insinuate your self either into credit, or advantage to draw it down; even as <hi>Ioab</hi> presented <hi>Amasa</hi> with a kind Kiss, to win thereby opportunity to stab him. For in the end you fetch about, that because a Prince is subject, as other men,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 20. Fol. 21.</note> not only to errours in Judgment, but also to passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affections, in his will; it was necessary, that as the common wealth hath given that great power unto him so it should assigne him helps for managing the same. And that a Prince reciveth his authority from the people, you prove a little before, for that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> termeth Kings <hi>Humane creatures</hi>; which you interpret to be,<note place="margin">Pag. 17. 1. Pet. 2.</note> a thing created by man; because by mans free choise, both this form of government
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98890:24"/>
is erected, and the same also laid upon some particular person.</p>
            <p>I know not in what sort to deal with you, concerning this interpretation. Shall I labour to impugne it by arguments? Why, there is no man that wanteth not either judgment or sincerity, but upon both the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and usual sense of the words, he will presently acknowledg it to be false. Shall I go about either to laugh, or to rail you from your errour, as <hi>Cicero</hi> in the like case perswaded to do? But this would be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neither to the stayedness of our years, nor the gravity of our professions. I am now advised what to do; I will appeal, as <hi>Machetes</hi> did before <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon, from your self asleep, to your self awake; from your self distempered by affection,<note place="margin">Plutarch. in probl.</note> to your self returned to sobriety of sense. Do you think then in true earnest, that a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man creature is a thing created by man, or rather that every man is a humane creature? Is a brutish creature to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a thing created by a beast? <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Angelical,</hi> or any other adjunct unto creature, what reference hath it to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Creation? And if it were so, then should all creatures be called divine, because they were created by God, to whom only it is proper to create; and in this very point,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is the ordinance and institution of God. Neither needeth it to trouble us that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> should so generally injoine us
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98890:24"/>
to be obedient to all men, no more than it troubled the Apostles, when Christ comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to preach to all creatures <note n="(d)" place="margin">Marc. 16.</note>; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which commission, St. <hi>Paul</hi> did testifie <note n="(e)" place="margin">Col. 1.23.</note>, that the Gospel had been prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to every creature under Heaven: but St. <hi>Peter</hi> doth specifie his general speech, and restrain his meaning to Kings and Governors; in which sence St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> 
               <note n="(f)" place="margin">Ad Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xentium.</note> citeth this place, as it followeth: <hi>Be subject to your Lords, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to the King, as to the most excellent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This interpretation not onely not relieving you, but discovering very plainly either the weakness or corruption of your judgment, it resteth upon your bare word, that Kings have received their first Authority from the people; which although I could deny, with as great both countenance and facility as you affirm, yet will I further charge upon you with strength of proof.</p>
            <p>Presently after the inundation of the world, we find no mention of politick Government, but onely of oeconomical, according as men were sorted in families; for so <hi>Moses</hi> hath written <note n="(g)" place="margin">Gen. 10.5.</note>, that of the progeny of <hi>Iapheth,</hi> the Isles of the Gentiles were divided after their families. The first who established Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over many families, was <hi>Nimrod</hi> the Son of <hi>Cush,</hi> accounted by St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> 
               <note n="(h)" place="margin">Hom. in Gen.</note> the first King: which Authority he did not obtain by favour and election of any people, but by plain purchase of his power. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Moses</hi> calleth him a mighty Hunter <note n="(i)" place="margin">Gen. 10.9.</note>,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98890:25"/>
which is a form of speech among the Hebrews, whereby they signifie a spoiler or oppresser. And this doth also appear by the etymology of his name; for <hi>Nimrod</hi> signifieth a Rebel, a Transgressour, and as some interpret it, a terrible Lord: And names were not imposed in ancient times by chance or at adventure, as <hi>Plato</hi>

            <p>Many hold opinion, that this <hi>Nimrod</hi> was the same, whom the Grecians call <hi>Ninus:</hi> which seemeth to be confirmed by that which <hi>Moses</hi> saith <note n="(m)" place="margin">Gen. 10</note>, that he did build the City of <hi>Ninive.</hi> Of this <hi>Ninus, Iustine</hi> writeth <note n="(n)" place="margin">Ninus primus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur bello parta reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From them also <hi>Cyrus</hi> by subversion of <hi>Astyages</hi> did transport it to the Persians; and from them again the Grecians did wrest it by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest. After the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, without any consent of the people, made partition of the Empire among them; whose successors were afterwards subdued by the Armies and Arms of <hi>Rome.</hi> And this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, being the greatest that ever the Earth did bear, was in the end also violently distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, by divers several either Conquests or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts. <hi>Leo Afer</hi> writeth, that it is not a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, since the people of <hi>Gaoga</hi> in <hi>Africk</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:98890:25"/>
had neither King nor Lord, until one obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the greatness and Majesty of the King of <hi>Tombute,</hi> did enterprize to attain Soveraignty above them, which by violence he effected, and left the same to his posterity. And because I will not be tedious in running through parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, give you an instance of any one people, which hath not divers times received both Prince and Government by absolute constraint, <hi>Et Phillida solus habito</hi>; and I will yield to all that you affirm. But failing herein, you shall be enforced to confess, that in many, yea, in most, if not in all Countries, the people have received liberty, either from the grant or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the victorious Prince, and not the Prince authority from the vanquished peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>What helps now do you imagine, that the people have assigned to their Prince?</p>
            <p>The first, you affirm to be the direction of Laws. But it is evident, that in the first heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ages, <gap reason="foreign">

In which verses <hi>Chrysostom</hi> affirmeth <note n="(q)" place="margin">lib. 2. de regno.</note> by the judgment of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that <hi>Homer</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated the perfect Image of a King: but that he maketh mention of any positive Laws, I do rather doubt, than assuredly deny. For Kings in ancient times did give judgment in person, not out of any formality in Law, but onely according to natural equity. <hi>Virgil</hi> saith <note n="(r)" place="margin">Aeneid. 7.</note>:

            <p>But because it grew both troublesome and tedious, for all the People to receive their Right from one man <note n="(y)" place="margin">At cum jus aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile ab uno viro homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes non conseque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventae sunt leges, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. 2.</note>; Laws were inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, and Officers also appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to execute the same.</p>
            <p>Another Original of Laws was thus occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned: When any People were subdued by Arms, Laws were laid like Logs upon their necks, to keep them in more sure subjection; which, both because it is not doubtful, and to avoid prolixity, I will manifest onely by our own example.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Romans</hi> had reduced the best part of this Island into the form of a Province, as they permitted liberty of Law to no other Country under their obedience, so here also they planted the practice of their Laws: and for this purpose they sent over many Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and among others <hi>Papinian,</hi> the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98890:27"/>
both for Knowledge and Integrity, of all the Authors of the Civil Law. Again, when the <hi>Saxons</hi> had forced this Realm, and parted it into seven Kingdoms, they erected so many sets of Law; of which onely two were of continuance, the <hi>Mercian</hi> Law, and the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Law. After these, the <hi>Danes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came victorious; and by these new Lords new Laws were also imposed, which bare the name of <hi>Dane-law.</hi> Out of these three Laws, partly moderated, partly supplied, King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Confessor composed that body of Law, which afterwards was called St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws. Lastly, the <hi>Normans</hi> brought the Land under their power, by whom St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws were abrogated, and not onely new Laws, but new Language brought into use; insomuch as all Pleas were formed in French, and in the same Tongue Children were taught the principles of Grammar. These causes we find of the beginning of Laws; but that they were assigned by the people for assistance and direction to their Kings, you bring neither Argument nor Authority for proof; it is a part of the dross of your own device.</p>
            <p>The second help, which you affirm that Commonwealths have assigned to their Kings, is by Parliaments and Privy-Councils. But Parliaments in all places have been erected by Kings; as the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> and of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> which our Historiographers do take for the first Parliament in <hi>England</hi>; affirming that the Kings, before that time, did never call the common People to Councel. After this the Privy-Council, at the instance of the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was also established; and since that time, the Counsellors of State have always been placed by election of the Prince. And that it was so likewise in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times, it appeareth by that which <hi>Homer</hi> writeth:

these were Titular Kings, having no other power but a single voice among the Senators: and because all Affairs were carried by consent of the People, the Estate was then esteemed popular.

            <p>Concerning his end, <hi>Livy</hi> writeth, that in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king muster of his Army, a thick Tempest did arise, after which he was never seen; wherein he is seconded by <hi>Solinus, Eutropius,</hi> and the rest: onely <hi>Livy</hi> addeth, that there was a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, but very obscure, without any certain either Author or ground; I will adde also, without probability, that he was torn in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for how probable is it, that such a Fact, in the open view of his Army, could be very obscure? How probable is it also, that the People would first tear him in pieces for his Injustice, and then worship him for a God? Further, with what either confidence or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit do you alledge this Report of <hi>Livy,</hi> for his opinion? I find your fetch; you apprehend every thing which may, if not confirm, yet countenance that Doctrine which lately you have drawn out of <hi>Cerberus</hi> Den, That it is lawful to contrive the death of Kings.</p>
            <p>That the People were grieved against <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Tullius</hi> for reigning without Election, it is a meer Fantasie, a Dream, a Device. <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> saith <note n="(f)" place="margin">Tanto consensu quanto haud quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam alius ante Rex est decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus.</note>, that he was declared King with such a Consent as no man had been before him.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Tarquinius</hi> neglected the Laws of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment prescribed to him by the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, it is an ugly untruth. <hi>Livy</hi> saith, that he brake the ancient manner of Kings before
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98890:29"/>
him: But for Laws, <hi>Pomponius</hi> affirmeth <note n="(g)" place="margin">In l. 2. D. de orig. jur.</note>, that at that time the <hi>Romans</hi> had no Laws but from their Kings, and that <hi>Sextus Papirius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them into one Volume, which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Civil Law of <hi>Papirius</hi> 
               <note n="(h)" place="margin">Jus ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianum.</note>; and that when the People expelled their Kings, they abrogated their Laws also, and remained twenty years without any Law.</p>
            <p>Lastly, you adde, that the <hi>Romans</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel their Kings, and erect Consuls in their stead; but you suppress that which followed, which I hold for a common consequence of the like disorder: First, that for this cause they were presently almost overwhelmed with Wars: Secondly, that in this state they never enjoyed long time free from Sedition: Lastly, that as <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith <note n="(i)" place="margin">Nullum esse discor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantis pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, quam ut ab uno re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geretur. Annal. 1.</note>, there was no means to appease these Tumults, but by returning to a Monarchy again. All this I write, rather to manifest the manner of your dealing, than that I hold it much regardable what <hi>Romans</hi> did.</p>
            <p>Your Examples of our present Age I will wrap up in these few words: All Nations, very few excepted, do consent in this form of Government; first, to be under one Prince; secondly, to accept him by succession, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to propinquity of Bloud: In other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, either for inaugurating their Prince, or for the manner of managing and executing his Government, not two Nations in the world in all points do agree. And yet is not this diversity raised by any Laws which the People do prescribe unto their Prince, as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98890:30"/>
you do most grosly, yea peevishly, yea malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously affirm; but by the particular Laws and Customs of every Nation, in which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Prince, either secret or express, sometimes onely is sufficient, always princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally doth concur.</p>
            <p>Upon this diversity of Customs you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it sufficeth not to alleadge bare propinquity of Bloud. What, not where that Custom is established, as I have declared it to be in most Nations of the World? Doth difference of Customs make all Custom void? Doth diversity of Custom in some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces take away the principal Custom of Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion by Bloud? This cleaveth together no su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer than Sand; you lose both labour and credit in obtruding unto us these weak and loose Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, without either force of Reason, or form of Art.</p>
            <p>Your instance of the Law Salick in <hi>France,</hi> doth offer occasion to enter into a large Field, wherein I could plainly prove, that there was never any such Law made to bind the descent of the Crown of <hi>France</hi>; and that it hath been the custom in most parts of the world, not to exclude Women from succession in State: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as <hi>Beda</hi> 
               <note n="(k)" place="margin">In Act. cap. 8.</note> and before him <hi>Eusebius</hi> 
               <note n="(l)" place="margin">Lib 2. cap. 1.</note> and <hi>Pliny</hi> 
               <note n="(m)" place="margin">Lib. 6. c. 29, &amp; 30.</note> do write, that certain People were governed onely by Princes of that Sex. But because this is a matter both of long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and not proper to our purpose, I will contain my self within this Observation, That the Exclusion of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third from the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> upon this pretence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:98890:30"/>
was the cause of the effusion of their bravest Bloud, and of the spoil, waste, and conquest of all that Realm. I acknowledge that the <hi>English</hi> have lost the possession of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; and that was by means of domestical Wars, for excluding the nearest in Bloud from the Crown: into which unquiet Quarrel you do now endeavour again to embark us. Yet no man can assure that the miseries of <hi>France</hi> for this cause are at an end. Rams recoil to strike harder; we are gone rather back than away: I will not presage, but any man may conjecture, that our minds and our means will not always want the favour of time.</p>
            <p>After all this, you proceed a degree further, that it is lawful, upon just considerations, not onely to put back the next Inheritor of the Crown, but also to remove him who is in full possession thereof. And that is plain (you say) not onely by the grounds before by you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, but also by example of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi>; and because God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly concurred in such judicial actions of the State, not onely in prospering them, but in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them also some notable Successour. And yet you protest you are far from their opinion, who upon every mislike are ready to band a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Prince; and that you esteem the tenure of a Crown, if once it be setled, the most irregular, whereto every man is bound to settle his Conscience, without examination of Title or Interest; but onely by the supreme Law of Gods disposition, who can dispence in what he listeth: and that notwithstanding

you are as far from the abject flattery of <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laie</hi> and others; who affirm, that Princes are subject to no Law or limitation at all, and that they succeeded by nature and birth onely, and not by admission of the people; and that there is no authority under God to chasten them. These you call absurd Paradoxes; and herewith you settle your self to shew in the next Chapter, what good success hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued the disposition of Princes.</p>
            <p>Concerning your protestation, we may say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you as <hi>Isaac</hi> said to his son <hi>Iacob</hi> 
               <note n="(n)" place="margin">Gen. 27.22.</note>, <hi>The voice is</hi> Jacobs <hi>voice, but the hands are the hands of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau: You speak fair, and therewith also well; but the main drift of your discourse, is nothing else but a tempestuous Doctrine of Rebellion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd Disorder; you being therein like the Boatman, who looketh one way and pulleth another; or rather like the Image of <hi>Ianus,</hi> which looked two contrary ways at once. It is a Rule in Law; That a Protestation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a mans Act, will not serve to relieve him <note n="(o)" place="margin">Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statio actui contraria non rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat.</note> only this shall serve to convince you, either of false or of forgetful dealing, when we come to that place where in flat words you maintain the contrary.</p>
            <p>Concerning the quarrel which you lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Billaie</hi>; as I have not seen what he hath written, so will I not interpose between him and you. I never heard of Christian Prince who challenged Infinite Authority without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of any Law, either Natural or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. But where you term it an absurd para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, that the people should not have power to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98890:31"/>
chasten their Prince, and upon just conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to remove him; I am content to joyn with you upon the issue.</p>
            <p>And first I note the manner of your dealing, in that you have omitted to express what these just considerations may be. For seeing there hath been no King, who is not noted of some defects; and again, no Tyrant, who hath not many commendable parts (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth <note n="(p)" place="margin">In Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys.</note> that <hi>Dionysius</hi> excelled most Princes in divers points of Justice and Vertue) it is a matter of dangerous consequence, to leave these considerations undetermined and at large. But who seeth not, that you do it out of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that you may upon every particular occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, declare such causes to be sufficient as you please?</p>
            <p>How then do you prove, that upon any cause, the people have power to dispossess their Prince? This is plain (you say) not onely by the grounds before by you alleadged, but also by example of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Graecians.</hi> The grounds by you alleadged, are two: One in your first Chapter, that because no one form of Government is natural, the people have power both to choose, and to change, and to limit it as they please. The other ground is in this Chapter; that because there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Laws and Customs in matters of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, it sufficeth not to alleage bare proinqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of bloud.</p>
            <p>Why? but had you no Text of Scripture? no Father of the Church to alledge? no Law? no Reason? no better Example? no surer
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98890:32"/>
Ground? It is more than this which you bring against your self, in citing out of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 
               <note n="(q)" place="margin">2. c. 10.</note>; <hi>The Lord knoweth to reserve the unjust unto the day of Iudgment; and especially them that despise Government, and speak evil of those that are in Dignity.</hi> And out of St. <hi>Iude</hi> 
               <note n="(r)" place="margin">vers. 8.</note>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Likewise these dreamers despise Government, and speak evil of them that are in Authority.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides also, you have alledged out of St. <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note n="(s)" place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>: <hi>Let every soul be subject unto the higher power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for there is no power but of God: Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves judgment.</hi> And likewise out of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 
               <note n="(t)" place="margin">c. 2. v. 13.</note>: <hi>Submit your selves to every humane creature, whether it be to the King, or unto Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; for so is the will of God.</hi> To which places we may likewise add that, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> did write unto <hi>Titus</hi> 
               <note n="(u)" place="margin">Tit. 3.1.</note>: <hi>Put them in remembrance that they be obedient to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and powers.</hi> And writing to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.1.</note>, he exhorteth us also to pray for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we may lead under them a peaceable life.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you will say, that the Apostles did not mean this of wicked Princes. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fler, the Apostles spake generally of all: St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> 
               <note n="(x)" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.18.</note> maketh express mention of evil Lords. And what Princes have ever been more either irreligious or tyrannical, than <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligula, Tiberius, Nero,</hi> the infamy of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, under whose Empire the Apostles did both live and write?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the great master of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98890:32"/>
perceiving this to be unanswerably true, did in another sort rather cut than unty the knot: affirming, <note n="(y)" place="margin">In tract. de exemp. Clerico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> that at that time it was necessary to admonish the Christians to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form obedience to their Kings, lest the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel might otherwise be hindred: which is as if in direct terms he should have said, Sir Kings, whilst our heads were under your girdle, we were content to curry favour, by preaching obedience unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: But now we have got the wind of you, we must plainly tell you, that you hold your Crowns at their courtesie and favour; and have no power in effect, but as Lieutenant-Generals. I know you will make a sour face at this; it will go very much against your sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs; but there is no remedy, you must take it down; they are your good Lords; they may dispossess you.</p>
            <p>Prophane <hi>Bellarmine!</hi> is Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mere policy? doth it apply it self onely to the present? doth it turn always with the time? May the principal professors thereof say, as an infidel Moor did, when he violated the Faith which he had given unto Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? <hi>We have no bone in our tongues that we cannot turn them which way we please.</hi> We see plainly that you say so: and it as is plain, that it was far from the true meaning of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. St. <hi>Iude</hi> 
               <note n="(z)" place="margin">ver. 16.</note> writeth sharply against those, who had mens persons in admiration <hi>because of advantage.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> also saith <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 1.10.</note>: <hi>Go I about to please men? If I should please men, I were not then the servant of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:98890:33"/>I will give you an example of another time. <hi>Nebuchadnezzer</hi> King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted all <hi>Palestina</hi>; took <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> slew the King, burnt the Temple, took away the holy Vessels and Treasure: the residue he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the cruelty and syoyl of his unmerciful Souldiers; who defiled all places with rape, ruine, and blood. After the glut of this but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, the people which remained, he led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> and there commanded, that whosoever refused to worship his golden I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, should be cast into a fiery furnace.</p>
            <p>What cruelty, what impiety is comparable to this? and yet the Prophets <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">c. 29.7.</note> and <hi>Baruch</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">c. 1.11.</note> did write to those captive Jews, to pray for the prosperity and life of him, and of <hi>Baltazar</hi> his Son, that their days might be upon Earth as the days of Heaven: and <hi>Ezekiel</hi>

What answer will you make to this example? I am wisely busied to cast forth this question; what answer can you make, which your own knowledge will not convince?</p>
            <p>Many other places there are in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby not onely our actions are tied to obedience: <hi>He that doth presumptuously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Ruler of the people shall die</hi>

            <p>Neither was the Devil ever able, until in late declining times, to possess the hearts of Christians with these cursed Opinions, which do evermore beget a world of Murders, Rapes, Ruines, and Desolations.

King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third did against their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons? What if other Princes, whom it doth concern, as well in honour, to see the Law of Nations observed, as also in policy, to break those proceedings which may form Presidents against themselves, do adjoyn to the side? What if whilst the Prince and the People are (as was the Frog and the Mouse) in the heat of their Encounter, some other Potentate play the Kite with them both, as the <hi>Turk</hi> did with the <hi>Hungarians?</hi> Is it not then a fine piece of policy which you do plot? or is it not a gross errour to raise these dangers, and to leave the defence to possibilities doubtful?</p>
            <p>Go to, Sirs, go to, there is no Christian Country which hath not by your devices been wrapped in Wars. You have set the Empire on float with Bloud; your Fires in <hi>France</hi> are not yet extinguished; in <hi>Polonia</hi> and all those large Countries, extending from the North to the East, you have caused of late more Battels to be fought, than had been in five hundred years before. Your practices have heretofore prevailed against us: of late years you have busied your selves in no one thing more, than how to set other Christian Princes on our necks; stirring up such store of Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, as, like the Grashoppers of <hi>Egypt</hi> 
               <note n="(g)" place="margin">Exod. 10.</note> might fill our houses, and cover our whole land, and make more doubt of room than of resistance.

            <head type="sub">Of the great Reverence and respect due to Kings, and yet how divers of them have been lawfully chastised by their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths for their misgovernment; and of the good and prosperous success that God commonly hath given to the same, and much more to the putting back of an unworthy Pretender.</head>
            <p>THat Princes may be chastised by their Subjects, your proofs are two: One is drawn from certain Examples; the other from the good success and Successors which usually have followed. Surely it cannot be but that you stand in a strong conceit either of the authority of your Word, or simplicity of our Judgment; otherwise you could not be perswaded by these slender Threads to draw any man to your Opinion. Of the force of Examples I have spoken before; there is no Villany so vile which wanteth example: and yet most of the Examples which you do bring, are either false, or else impertinent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>For there have been divers States, wherein one hath born the name and title of King, without power of Majesty. As the <hi>Romans</hi> in the time of their Consular Estate had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98890:37"/>
a Priest, whom they entitled King, whose office consisted in certain Ceremonies and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, which in former times could not be performed but by their Kings. Likewise the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> after <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had formed their Government, retained two Kings, who had no greater stroke in matters of State, than a single Voice as other Senators. Such were in <hi>Caesars</hi> time many petty Kings of <hi>Gaul,</hi> who (as <hi>Ambiorix</hi> King of <hi>Leige</hi> confessed) were subject to their Nobility, and questionable by them. Such are now the Emperours of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> because the Puissance and Majesty of the Empire pertaineth to the States, who are sworn to the Empire it self, and not to the person of the Emperour. Such are also the Dukes of <hi>Venice,</hi> the Soveraignty of which State is setled in the Gentlemen. In these and such-like Governments, the Prince is not Soverain, but subject to that part of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth which retaineth the Royalty and Majesty of State, whether it be the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Common People: and therefore your Examples drawn from them, is nothing to our purpose.</p>
            <p>Concerning success, it cannot be strange unto you, that by the secret, yet just Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, divers evil actions are carried with appearance of good success. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> said, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Psal. 73.</note> that his treadings had almost slip't, by seeing the wicked to flourish in prosperity: The Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Ca. 12.1.</note> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also to stagger upon this point; and it hath always been a dangerous stone in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98890:37"/>
way of the Godly, whereat many have stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and some fallen.</p>
            <p>Besides, it ordinarily happeneth that good Princes succeed Tyrants; partly because they are so indeed, as being instructed to a better manage of Government, both by the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life of their Predecessors, and by the ugly infamy which remaineth after their death: partly because by means of the Comparison they both seem and are reported to be far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they are. Hereupon <hi>Lampridius</hi> saith of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">In Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xand.</note> 
               <hi>I may also say, that</hi> Alexander <hi>was a good Prince by fear, for that</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liogabalus <hi>his Predecessor was both an evil Prince, and also massacred and slain.</hi> Seeing therefore the reason is so manifest, wherefore good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces should succeed Tyrants, is it not rashness? is it not impudence? is it not impiety for us to wade with unclean feet into God's secret Counsels, unknown to the Angels, and to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie upon this event the Parricide of any Prince? For my part, I know not whether you shew your self more presumptuous in entering into this observation, or in pursuing it more idle and impure.</p>
            <p>I will pass over your protestation of Respect and Obedience due unto Princes: Protest what you please, we will take you for no other than a vile kind of vermine, which, if it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to creep into the bowels of any State, will gnaw the Heart-strings thereof in sunder. This you manifest by the coarse comparison which presently you annex, that as a natural Body hath authority to cure the Head if it be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98890:38"/>
out of tune, and reason to cut it off oftentimes, if it were able to take another; so a body Politick hath power to cure or cut off the Head, if it be unsound. But what either Will or Power hath any part of the Body in it self? What either Sense for the one, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the other, which proceedeth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together from the Head? Where is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son seated which you attribute to the Body, both in judging and curing the infirmities of the Head? Certain it is, that in your cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-cure you deal like a foolish Physician, who finding a Body half taken and benumb'd with a Palsie, cutteth off that part to cure the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so make sure to destroy both. You suppose, belike, that to enter into greater pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, is the onely remedy of present Dangers. I omit to press many points of this Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison against you, because Comparisons do serve rather to illustrate than enforce: and I know not what assertion you might not easily make good, if such senceless prating might go for proof.</p>
            <p>I come now to your particular Examples, whereof the first is of King <hi>Saul</hi>; whom you affirm to be deprived and put to death for his disobedience. <hi>Saul deprived and put to death?</hi> I never heard that any of his Subjects did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lift up one thought against him. Drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, you will say, he was slain by the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines: Good, but who deprived him? It was God (you say) who did deprive him. You must pardon us, if upon the suddain we do not conceive the mystery of your meaning:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98890:38"/>
Your words of deprivation and putting to death, do rather import a judicial proceeding against him, than that God delivered him to be vanquished by his Enemies in the Field. But what is this to dispossessing by Subjects? Yes, you say, because whatsoever God hath put in ure in his Commonwealth, may be practised by others. Why, but then also good Princes may be deposed by their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, because God delivered <hi>Iosiah</hi> to be slain by the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You Firebrands of Strife, you Trumpets of Sedition, you Red Horses whose sitters have taken peace from the Earth <note n="(d)" place="margin">Apoc. 6.4.</note>, how impudently do you abuse the Scriptures? how do you defile them with your filthy Fingers? It is most certain, that <hi>David</hi> knew, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Samuel</hi> told him, and because he had the Spirit of Prophesie, that God had reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Saul,</hi> and designed him to be King in his place: yet his Doctrine was always, not to touch the Lords Anointed, <note n="(e)" place="margin">Ps. 105. 1. reg. 24.</note> whereto his Actions were also answerable: For when <hi>Saul</hi> did most violently persecute him, he defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himself no otherwise than by Flight. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this pursuit, <hi>Saul</hi> fell twice into his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; once he did not onely spare, but protect him, and rebuke the Pretorian Soldiers for their negligent watch: The other time his Heart did smite him, for that he had cut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the lap of his garment. Lastly, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Messenger to be slain, who upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and for pity, had furthered (as he said) the death of that sacred King. We have a
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98890:39"/>
Precept of Obedience, which is the mould wherein we ought to fashion our actions. God onely is superiour to Princes, who useth many instruments in the execution of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, but his authority he hath committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to none.</p>
            <p>Your second Example is of King <hi>Amon,</hi> who was slain (as you write) by his own people, because he walked not in the ways of the Lord. This is somewhat indeed, if it be true; let us turn to the Text: <note n="(f)" place="margin">4 reg. 21.</note> 
               <hi>Amon was twenty two years old when be began to reign, &amp;c. and he did evil in the sight of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his house; and the people smote all those who conspired against King</hi> Amon, <hi>and made</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah <hi>his son King in his stead.</hi> But this is very different from that which you report. <hi>Amon</hi> was slain by his Servants, and not by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; who were so far from working, that they severely revenged his death. And although <hi>Amon</hi> was evil, yet the Scripture layeth not his evil for the motive whereupon his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants slew him. The Devil himself in allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Scripture, used more honesty and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity (if I may so term it) than you: For he cited the very words, wresting them onely to a crooked sence; but you change the words of the Scripture: you counterfeit God's coyn; you corrupt the Records which he hath left us. I will now shake off all respect of civility to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, and tell you in flat and open terms, that as one part of your Assertion is true, that good Kings succeeded <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Amon</hi>; so
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98890:39"/>
the other part, that either they were, or in right could have been deprived and put to death by their Subjects, it is a sacrilegious, a loggerheaded lye.</p>
            <p>Of your Example of <hi>Romulus</hi> I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before. I have declared also how the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> presently after the expelling of their Kings, and for that cause, were almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with the weight of War, being bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten home to the very Gates of their City. And had not <hi>Chocles</hi> by a miracle of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood sustained the shock of the Enemies, whilst a Bridg was broken behind him, the Town had been entred, and their State ruined. And whereas you attribute the inlargement of the Empire, which hapned many Ages after, to this expelling of their Kings, you might as well have said, that the rebellion against King <hi>Iohn</hi> was the cause of the Victories which we have since had in <hi>France.</hi> I have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the state of the <hi>Romans</hi> under their Consuls, was popular rather in shew, than in deed: This shew began also to end, when by the Law <hi>Valeria,</hi> L. <hi>Sylla</hi> was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Dictator for four and twenty years. After this, the Empire did mightily increase, until the reign of <hi>Trajane</hi>; at which time all Authors agree that it was most large; and yet far short of your wandring Survey, not half Fifteen thousand miles in compass.</p>
            <p>In your Example of <hi>Caesar,</hi> I never saw more untruths crowded together in fewer words: you say he broke all Laws both Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and Divine: that is one; his greatest
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98890:40"/>
Enemies did give of him a most honourable testimony. You say he took all Government into his hands alone: that is two; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the Law <hi>Servia</hi> elected him perpetual Dictator. You make his death to be an act of the State: that is three; for they who slew him, were both declared and pursued by Decree of the State for publick Enemies; of whom, not any one, either died a natural death, or lived three years after: it was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decreed, that the Court where he was slain should be stopped up, that the Ides of March should be called <hi>parricidium,</hi> and that the Senate should never be assembled upon that day. You say that <hi>Augustus</hi> was preferred in his place: that is four; and all within the compass of six Lines. <hi>Augustus</hi> was never chosen Dictator; <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth <note n="(g)" place="margin">In Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusto. ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu nixus dictaturam deprecatus est.</note> that he entreated the people upon his knee, not to charge him with that Office. But <hi>Augustus, Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus</hi> did first knit in Arms by the name of <hi>Triumviri,</hi> to revenge the death of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>; whereupon a long cruel and doubtful War was set up, which continued the space of twenty years: first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these three and the Murtherers of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>; then between <hi>Lepidus</hi> and the other two: lastly between <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Antonius:</hi> and this was the sweet success of the murther of <hi>Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus,</hi> after his Victory was made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Tribune, as <hi>Suetonius</hi> hath written. <hi>Dio</hi> saith, <note n="(i)" place="margin">In Aug. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But where you bring the Succession of <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian</hi> as a good success of this Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Nero,</hi> it is a wild and witless untruth. <hi>Galba</hi> succeeded next after <hi>Nero,</hi> who was slain in a sedition raised by <hi>Otho. Otho</hi> again was overcome in field by <hi>Vitellius</hi>; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he slew himself. Lastly, <hi>Vitellius</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and slain by the Captains of <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi> who was the fourth Emperour after <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro.</hi> These Intestine Wars, these open Battles fought to the full, this slaughter of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, which you term Interludes, were the immediate success after the death of <hi>Nero.</hi> You Fiends of Hell, whose Voices are Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Thunder, whose breathing is nothing but Sword, Fire, Rages, and Rebellions: the encountring of Armies, the butchery of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of men, the Massacre of Princes, you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Interludes: These are your pleasures; these your recreations. I hope all Christian-Commonwealths will bear an eye over your inclination, and keep out both your persons and perswasions, from turning their State
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98890:41"/>
into an open Stage for the acting of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terludes.</p>
            <p>You continue your base boldness in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Senate procured the death of <hi>Domitian</hi>; that they requested the Souldiers to kill <hi>Heliogabalus</hi>; that they invited <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> to come and do justice upon <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xentius:</hi> this broken kind of disguising is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar unto you, to make such violences as have often prevailed against excellent Princes, to seem to be the act of the whole State. And whereas you bring the succession of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander Severus</hi> for a good success of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> being the rarest Prince (you say) that ever the <hi>Romans</hi> had, you might have alleadged any Author in proof thereof better than <hi>Herodian,</hi> who writeth of him in this manner. <note n="(m)" place="margin">lib. 6</note>

By this we may see that you go blindfold, being so far from caring, that many times you scarce know what you write.</p>
            <p>Your markable Example (as you term it) of the change of the Empire, from the West to the East; from <hi>Constantine</hi> the sixth, to <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> doth mark out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more unto us than your soundred judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The question is not what one forrain
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98890:41"/>
Prince may do against another, but what Subjects may do against their Soveraign? This is the point of controversie; here you must close, and not traverse about in discourses impertinent.</p>
            <p>The change of the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Childeric</hi> to <hi>Pepin,</hi> your own Author <hi>Girard</hi> 
               <note n="(n)" place="margin">lib. 1. de l'state de France.</note> affirmeth to be both an ambitious and fraudulent usurpation, wherein <hi>Pepin</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the reverence of Religion as a Mantle to cover his Impiety and Rebellion. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which he objected against <hi>Childerick</hi> were two: First, his insufficiency, the ordinary pretence of most Rebellions; but <hi>Girard</hi> saith <note n="(o)" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> that the ancient custom of the French was, to love and honour their Kings, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sufficient or unable, worthy or weak; and that the name of King was esteemed sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred by whomsoever it was born. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he objected, that his Subjects were condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally sworn unto him: and this also <hi>Girard</hi> writeth to be a forced and cautelous interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, violently streining the words of their Oath to his advantage; and indeed, if the Oath of the people had been conditional, what needed they to procure a Dispensation for the same? This was the first act (saith he) whereby the Popes took occasion to set in their foot of Authority for transporting of Kingdoms from one Race to another: which growing to strength, hath filled all Christian Countries with confusion and tumult.</p>
            <p>Likewise, the change of that Kingdom from the Line of <hi>Pepin</hi> to the Line of <hi>Capet,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:98890:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was a meer violence and intrusion, and so it was acknowledged by <hi>Endes</hi> Earl of <hi>Paris,</hi> the first of that Family who did usurp <note n="(p)" place="margin">Girard fo. 52.</note>: and for that cause he was constrained after two years reign to quit the Crown, and to give place unto <hi>Charles</hi> the lawful Heir.

            <p>The History of <hi>Alphonso,</hi> another of your Examples, standeth thus. <hi>Alphonso</hi> had a son call'd <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who died during the life of his father, and left two young sons behind him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> his younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98890:42"/>
               <hi>Sancho</hi> practised with D. <hi>Lope Diaz de Haro</hi> Lord of <hi>Biscay,</hi> to procure him to be advanced to the succession of the Kingdom, before his Nephews. D. <hi>Lope</hi> undertook the devise; and drawing some other of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to the party, they so wrought with the King, that in an Assembly of the States at <hi>Segovia, Sancho</hi> was declared Successor, and the Children of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> appointed to be kept in Prison. But <hi>Sancho,</hi> either impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to linger in expectation, or suspitious that his Father grew inclinable towards his Nephews, made a League with <hi>Mahomed Mir</hi> King of <hi>Granado,</hi> a Moor; by whose aid, and by the Nobility of his Faction, he caused himself to be declared King. Hereupon <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso</hi> was enforced to crave assistance of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Aben Ioseph</hi> King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> who before had been an Enemy to <hi>Alphonso:</hi> but upon detestation of his unnatural Rebellion, he sent Forces to him, protesting notwithstanding, that so soon as the War should be ended, he would become his Enemy again. So <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so</hi> by help, partly of the <hi>Morocco</hi> Moors, and partly of his Subjects which remained loyal, maintained against his son both his Title and State during his life; but not without extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of bloodshed, and opportunity for the Moors, being assistant to both parties, to make themselves more strong within the Countries of Spain. For this cause <hi>Alphonso</hi> disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his son by his Testament, and cast a cruel curse upon him and his Posterity: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it was ordained in an Assembly of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98890:43"/>
States holden at <hi>Tero,</hi> that the Children of the elder Brother deceased, should be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Uncle.</p>
            <p>How then will you verifie your two points by this History? First, that <hi>Alphonso</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived by a publick Act of Parliament: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that it turned to the great Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the State. It is not a million of <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> that are sufficient to satisfie for all your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful and malicious untruths. I marvel how the Rebellion of <hi>Absolon</hi> against King <hi>David</hi> his Father escaped you: Oh, it wanted suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; and you could not easily disguise the Report.</p>
            <p>You write, that the Commonwealth of <hi>Spain</hi> resolving to depose Don <hi>Pedro</hi> the cruel, sent for his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> and required him to bring a strength of <hi>Frenchmen</hi> with him: But hereby you make it plain, that the Commonwealth was not fully agreed. The truth is, that this was a dangerous divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the State between two Concurrents; some holding for <hi>Henry,</hi> and some for <hi>Pedro<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Henry</hi> obtained forraign Assistance by the <hi>French; Pedro</hi> by the <hi>English.</hi> In the mean time, whilst <hi>Peter</hi> was thrown out of State by the Forces of <hi>France,</hi> and after that <hi>Henry</hi> by the Arms of <hi>England</hi>; and again <hi>Peter</hi> deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted both from dignity and life; the poor Country became a Spectacle for one of your Enterludes.</p>
            <p>Your Example of Don <hi>Sancho Capello</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> containeth many intollerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths: for neither was he deprived of his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98890:43"/>
dignity, neither did the Pope and Council of <hi>Lions</hi> give either authority or consent that he should be deprived; neither was he driven out of his Realm into <hi>Castilla</hi>; neither died he in banishment; neither was <hi>Alphonso</hi> his Brother King during his li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e. These five un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths you huddle into one heap. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Lions</hi> wholly opposed against the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Don <hi>Sancho,</hi> notwithstanding many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abilities were objected against him: in regard whereof they gave direction, that <hi>Alphonso</hi> his Brother should be Regent of the Realm; as in that case it is both usual and fit. But <hi>Sancho</hi> taking this to dislike, did seek Aid of the King of <hi>Castile,</hi> and in that pursuit ended his life without Issue: whereby the right of Succession devolved to <hi>Alphonso.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To your Examples of Greek Emperours <note n="(r)" place="margin">c. 5. p. 84.</note> I will answer by your words, which are, That for the most part they came not orderly to the Crown, but many times the means thereof were tribulent and seditious.</p>
            <p>The deposing of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> I acknowledge to be both true and just; I have nothing to except against it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the Crown of <hi>France</hi> did descend unto him, he forsook <hi>Polonia,</hi> and refused to return again to that swaggering Government; whereupon they did depose him. Give us the like case, and you shall be allowed the like proceeding; but you esteem your Examples by tale, and not by touch: being not much unlike a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mad Fellow in <hi>Athens,</hi> who imagined e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Ship which was brought into the Haven
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98890:44"/>
to be his: For whatsoever you find of a King deposed, you lay claim unto it, as both lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, and pertaining to your purpose; whereas one of these doth always fail.</p>
            <p>Concerning your two Examples, one of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the other of <hi>Denmark,</hi> I shall have occasion to speak hereafter. The Nobility of those Countries pretend that their Kings are not Soveraign, but that the power in highest matters of State pertaineth unto them. If it be thus, the Examples are not appliable to the Question; if it be otherwise, then the Princes had wrong.</p>
            <p>We are now come to our domestical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; the first whereof is that of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was deposed by the Pope, you say at the suit of his own people. All this people was the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi>; at whose complaint, the Pope did write to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> that he should expel King <hi>Iohn</hi> out of his Realm. If not Conscience, if not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Honesty, pure Shame should have drawn you to another form of writing. He was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so deprived (you say) afterwards by his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>avy Beast, call you this a Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? The Commons were never called to consent; the Clergy were so opposite to those that stood in Arms against King <hi>Iohn,</hi> that they procured Excommunication against them; first, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>lity, which is onely the third State of the Realm, I make no doubt but some reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98890:44"/>
themselves to be guided by success; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and namely the Earls of <hi>Warren, Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, Chester, Pembrooke, Ferrers, Salisbury,</hi> and divers Barons did openly adhere unto King <hi>Iohn:</hi> You may as well call any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion a Deprivation, as affirm that the rest either did or might deprive him. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you bring in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third as a most worthy Successor after this Deprivation, I will derogate nothing from his worthiness; but there was never King in <hi>England,</hi> who without concurrent in the Title of the Crown, did draw more bloud out of the sides of his Subjects.</p>
            <p>Your second Example is of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, whom many of our Histories re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be of a good and courteous nature, and not unlearned; imputing his defects rather to Fortune, than either to counsel or carriage of his Affairs. His Deposition was a violent fury, led by a Wife both cruel and unchast; and can with no better countenance of right be justified, than may his lamentable both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities and death which thereupon did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue. And although the Nobility, by submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselves to the government of his Son, did break those occasions of Wars which do usually rise upon such Disorders, yet did not the hand of God forget to pursue revenge: For albeit King <hi>Edward</hi> his Son enjoyed both a long and prosperous Reign, yet his next Successor King <hi>Richard</hi> the second, was in the like violent manner imprisoned, deprived, and put to death. I will prosecute the successive
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98890:45"/>
revenge which hereof also ensued, being a strange matter, and worthy to be rung into the ears of all Ages. King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, by whom King <hi>Richard</hi> was deposed, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise the chiefest Acts of his Reign in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting those who conspired with him against King <hi>Richard.</hi> His Son had his Vertue well seconded by Felicity; during whose Reign, by means of the Wars in <hi>France,</hi> the humour against him was otherwise employed and spent: but his next Successor King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, was in the very like manner deprived, and together with his young Son <hi>Edward,</hi> imprisoned and put to death by King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth. This <hi>Edward</hi> died not without suspicion of poyson; and after his death his two Sons were in like manner disinherited, imprisoned, and murthered by their cruel Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi>; who being both a Tyrant and Usurper, was justly encountred and slain by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh in the field. So infallible is the Law of Justice in revenging Cruelties and Wrongs, not always observing the presence of times wherein they are done, but often calling them into reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Offenders retain least memory of them.</p>
            <p>Likewise the deposition of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second was a tempestuous Rage, neither led nor restrained by any Rules of Reason or of State; not suddenly raised and at once, but by very cunning and artificial degrees. But examine his actions without distempred judgment, and you will not condemn him to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98890:45"/>
be exceeding either insufficient or evil: weigh the Imputations that were objected against him, and you shall find nothing either of any truth or of great moment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hollingshead</hi> writeth <note n="(s)" place="margin">In Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard 2.</note>, that he was most unthankfully used by his Subjects; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, through the frailty of his youth, he demeaned himself more dissolutely than was agreeable to the Royalty of his estate, yet in no Kings days the Commons were in greater wealth, the Nobility more honoured, and the Clergy less wronged: who notwithstanding in the evil-guided strength of their Will took head against him, to their own headlong-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction afterward: partly during the Reign of King <hi>Henry,</hi> his next Successor, whose grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Atchievements were against his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but more especially in succeeding times, when upon occasion of this disorder more En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish bloud was spent than was in all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Wars which had been since the Conquest. Three causes are commonly insinuated by you, for which a King may be deposed; Tyranny, Insufficiency, and Impiety: But what Prince could hold his State, what People their Quiet assured, if this your Doctrine should take place? How many good Princes doth Envy brand with one of these marks? What action of State can be so ordered, that either blind Ignorance or set Malice will not easily strain to one of these heads? Every execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, every demand of Tribute or Supply, shall be claimed Tyranny: every infortunate Event shall be exclaimed Insufficiency: every
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98890:46"/>
kind of Religion shall by them of another Sect be proclaimed Impiety. So dangerous it is to permit this high power to a heedless and headless Multitude, who measure things not by Reason and Justice, but either by Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which commonly is partial, or else by Report, which usually is full of uncertainties and errours: the most part doing because o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do; all easie to become slavish to any mans ambitious attempt. So dangerous it is to open our ears to every foolish <hi>Phaeton,</hi> who undertaking to guide the Chariot of the Sun, will soon cast the whole Earth into combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
            <p>You proceed, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth was also deposed for defects in Government. Let us yield a little to you, that you may be deceived; a little that you may be carried by your affections: How can you excuse these open untruths, wherein it cannot be but the Devil hath a finger? You cannot be ignorant that the onely cause which drew the Family of <hi>York</hi> into Arms against King <hi>Henry,</hi> was the Title which they had unto the Crown: by vertue whereof it was first enacted, That <hi>Rich.</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> should succeed King <hi>Henry,</hi> after his death: but for that he made unseasonable attempts, he was declared by Parliament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of succession, and afterwards slain at the Battel of <hi>Wakefield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Edward</hi> his Son, prosecuting the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and having vanquished King <hi>Henry</hi> at the Battle of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> obtained possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the State, caused King <hi>Henry</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98890:46"/>
and himself to be proclaimed and Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King. Afterward he was chased out of the Realm, and by Act of Parliament both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived and disabled from the Crown. Lastly, he returned again, and deprived King <hi>Henry</hi> both from Government and from Life. It is true, that some defects were objected against King <hi>Henry</hi>; but this was to estrange the hearts of the people from him. The main cause of the War did proceed from the right of the one party, and possession of the other: The contrariety of the Acts of Parliament was caused, by the alternative Victories of them both.</p>
            <p>Your last example is of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, of whom you write: First, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he sinned in murthering his Nephews, yet after their death he was lawful King. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he was deposed by the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, who called out of <hi>France Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> to put him down. Philosophers say, that dreams do commonly arise, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of the phansie upon some subject, whereof we have meditated the day before. It may be that your drowsie conceit was here cast into a dream, of that whereon it had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in all this Chapter: Or at the best, that you are like unto those, who have so often told a lie, that they perswade themselves it is ture. King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth left other children besides those that were murthered; the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> also, who was elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to King <hi>Richard,</hi> left Issue in life, all which had precedence of right before him. And as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98890:47"/>
for the second point, tell me, I pray you, by what Parliament was King <hi>Richard</hi> deposed? where did the States assemble? when did they send for the Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> to put him down? by what Decree? by what Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? There is no answer to be made, but one; and that is, to confess ingenuously, that you say untrue; and that it is your usual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of deceiving, to impute the act of a few unto all; and to make every event of Arms, to be a judicial proceeding of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. For it is manifest, that the Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> had his first strength from the King of <hi>France</hi>; and that after his descent into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> more by half, both of the Nobility and common people did stand for King <hi>Richard,</hi> than stir against him. You adjoyn for a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial consideration, that most excellent Princes succeeded these whom you affirm to be depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. I will not extenuate the excellency of any Prince; but I hold it more worthy to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that these disorders spent <hi>England</hi> a sea of bloud.</p>
            <p>In the end you conclude, that all these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privations of Princes were lawful. Nay; by your favour, if you sweat out your brains, you shall never evince, that a fact is lawful because it is done. Yes (you say) for otherwise two great inconveniences would follow: One, that the acts of those that were put in their place, should be void and unjust. The other, that none who now pretend to these Crowns, could have any Title, for that they descended from them, who succeeded those that were depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:98890:47"/>You deserve now to be basted with words well steeped in Vinegar and Salt; but I will be more charitable unto you, and leave bad speeches to black mouths. For the first, the possession of the Crown purgeth all defects, and maketh good the acts of him that is in Authority, although he wanteth both capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and right. And this doth <hi>Vlpian</hi> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determine <note n="(t)" place="margin">In l. Barbarius. D. de offic. praesid.</note> upon respect (as he saith) to the common good. For the other point, the Successors of an Usurper, by course and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of time, may prescribe a right; if they who have received wrong, discontinue both pursuit and claim. <hi>Panormitane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A Successor in Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity may prescribe, notwithstanding the fault of his Predecessor;</hi> Otherwise, causes of War should be immortal, and Titles perpetually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main uncertain.</p>
            <p>Now then for summary collection of all that you have said: your Protestations are good; your Proofs light and loose; your Conclusions both dangerous and false. The first doth savour of God, the second of Man, the third of the Devil.</p>

            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:98890:48"/>
            <head>An Answer to the fourth Chapter, which beareth title,</head>
            <head type="sub">Wherein consisteth principally the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of proceeding against Princes, which in the former Chapter is mentioned. What interest Princes have in their Subjects goods or lives. How Oaths do bind or may be broken, of Subjects to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Princes; and finally, the difference between a good King and a Tyrant.</head>
            <p>HEre you close with <hi>Bellaie</hi> upon two points: First, whether a King is subject to any Law. Secondly, whether all Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities are in propriety the King's: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these questions do little pertain to our principal Controversie, I will not make any stay upon them; it sufficeth that we may say with <hi>Seneca</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">De be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefic. lib. 7. c. 5.</note>: <hi>Omnia Rex imperio possidel, singuli domino. The King hath Empire, every man his particular propriety in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, you proceed further to make ood, that the Princes before-mentioned were lawfully deposed; and that by all Law, both Divine and Humane, Natural, National, and Positive. Your cause is so bad, that you have need to set a bold countenance upon it. But what Divine Laws do you alleadge? You
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98890:48"/>
have largely before declared (you say) that God doth approve the form of Government which every Commonwealth doth choose, as also the Conditions and Statutes which it doth appoint unto her Prince. I must now take you for a natural lyar, when you will not forbear to belye your self: you never proved any such matter; and the contrary is evident, that sometimes entire Governments, often, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms and Statutes of State, and very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accidental actions are so unnatural and unjust, that (otherwise than for a punishment and curse) we cannot say that God doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them. We have often heard that the Church cannot erre in matters of Faith; but that in matter of Government a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth cannot erre, it was never (I assure my self) published before.</p>
            <p>But let us suppose (supposal is free) that God alloweth that form of Government which every Commonwealth doth choose: Doth it therefore follow, that by all Divine Laws Princes may be deposed by their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? These broken pieces will never be squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to form strong argument. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not you produce the Divine Canons of Scripture? Surely, they abhor to speak one word in your behalf: yea, they do give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press sentence against you, as I have shewed before.</p>
            <p>Well, let this pass among your least escapes; in making God either the Author or Aider of Rebellion, you alleadge no other Humane Law, but that Princes are subject to Law and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98890:49"/>
I will not deny but there is a duty for Princes to perform: But how prove you that their Subjects have power to depose them if they fail? In this manner: As the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth gave them their Authority for the common good, so it may also take the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, if they abuse it. But I have manifested before <note n="(c)" place="margin">Cap. 2.</note>, both that the people may so grant away their Authority that they cannot resu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it; and also that few Princes in the world hold their State by grant of the people. I will never hereafter esteem a mans valour by his voice: Your brave boast of all Laws, Divine, Humane, Natural, National and Positive, is dissolved into smoak: You busie your self as the Poets write of <hi>Morpheus,</hi> in presenting shadows to men asleep.</p>
            <p>But the chiefest reason (you say) the very ground &amp; foundation of all. Soft; What reason? what ground? if you have already made proof by all Laws, Humane and Divine, Natural, National and Positive, what better reason; what surer ground will you bring? Tush; these interruptions? The chiefest reason (you say) the very ground and foundation of all is, that the Commonwealth is superiour to the Prince; and that the Authority which the Prince hath, is not absolute, but by the way of mandate and commission from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>This is that which I expected all this time: you have hitherto approached by stealing steps, you are now come close to the wall; do but mount into credit, and the fort is your
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:98890:49"/>
own. You affirmed at the first, that Princs might be deposed for disability; then, for misgovernment; now, upon pleasure and at will. For they who have given authority by commission, do always retain more than they grant <note n="(d)" place="margin">C. du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum de praeb. lib. 6.</note>; and are not excluded either from Commanding or Judging, by way of prevention, concurrence, or evocation; even in those cases which they have given in charge <note n="(e)" place="margin">l. judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitur.

               <hi>Because he to whom Iurisdiction is committed representeth his person who gave commission, and not his own.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Alexander</hi>

               <hi>a man can judge no longer, when he forbiddeth who gave authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, all States take denomination from that part wherein the supreme power is setled; as if it be in one Prince, it is called a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; if in many of highest rank, then it is an Aristocracy; if in the people, then a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy. Whereupon it followeth; if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are superiour to the Prince, if the Prince hath no power but by commission from them, that then all Estates are popular: for we are not so much to respect who doth execute this high Power of State, as from whom immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately it is derived. Hereto let us add that which you have said in another place <note n="(l)" place="margin">Cap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.</note>; that in popular Governmens there is nothing but sedition, trouble, tumults, outrages, and injustices upon every light occasion; and then
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98890:50"/>
we shall perceive, first, that you want the art of a wise deceiver, not to be entangled in your tale. Secondly, that this is mere poyson, which the Devil hath dropt out of your Pen, to infect Christian Countries with disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and disorder. In a word, to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this your impudent untruth, our Laws do acknowledge supreme authority in the Prince within the Realm and Dominions of <hi>England,</hi> 
               <note n="(m)" place="margin">1 El. 1.</note> neither can Subjects bear themselves ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther superiour or equal to their Soveraign; or attempt violence either against his person or estate, but as well the Civil Law <note n="(n)" place="margin">L. 1. d. ad. l.

I will speak now without passion: What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son have we, to accept your idle talk for a kind of authority, against the Judgment and Laws of most Nations in the world?</p>

            </p>
            <p>Well fare your wits, good soul; Do you account the promise of obedience evil? not so (I suppose you will say) but it turneth to be evil when it turneth to the notable detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Commonwealth. It is one of your peculiar gifts, the further you go, the more impious you declare your self. For if you take the word evil in no higher sence than for detriment and dammage, it would follow upon your rule, that a man were no further tied to his promise, than the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof were advantageable unto him. You would enforce also, that if the Father doth dissipate his patrimonial Estate, and run a course to ruine his Family, the Children and the Wife may thereupon disavow their duties.</p>
            <p>But if we take a true touch of this point, we shall find that the vices of any Prince are not sufficient of themselves to overthrow a State, except thereupon Rebellions be raised, which will draw all things into confusion. For there is no Prince, which either hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or can almost be imagined to live, in so little sence of humanity, but generally he both favoureth and maintaineth some order of Justice; only against particular persons, some of them have violently been carried by the tempest of their passion, whereby notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the inordinate desires of one man, cannot possibly reach to the ruine of all.</p>
            <p>So saith <hi>Suetonius,</hi>

But when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do break into tumult, then all course of Justice is stopped; then is either assistance made, or resistance weakned for forain Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; then is every one raised into hope who cannot fly but with other mens Feathers; then, as when a fierce Horse hath cast his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Reins are loosed to those insolencies, which a dissolute people, nothing restrained either by honesty or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>If the Emperour demandeth tribute, we do not deny him: If he desireth Fields, let him take them if he please: I do not give them to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; but therewith also I do not deny them.</hi> Of the second, <hi>Tertullian</hi> writeth <note n="(k)" place="margin">Apol.</note> as I have alleadged him before: For what War are we unserviceable or unfit, although une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual in number, who do so willingly suffer death?

thing which is lawfully commanded. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <note n="(m)" place="margin">In Psal.</note> 
               <hi>Iulian was an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del Emperour, an Apostata, an Idolater; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Souldiers did serve this Infidel Emperour; when he would have them worship Idols, and offer Frankincense unto them, they preferred God before him: but when he said, Bring forth the Army, march against such a Nation, they did presently obey.</hi> All this seemeth to be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by God himself, who after he had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned the people of <hi>Israel</hi> by the mouth of <hi>Samuel,</hi>

            <p>Surely, if you had been advisied, you would privily have blown your Blasphemies into the ears of those Ideots, who adore you for the great Penitentiaries of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and esteem your idle imaginations as the Articles of their Faith: and not so publickly have poured forth your self into these Paradoxes, both impious and absurd; not so boisterously have stepped, like <hi>Hercules Furens,</hi> upon the open stage of the world, to denounce depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation against all Princes. You would not thus confidently have opposed your hot-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded assertion against all the ancient Fathers of the Church.

Wisdom, by corrupting the sence of the Civil Laws: you would not thus profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have abused the Scriptures in maintaining Rebellion, as Conjurers do in invocating the Devil.

            </p>
            <p>After this you declare who is a Tyrant; and that is a King, (you say) if once he doth decline from his duty: which is a large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, and fit to set all Christian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries on float with Bloud. <hi>Comines</hi> saith, that he is to be esteemed a good King, whose ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are not overballanced by vice.</p>

               <hi>Alexander,</hi> to extend no further than when the Laws shall be both profitable and just; because Justice and the common benefit of Subjects, is the principal point both of the Oath and Duty of a Prince, whereto all other clauses must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. And now to your Examples.</p>
            <p>First, because in all the rank of the Hebrew Kings you cannot find either Condition or Oath; not in the ancient Empires and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world; not usually in the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing time of the Roman State, both under Heathen and Christian Emperours; because these times are too pure for your purpose, you fumble forth a dull Conjecture: That for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as the first Kings were elected by the People, it is like that they did it upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and assurances for themselves. That the first Kings received not their Authority from the people, I have manifested before <note place="margin">In c. 1.</note>: and yet your inference hereupon is no other, than
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98890:55"/>
if you should sue in some Court for a Legacy, alleadging nothing for your intent, but that it is like the Testator should leave you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; in which case it is like (I suppose) that your Plea would be answered with a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent scorn.</p>
            <p>After a few loose Speeches, which no man would stoop to gather together, you bring in the example of <hi>Anastasius</hi> the first Emperour of <hi>Constantinople</hi>; of whom the Patriarch <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemius</hi> required before his Coronation, a Confession of the Faith in writing, wherein he should promise to innovate nothing. And further, he promised to take away certain Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, and to give Offices without money. Let us take things as they are, and not speak upon idle imagination, but agreeable to sence. What either Condition or Restraint do you find in these words? Condition they do not form, because in case of failance they do not make the Authority void: neither do they make Restraint, because they contain no point whereunto the Law of God did not restrain him. All this he was bound to perform with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Oath; and if he were a thousand times sworn, he was no more but bound to perform it: even as if a Father should give his word to cloath and feed his Child; or the Husband to love his Wife; or any man to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that duty which God and Nature doth require. It is true, that <hi>Anastasius</hi> was both a wicked man, and justly punished by God for the breach of his Faith; but his Subjects did never challenge to be free therefore from their Allegiance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:98890:56"/>The same Answer may be given to the Promise, which <hi>Michael</hi> the first gave to <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> the Patriarch, <hi>That he would not violate the Ordinances of the Church, nor embrue his hands with innocent bloud</hi>; especially if you take the word <hi>Ordinances</hi> for matters necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be believed: but if you take it in a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sence, then have I also declared in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Chapter, how far the Promise doth extend.</p>
            <p>Your next Example is of the Empire of <hi>Almain</hi>; from whence all that you object doth fall within this circle. After the death of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, the Empire was held by Right of Succession, until his Line was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in <hi>Conrade</hi> the First: After whose death it became Elective: first, in <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>; then in <hi>Otho</hi> his son; and afterwards in the rest: from whom notwithstanding no other promise was wrested, but the discharge of that duty, which they were informed, or rather threatned, that God would severely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act at their hands. But (as in all Elective States it usually happeneth) at every new change and choice, the Emperour was deplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of some of his Feathers, until in the end he was made naked of Authority, the Princes having drawn all power to themselves.</p>
            <p>So by degrees the Empire was changed from a Monarchy to a pure Aristocracy; the Emperour bearing the Title thereof, but the Majesty and Puissance remaining in the States. During which weakness of the Emperour, some points were added to his Oath, which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98890:56"/>
seemed to derogate from the soveraignty of his estate. But what is this to those Princes who have retained their dignity, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diminution either of Authority or of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?</p>
            <p>The like may be said of <hi>Polonia,</hi> which not many hundred years since was erected into a Kingdom; and although the States did chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge therein a right of Election, yet did it always pass according to propinquity of bloud, and was esteemed a soveraign Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; until after the death of <hi>Casimire</hi> the Great, when <hi>Lodovicus</hi> his Nephew King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> rather greedy than desirous to be King also of <hi>Polonia,</hi> did much abase the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty thereof. Yet falling afterward into the Line of <hi>Iagello,</hi> who married one of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Lodowiek,</hi> it recovered the ancient both dignity and strength. But when that Line also failed in <hi>Sigismond Augustus,</hi> the last Male of that Family, the States elected <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> for their King, with this clause irritant; That if he did violate any point of his Oath, the people should owe him no Allegiance. But whereas you report this as the usual Oath of the Kings of <hi>Polonia,</hi> you deserve to hear the plainest term of untruth.</p>
            <p>In the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> you distinguish two times: one, before the Conquest thereof by the <hi>Moors</hi>; the other, after it was reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered again by the Christians. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a difference in these two times; for that in the one, the Right of the Kingdom was Elective; in the other, it hath always remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            <p>Concerning the matter in controversie, you affirm, that the Kings did swear the same points in effect, which before have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. This we must take upon your forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Faith, for you alleadge no form of Oath, onely you write, that the fourth National Council of <note n="(c)" place="margin">An. 623. cap. 74.</note> 
               <hi>Toledo,</hi> with all humility con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient did require, that the present King and all other that should follow, would be meek and moderate towards their Subjects, and govern them with Justice, and not give sentence in Causes capital without assistance: declaring further, that if any of them should exercise cruel and proud Authority, that they were condemned by Christ with the sentence of Excommunication, and separated to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Judgment.</p>
            <p>But what pang hath possessed your dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brains, to term this by a marginal Note, <hi>Conditions of reigning in</hi> Spain? being no other than a reverent and grave admonition of the duty of a King, with a fearful declaration of the Judgment of God against wicked Princes. And that which was afterward decreed in the sixth Council of <hi>Toledo, That the King should swear, not to suffer any man to break the Catholick Faith,</hi> because it is a principal point of his duty, his Estate was not thereby made conditional.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:98890:57"/>The rest of this passage you fill up with froath of the antiquated Law of Don <hi>Pelayo,</hi> prescribing a form of inaugurating the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi>; whereof there is not one point ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now in use, or pertaining to the purpose. So miserable is your case, that you can write nothing therein, but that which is either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent or untrue.</p>
            <p>For <hi>France,</hi> your first Example is taken from the Coronation of <hi>Philip</hi> the First: wherein you note, that King <hi>Henry</hi> his Father requested the people to swear Obedience to his son; inferring thereby, that a Coronation requireth a new Consent, which includeth a certain Election of the Subjects. But this is so light, that the least breath is sufficient to disperse it. <hi>Philip</hi> was crowned King during the life of his Father: which action, as it was not ordinary, so was it of such both difficulty and weight, that it could not be effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out assembly and consent of the States. The Oath which he made, is in this form extant in the Library of <hi>Rheimes: I do promise before God and his Saints, that I will conserve to every one committed unto me, Canonical Priviledge, and due Law and Iustice, and will defend them, by the help of God, so much as shall lie in my power, as a King by right ought to do within his Realm, to every Bishop, and to the Church committed to him: and further, to the People committed to my charge, I will grant by my authority the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Laws according to right.</hi> Adde to this a more ancient form of the Oath of those Kings, which it seemeth you have not seen: <hi>I
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98890:58"/>
swear in the Name of God Almighty, and promise to govern well and duly the Subjects committed to my charge, and to do with all my Power, Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Iustice, and Mercy.</hi> Adde also the Oath which you alleadge of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Augustus: To maintain all Canonical Priviledges, Law and Iustice due to every man, to the uttermost of his power; to defend his Subjects as a good King is bound to do; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that they be kept in the union of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to defend them from all Excess, Rapine, Extortion, and Iniquity, to take order that Iustice be kept with equity and mercy; and to endeavour to expel Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi> What doth all this rise unto, but a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promise to discharge honourably and truly those points of duty which the Laws of God did lay upon them? What other Conditions or Restraints are imposed? What other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is hereby made? Where are the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations which in the end of the last Chapter you promised to shew, that if the Prince do fail in his Promise, the Subjects are free from their Allegiance? What Clause do you find sounding to that sence? But you little regard any thing that you say; you easily remember to forget your word. Well then, we must put these your vain Speeches into the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Money accounted, but not received: and seeing you cannot shew us that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>Spain</hi> are tyed to any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whereto the Law of God doth not bind them, I will not vary from the judgment of <hi>Ordradus</hi> 
               <note n="(f)" place="margin">Con. 69.</note> in affirming them to be absolute Kings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:98890:58"/>I have pressed this point the rather in this place, because you write, that most Neighbour-Nations have taken the form of anointing and crowning their Kings, from the ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of <hi>France</hi>; although the substance be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the first Kings of the Hebrews, as appeareth by the anointing of King <hi>Saul:</hi> whereof <hi>David</hi> (you say) made great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, notwithstanding that <hi>Saul</hi> had been rejected by God, and that himself had lawfully born Arms against him.</p>
            <p>Out, Atheist; you would be dawbed with Dung, and have the most vile filth of your Stews cast in your face. Did <hi>David</hi> bear Arms against his anointed King? did he ever lift up his eye-lids against him? did he ever so much as defend himself otherwise than by flight? It is certain that <hi>Shemei</hi> did not half so cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either curse or revile this holy man, who did so much both by speech and action detest this fact, that he would rather have endured ten thousand deaths, than to have defiled his Soul with so damnable a thought. What then shall we say unto you, who to set up Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Tumult, abuse all divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Writings, in whatsoever you believe will advance your purpose? who spend some speech of respect unto Kings for allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely, to draw us more deep into your deceit? Shall we give any further ear to your Doctrine, both blasphemous and bloudy? We will hear you to the end; and I deceive my self, but your own tale shall, in any moderate judgment, condemn the authority of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:98890:59"/>Let us come then to your last Example, (which is neither the last nor the least where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at you level;) and that is of <hi>England,</hi> which of all other Kingdoms (you say) hath most particularly taken this Ceremony of Sacring and Anointing from <hi>France.</hi> Well, let the Ceremony be taken from whence you please; if the Oath be no other than you do specifie, <hi>To observe peace, honour, and Reverence unto Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, to his Church, and to the Ministers of the same; to administer Law and Iustice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this is plainly declared by the Speech which you alleadge of <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth: <hi>Remember</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Oath which volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily you made:</hi> Voluntarily he said, and not necessarily; it was voluntaly in Oath, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in Duty. That which you report al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> did write unto King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, importeth nothing else but an acknowledgment of Duty: <hi>Remember</hi> (said he) <hi>the Confession which you made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot omit your description of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Coronation in <hi>England.</hi> First (you say) the King is sworn; then the Archbishop
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98890:59"/>
declareth to the people what he hath sworn, and demandeth if they be content to submit themselves unto him under those conditions: whereunto they consenting, he putteth on the Royal Ornaments; and then addeth the words of commission: <hi>Stand and hold thy place, and keep thy Oath.</hi> And thus you have hammered out a formal Election, supposing that you draw together the pieces of falshood so close, that no man can perceive the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>am. The truth is, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the nearest in Bloud to the inheritance of the Crown, did countenance his violence with the election of the people; not at his Coronation, but in a Parliament that was holden before. And therefore you do impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently abuse us; first, in joyning them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as one Act; secondly, by falsifying di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers points in both; lastly, by insinuating that the same order was observed by other Kings.</p>
            <p>The points which you falsifie, are these: The interrogation of the Archbishop to the people; the absurd straining of these words, <hi>Stand, hold thy place,</hi> to be a Commission; the alleadging also out of <hi>Stow,</hi> 1. That the Archbishop did read unto the people what the King was bound unto by Oath. 2. That the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> did shew a Ring unto the people, that they might thereby see the Band whereby the King was bound unto them. 3. That the King did pray that he might observe his promise. In whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98890:60"/>
to your purpose; perswading your self, that it is no fraud unto God, to deceive the World in a lye for advantage.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth also (because his Right was litigious, and another was in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Crown) strengthened, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countenanced his Title with the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People. But where you write, that at the Coronation of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the consent and acceptation of the people was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: First, we have no cause to credit any thing that you say; then, although it be true, yet not being done in Parliament, it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no right unto the Prince; but is onely a formality, a circumstance onely of Ceremony and Order.</p>
            <p>Hereupon you conclude, that a King hath his authority by agreement and contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the people: insinuating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that he loseth the same, if he either violate or neglect his word. The contrary opinion, that onely succession of Bloud maketh a King, and that the consent of the people is nothing necessary, you affirm to be absurd, base, and impious, an unlearned, fond, and wicked as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion; in flattery of Princes, to the manifest ruine of Commonwealths, and perverting of all Law, Order, and Reason.</p>
            <p>I did always foresee that your impostumed stomach would belch forth some loathsome matter. But whosoever shall compare this confident conclusion with the proofs that you have made, he will rather judge you mad than
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98890:60"/>
unwise. This bold blast, upon grounds that are both foolish and false, bewrayeth rather want than weakness of wits. I am ashamed I should offer any further speech in so evident a truth: but since I have undertaken to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate an Heresie, since the matter is of so great consequence and import, I purpose once again to give you a Gorge.</p>
            <p>Learn then, heavy-headed Cloisterer, una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to manage these mysteries of State; learn of me, I say, for I owe this duty to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: the Prophets, the Apostles, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath taught us to be obedient to Princes, though both Tyrants and Infidels. This ought to stand with us for a thousand reasons to submit our selves to such Kings as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God to send unto us; without either judging or examining their qualities. Their hearts are in Gods hand; they do his service, sometimes in preserving, sometimes in puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing us: they execute his judgment both ways, in the same measure which he doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe. If they abuse any part of their power, we do not excuse, we do not extenuate it; we do not exempt them from their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: let them look unto it, let them assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly expect that God will dart his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance against them with a most stiff and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful arm. In the mean season, we must not oppose our selves otherwise than by humble suits and prayers; acknowledging that those evils are always just for us to suffer, which are many times unjust for them to do. If we do otherwise, if we break into tumult and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98890:61"/>
we resemble those Giants of whom the Poets write, who making offer to scale the Skies, and to pull <hi>Iupiter</hi> out of his Throne, were overwhelmed in a moment with the Mountains which they had heaped together. Believe it, Cloisterer, or ask any man who is both honest and wise, and he will tell you: It is a Rule in Reason, a Tryal in Experience, an Authority confirmed by the best, That<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion produceth more horrible effects, than either the tyranny or insufficiency of any Prince.</p>

            <head>An Answer to the sixth Chapter, whereof the title is,</head>
            <head type="sub">What is due to onely Succession by Birth; and what interest or right an Heir apparent hath to the Crown, before he is crowned or admitted by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: and how justly he may be put back, if he hath not the parts requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site.</head>
            <p>YOu begin (after your manner) with a carreer against <hi>Billay</hi>; but because both I have not seen what he hath written, and dare not credit what you report, I will not set in foot between you.</p>
            <p>In breaking from this, you prefer Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Princes before free Election, as well
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98890:61"/>
for other respects, as for the pre-eminence of Ancestry in birth, which is so much privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Scripture: and yet not made so inviolable, (you say) but upon just causes it might be inverted, as it appeareth by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Iacob, Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> And this liberty you hold to be the principal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for such inconveniencies as do ensue of the course of Succession; as if the next in birth be unable or pernicious to govern: in which cases, if he be not capable of directions and counsels, you affirm that the remedy is to remove him. And so you make Succession and Election, the one to be a preservative to the other; supposing, that the difficulties of both are taken away, First, if ordinarily Succession taketh place; then, if upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, we give allowance to Election.</p>
            <p>For the Prerogative of Birth, as also for the special choice which God hath often made of the youngest, I will remit my self to that which I have written before <note n="(g)" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note>. At once; in those particular actions which God hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther done, or by express Oracle commanded, contrary to the general Laws which he hath given us; as in the Robbery of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the extirpation of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> the insurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Iehu,</hi> and such like; we are bound to the Law, and not to the Example. God hath given us a natural Law to prefer the first-born; he hath often made choice of the youngest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he commonly worketh greatest effects, by means not onely weak, but extraordinary; as it appeareth by the birth of <hi>Isaak.</hi> But that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98890:62"/>
these special Elections of God are not proposed for imitation to us, hereby it is evident; because they have been for the most part without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the one, or demerit in the other. And especially in this example of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith <note n="(h)" place="margin">Ro. 9.13</note> that it was not grounded upon their works, but upon the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God; for before they had done good or evil, before they were born, God said: <note n="(i)" place="margin">Gen. 25.23.</note> 
               <hi>The eldest shall serve the youngest.</hi> Which if we might imitate, the priviledge of birth were given in vain.</p>
            <p>For your device in joyning Election to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, whereby one of them should remedy the difficulties of the other, it is a meer Uto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical conceit: What else shall I term it? an imposture of State, a Dream, an Illusion, fit only to surprise the judgement of the weak and ignorant multitude. These toys are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways hatched by the discoursive sort of men rather than the active; being matters more in imagination than in use: and herein two respects do principally oppose against you.</p>
            <p>The first is, for that in most Nations of the world, the people have lost all power of Election; and Succession is firmly setled in one discent, as before I have declared <note n="(k)" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note>.</p>
            <p>The second is, for that more fiery factions are hereby kindled, than where Succession or Election are meer without mixture. For where one claimeth the Crown by Succession, and another possesseth it by Title of Election; there, not a disunion only of the people, not a division in arms, but a cruel throat-cutting, a

most immortal and mercyless butchery doth u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually ensue. It is somewhat inconvenient (I grant) to be governed by a Prince either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent or evil; but it is a greater inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, by making a breach into this high point of State, to open a way to all manner of ambitions, perjuries, cruelties and spoil: whereto the nature of the common-people would give a great furtherance, who being weak in Wisdom, violent in Will; soon wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of quiet, always desirous of change, and most especially in matters of State, are easily made serviceable to any mans aspiring desires. This I have manifested before <note n="(l)" place="margin">Cap. 3.</note>, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of King <hi>Edward</hi> and King <hi>Richard,</hi> both surnamed the Second: who were not insupportable either in nature or in rule; and yet the people, more upon wantonness than for any want, did take an unbridled course a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. And thus is your high Policy nothing else but a deep deceipt; thus whilst you strive with the wings of your wit to mount above the Clouds of other mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you sink into a sea of absurdities and errours.</p>
            <p>After this, you determine two questions: The first is, What respect is to be attributed to propinquity of bloud only. Whereto you answer, that it is the principal circumstance which leadeth us to the next Succession of the Crown, if other circumstances and conditions do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oncur, which were appointed at the same time, when the Law of Succession was establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Assuredly, you can never shew either
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98890:63"/>
when, or by whom, this Law of Succession was first instituted, except perhaps by some <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> when he had brought the neck of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under his sword: at which time, what conditions he would set down to be required from his Successour, any ordinary judgment may conjecture at ease. Well, since you set us to seek for proof of this, to that which you have written before, I will also send you back to the same place <note n="(m)" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> for your answer.</p>
            <p>The second question is, What interest a Prince hath to his Kingdom, before he be Crowned? This you resolve by certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons; and first you write, that it is the same which the <hi>German</hi> Emperour hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Coronation. But that is so large, that some Emperours have never been Crowned; others have deferred it for many years; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which <note n="(n)" place="margin">Metrop. l. 3. cap. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Crantzius</hi> writeth, that <hi>Otho</hi> the First received the Crown of the Empire, in the eight and twentieth year of his Reign. And yet is not this comparison full to the question propounded; because in elective States there is not held one perpetual continuance of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, as is in those that are successive. And <note n="(o)" place="margin">In Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oem. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</note> 
               <hi>Panormitane</hi> saith, That an argument <hi>a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milibus</hi> is not good, if any difference can be assigned. Much more unfitly do you affirm, that it is no greater than a Mayor of <hi>London</hi> hath in his Office, before he hath taken his Oath: For it is odiously absurd, to compare the Authority of an absolute Prince by succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to the Authority of an Officer, both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective and also subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:98890:63"/>But it is the example of marriage (you say) whereby this matter is made more plain: for as in this contract there is an espousal, by promise of a future act, and a perfect marriage by yielding a present consent; the first is, when both parties do mutually promise that they will. The second, that they do take one the other for Husband and Wife: So an Heir apparent, by propinquity of blood is espoused only to the Commonwealth, and married af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward at his Coronation, by Oaths of either party, and by putting on the Ring, and other Wedding-garments. But how were Kings married in former ages? how are they now married in those Countrys, where they have neither Ring, nor Wedding-garment, nor also any Oath? What? is every Office and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree which is taken with Ceremony, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed likewise a Marriage? Or if you will have Coronation onely to be a Marriage, what else can it resemble, but the publick ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of Matrimony between man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? which addeth nothing to the substance of contract, but onely manifesteth it to the world.</p>
            <p>These pitiful proofs naked of authority, empty of sence, deserve rather to be excused than answered: I will help therefore in some sort to excuse them. They are the best that your both starved cause and conceit can possibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford: and you have also some fellows in your folly. <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> did solemnly joyn the statues of the Sun and of the Moon in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage together. <hi>Nero</hi> was married to a man,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98890:64"/>
and took also a man to his Wife. The <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> do yearly upon <hi>Ascention</hi>-day, by a Ring and other ceremonies, contract marriage with the Sea.</p>
            <p>But now in earnest; men do die whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it pleaseth God to call them: but it is a Maxime in the Common-Law of <hi>England: Rex nunquam moritur; The King is always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually in life.</hi> In <hi>France</hi> also the same custom hath been observed; and for more assurance, it was expresly enacted under <note n="(p)" place="margin">About the year 1375.</note> 
               <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, That after the death of any King, his eldest Son should incontinently succeed.

                  </expan> requirunt,</hi> his Father <hi>Aeneas</hi> being yet alive.</p>
            <p>But so soon as the King departeth out of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98890:64"/>
life, the Royalty is presently transferred to the next Successour, according to the Laws and Customs of our Realm. All Writs go forth in his Name; all course of Justice is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, all Offices are held by his Authority; all States, all Persons, are bound to bear to him Allegeance: not under supposal of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation when he shall be Crowned, according to your dull and drousie conjecture, but as being the true Soveraign King of the Realm.</p>
            <p>He that knoweth not this, may (in regard of the affairs of our State) joyn himself to St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> in glorying in his ignorance, and professing that he knoweth nothing. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> Reigned three months before she was Crowned, in which space the Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> and others were condemned and executed for Treason: for Treason, I say, which they had committed, before she was proclaimed Queen.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the first was in <hi>Palestina,</hi> when his Father died; in which his absence, the Nobility and Prelates of the Realm assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>London,</hi> and did acknowledge him for their King. In his return homeward he did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the <hi>French</hi> King, for the lands which he held of him in <hi>France.</hi> He also repressed certain Rebels of <hi>Gascoine</hi>; amongst whom, <hi>Gasco</hi> of <hi>Bierne</hi> appealed to the Court of the King of <hi>France:</hi> where King <hi>Edward.</hi> had Judgment, that <hi>Gasco</hi> had committed Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note n="(d)" place="margin">Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. in E. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>; and thereupon he was delivered to the pleasure of King <hi>Edward.</hi> And this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98890:65"/>
hapned before his Coronation, which was a year and nine months after he began to reign.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth was crowned in the eighth year of his Reign; and in the mean space, not only his Subjects did both profess and bear Allegeance, but the King of <hi>Scots</hi> also did swear Homage unto him.</p>
            <p>What need I give any more either instance or argument, in that which is the clear Law, the uncontrouled custom of the Realm? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which notwithstanding your weather-beaten forehead doth not blush to oppose a blind Opinion, that Heirs apparent are not true Kings, although their Titles be just, and their predecessors dead. This you labour to prove by a few dry conjectures, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially and above all others (you say) because the Realm is asked three times at every Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, whether they will have such a man to be their King or no. First, we have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to require better proof of this question than your bare word. Secondly, although we admit it to be true, yet seeing the answer is not made by the Estates of the Realm as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in Parliament, but by a confused con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course (necessary Officers excepted) of all sorts both of Age and Sex, it is for Ceremony only, and not of force, either to give or to increase any right.</p>
            <p>Another of your Arguments is, for that the Prince doth first swear to Govern well and justly, before the Subjects take their Oath of Allegeance; which argueth, that before they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:98890:65"/>
were not bound. And further you affirm, that it hapned onely to King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, among his predecessors, to have fealty done unto him, before he was crowned, and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Oath. I confess indeed, that <hi>Polydore</hi> and <hi>Stow</hi> have written so; but you might easily have found that they write not true; the one of them being a meer stranger in our State; the other a man more to be commended for endeavour than for art. King <hi>Iohn</hi> being in <hi>Normandy</hi> when his Brother died, sent into <hi>England Hubert</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury, William Marshal</hi> Earl of <hi>Strig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> and <hi>Geoffry Fitzpeter</hi> Lord Chief Justice, who assembled the States of the Realm at <hi>Northampton,</hi> and took of them an Oath of obedience to the new King. Also King <note n="(e)" place="margin">Anno reg. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Third caused the Citizens of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the Guardians of the Cinque-ports, and divers others, to swear fealty to Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> his son; who being in <hi>Palestina</hi> when his Father died, the Nobility and Prelates of the Realm assembled in the new Temple at <hi>London,</hi> and did acknowledge him for their King. And in like manner, King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third took an Oath of all the Nobility of the Realm, of faith after his death to <hi>Richard</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>; and so did King <hi>Henry</hi> the first, for his Daughter <hi>Mawde,</hi> and her young son <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, that Subjects did often swear allegeance before the Coronation and Oath of the King, you had neither Countenance nor Conscience to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98890:66"/>
deny: but it was neither of these two which did restrain you; it proceeded onely from the force of truth, which will manifest it self whatsoever art we use to disguise it. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, what Countenance, what Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had you to affirm, that it is expresly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our English Historiographers, That no Allegeance is due unto Kings before they be crowned? Who are these Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers? Where do they so write? You that search every dusty corner of your Brains for a few ragged reasons to uphold your Heresie, should not either have mentioned, or omitted such pregnant proofs: For in that you affirm and do not express them, you condemn your self by your own silence.</p>
            <p>If you mean that which you alleadge out of <hi>Polydore</hi> and <hi>Stowe</hi>: That an Oath of feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was never made before Coronation, until the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth; it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true, nor to any such sence. If you mean that of <hi>Polydore</hi> in terming <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth Prince and not King, before he was crowned; in writing also, that the States did consult in Parliament, <note n="(f)" place="margin">De no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <hi>Of creating a new King after the custom of their Ancestors:</hi> It is a sleepie jeast, to strain every word in such an Author to propriety of speech. You might better have cited, what certain Cities in <hi>France,</hi> not long since, alleadged for themselves: That because they had not reputed <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth for their King, because they had not professed Alleageance unto him, they were not to be adjudged Rebels: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98890:66"/>
notwithstanding the chiefest Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers of our age did resolve, that foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they were original Subjects, even Subjects by birth; they were Rebels in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arms against their King, although they had never professed alleageance. And this is so evidently the Law of the Realm, that it is presumption in us both: in you, to assay by your shallow Sophistry to obscure or impugn; in me, to endeavour by authorities and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to manifest or defend the same.</p>
            <p>But the admission of the people (you say) hath often prevailed against right of Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. So have Pyrates against Merchants; so have Murtherers and Thieves against true meaning Travellers. And this disloyalty of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath moved divers Kings to cause their Sons to be crowned during their own lives; because the unsetled state of succeeding Kings doth give opportunity to boldest attempts; and not as you dream, because admission is of more importance than succession.</p>
            <p>I will examine your Examples in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters following. In the mean time, where you write, that King <hi>Henry</hi> and King <hi>Edward,</hi> both called the Fourth, had no better way to appease their minds at the time of their death, but by founding their Title upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the people; the Authors <note n="(g)" place="margin">Sir Tho. Moor, and Stow.</note> which you cite do plainly charge you with unexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable untruth. King <hi>Edward</hi> never made question of his right: King <hi>Henry</hi> did, as some other Authors report <note n="(h)" place="margin">Holing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</note>; but applied no such deceitful comfort: this false skin would not then serve to cover his wound.</p>

            <p>HEre you present your self very pensive to your audience, as though you had so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-strained your wits with store of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the next in Succession not admitted to the State, that you had cracked the credit of them for ever. But you are worthy of blame, either for endangering or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling your self in matters of so small ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. I have shewed before, that Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples suffice not to make any proof; and yet herein doth consist the greatest shew of your strength. It is dangerous for men to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Examples though good, except they can assure themselves of the same concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of reasons, not onely in general, but in particularities; of the same direction also and carriage in Counsel; and lastly, of the same favourable fortune: but in actions which are evil, the imitation is commonly worse than
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98890:67"/>
the example. Your puffie discourse then is a heap of words without any weight; you make mountains, not for Mole-hills, but of Moats; long harvest of a small deal, not of Corn, but of Cockle: and (as one said at the shearing of Hogs) great cry for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and that not very fine Wool.</p>
            <p>Yea, but of necessity something you must say: yea, but this something is no more than nothing. You suppose, that either your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion will be accepted, more for authority of your Person, than weight of your Proofs; or else that any words will slide easily into the minds of those who are lulled in the humour of the same inclination; because partiality will not suffer men to discern truth, being ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily beguiled in things they desire. Besides, whatsoever countenance you carry, that all your Examples are free from exception, yet if you had cast out those which are impertinent, or unjust, or else untrue, you could not have been overcharged with the rest.</p>
            <p>Your first example, that none of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Saul</hi> did succeed him in the Crown, is altogether impertinent: because by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and express appointment of God <note n="(i)" place="margin">2 Reg. 15, &amp; 16. 2 Reg. 2 &amp; 5</note>, the Kingdom was broken from his posterity. We acknowledge that God is the onely supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Judge of Supream Kings, having abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute both Right and Power, to dispose and transpose their Estates as he please. Neither must we examine his actions by any course of Law, because his Will is above all Law. He hath enjoyned the people to be obedient to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98890:68"/>
their Kings, he hath not made them equal in authority to himself. And whereas out of this example you deduce, that the fault of the father may prejudicate the sons right, although he had no part in the fault; to speak moderately of you, your judgement is either deceitful or weak.

               </gap> the least. You write that <hi>David</hi> made a promise to <hi>Bathsheba</hi> in his youth, That <hi>Solomon</hi> should succeed in his estate: but if you had considered at what years <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:98890:68"/>
began to Reign, you should have found that <hi>David</hi> could not make any such promise, but he must be a youth about threescore years of age. You write also, that <hi>David</hi> adored his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> from his bed: but the words wherewith <hi>David</hi> worshipped were these <note n="(q)" place="margin">3. Reg. 2.48.</note>: <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of</hi> Israel, <hi>who hath made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one to sit on my Throne this day, even in my sight:</hi> whereby it is evident, that <hi>David</hi> adored God and not his Son. This I note rather for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the loosness of your Judgment, than for any thing it maketh to the purpose. You are so accustomed to untruths, that you fall into them, without either advantage or end.</p>
            <p>The like answer may be given to your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Rehoboam</hi>; because God declared his sentence therein by two Prophets, <hi>Ahijah</hi> 
               <note n="(r)" place="margin">3. Reg. 11.31.</note> &amp; <hi>Shemaiah</hi> 
               <note n="(s)" place="margin">3. Reg. 12.24.</note>. But for that the ten Tribes revolted from <hi>Rehoboam</hi> upon discontentment at his rough answer, and with dispite against <hi>David</hi> and his House, and not in obedience to Gods Decree, we cannot excuse them from offence, for which it turned to their destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For hereupon, first they were separated both from the place and manner of the true Worship of God; then, there arose unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasable War, between them and the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi>; then, insolencies following disorders, they were never long time free from Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, Divisions, and Tumults: by which means being drained both of Wealth and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and reduced to a naked weakness,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98890:69"/>
they were lastly carried captive into divers far Countries, and strangers were sent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit their Cities.</p>
            <p>I must here also observe a few of your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, wherein your boldness is not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with any bounds. It is to be noted (you say) that before <hi>Rehoboam</hi> went to <hi>Shechem</hi> to be admitted by the people, he was not accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted true King. I desire therefore that you would satisfie us in these places following. Before <hi>Rehoboam</hi> went to <hi>Shechem,</hi> the Scripture saith, that <hi>Solomon</hi> died, &amp; was buried, and <hi>Rehobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> his Son reigned in his stead <note n="(t)" place="margin">3. Reg. 11.43.</note>. Again, after the defection of the ten Tribes it is said, that in the Cities of <hi>Iudah Rehoboam</hi> did Reign still <note n="(u)" place="margin">3. Reg. 12.17.</note>; implying thereby, that in the other Cities he reigned before. Again, they are said to have rebelled against the house of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> 
               <note n="(w)" place="margin">3. Reg. 12.19.</note>. And lastly, <hi>Rehoboam</hi> raised all the strength of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> to bring the Kingdom again unto him <note n="(x)" place="margin">3. Reg. 12.21.</note>.</p>
            <p>Further you write, that ten Tribes refused to admit <hi>Rehoboam</hi>; but the Scripture saith, that they rebelled <note n="(y)" place="margin">3. Reg. 12.19.</note>. What? did God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow hereof after it was done? did he only permit the people to do it? The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture testifieth, that it was his Decree, that it was his Deed, and that he declared his Will by <hi>Ahijah</hi> the Prophet <note n="(z)" place="margin">3. Reg. 11.31.</note>, during the life of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and for his sins. But these special Warrants do not constitute a Law; they serve onely to make good the particular actions for which they are directed, and not to justifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98890:69"/>
the like. Lastly, St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that all things hapned to the Jews in figure; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which place divers Expositors have noted, that the State of the Jews was a figure of the Church of Christ: but that it was an example and patern of all other States that should ensue, it shall be ranged among your cast conceits.</p>
            <p>I refer me now to the judgment of any man, who taketh not pleasure to beguile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, whether you do not by art and trumpery manifestly abuse us; partly by incapacity, and partly by deceit, either corrupting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding whatsoever you take in hand. Your humour both discontented and unquiet, hath armed your mind with bloudy desires; which have edged you on to put fewel to those flames, which you should endeavour to quench, though it were with your bloud.</p>
            <p>I will not stand upon the particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>Spain,</hi> as well for that the matter is both tedious and to little purpose; as also for that we have small conformity with the Customs of that Nation. Onely thus much in general: We acknowledge that in ancient times the Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> was Elective, and therefore your Examples drawn from thence are nothing pertinent. The Examples of latter times are both few and unjust, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried onely by Faction and by Force; as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabay</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 414.</note> testifieth of your Example of <hi>Aurelio</hi>; and as by the Example of D. <hi>Sancho el Bravo</hi> I have declared before <note n="(a)" place="margin">Cap. 3.</note>. But you account
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98890:70"/>
Faction to be the Commonwealth, and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence Justice, when it may make to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of your affairs.</p>
            <p>The History of D. <hi>Berenguela</hi> I will briefly report, rather for the respect which guided the <hi>Castilians,</hi> than that I allow it for Right which they did. <hi>Henry</hi> had two Sisters: <hi>Donna Blanch</hi> the eldest, married to <hi>Lewes</hi> the eighth King of <hi>France</hi>; and <hi>Berenguela</hi> the youngest, married to <hi>Alphonso</hi> King of <hi>Leon. Henry</hi> dying without Issue, the <hi>Castilians</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if they should submit themselves unto <hi>Blanch,</hi> that their State being less than the State of <hi>France,</hi> would be made a Member thereof, and governed as a Province, and not as a Kingdom. And therefore they did rather chuse to profess Allegiance to the Lady <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guela</hi>; by which means the Kingdom of <hi>Leon</hi> was afterwards annexed unto <hi>Castile,</hi> to the great increase both of dignity and assurance to them both. I have followed herein your own Authors, not being ignorant that others of better name do write, that <hi>Berenguela</hi> was the eldest Sister, as I shall have occasion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to declare: but for the present, let it be as you please; and let us weigh our own wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, not onely in straining, but in forging Titles, to incur those mischiefs which the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilians</hi> rejected a lawful Title to avoid.</p>
            <p>And this was also one of the Motives of the Revolt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which is your last Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; although it had also (as <hi>Garabay</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Lib. 34. Pag. 833.</note> writeth) a concurrence of Right. For <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:98890:70"/>
King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> by his Procurators the Bishop of <hi>Ebora</hi> and others, did both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and solemnize espousals with <hi>Elianor,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Aragon.</hi> But being entred into War with <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Castile,</hi> and finding himself at some disadvantage, he forsook the King of <hi>Aragons</hi> Daughter, and contracted himself to <hi>Elianor,</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Castile,</hi> upon very beneficial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions for his State. Afterward, falling into fancy with one of his Subjects, named <hi>Elianor Telles de Meneses,</hi> Wife to a Nobleman called <hi>Lorenzo Vasques de Aounna,</hi> he took her as his Wife, and enforced her Husband to avoid the Realm; and had by her one onely Daughter named <hi>Beatrix,</hi> who was joyned in marriage to <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>Castile.</hi> After the death of the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> her Father, the King of <hi>Castile</hi> in the right of his Wife, laid claim to that Realm, and was accordingly acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the chief of the Nobility and Prelates; and in particular, by <hi>D. Iohn</hi> Master of <hi>Avis,</hi> her Fathers base Brother, who was then the most forward man in her favour. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards falling into quarrel, and having slain the Count <hi>de Oren,</hi> he stirred the people against the Queen, and compelled her to quit the City. And after divers Outrages and Murthers committed upon the Bishop of <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> an Abbess, and many others, he was first made Governour of <hi>Portugal</hi>; and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding further, in an Assembly of his Party gathered at <hi>Coimbra,</hi> he was made King. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabay</hi>

The Good did fear, the Evil expect; no place was free, either from the rage or suspition of Tumult; few to be trusted, none assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all things in commixtion; the Wisest too weak, the Strongest too simple, to avoid the Storm which brake upon them:

the People Joyning to their miserable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition many Complaints, That they had been abused by you, in whose Directions they found nothing but Obstinacie and Rashness, two dangerous Humours to lead a great Enterprise. At the last, when la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable Experience had made that known unto them, which they had no Capacity by reason to foresee, they expelled as well your Company as Counsel out of the Realm; and so the Firebrands which you had kindled, were broken upon your own Heads; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving opportunity by your just banishment to take into Consideration both the Weakness and Wrong of your Advice.</p>
            <p>The partition of the Realm of <hi>France</hi> betwen <hi>Charles the Great</hi> and <hi>Charloman</hi> his younger Brother, and also the uniting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of again in <hi>Charles,</hi> after the death of <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loman,</hi> depended upon the disposition of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> their Father, and not upon the Election of the People. <hi>Girard</hi> saith, that <note n="e" place="margin">

               <hi>Pepin</hi> having disposed all things in his new Realm which he thought necessary for the surety thereof, he disposed his Estate; leaving the Realm of <hi>Noion</hi> to his Son <hi>Charles</hi>; and to <hi>Charloman</hi> his other Son, that of <hi>Soisons,</hi> &amp; that by the death of <hi>Carloman,</hi> both his Place and his Power did accrue unto <hi>Charles.</hi> In this manner, the first of a family, who hath attained a Kingdom, hath ordinarily directed the Succession thereof.</p>
            <p>The Contention between <hi>Lewis le De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonaire</hi> and his sonnes, according to your own Author <hi>Girard,</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">

               </note> proceeded and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98890:73"/>
after this manner. Certain Lords of <hi>France</hi> taking discontentment at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate favours, which the king shewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Berard</hi> his great Chamberlain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired against him; and for their greater both countenance and strength, drew his owne sonnes to be of their faction. But <hi>Lewis</hi> brake this broile, more by foresight than by force; and doing execution upon the principal offenders, pardoned his Sons. Yet they, interpreting this lenity to slackness of courage, rebelled again, gathered a greater strength, &amp; drew Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the fourth to be accomplice of their unnatural impietie: whereby it appeareth (saith <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard</hi>) that they are either foolish or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, who will affirm, that every thing is good which the Popes have done. Afterward they took their Father, under colour of good faith, and sent him prisoner to <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone,</hi> and then at <hi>Compeigne</hi> assembled a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, composed of their own confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, wherein they made him a Monk, and brought his estate into division and share. It is easie to conjecture (saith the same <hi>Girard</hi>) what miserable conditions the Realm then endured; all Laws were subverted, all things exposed to the rage of the Sword, the whole Realm in combustion, and the people extreamely discontented at this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous impiety. In the end <hi>Lewes,</hi> by the aid of his faithful servants was taken out of prison, and restored to his Kingdom; and his Sons acknowledging their fault,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98890:74"/>
were received by him both to pardon and favour. His son <hi>Pepin</hi> being dead, he divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Realm among his other three Sons, <hi>Charles, Lewes,</hi> and <hi>Lothaire</hi>; but <hi>Lewes</hi> rebelled again, and was again received to mercie: lastly, he stirred a great part of <hi>Germanie</hi> to revolt, with grief whereof the good old man his Father died. After his death, <hi>Lewes</hi> and <hi>Lothaire,</hi> upon disdain at the great portion which their Father had assigned to their brother <hi>Charles,</hi> raised war against him.

At his death, he left his wife great with child, who afterward was called <hi>Charles</hi> the simple. But before he had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished the age of 12 years, there stept up

being a bastard, succeded <hi>Robert</hi> his Father in the Duchie of <hi>Normandie,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the said <hi>Robert</hi> left two brothers in life, it was at that time a custom in <hi>France,</hi> that bastards did succeed, even as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full children. <hi>Thierry</hi> bastard of <hi>Clovis,</hi> had for his partage the kingdome of <hi>Austrasie,</hi> now called <hi>Lorraine.

by the State, for the offences of their Father. You bear a minde charged with thoughts Vain, Busie, and Bold, without any restraint either of Honesty or of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.

               <hi>Eldred</hi> did first take upon him but as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, because of the minoritie of the sonnes of <hi>Edmund</hi> his elder brother; and afterward entred into full possession of the Crown.

            <p>You write, that they thought they might have done this with a good conscience, for the good of the Realm. But what

The Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were set into factions; the common people into division and disorder: and as in Wars, where discipline is at large, there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies are infinite; so in this confusion of the State, there was no action which tended not to the ruin thereof; the Lives and Goods of Men remaining in continual pillage. <hi>Polydore</hi> saith: <note n="*" place="margin">

odious untruths, which are more harsh to a well-tuned ear, then the crashing of teeth, or the grating of copper. As namely, in affirming, that <hi>Arthur</hi> was excluded, and <hi>Iohn</hi> crowned King by the States of the Realm; that God did more defend this act of the Common-wealth, then the just Title of <hi>Arthur</hi>; that by the same States King <hi>Iohn</hi> was rejected, Prince <hi>Henry</hi> his son deprived, and <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>France</hi> chosen to be King; that the same States recalled their sentence against Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> disannulling their Oath and Allegiance made unto <hi>Lewes.</hi> A shameless tongue, governed by a deceitful mind, can easily call Faction, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; Rebellion, a just and judicial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; open and often Perjury, an orderly revoking of a Sentence; Gods secret Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in permitting Injustice to prevail, a plain defence and allowance thereof.</p>
            <p>Of the division of the Houses of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> it is but little that you write, whereto I have fully answered before: you do wisely to give a light touch to this Example, it is so hot that it will scald your throat. King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, more car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by cursed ambition, then either by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity or right, laid an unjust gripe upon the Realm, which afterward he did beautifie with the counterfeit Titles of Conquest and Election. So violent are the desires of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to imbrace streined Titles, by which they may disturb the States of other; not
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98890:84"/>
remembring, that Right may be trodden down, but not trodden out; having her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret both means to support, and seasons to revive her. For although the lawful Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor did warily strike sail to the Tempest, because neither the time running, nor the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity present (which are the Guiders of Actions) did consent as then to enter into enterprise; yet so soon as one hair of occasion was offered, his progeny did set up a most doubtful war, wherein thirteen Battels were executed by English-men only, and above fourescore Princes of the Royal Blood slain.</p>
            <p>Lo now the smiling success of these usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations; lo what a dear purchase of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance they did cause! Were it not that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion doth blind men, not only in desire but in hope, they might suffice to make us ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, to keep rather the known and beaten way with safety, then upon every giddy and brainless warrant to engulph our selves in those Passages wherein so many have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risted before us. It belongeth to wise men to avoid mischiefs; and it is the reward of fools to lament them.</p>
            <p>Go too then; conclude if you please, that the people are not bound to admit him to the Crown, who is the next Successor by propinquity of blood; but rather to weigh, whether it is like that he will perform his charge, or no. Conclude this (I say) to be

            <p>IN this Passage you handle what Cause is sufficient either to keep in, or to cast out of State the next in Blood. In which Question you determine, That God doth allow for a just and sufficient Cause, the Will and Judgment of the People. Your Reason is, For that they are Judge of the Thing it self, and therefore they are the Judge also of the Cause. Your Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent you prove, first, For that it is in their own Affair: secondly, For that it is in a Matter that hath its whole Beginning, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and Substance from them alone. Your Consequence you prove by a whole

            <p>
               <hi>Diogenes</hi> said of a certain Tumbler, That he never saw Man take more pains to break his Neck. In like sort we may say of you, It is hard to find a Man that hath more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied his Wits to overthrow the Opinion of his Wisdom. For, the first Proof of your Antecedent is not onely of no force for you, but strong against you; because no Man is a competent Judge in his own Cause; no Man can be both Party and Judge: Whereto I will add, That no Inferiour hath Jurisdiction over the Superiour, much less the Subject against the Sovereign.</p>
            <p>Your second Proof, That all the Power of a King hath dependency upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I have sufficiently encountred before <note n="*" place="margin">

And if your Consequence were true, That whosoever is Judge of a thing, is Judge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so without controllment of the Cause; if this were as agreeable to all Laws as you seem to believe, then were all Judgments arbitrary; then could no Appeal be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, for giving Sentence without just Cause; then were it false which <hi>Panormitan</hi> writeth <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>What shall I say? What do you think? Do you think that these fat Drops of a greasie Brain can bring the Tenure of a

Are you of Civil either Nature or Education, who under the name of <hi>Civilian</hi> do open the way to all manner of Deceits, Perjuries, Tumults, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? What are you? For you shew your self more prophane than Infidels; more barbarous than Canibals, <hi>Tartarians, Moors,</hi> and <hi>Mammelucks</hi>; who though they please themselves in nothing more than Hatred and Contempt, yet do they both love and honour their Kings. I see what you are, the very true Follower of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> who openly professed, That they must ruinate the State of Kings. And who can assure us (for your corrupt Dealings make all Suspicions credible) that you do not also follow them both in Desire and Hope, to embrace the Monarchy of the whole World? The difference between you is this: They pretended Revelation for then War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; you work by deceitful shew of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by falsly either alledging, or wresting, or corrupting both Humane and Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>In what miserable condition should Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces live, if their State depended upon the Pleasure of the People, in whom Company taketh away Shame, and every Man may lay the Fault on his Fellow? How could they command? Who would obey? What

could they safely either do or omit? Who knows a People, that knoweth not, that sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Opinion maketh them hope; which if it be not presently answered, they fall into Hate, chusing and refusing, erecting and overthrowing, as every Wind of Passion doth puff? What steddiness in their Will or Desire, which having so many Circles of Imagination, can never be enclosed in one Point?</p>
            <p>And whereas you write, That God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways approveth the Will and Judgment of the People, as being properly the Judge of the whole Business; and that every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Man must simply submit himself there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, without further inquisition, although at divers times they determine Contraries, (as they did between the Houses of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> and <hi>York</hi>) because we must presume they were led by different Respects. You seem not obscurely to erect thereby another pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileged Power upon Earth, which cannot err, which doth not deceive.</p>
            <p>But it may be some honest-minded Man will say, That howsoever you write, your meaning was otherwise: You write also afterward, That in two Cases every Private Man is bound to resist the Judgment of the whole People, to the uttermost extent of his Ability.

But this Exception is so large, that it devoureth the whole Rule: for in Actions of this quality, the Original is always by Faction; the Accomplishment by Force, or at least by Fear, howsoever they are sometimes countenanced with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the State. So <hi>Sylla,</hi> having brought his Legions within the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> obtained the Law <hi>Valeria</hi> to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, whereby he was created Dictator for twenty four Years; by means of which Force, <hi>Cicero</hi> affirmeth <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> that it was no Law. Likewise <hi>Lawrence Medices,</hi> having an Army within <hi>Florence,</hi> caused, or rather constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Citizens to elect him Duke. When <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was chosen King, he held Forty thousand Men in Arms. And this is most evident by your own Example, of four contrary Acts of Parliament, which at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times were made, during the Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the Families of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> not upon different Reasons, as with little reason you affirm, but upon different Success of either Side.</p>
            <p>In Matters of this moment, the orderly
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98890:87"/>
Course of Proceeding is onely by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Parliament must be summoned by the King's Writ, and no Act thereof hath Life but by express Consent of the King. If this Form had always been obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, neither our Kings should have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, nor the next Successors excluded, nor the Title of the Crown entangled, to the inestimable both weakning and waste of all the Realm.</p>
            <p>Your second Exception is, When such a Man is preferred to the Crown, by whom God is manifestly offended, and the Realm prejudiced or endangered: In which Case (you say) every Man, with a free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlled Conscience, may resist what he can.</p>
            <p>It was even here I looked for you. Your broyling Spirits do nothing else but fling Firebrands, and heap on Wood, to set King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in Combustion. What Rebellion, what Revolt hath ever been made, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some of these Pretences? What Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Actions, either by malicious or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Interpretation, may not easily be drawn to one of these Heads? You are a Nursery of War in the Commonwealth, a Seminary of Schism and Division in the Church: In sum, All your Actions, all your Thoughts are barbarous and bloody.</p>
            <p>You write much of Right and Justice;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98890:88"/>
but you measure the Right and Justice of a Cause, by the Advantage of your own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. You speak as having a tender sense of the Glory of God; but you stretch out your Throat with high Words of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction against him. You make shew of Care to preserve the State; but you are like the Ivy, which seemeth outwardly both to embrace and adorn the Wall, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to inwardly it doth both eat and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. For, what Means, either more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or forcible, to overthrow a State, than Faction and intestine Quarrels? And what other Milk do you yield? What are your Opinions, what your Exhortations, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to set or to hold up Sedition and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed? St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us not to resist high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Powers <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.</note>, although both cruel and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane; you teach us to resist them what we can. The Apostle is followed of all the Ancient Fathers of the Church; you are followed of those onely who follow the <hi>Anabaptists.</hi> For my part, I had rather err with the Apostle in this Opposition, than hold Truth with you. But I will speak more moderately in a Subject of such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: I will not say then, That I had rather err; but, That I shall less fear to err, in not resisting, with the Apostle, than in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, with you. <hi>New Counsels are always more plausible than safe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After you have plaid the <hi>Suffenus</hi> with your self, in setting the Garland upon your
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98890:88"/>
own Head, and making your imaginary Audience to applaud your Opinion, as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfully wise, you proceed to declare what ought chiefly to be regarded, in furthering or hindering any Prince towards the Crown. Three Points (you say) are to be required in every Prince; Religion, Chivalry, and Justice: And putting aside the two last, as both handled by others, and of least im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, you assume onely to treat of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; wherein either Errour or Want doth bring inestimable Damage to any State.</p>
            <p>You draw a long Discourse, That the highest End of every Commonwealth is the Service and Worship of God; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, That the Care of Religion is the principal Charge which pertaineth to a King. And therefore you conclude, That whatsoever Prince doth not assist his Subjects to attain this End, omitteth the chief part of his Charge, and committeth High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against his Lord, and is not fit to hold that Dignity, though he perform the other two Parts never so well: And that no Cause can so justly clear the Conscience, whether of the People, or of particular Men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting the Entrance of any Prince, as if they judge him faulty in Religion.</p>
            <p>This is neither nothing, nor all which you say. In Elective States, the People ought not to admit any Man for King, who is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cold or corrupt in Religion; but if
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98890:89"/>
they have invested such a one with Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Authority, they have no Power at pleasure to remove him. In Successive King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, wherein the People have no Right of Election, it is not lawful for Private Men, upon this cause, to offer to impeach eith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r the Entrance or Continuance of that King, which the Laws of the State do present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; not onely because it is forbidden of God, (for that is the least part of your regard) but because disorderly Disturbance of a setled Form in Government, traineth after it more both Impieties and Dangers, than hath ever ensued the Imperfections of a King.</p>
            <p>I will come more close to the Point in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, and dispel those foggy Reasons which stand between your Eye and the Truth. There are two Principal Parts of the Law of God; the one Moral, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, which containeth three Points, Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in our selves, Justice towards others, and generally also Reverence and Piety towards God: The other is Supernatural, which containeth the true Faith of the Mysteries of our Salvation, and the special kind of Worship that God doth require. The first God hath delivered by the Ministry of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to all Men; the second he doth partly reveal, and partly inspire to whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: and therefore although most Nations have in some sort observed the one, yet have they not onely erred, but failed in the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:98890:89"/>During the time of the Law, this peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Worship of God was appropriate onely to the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> in a corner Kingdom of the World: The flourishing Empires of the <hi>Assyrians, Medes, Persians, Aegyptians, Graecians, Syrians,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> either knew it not, or held it in contempt. The <hi>Israelit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the time of Grace, the true Mysteries both of Worship and Belief were impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed also to other Nations; but the ordinary Means to propagate the same, was neither by Policy, nor by Power.

            <p>Seeing therefore that this is appointed the odinary means, both to establish and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease Religion, may we adventure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change it with humane devices?

You have always bin like a winter Sun, strong enough to raise Vapours, but unable to dispel them. For most cowardly

Companions may set up strife; but it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with the hazzard, and ended with the ruine, always of the worthiest, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of all.</p>
            <p>The sum is this. So long as we express pure piety, both in our Doctrine and in our doings, all will go well: but when we make a mixture of divine and humane both Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power; when we preach policy; when we make a common trade of Treason; when we put no difference between Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Conceit; we must needs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw either Religion or our selves.</p>
            <p>Now I will answer the Reasons of your Assertion. First you say, That if Princes do not assist their Subjects in the honour and service of God in this life, God should draw no other fruit or commodity from humane Societies, then of an Assembly of brutish Creatures. But this Reason is not only weak, as it may appear by that which hath been said, but also brutish, and (which is worse) prophane. For what fruit, what commodity doth God draw from Societies of men? is not his Glory perfect in it self? can we add any thing to the excellency thereof? hath he any need of our broken worship? God is an absolute Being, both comprehending, and exceeding all Perfections: an Infinite Being, therefore his sufficiencies neither can be encreased, nor depend upon any, but only of himself. He was from Eternity without any
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98890:92"/>
world, and a thousand worlds more cannot at all encrease his felicity and glory: he did create the world, not to participate any thing thereof, but to communicate from himself unto it. Hereupon <hi>Iob</hi> saith <note n="g" place="margin">22.3.</note>, <hi>What profit is it to God if thou be just? What advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is it to him if thy wayes be clean?</hi> Surely we must be better enformed of the soundness of your judgment, before we dare depend upon the authority of your word.</p>
            <p>You put us in mind that you compared an Heir apparant to a Spouse, betroathed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not married to the common wealth. I remember it well; but I did not take you for such a widower of wit, that you could think it worthy to be repeated. And ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that which hereupon you deduce out of S. <hi>Paul</hi> maketh altogether against you. <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith <note n="h" place="margin">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Now if you will needs make a marriage between a King and his Subjects, you might hereupon conclude, that if an infidel King will hold his state, the people may not dispossess him.</p>
            <p>And wheras you affirme, That all they who differ in any point of Religion, and stand wilfully in the same, are Infidels the one to the other, you shew both a violence and weakness of mind. For obstinate Error in certain Articles of Faith, and not in the

The Apostle speaketh when an action is of it self indifferent, but a weak Conscience judgeth it evil, being also evil by circumstance, in offending o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: you speak where an action is good in it self, but an erronious conscience judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it evil. I allow, that a good action contrary to conscience is unprofitable; but

But where you write with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either authority or proof, that to assist, or not to resist the advancement or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any King, whom we judge faulty in Religion, is a most damnable sin, of what side soever the truth be; you breath out most filthy and unsavory smoke; you lift up your voice into high blasts of blasphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the most High.</p>

            <p>Certainly if we had received no such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement from God, the regard of the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et of humane societies is sufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm your Heritical Assertion: for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are many different professions of Religion, not only in the World, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in every Nation of the World: seeing also, Cas <hi>Philo</hi> saith <note n="t" place="margin">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98890:94"/>
can there be of Life or of State, where the Sword beareth sway upon such occasions, and that guided by hands both Tumultuous and fierce. And seeing among many Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there can be but one Truth, if all Men should be obstinately bent against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of any, who in their Judgment is Faulty in Religion; what likelihood can we either conceive or conjecture, but that many Errors would soon prevail against the only Truth. And therefore 'tis far more moderate and safe, to use the ordinary means both of maintaining and propagating the truth, and to commit the success there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto God; and (as <hi>Iosephus</hi> adviseth) not to offer either con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>umelie or violence against any Religion, lest we provoke thereby the Professors thereof to do the like against ours.</p>
            <p>Your last Reason is drawn from Policy and consideration of State; because a King will neither trust nor favour, much less ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him, that is not of the same Religion with himself: but to the contrary, he shall be Subject to all molestations, injuries and other aversions, which are incident to those who are not current with the present course of affairs.</p>
            <p>Oh Sir; this is the <hi>Helene</hi> for which you contend; you concur in opinion with those <hi>Athenians</hi> of whom <hi>Alexander</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded divine honours; not so obstinately to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98890:94"/>
defend Heaven, as to lose the benefit of the Earth. This is the mark whereat you aime, this is the Compass whereby you sail; as divers flowers do open and close, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Motion of the Sun; so accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the variation hereof, you extend or restrain your plyant Conscience as you please.</p>
            <p>But the Appostle teacheth us to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to higher Powers, for Conscience sake <note n="u" place="margin">

            <p>Besides, all Princes are not of that dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition whereof you speak. <hi>Suidas</hi> writeth of one, who changeing Religion to please his King, was therefore adjudged to lose his head; one being appointed to cry at the time of his Execution; <hi>He that keepeth not Faith with God, what sound Conscience can he bear towards Men?</hi> The Protestants in <hi>France</hi> are not alltogether cast either out of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or out of Charge: and many Roman Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> do enjoy their full part, of all the plenty and pleasures that the Realme can afford.</p>
            <p>Lastly, what have you to do with Reasons of State? This is the Eagles Feather which consumeth your devotion. Your Office is to meditate, to pray, to instruct men in pure Devotion, to settle their Souls in Piety and in Peace. But do you contain your selves within these limits? nothing less. You take
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98890:95"/>
upon you the Policy of State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you rend and deface the reputation of Kings; you make your selves both judges and moderators of all their actions, allowing them to fly no further then you give them wings. You dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose not only their Affairs, but their Crowns at your pleasure; you hunt them not to Covert but to Death. You contrive ways to compass your designs; you train up your Followers in the high mistery of Treason; you cast into every Realm the Apple of Strife: your Doctrine is to no other use but as Drumms, Fifes, and Trumpets, to Incense Fury.</p>
            <p>To these ends you wrest Scriptures, you corrupt Histories, you counterfeit Reasons, you corrupt all Truth (pardon my plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness I pray you, I have not attended to your dexterity in disguising matters with smooth terms) you are obstinate to hazard rather all dangers, then to be cut off from one point of your purpose. You acknowledge no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion but your Will, no Law, but your Power: all Lies, Treacheries, and Frauds do change their Nature, and become both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and laudable actions, when they bear for the advantage of your affairs.</p>
            <p>But this is directed to devotion, (you will say) and as you terme it, <hi>ordine ad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, for a holy and Religious end.</hi> Away then with your devotion, and so we shall be rid of your dangerous deceit. Away I say with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98890:95"/>
your devotion; or else we will conclude of you as <hi>Livie</hi> did of <hi>Anniball: Nihil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> veri, nihil sancti, nullus deum metus nullum jusjurandum, nulla religio.</hi>
