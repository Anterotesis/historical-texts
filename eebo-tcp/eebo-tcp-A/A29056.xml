            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The</hi> CASE <hi>and</hi> USAGE <hi>of Mr.</hi> Edward Bagſhaw.</head>
            <p>ON <hi>January</hi> 3. 1662. I living then peaceably in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> by a Servant of Sir <hi>John Bernard,</hi> one of the Juſtices of Peace of our Country, was ſerved with a Warrant, ſubſcribed by Sir <hi>Henry Bennet,</hi> wherein <hi>my Perſon</hi> was commanded to be <hi>ſeized, with my Books and Papers:</hi> This was brought to me about ſeven a clock at night, and though I might well have pleaded the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonableneſs of travelling at that hour, yet to ſhew how willing I was to clear my ſelf, that very night I rode ſeven Miles to Sir <hi>John Bernard</hi>'s Houſe, where I lodged, and ſpent the Lord's Day following.</p>
            <p>On Monday, <hi>Jan.</hi> 5. though the Weather was ſo tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that Sir <hi>John</hi> did very civilly intimate his willingneſſ to let me ſtay; yet, leſt any Delay might ſeem to argue Guilt, I refuſed his courteous offer, and that day rode to <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable;</hi> which was about 25 Miles, in ſo much Wet, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Zeal to clear my Innocence, could have made me ſo willingly venture through it.</p>
            <p>On Tueſday, <hi>Jan.</hi> 6. from <hi>Dunſtable</hi> I rode to <hi>London,</hi> where I arrived about one a clock: and though I was deſired, after ſo long a Journey, to ſtay and refreſh my ſelf; yet, ſo impatient was I to know my Crime, that, without either eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in my Riding Habit, I went immediately to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Bennet,</hi> by whom I was examined about three in the afternoon, but ſo ſlightly, that I plainly ſaw he was not himſelf ſatisfied, that I deſerved any of that kind of Rigour; yet, whether becauſe he was bound by his Place to comply with the Information of my Accuſers, o<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 words">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29805:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſent me forthwith to the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> and committed me <hi>Cloſe-Priſoner, for Dangerous and Seditious Words and Practices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that place I abode ten dayes, after which time, the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour</hi> (who now appeared as the ſole Author of my Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſent for me to <hi>Worceſter-houſe,</hi> and in his Chamber (the Secretary being preſent) asked me ſeveral captious and enſnaring Queſtions; As, <hi>Whether I had never ſaid that the Long-Parliament was in Being?</hi> And, <hi>Whether I did not affirm, That by the Spring there would be a Change?</hi> And, <hi>Whether I had never ſpoken Derogatory words of the King, by ſaying that he kept Wenches,</hi> and the like? To all which, when I had, as I thought, given ſatisfactory Anſwers, I deſired I might be brought to a <hi>Tryal:</hi> but was anſwered, <hi>That ſhould be when the King pleaſed:</hi> Upon which I was remanded to the <hi>Gate-houſe;</hi> but that afternoon, <hi>viz.</hi> upon <hi>Jan.</hi> 16. I was fetched from thence, and ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> whither I was committed <hi>Cloſe-Priſoner</hi> by a New Warrant, the words of my former being changed, into, <hi>Treaſonable Deſigns and Practices:</hi> But for what Reaſon that Alteration was made, I as yet know not, having often deſired a <hi>Tryal,</hi> but could not obtain it.</p>
            <p>With what unhandſom Circumſtances of Rigorous Reſtraint I was uſed there, I ſhall now forbear to mention, becauſe a few words cannot expreſs that matter: but in ſhort, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I was forced to give ten pieces in Gold to Sir <hi>John Robinſon,</hi> to purchaſe the Liberty of Tower Air, and beſides paid thirty ſhillings a week for my Diet and Lodging, yet I was given to the Arbitrary Diſpoſal of an Abſurd and Drunken Keeper, who being himſelf <hi>a ſlave to his Luſts,</hi> was thought the fitteſt perſon to oppreſs the ſpirit of one, who never was guilty of any <hi>State-crime,</hi> but the deſiring of a <hi>ſober Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this condition I continued above a year, ſo hopeleſs of Redreſs, that I never did attempt to ſeek it; when on <hi>Jan.</hi> 30. 1663. one Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> (whom I had heard much, and written ſomething of, but never ſaw before) came to ſearch my cha<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in my Window found a Paper, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Mr. <hi>Davis,</hi> who was then newly ſent to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29805:2"/>
               <hi>Fangier</hi> in a very Extraordinary manner; In which Paper, there were, it ſeems, ſome <hi>Marginal Notes</hi> likely to give Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and therefore it was in all haſt conveyed to <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> as a Diſcovery worthy the Diligence of ſuch a Needy and Officious Informer.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Feb.</hi> 2. following, I was ſent for to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and by the King himſelf examined about that Paper; not whether I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived or writ it (for that, as Sir <hi>John Robinſon</hi> afterwards told me, the King was ſatisfied I had no hand in) but <hi>how,</hi> and by <hi>whom</hi> it was conveyed to me? To whoſe Queſtions, though I anſwered in words of Truth and Sobriety, yet becauſe I durſt not do a thing ſo unworthy of the Goſpel, as to betray another; and becauſe I could not humble my Language to the <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>flattering ſtile</hi> of Court (for though I was called <hi>Rogue,</hi> and uſed like one, yet I could not forget that I was a <hi>Miniſter of the Gospel,</hi> and therefore was enabled to ſpeak with that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy which became one.) For this I was returned back by the King, in a Paſſion, much greater than his Title; and that very night, about eleven a clock at night, I was by Sir <hi>John Robinſon</hi> committed to the <hi>Tower-Dungeon;</hi> where I continued four dayes and four nights, without either <hi>Bed, Fire, Candle,</hi> or any thing elſe, that, as to humane conveniencies, could make my Life deſirable: Beſides the Diſmal Horrour of that place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the time afflicted with the <hi>Piles,</hi> in ſo great extremity, that the very vehemence of pain did often put me into a ſweat, and ſo by accident prevented my feeling the cold, which at that time of the year, and in that place, was more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily piercing.</p>
            <p>On Saturday, <hi>Feb.</hi> 6. about three in the afternoon I was releaſed from thence, without any ſeeking of my own, but by the <hi>unwearied Importunity</hi> of my Eldeſt Brother, and (that I may be juſt in commemorating, as I think, an Effect of Real Worth) by the generous and compaſſionate reſentment of Sir <hi>Henry Bennet</hi> the Secretary, by whoſe Warrant I was returned to my former Lodgings, and by his Interceſſion, preſerved from being remanded into the Dungeon, which, by Sir <hi>John Robinſon</hi> the very next day after, was moſt maliciouſly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely ſollicited.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:29805:3"/>
Though I came out of the Dungeon with ſo much Health, as made it evidently appear that God himſelf did own and preſerve me there, yet within three dayes after, I fell into a violent Feaver, which brought me very low; And though God did then likewiſe deliver me from the Fury of it, yet Sir <hi>John Robinſon</hi> was not wanting to do his part that it might prove <hi>mortal;</hi> forbidding not onely my Brothers, but likewiſe my Phyſician acceſs to me, notwithſtanding both He and They had an expreſs Order for their free Admittance.</p>
            <p>I am ſcarcely yet well recovered, when this News comes, that I am to be ſent away I know not whither;—And ſince I underſtand that every part of this Proceeding againſt me, is contrary, not only to God's, but likewiſe to our <hi>Engliſh Laws,</hi> I thought fit to leave this Narrative behind me, that it may be preſented to the ſcanning of all ſober and virtuous Men in the approaching Parliament: And if they find that one Innocent Perſon cannot ſuffer unjuſtly, but all are threatned; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Honour of the Nation ſuffers, which conſiſts in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Right done to all its Members; I ſhall then expect a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, equal to my Injuries; At leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I may be reſtored unto my <hi>Birth-right,</hi> and that is, my <hi>Liberty.</hi>
