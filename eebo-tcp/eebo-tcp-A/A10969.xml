            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The boddie to put him in minde, of his slauerie: the minde of his soueraigntie. The boddie of his misery, the minde of his felicitie. The boddie of his mortalitie, the minde of his eternitie. For by the one vve participate the nature of beastes, by the other of Angels. By the one vve are for a tyme, by the other vve continue for euer. By the one vve die, by the other vve liue. Such as they are, such are their goodes. For the goodes of the boddie lasteth not, but leaueth vs: the goodes of the minde more increase in vs, the more vve esteeme of them, and the elder vve grovve, the more they prosper. For beutie, strength, health, and other giftes of the boddie, either by tyme doo vanishe, or perishe by sicknesse: but vvisedome and other

For vvhat is more hurtfull to our mindes then is riches, good cheere, and life? and vvhat is more gratefull to the boddie, for by them it continueth? vvhat is more profitable to the boddie, then to be vvell nourished? and vvhat is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious to the minde, for thereby it is kept in seruitude?

                  </gap>e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Peripatetions</hi> in this point too prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall. For (as termeth them <hi>Lactantius</hi>) furious and mad are the <hi>Stoikes,</hi> which are so farre from tempering them, that they woulde cut of, and as it were gelde men of those thinges which are grafted and planted in them by nature. Which what other thing is it, then from <hi>Hartes</hi> feare: from Snakes poyson: fearcenesse from wyld Beasts, from tame quietnes to take awaye? for looke what particular and speciall thinges are geuen to wylde Beastes, those are to bée founde in one man altogether. And if true it be which Phisitions affyrme, that cherefulnesse hath abiding in the Splene, anger in the Gaule, luste in the Lyuer, and feare in the harte, then easier is it to slay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then to plucke any thing out of the bodie, that is to alter the naturel &amp; disposition of man.</p>
               <p>But these wyse men perceaue not that when they take vices out of man, they take vertue also, which only they would, should haue the rule and gouernment of him. For if it be the part or propertie of vertue, in the mydst of anger to brydle &amp; suppresse that vnruly affection (which
<pb facs="tcp:16599:14"/>
they can not deny) then must he néeds be without vertue, which is without anger: and if is be vertue to contain y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> insatiable desire of the flesh within his bounds, then must he needes lacke vertue, which is without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lust which he should asswage: &amp; againe if it be a part of vertue to bridle the desire from coueting that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans, then can he haue no vertue which hath not that in the suppressing of which the vse and office of vertue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth. And therefore except there bée passions and perturbations in man, ther is no place for vertue. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as there is no victorie, where as there is no aduersary. And therfore how precise in their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Stoikes</hi> haue bene, it may easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. Now the <hi>Perip.</hi> saye that a man shoulde be affectioned, but yet <hi>modicè</hi> meanly, and in his passions kéepe a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: As though that then he should fall into none offence. But, as he offendeth aswell which goeth softlye, as he which runneth, if they both wander and be out of the waye: euen so is he aswell to bée reprehended, which is subiect to pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations, though it be but in measure, as he which immoderatly doth serue them, if both be vnlawfull. For as directly to
<pb facs="tcp:16599:15"/>
walke is good, and to goe astraye daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: so to be moued with affections to a good purpose is commendable, but to an yll ende and purpose altogether dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. For a more illustration, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning desyre of the fleshe, though it bée without measure, as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as it is in law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Mariage, is without blame: but if it once desire another mans wyfe, though it be not in such burning, and vehement wyse is a most horrible crime. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be angrie, to couet, to lust, is no offence, but to be an angrie, a couetous, and a lecherous man, deserueth great reproche. For he which is an angrye man, is moued, when he should not: and he which is couetous, desyreth which he ought not: and the lecherous hunteth after that which is vnlawfull. So that neyther can we saye with the <hi>Stoikes,</hi> that a man ought not, neither with the <hi>Peripatetions,</hi> that one shoulde some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what sharply without any respect serue his affections: when as necessarye it is that perturbations should raigne for the illustratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vertue, and to haue them but a lytle, if it be not in respect of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and to a good entent is much to bée
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16599:15"/>
reprehended. And therefore as that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is alwayes standing, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer runneth, must néedes bée noysome and infectious: so that man, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer moued in mind, can neuer be eyther good to himselfe, or profitable to others. But haue them we must, and vse them we maye (and that aboundauntly) in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest wyse. And therefore the ende of our affections, make them eyther good, and so to be commended: or bad, &amp; therefore to be dispraised. And thus briefly of the perturbations in general, and of the vse of them.</p>

               <p>ANger is defined after two sortes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to her nature,<note place="margin">

                  </note> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her effect. Those which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the nature of it say, it is a heate of blood, and inflaming of the same, euen to the innermost part of man. According to the effect it is thus defined: Anger is a lust or desire to punishe, or to be reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on him, which seemeth to haue hurt vs.<note place="margin">Wrath, what.</note> Wrath is a desire to be reuenged, seekinge a tyme or oportunitie for the

same. The one of these consisteth in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite and disposition, the other in déede and effect. <hi>Lactantius</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lact. lib. de vero cultu.</hi>
                  </note> that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Superiours towardes their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, that is, of Magistrates towardes wicked violatours of the lawe, is good and profitable for a common weale, but when inferiour personnes are moued with the same one against another, then is it both daungerous and damnable: daungerous because that if they shoulde be resisted, it must néedes followe that some be hurt or slaine, from whence ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth part taking, dissention, and warre: and damnable, because it is against the commaundement of God, who wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs to be in loue and charitie with all men.

                  </note> I doo not here contende, that as at all tyme, so especially in this our age it is a harde thing to alter the minde, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly to plucke awaye that which by custome is come to an habite: but this I
<pb facs="tcp:16599:27"/>
admonish you, that if you can not auoide it, that before your minde bee occupied with anger, then reason coulde foresee it shoulde be occupied, you ought so to frame your selfe, and daily haue this in minde, Anger should be resisted. And when anger most doth moue you, then shoulde you most carefullie kéepe the tongue: which thing to doo, seemeth to mee as great a vertue, as not to bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie at all. For at no tyme to be angrie is not onely a great poynt of grauitie, but of gentlenesse, but for to temper both talke and thought, when you are angrie, or else to holde your peace, and to suppresse the motion and griefe of minde, although it be not of perfect wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet is it a token of a rare wytte: Hitherto <hi>Cicero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next and thirde in order is Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,<note place="margin">Palenes, what.</note> which is called an anger newly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, or but newly beginning, and after a litle whyle is quickly gone. A man so affected is soone hote, and soone colde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause reason ouercommeth the outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of the passion. For if it shoulde persist and continue long, it would easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to hatred. Which according to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16599:27"/>
the minde of <hi>Cicero,</hi> is an olde grudge:<note place="margin">Hatred, what.</note> or as <hi>Zeno</hi> defineth. It is a certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire by which we wishe ill to some body, that so we maye come eyther to welth, promocion or profite.</p>
               <p>Here it is not impertinent to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish Hatred from Anger: for they may seeme to be all one, and to haue the same nature:<note place="margin">

For (saith he) Anger springeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an iniurie done vnto vs: but hatred of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes is conceiued of none occasion. For by and by, as sone as we conceyue an yll opinion of any man, at the same tyme we beginne to hate. Againe, we are angrie with some perticular perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, with this man, or that man? but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred most commonly is against a whole company: as euery man that hath the feare of God before his eyes, hateth all droonkardes, théeues, whoremongers, and generally, all wicked men lewdly bent. Againe, tyme can aswage anger, but hatred once rooted, can not be (or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hardly) pluckt from the hart. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, he which is angrie desireth to bring vexation and griefe, to him whome he
<pb facs="tcp:16599:28"/>
is offended withall: but he which hateth seeketh to destroy. An angrie man wyll be known: but an hater cares not much for that. The thing which an angry man wyll doo, may be sensibly perceiued: but the hurts which a hater doth, can not by sense be knowne, as iniustice, sclander, and such like. Besides, griefe doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Anger, but Hatred is without griefe, and paste al shame. Furthermore Anger is driuen away by reuenge, but hatred no calamitie can put away. To conclude, he which is angrie desireth to haue him vexed, with whome he is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, but he which hateth, desireth his death, whome he doth hate.</p>

Loue is good, and to be followed. His wordes be these: To a man tormented with Loue, this salue shoulde be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred.

               <p>IN our begynning, we deuided Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations into two sorts, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect or iudgement of Good, or of Euyll.

Of the former we haue alreadie spoken sufficiently: nowe let vs in lyke sort illustrate, and make plaine those which followe. And first we wyll speake of Feare, and of his partes.<note place="margin">Feare what.</note> Which <hi>Cicero,</hi> according to the opinion of the <hi>Stoikes,</hi> defineth to be an opinion of some Euyll comming towards vs, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che séemeth to be intollerable. <hi>Varro</hi> thinketh this feare to haue his deriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the mouing of the minde, and <hi>Metus</hi> he sayth, is <hi>quasi motus animi,</hi>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation, &amp; Fearefulnesse: As vnméete for euery man. The <hi>Stoikes</hi> with whom the auncient <hi>Academikes</hi> agree, doo say, that there be three good affections, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to vertue, to wyt Gladnesse, Wyll, and Héede.<note place="margin">Gladnes. Wyll.

By which they seeme to infer, that a wise and valiant man, shoulde alwayes be heedefull, but neuer fearefull. For as <hi>Tullie</hi> sayth, there is more euyl in fearing, then in that which is feared. To this agreeth that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> for he supposed Fortitude to be a science,<note place="margin">Fortitude what. <hi>Hannibal.</hi>

It is the greatest token of victorie, when a Captaine is couragious, and it bringeth a stomacke to souldiors, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde theyr guides not to be dastardes, but manfully to stande vnto it.</p>

And he was so farre from feare, that vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously he woulde doo all thinges: as maye appeare. For being on a tyme in great daunger, neither coulde he ouercome without great slaughter of his men, was counsayled by <hi>Parmenio,</hi> by craft in the night to encounter,<note place="margin">

Their conclusion is, that a man, yea a wyse man, ought not only to haue pittie, but also many other Perturbations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring them to the encrease of vertue.

This Enuie is compared vnto the Canker.<note place="margin">Cankered Enuie.</note> For as the Canker eateth and destroieth iron, so doth enuie eate and consume the hartes of the enuious. The Poets faine Enuie to be one of the furies of Hell, and to be fedde with nothing but adders &amp; snakes: to shewe that enuious persons, doo swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe downe poyson, and lykewise vomit vp the same againe.

               <p>Therfore did <hi>Politian</hi> write very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly vnto an enuious man,<note place="margin">

It bringeth likewise infamie vnto those which are infected with the same, when they wyll contende and challenge theyr betters. As it dyd vnto <hi>Marsyas,</hi> which would (him selfe being rude and vnskyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in Musike) contend with <hi>Apollo,</hi>

               <p>But there is an other Emulation, which is good and commendable. And it is a studie, and endeuouring by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to be lyke another man, and yet

                  </note> and sad.

vnreasonable sadnesse, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to persecute all mankinde with hatred, and men gathered the same, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was in no company merie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tooke he delyght in any. And but once in al his lyfe, he was séene to laugh, and that was at such a tyme, when as (a great sort being in company) all others were sad: and being demaunded, why at that tyme he brake into laughter, none else being merie? aunswered, because I haue no companion. By which aunswer of <hi>Myson,</hi> it is gathered, that sad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons care for no company, but take most delyght when they are alone. But nowe to come to the cause hereof:<note place="margin">Causes of sadnes.</note> no maruayle though déepe and profounde meditation bring the same, and cause men to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to be alone. For nature hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to euerie man two places, or recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles of all his cogitations, one is the braine, the other the harte, both being furnished with cogitations, néedes must a man be vnquiet, and proane to sadnes, for to the braine haue recourse all the senses of mans boddie, which as they were messengers, bring newes of al such exteriour thinges, which are obiect vnto
<pb facs="tcp:16599:66"/>
them: and therefore running continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therevnto, suffereth the braine neuer quietly to rest, but alwayes with imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations trouble it. But the hart by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that it is more cloase and secréete, is lesse assaulted with the senses: And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mind of man, when it hath some great, and graue cogitation, flieth vnto the hart, as to a more quiet place, where he maye the better iudge trueth from falsehoode, and according to reason geue sentence of euerie thing. And so we (by the example of the minde) when we are in any cogitation of weight, séeke the moste secréete place frée from all noyse, that so we may neither sée those thinges which wyl trouble our minds, nor heare that which may driue vs from the same into some other matter. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, sadnesse may be well commended, and taken for a great grauity,<note place="margin">Sadnesse commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</note> which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers doo much praise: and hereof it comes that <hi>Lucilius</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> haue called Philosophers graue, sad, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere, epithetons geuen in good parte to their comendations. And <hi>Terence</hi> sayth: There is a sad seueritie in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, &amp; faithfulnesse in words, wherby
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16599:66"/>
it appeareth that sadnesse somtime is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a good qualitie. And as there is an vngratious, so is there a vertuous, which is a token of no lyght person, but of one whose behauiour is such, as his desire is to be accompted graue, as were Philosophers, and are all wyse and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men. Therefore ought euery man so prepare him selfe, that not so much as a shewe of that harde, bitter, and sowre sadnesse, which hath alwayes bene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of none, but contemned of all wyse men, shoulde appeare in him: but this graue and seuere sadnesse, ought not onely to be wished for, but laboured for, that so, he maye be nombred among the graue, and wyser sort of men.</p>

                  </note> &amp; therefore is it next adioyned vnto the same, and is defined of <hi>Cicero</hi> to be a doleful, or wéeping sorrowfulnesse, It is named in Latin <hi>Moeror</hi>: &amp; that is, deriued from the Latin verbe <hi>Maresco,</hi> which signifieth to drye, or wyther.
<pb facs="tcp:16599:67"/>
Because that this Pensiuenesse withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the bodie of man. But if any be not content with that deriuation, they maye thinke the same to be fetcht eyther from the Greeke verbe <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which is is by chaunce to get a thing. But whiche of these opinions are true, greatly it skylleth not, and yet there bée which thinke this worde to be deriued of eyther of them. Nowe to my purpose. This wofull Sorrow is a Perturbation which ought not to be in a discréete and wise man. For it is a manifest signe and token of an effeminate &amp; woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And not without good cause it is so iudged: for it weakeneth the string or vaines of vertue, and maketh them in al theyr doing negligent, &amp; of no strength or power to accomplishe any good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise:<note place="margin">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16599:67"/>
And theyr custome was so narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, that almost none were founde, no not among the weake sorte, which eyther would groane, or geue any signe of griefe, when they were in paine: and if any dyd in his calamities shedde but one teare, he was not onely derided of his fellowes, but also brought againe to the altar, there to be greeuously tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for his not obseruing theyr cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome. Hereof it procéeded that the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> of all people, in peace and warre, proued the most valiaunt.

                  </note> because they were free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this pensiue sorrowfulnesse.

               <head>¶Of the goodes of Fortune. Chap. 2.</head>
               <p>THe Philosophers, &amp; other vnfaithfull heathens, considering the mutability of all thinges, and the small assuraunce that man hath of any thing, haue suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed this world to bee gouerned by some blinde or beastly God.<note place="margin">Fortune discribed.</note> And hereof came the fiction of Fortune, which is of aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente, both Poets and painters fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be blinde, brutishe and frantike, and so to stande vppon a rounde stone, distributing worldly thinges. She is thought to be blinde, because she besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth her gifts without consideration of Persons: Brutishe, because she rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth most commonly, the most vngodly: without iudgement, Mad, because she is waywarde, cruell and vnconstant: stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding not vpon a square stone, for that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth, but vppon a rounde one, for that slideth continually. And therefore she is compted as brittle as glasse, and nothing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16599:77"/>
or more vnstable. And yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, at her pleasure she bestoweth all thinges: which <hi>Virgill</hi> confirmeth, for he ascribeth vnto her this lytle Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent: and <hi>Saluste</hi> sayeth, that in all thinges Fortune beareth swaye. But let them as Heathens, and without the knowledge of the true God, imagine what they liste, yet let vs thinke, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue none to bee Omnipoten, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the worlde, and that which is in the same, but onely our God, not Fortune: and that he doeth all thinges, not rashly without reason, but prouidently to our preseruation: and that he is not mad in his doings, but mightie and maruelous, and doth all thinges to the comfort of his electe. For if the vertuous be pinched with pouertie, or plaged with any kinde of aduersity, they ought with Christe to saye, <hi>Their kingdome is not of this worlde:</hi> if the vitious be puffed with plentie, or placed in all kinde of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, the good shoulde perswade them selues, that though they florishe, yet a tyme wyll come, when a straighte ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt shall be asked, and those wicked stewards shal be throwne headlong into
<pb facs="tcp:16599:78"/>
that lake which burneth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually with fire and brimstone, where is weeping &amp; gnashing of teeth. Yet wyl we somwhat follow the Philosophers (&amp; yet so as our opinion shalbe that there is a God, &amp; that nothing happeneth by chaunce, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune vnto man, but by the espetiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of almighty God) and with the ruder sort we wyl consider what are the goodes of Fortune: which are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber infinite. For they are all such earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things,<note place="margin">Goodes of Fortune.</note> as are geuen of God to the vse of man, or those things which are not in man, but are gotten by man, as Riches, Good wyll of men, Nobilitie, Fame, Aucthority, Honor, many, and vertuous children, and such lyke.

or maye doo vs some great benefite. And therefore the <hi>Athenians</hi> honored <hi>Aristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geton,</hi> and <hi>Harmodius,</hi>

This Honor, as the rewarde of well doing, ought not onely to be desired, but sought for, but yet not by al meanes, or yll meanes, but we must come to the same (as I saide before) by vertue, shee must be our guide, and bringe vs to the place of honor. It hath bene sought for of manye, and yet none purchase the same, and are truly honored of the wise, but onely the vertuous. For when as they hunt after the same immoderatly,<note place="margin">Ambition.</note> not according to the rules of wisedome, they are counted ambitious, and pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked therevnto because they woulde be in the eyes of men gratious, not for any good they meane to the common weale. Such are knowne by theyr fruites, and are honored of flatterers, or other men, because they woulde reape some profite. To haue the true Honor, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced among men, for the sake of vertue, is an espetiall gifte, and one of the chiefest goodes of Fortune.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16599:82"/>
Another of the goodes of Fortune,<note place="margin">Children.</note> is to bee blessed with children, &amp; those in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber many, of nature honest. There was a lawe among the <hi>Spartanes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Spartanes.</hi>
                  </note> that he which had begotten thrée men children, should neyther watche nor warde: and if any had fiue sonnes, shoulde be set free from paying any common fyne, &amp; neuer be troubled with bearing any publyke office, but lyue at his hartes ease, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And the <hi>Romanes</hi> had a company of men called <hi>Proletaries,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proletaries.</hi>
                  </note> vppon whome was neuer any task or fyne set, but they dyd benefite, and pleasure theyr coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey with begettinge children. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainlie, the getting of children is one of the chiefest benefits that can be in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, without which mankinde woulde soone perish and come to naught. And who is he that wyll not iudge that man to bée greatly in Fortunes fauor, which is adorned with many goodly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Or who wyll reprehende that noble <hi>Cornelia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:16599:83"/>
shall stande lyke Oliue braunches round about his table.</hi> Finally what a blessing it is to haue children, let them iudge which want. I haue heard that the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest cause of debate, among many folkes is most commonly barrennes: and some are so desirous of them, that many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes they woulde geue, to haue but one. By whiche it appeareth what a great blessing it is to haue many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, espetially if they be vertuous: else were it better to haue none. For, as we commonly saye, Better vnborne, then vntaught. To haue them well manne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, consisteth in the power of parentes, for if they wyll, they maye be endued with all vertues. Which made <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> to enacte that those parentes in their olde age,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Solon.</hi>
                  </note> shoulde not be relieued of their children, which cared not howe they practised good manners, or profited in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humane literature. And therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> doeth sharply rebuke <hi>Timarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cicero ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</hi> 4. <hi>in Verrem. Timarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>
                  </note> for that being of wicked lyfe, and conuersation him selfe, yet he was not ashamed, to haue his sonne of tender yeares to be a viewer, and a witnesse of his wicked lyuing. And as vehemently

he doeth inueigh against <hi>Verres</hi> for the same faulte,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cicero act.</hi> 6 <hi>in Verré.</hi>
                  </note> because he cared not howe his sonne spent his tyme, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong harlottes, or honest persons. Notable is the example of <hi>Iulia,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnto <hi>Augustus</hi> the Emperour,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iulia.</hi>
                  </note> and maye be a good example to all well dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed parentes, howe they bring vp theyr children. For she being on a tyme coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayled by a deare friende, to leaue her light behauior, and to imitate the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of her noble father, aunswered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously, My father hath forgot that he is an Emperor, and I doo not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he is my father. And surely the readiest waye to make children forget them selues and their friendés, is not by instructing them in good manners when they are yonge. I wyll recite no forraine examples, for Englande can minister mater inough, and euery iayle can beare mee witnesse, howe lytle care parentes haue of theyr childrens good behauior. The cause of <hi>Iulias</hi> wickednesse, was her fathers too much pampering her, and the cause of al wickednesse not onely in this lande, but else where, is the carelesnesse
<pb facs="tcp:16599:84"/>
of parentes. For if they, while they are yonge, eyther did punishe them, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be punished, they would not without great feare and trembling of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende, yea in smallest matters. Nowe (I may very well reason from a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) If the hauing of no children be such a griefe and miserie, not onely to maried folkes, but also to the common weale, then the hauing of them is a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to parentes, and commoditie to a common weale: and againe, if careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of bringing them vp in the studie of vertue, be not onely to them selues a shame and vexation, but vnto theyr neighbors &amp; countreymen hurtfull, and pernicious, then must it néedes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that to haue children well nurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, bringeth no small praise to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, and profite to mankinde. And thus much concerning the goodes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which do illustrate euery man ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much, and cause them to be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all men blessed: But the vertuous they doo place almoste in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Felicitie.</p>

This degree doo all such attaine, which iudge and suppose wisedome onely to consiste in the acknowledginge of that which is supernall: and those onely to be wyse, which bende them selues to the searching out of all celestiall matters, and in theyr lyfe and conuersation, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to expresse that which is onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing vnto the diuine nature. In this felicitie are all the fowre principle ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues perceiued to bee. Prudence in chusing celestiall, refusing that which is earthly.<note place="margin">Prudence</note> As dyd <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> which being demanded (after he had bestowed all his goodes vppon his friendes) why he dyd no more esteeme his countrey?<note place="margin">

So that the first degree seemeth to be but an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and chusing good before euyll: the latter is as it were an habite, and enioying thereof in deede.

                     <hi>Socrates.</hi>
                  </note> that he thought all vertues should be called by the name of Prudence. But <hi>Aristotle</hi> (as being out of the waye) reprehended him, and sayd, that his opinon had beene good, if he had thought no vertue could haue bine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Prudence, but he coulde not saye rightly, that euery one was Prudence. Many and great haue bene the prayses of this vertue. <hi>Apollophanes</hi> a <hi>Stoike</hi> stoode in such admiration thereof,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apollopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi>
                  </note> that he iudged all other vertues in respecte of wisedome nothing worth, that shee was to the rest as a prince to her handmaids.

                  </note> as the sight is better in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie then other senses. Another Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, whose name was <hi>Epicurus,</hi> (which though concerning the chiefest happinesse he erred,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and to springe out of <hi>Iupiters</hi> braine, thereby to shewe, that wisedome is no base, but a diuine thing.

The place from whence it floweth, is not the beastly part concupiscence, but the best, the minde which is immortall. As the Philosophers &amp; Poets say theyr minde, to the extolling of wisedome, so doo the painters discribe what they think of her.

                  <hi>Cicero</hi> deuideth all vertues in two sorts, and calleth them eyther vertues of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, or of conuersation. Those of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he calleth Prudence, &amp; Wisdome: wisedome hee sayeth onely consisteth in contemplation: Prudence in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of common matters. And that he calleth in diuerse considerations Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall, and ciuile. Domesticall when euerie priuate man doth prudently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of his owne affayres: and Ciuile when we bende our selues to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting of the weale publike. To our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
<pb facs="tcp:16599:122"/>
he sayth, doeth belong Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, onely vnder which he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth Iustice, and Fortitude, as bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the same Temperaunce, and vnder those he containeth all those ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of which hereafter we shall speake. But mée thinkes he doeth not properly talke of Temperance, as one of the fowre principall vertues, but rather as they doo consist in a meane, betwéene two mischiefes. But Temperance is otherwyse to bee vnderstoode. For the learned haue deuided vertue into fowre partes principally, to wit, Prudence, Temperance, Fortitude, and Iustice, whiche they woulde neuer haue done, had not Temperance some espetial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration as the other haue. And this is gathered by the definitions, and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Temperance. It is defined to be a vertuous habite of the minde,<note place="margin">Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance what.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we abstaine from all vaine and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilent pleasures, both of minde and boddie. And this doth agrée with that definition of <hi>Cicero,</hi> in his offices, where he sayth, Temperance is the ruler of all troublesomnesse of minde, and a strong
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16599:122"/>
subduer of al vaine pleasures. Wherby it appereth, that as it is the part of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence iustly to discerne good from euyll:<note place="margin">The office of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> so is it of Temperance to abstaine, and that alwayes from hurtfull things. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> sayth, It is the propertie of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, to consist in those things which belong to the keeping of life in mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and vsing the pleasures thereof mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly. And therfore he sayth it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine meane about things belonging to the pleasures of the boddie, as tasting, féeling, hearing, smelling, &amp; seeing. And therfore sayd <hi>Plotinus</hi> very well, that it was the office of Temperance, to couet nothing whereof it shoulde afterwarde repent her, and in no case to goe beyond the boundes of wisedome prescribed. If I shoulde recite the prayses which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed vnto this vertue, I should make a volume thereof, but hauing another thing in hand, I wyll plainly without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Rhetoricall</hi> discourse talke thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leauing her commendations vnto them which haue the leasure of a Philosopher, and the wit of an orator: but this I say, to much to her praise cannot be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16599:123"/>
which is enemie to all pestiferous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and a friende to all vertuous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises. Which is gathered from the etymologie of this worde Temperance. For it is called Temperance, because it keepeth a meane in all those thinges whiche belong to the delighting of the boddie. And he is called a Temperate man,<note place="margin">Who Tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perate.</note> which desireth nothing but that he ought, when he ought, and as he ought: and in all his doings setteth honestie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes, as a marke to leuell the bowe of his cogitations, and shote the dartes of his desires vnto. Therefore Temperance is contrary to pleasure, if it be not honest: and Temperate men are contrarye to those, who set theyr whole delight in the vaine pleasures of the beastly boddie.

               <p>OF the two next vertues (Abstinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and continencie) we wyll make but one Chapter, because they seeme to haue small difference in sense, though in sounde they haue, and yet both in sound, and sense they differ somewhat.<note place="margin">Abstinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>This continencie of <hi>Scipio,</hi> passeth

all the rest. For who woulde thinke that a warrier, from a woman: a lustie young man, from a bewtifull mayden: a conqueror, from a captiue hauing tyme, place, and permission (so that without controlement of any man, he might haue vsed her) woulde containe him selfe, all thinges falling so in the nicke? And yet this noble warrier, lustie youth, and victorious conqueror, entred not familiaritye with this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, this bewtifull mayden, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, because shee had geuen her troth to another. O vnspeakeable vertue, and most wonderfull continencie of this noble <hi>Scipio,</hi> whiche so preferred ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie before lecherie: chastitie before incontinencie: and a faythfull promise, before sinfull pleasure. I maye not in Rhetorical manner enlarge this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (and yet too muche can not be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his prayse) and therefore I leaue it.</p>
               <p>By this then it appeareth, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene Continencie, and Abstinencie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is great similitude,<note place="margin">Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie.</note> and that they haue so, it is euident by theyr contrary.

For Incontinencie is indifferently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto eyther of them.

                  </note>The effectes of chastitie haue bene ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye strange. <hi>Aemylia</hi> a virgin was iudged of the <hi>Romanes</hi> to be scarce ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, which when it came to her eares, shée prayed vnto <hi>Vesta</hi> after this maner: <hi>Vesta,</hi> thou preseruer of this noble cittie <hi>Rome,</hi> if I for this thirtie yeares, which tyme I haue geuen mine attendance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thy rites, and ceremonies, If I saye, I haue bene faithfull vnto thée, as becommeth a virgin, geue some token of the same, that all the <hi>Romanes</hi> maye witnesse what I am.

He saith a good man may hurt, if he be iniured. But when he dooth
<pb facs="tcp:16599:171"/>
hurt it must néeds follow that he lose the name of a good man. For it is no lesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil to requite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is to offer an iniurie. For from whence doo fraies, fighting and contentions arise, but only because that wicked men laying aside all Patience, séeke occasion to mooue troubles and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults? Now if against their madnes, a man wil set patience (then which vertue nothing dooth better become a man) all troubles wil easely be extinguished, and quencheth the same euen as water put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out fire. But if Impatience be set a against misuse, it is so far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beeing quen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ched, that it ministreth matter of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall debate, and euen as it were Oile poured into fire it raiseth such a flame, as not a riuer, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> effusion of much blood can extinguish the same. And therefor ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry necessary is patience, whiche prudent <hi>Cicero</hi> would take from a vertuous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This only vertue is the cause that no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils be doone: and if euery man had this gift, no wickednesse nor deceit would be in the world. And therefore what can be more contrary to the nature of an honest man, then to submit him selfe to Angre that can dispoile him not onely of the name of a good man, but also will not
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16599:171"/>
suffer him to be called a man. For as <hi>Tullie</hi> him self saith, and truely, to hurt another,<note place="margin">Angre.</note> is not according to mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For bothe beasts if you mooue them ether with heele or horne wil set against you: and Serpents and sauage Beasts wil not trouble you, except they perceiue you persecute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to slay them, and (that we may return to the examples of men) ignoraunt and foolish men, when they are hurte and iniured, are led with a blinde and vnresonable fury to hurt and requite iniuries doon vnto them. And therefore in what shall a wise and good differ from a foolish and wicked man, but onely that he hath a singular patience which fooles want: but onely that he can asswage his anger, which those whiche haue not grace and goodnes cannot bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle? But forsooth this thing deceiued him, because when he speake of vertue in what quarrel soeuer he ouercame, he supposed that same to be vertue, and could not perceiue that a man submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him self to Anger, and fauouring those affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which he should withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and so rushing in to what parte so euer wickednes did prououke him, did vio<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>late the office of vertue.</p>
               <p>

                  </note> Nay (if <hi>Plato</hi> may in in this thing be credited) of all the giftꝭ of God Iustice is principal.

By whiche sentence of the Poets, no other thing is ment, but that Iustice is a diuine and celestiall vertue, which if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, they might liue quietly from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and happely to their harts desire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tullie</hi> confirmes that of <hi>Plato</hi> and the Poets,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cicero de legibus.</hi>
                  </note> and saith, that of all thingꝭ contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Books and volumes of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie nothing is more to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then that which giueth vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand we are borne to Iustice. But the excellencie of this vertue wil be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perceiued, if we cal into remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of how many kindes iustice dooth consist. The Philosophers make foure sortes of Iustice,<note place="margin">Iustice of iiij. kindes</note> and say that all Iustice is either Celestiall, Naturall, Ciuil, or Iudiciall. The celestiall Iustice is that,<note place="margin">Celestiall Iustice.</note> whereby we are driuen to the confessing there is a God creator of all things, knowen of none perfectly, and as he is, but by his
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16599:174"/>
woorks, and yet knowing all things: whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ch is not only the Creator but the kéeper of all thingꝭ in their kinde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> destruction without whose care nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g is, hath béen, or can continue: which though he haue a care of all things created by him, yet moste especiall of man and therfore hath not onely endued him with reason and spéeches, wherby he may both conceiue aswell that whiche hath béene, is, or may be, and also vtter and expresse that which is conceiued vnto others, but also hath made him a beholder of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and not only hath indued him with reason, and with that gift of beholding the firmament (which no other creatures doo) but also hath brought all other things aswel senceles as hauing life: as Foules, fishes, and foure footed beasts, vnder his power either to kil or kéep them, and at his pleasure to vse them. So that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and celestiall iustice is a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sideration, and a dutiful acknowledging of Godꝭ omnipotencie, which Iustice had many Philosophers euen by the instinct of nature.<note place="margin">Naturall Iustice.</note> Natural Iustice is that which all people haue in them selues by nature, and is alwaies and in all places one and the same. Which is not only proper and
<pb facs="tcp:16599:175"/>
peculiar vnto man (as was the former celestiall Iustice) but also many brute Beasts doo participate the same. The properties of this Iustice are many as to haue a care of our selues, not wilfully to run into perils and dangers: Next to haue an affection towards them whiche moue of vs, as our children, and not to suffer them to be molested of any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Third<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, to reléeue our Parents, kinsmen and neighbours, if there be any in pouertie, and to helpe them when they be in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Lastly to heare good wil to all, and willingly to offend none. And there is almoste no beaste, and certainely there can be no man, which hath not these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res somtime in his minde, and dooth not thinck that he should first looue him selfe, then his wife and children, next his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, kinsemen and acquaintance, and lastly beare a generall good will vnto all men, and doo vnto euery manne, as hee would be doone vnto. And therfore it is called Naturall Iustice, because natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in man there be some sparkꝭ of vertue, and no man is so destitute of grace, but sometime or other (though he neuer herd of God and his threatnings to wicked li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers) dooth repent him of his wickednes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:16599:175"/>Now the Stoiks did not onely thinck Iustice to be naturall, but they thought vertue in generall to be nought els but an obsolute and perfect nature. And they iudged (as in the beginning of this Book we tolde) the chéefest happines not to swarue from the lawes of nature. And the ancient <hi>Academicks</hi> to this purpose defined iustice to be nothing els but a per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect knowledge of good and euil agréeing to naturall reason. By the which two kindes of Iustice, we sée that Iustice is often times referred aswel to our selues, as vnto others. So that they are much deceiued whiche say, that Iustice of all vertues is anothers good, and dooth those things all togither whiche are not profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him which dooth them, but vnto others to whome they are doon: and that it is no Iustice to helpe our selues. But that opinion is against the authoritie of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and reason, whiche any will graunt if he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> enter into his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science but a litle. Now to Ciuil Iustice:<note place="margin">Ciuil Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> 
                  <hi>Pomponius Laetus</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius laetus de legibus</hi>
                  </note> that Ciuile Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is made either by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of nature, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> statutes of the people, the consultations of Senators, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuises of princes or authoritie of graue &amp; wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb facs="tcp:16599:176"/>
So that ciuil Iustice is only among ciuil men, in common weles. <hi>Cicero</hi> defines the same to be an habit of the minde, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vnto euery man according to his d<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>INnocencie (according to the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tecions) is an habit of the minde,<note place="margin">Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> so wel framed that it wil hurt no man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by woord or déed.

any man though he might got much therby. <hi>Cicero</hi> therfore calles the same an affection of the minde, which wil not molest, iniury, nor hurt any man. This innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t man is he which feareth no man, no law, no witnes, accusar, iudge, or any but is a frée man, and by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his good conscience is out of the limits of the law. He wil be sure to giue vnto euery man his due right, and wil obey the authoritie of no man which wil commaund him to doo any thing that is not good, honest and vertuous. Now the vngodly perceiuing the same, conceiue by &amp; by secret hatred against them. And heerof it comes that innocent and iust men of all others are moste contemned, hated and persecuted: and they which liue moste vprightly and in the fear of God, are cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted idiots and fooles, and are iudged vnworthy to be in a common weale as <hi>Lactantius</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.<note place="margin">

Wel in this kinde of looue a new must be obserued. Héere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain may be mooued another question. Whether the looue of parents towardes their children be greater,<note place="margin">Whether the loue of parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their children be greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary.</note> then the looue of children towards their parents. Many reasons may be brought to prooue, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples to confirme either parte, some we haue alredy in this chapter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. But certain it is that the looue of pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:16599:187"/>
towards their children is greater and that is prooued by two reasons. The first is this: By how muche more any man knowes the thing which he looueth, then the thing knoweth him: by so much he looueth it better. But a father dooth better knowe the sonne, then the sonne dooth knowe the father: and therefore the father dooth looue him better. Again an Artificer dooth looue his woorkmanship, and the thing wrought by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woorkman. But the father is like a woorkman, and the sonne as the woorkmanship, and ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he dooth better looue his sonne, then his Sonne can fancie him.<note place="margin">Whether a father doth loue his chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren better then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it said that this naturall and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection dooth alwaies descend, but it neuer ascends: Againe it may be mooued whether a father dooth fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy better his children then the mother. It is thought that the mother dooth. And the philosophers prooue it by this reason. They whiche take the greater paines in getting any thing, looue that whiche is gotten more intirely, then they whiche take lesse paines. But the mother dooth with greater paines attain to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then the father: and therfore her looue muste néeds be greater.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16599:188"/>Now to the last parte of this naturall freendship. Reason willeth that as first we should abooue all thinges looue God,<note place="margin">Kindred.</note> our parents, Contrie, wiues, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: so next we are bound in conscience to make much of those which are of our kin and acquaintance.

And therefore it is a great cause of looue and amitie among men to be vnder the same Princes, to be in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to the same lawes, to be of one so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie, of one Contrie, Cittie,<note place="margin">Common freendship.</note> to be of one religion. &amp;c.

               <p>The last kinde of fréendship is called Sociall or Fellowly fréendship. The

cause of which fréendship is only perfect,<note place="margin">Felowly freendship.</note> and therfore it differeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these abooue recited kinds of Amitie. For as the one hath pleasure for her end, and the other vertue: so this hath profit. Such is the fréendship of crafts men and merchants: but this dooth continue but for a time as the first. And therfore when pleasure is gone, looue is none: and farewel goodwil (say they) when goods are consumed. Of this fréendship <hi>Cicero</hi> wrote notably, to this purpose. This woord looue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce freendship is deriued,<note place="margin">

                  </note> is charie and déere: which fréendship if we imbrace onely for our owne sakes and profit, not for his whome we looue and beare good will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, then is it not to be called Amitie, but a certain chopping and chaunging of good wil for gaines, and fréendly woords, for profit and commoditie. After which sorte we should looue our féeldes and pasture ground, and our beasts &amp; cattell, because we hope to receiue profit of them, but the fréendship amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men should be free with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out hope of reaping earthly commoditie. But if we only beare goodwill in hope to receiue gain, if there be no kindenes whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che is cause of fréendship, and makes the same of her owne nature, or for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:16599:192"/>
cause to be desired, there is no dout, but that we may prefer groues and la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds before freends. For they bring moste pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to their owners. And therefore it is méet that he which would be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted my true and faithfull fréend, should looue me for mine owne sake, not for my goods &amp; ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. And again <hi>Cicero</hi> in his seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d book <hi>De Finibus,</hi> declareth the nature of this freendship in these woords: what place hath fréendship, or who can be a freend vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which dooth not loue his fréend only for his fréends sake? And to Looue (from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce fréendship is deriued) what other thing is it,<note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But some wil say (saith he) I followe gain and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. And then shall your fréendship conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as long as you reape commoditie.</p>
               <p>And therefore true is that saying of a learned man, It is hard in prosperitie to knowe whether our fréends doo looue vs for our owne sakes, or for our goods:<note place="margin">Aduersitie tryes a freend.</note> but aduersitie proues a fréend. For neither doth prosperitie manifest a fréend, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uersitie bide a flatterer. And thus much bréefely of Ciuil fréendship. Of all these
<pb facs="tcp:16599:193"/>
kindes of ciuil amitie, but one can truely be commmended (for praise belongeth on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to vertue) the other be necessary (for without them no estate can florish) but they are not of continuance. Now to the last kinde of fréendship.</p>

For hospitalitie should be only for the releef of suche as are pinched with pouertie, which noble men are not troubled with: for in any place they may haue to their desire all things. Again a iust ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil doo nothing but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is a benefit: but it is no benefit, which is doon in hope to be wel rewarded afterwards.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is ment, that he whiche wil bestowe a benefit, must giue it cheerfully and wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lingly. For the nature of man is suche, as it thinks not that wel giuen, whiche is not willingly giuen. Heerof is it said, that that is a double benefit which is quickly bestowed. And how much it is lingred be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it is bestowed, so muche it léeseth of his grace when it is bestowed. We had rather leese all, then long for a thing. The Poets therfore to declare the dutie bothe of him whiche will be a benefact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and him whiche hath receiued a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, haue giuen these names to the Graces. The two first tel how he should behaue him selfe that is adorned with a good turne. He must truely acknowledge a good turn, without hypocrisie: and iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requite the same without partialitie: and also neuer commit that a benefit fréendly bestowed,<note place="margin">The dutie of a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.</note> be vnkindely forgot.</p>

               <p>The barenes of the Graces is also a signification of his dutie which wil be a benefactor. For he must not only doo the same willingly and spéedily, but also sim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply and to a good purpose. For he which conferreth a benefit, for any other intent then for meere goodwil is no benefactor, but a malefactor. And therefore saieth <hi>Aiax,</hi> mentioned of <hi>Euripides,</hi>

A benefactor must therfore giue cheerfully, speedily and simply. They are linked togither and yet but two at once not altogither: wherby is signified again th'office of him whiche hath receiued a good turn.

               <p>What is Pietie, but onely a gratefull goodwil towards our parents?
