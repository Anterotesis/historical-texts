            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS the Wings and Motion of <hi>Time,</hi> are uſher'd into the Univerſe with various Changes; ſo is the Creature transformed daily from his Rational Intellects, to an irrational ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality of Dumb Creatures. O monſtrous! What Chriſtians become Beaſts; what a ſad Age do we live in? Woful Experience makes it deplorably evident: Iron ſides, in Iron Times, ſuits well with a true Chriſtians Qualifications; but Satanical Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Backſliders from the Truth, carries a Badge of Infamy, aſwel againſt the Glorious and Inviſible Creatour, as againſt His admired Works of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Such <hi>Atheiſtical Spirits,</hi> are the <hi>Original Riſe,</hi> from whence the enſuing ſubject takes its Diſcourſe; and true it is, that the Judgments of God upon Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Inchanters, are clearly manifeſted by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Examples, where the Lord ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer a Witch to live,</hi> Exod. 22.18. <hi>There ſhall not be found amongſt you one that uſeth Divination, or an obſerver of Times, or an Inchanter, or a Witch, or a Charmer, or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulter with Familiar Spirits, or Wizards, or a Necromancer. For all that do theſe things are an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Deut. 18.10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Many ſuch like Inſtances, may here intervene by way of ſimilie to the people called Quakers; and as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51253:3"/>
               <hi>Conſtantine</hi> forbad all to ask Counſel at Witches, or to uſe the help of Charmers, <hi>upon pain of Death</hi>; ſo ſhal I admoniſh all people from adhering to <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> which like ſo many <hi>Muſhrooms</hi> (in this Age) ſpring up in an inſtant, deviating from the Truth, and fancy a New Light, proceeding onely from the Prince of Darkneſs; as manifeſtly appears in the caſe of <hi>Mary Philips,</hi> who falling from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Society of <hi>Robert Dickſon,</hi> and <hi>Jane Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naway,</hi> two unrefined Quakers; but after ſome few weeks expired, ſhe declined their ways, utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing them, and deteſting their actions; inſomuch, that they adjudged her to be in a Reprobate Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not worthy of an Earthly Being; but rather a transfiguration from the Glorious Image ſhe was created in; which (poor Soul) ſhe was ſoon diveſted of, even in the Night, as ſhe betook her ſelf to reſt with her Husband, being bewitched or inchanted out of the Room where ſhe lay, and transformed into the perfect ſhape of a Mare, and ſo rid from <hi>Dinton</hi> to a Town within four miles of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where a Company of ſeeming Quakers were met: But upon the aforeſaid Inchanting-Witches alighting off, and hanging the Bridle upon the Pails, the ſnafflle (or Bitt) came out of her mouth, and miraculouſly ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in her created Form and Likeneſs, to the great aſtoniſhment of the Neighbours, who beheld this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected change with abundance of admiration; and upon the Womans declaring of her ſelf, and the ſtate of her Condition, ſhe went along with ſome Officers to the Meeting, and coming into the Room, ſhe point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the two Quakers, ſaying, <hi>This is the Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that bewitcht me</hi>: Whereupon they were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and carryed before a Juſtice, who committed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51253:3"/>
them to ſafe Cuſtody, there to remain till the Aſſiſes, which on <hi>Thurſday</hi> laſt began at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and on <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> they were brought to Trial, where the Woman that was bewitcht made Oath againſt them, and ſhewed her hands and feet, which were lamentably bruiſed, and changed as black as a Coal, her ſides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo exceedingly rent and torn, juſt as if they were ſpur-gal'd, and her ſmock all bloudy: Evident ſigns of her ſad ſufferings; yet utterly denied by the priſoners, who at laſt were cleared, notwithſtanding the Grand Jury finding the Bill of Indictment.</p>
            <p>But to demonſtrate more plainly, That there are Magicians and Witches, is evident by theſe two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Examples; to wit, <hi>Cleomedes</hi> a great Magician in <hi>Rome,</hi> having practiſed the death of many little Children, the Parents of them at laſt ſought revenge on him, who to ſhun their Fury, ſhut himſelf cloſe up in Coffer: but when they had broke it open, the Devil had carried away the Magician.</p>
            <p>The Governour of <hi>Maſcon,</hi> a great Magician, as he was at diner with ſome company, was ſnatched away by the Divel, hoiſted up into the air, and carried three times about the Town, to the great aſtoniſhment of the Inhabitants, to whom he cried for help, but all in vain.</p>
            <p>Thus it is evident, that as there are <hi>Magicians</hi> and <hi>Witches</hi>; ſo are there divers of the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their hands to the forbidden Tree, and catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the fruit of it; yea, this off-ſpring of <hi>Eve</hi> long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the greeneſt Apples, the precocious knowledg of Events, and New Lights, before they come their juſt and perfect ripeneſs of maturity. And true it is, that there are ſome who can find no ſatisfaction, no Sabbath, no quiet in their preſent ſtate, and therefore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51253:4"/>
they would fain know what the next day, what the next year, what the next age will bring forth; in the higheſt proſperity they fear a mutation; in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt adverſity they are impatient for a change; and hence it comes to paſs, that futurity is the mark at which all level the arrows of their aſpiring thoughts. As for inſtance, the Jews who had the <hi>Urim</hi> &amp; <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> and Prophets of God to enquire of, yet ran a madding after Wizzards, and ſuch as had familiar ſpirits, had their falſe Prophets by hundreds; yea, and ſent to <hi>Baalzebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron,</hi> an Oracle of the Devils, to enquire; as in the life of <hi>Ahaziah</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>With how frequent and coſtly ſacrifices did the <hi>Graecians</hi> adore their Oracle-giving Deities, purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an anſwer with a <hi>Hetacomb,</hi> and with the bloud of a hundred dumb beaſts conju<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing their dumb De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, before the ſullen Fiends would vouchſafe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>To paſs by the ſeveral kinds of madneſs expreſſed in <hi>Geomancy,</hi> by Circles in the Earth; <hi>Pyromancy,</hi> by Fire; <hi>Hydromancy,</hi> by Water; <hi>Necromancy,</hi> by the Ghoſts of the Dead, we ſhall deſcend, and treat your view, to another Inſpection of the New Lights of theſe Dark Times; which appeass ſo viſible, that they may be diſcern'd as far as <hi>Norwich,</hi> where a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown Spirit, on Sabbath day laſt was a ſevennight, took the impudence to pull down his breeches on the Communion Table, and laid there his moſt odious and naſty burden: But obſerve and tremble at the Divine Vengeance; he was ſuddainly tormented with the griping in his guts; and lamentably roaring out, died within the ſpace of an hour or two. Will any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51253:4"/>
man now ſay, that this is a Generation of men indued with New Lights: Surely no; for what is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, than the proceeding of theſe Lights from the Prince of Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>And as there are ſome, who by their inchanted black Ribbons, tyed about the Creatures left Wriſt, gain many Proſelytes; ſo there are others who deny the Lords Day, charging the Miniſtry of <hi>England</hi> to be Antichriſtian, and yet ſeem to be ſtrict in the ways of Holineſs. I ſhall not therefore ſet bounds to other mens knowledge, nor circumſcribe them within the Circle of my own Ignorance; they may have Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, where I perceive no Star-light: yet take this along with you, that God often in Text-hand declares his Mind, in a Comet, a Blazing-ſtar, and other fiery Apparitions; and not by the vain-bablings of <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and <hi>Sorcers</hi>; Who may fitly be compared to the great Conjurer that <hi>Picus Mirandulae</hi> writes of in his time, <hi>viz.</hi> That promiſing a certain Prince he would preſent to him the ſiege of <hi>Troy,</hi> with <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> fighting together as when they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live: But as he was about his Conjurations, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil carried him away that he was never heard of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>To conclude, As the Jews and Heathens formerly, ſo many of the Quakers in theſe days, have been tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering about Futurities, how lawfully I cannot ſay, and pretend a Viſion ſeen in the Air, betwixt <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> figuratively preſenting the dividing of the City and <hi>Southwark</hi>; and of the Cities devolving and extinguiſhing in ſmoak.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51253:5"/>But doubtleſs, the beſt way is to acquieſce in Gods revealed Will; for He will have his Children in ſome ſenſe entertain Fortune by the day, chooſing gradually and leaſurely to diſcover the thoughts he hath concerning them, that he might keep them in a waiting and obebient poſture, in a poſture of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and expectation; not that I would have them with <hi>Anacreon</hi> cry out, <hi>Give me to day, let who will care for to morrow</hi>; or with the <hi>Stoicks</hi> lazily expect the blind ſtroak of a conceited unavoidable Fate; but u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all lawful and probable means, endeavour their Countries, and in it their own future good.</p>
