            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He valiant Coronell after his lawfull diſpatch from the Generall, and the obteining of his letters patents from the Generall, and monie for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of that number of ſouldiers, appointed to his gouernement, hee muſt with all diligence chooſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt ſo manie Captaines as hée ſhall haue neede of, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing iii.C. men for a company, which is a conuenient number: For if the number were diuided into ſmaller com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, the more money would be ſpent vpon the officers. And beſides, where many diuiſions are: there happens the ſooner diſcord and diſorder. Thoſe Captaines would bee choſen of yeares and good experience, whereby they may the better execute their office, as otherwiſe too obtaine the loue of the ſouldiers, graunting vnto them ſufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie for the executing of al things apperteining to their charge. He muſt then deliuer vnto them equally ſo much mony as he hath receiued for the companies by preſt, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing that it be ſufficient for ſuch an effect, that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and officers may not be hindered by extraordinarie expenſes, and the ſouldiers to haue better liking of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronell, as otherwiſe to winne them to obedience, which is moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for men of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> calling. He muſt haue ſpeciall regard, that the Lords or principall officers, whoſe minds are addicted to auarice by their vnſatiable deſire of gaine, the good ſouldier be not anie waies hindered of his paie, which would do ſo much hurt to his good nature, without whom the Coronell can auaile little or nothing: and that he giue ſtraight charge that ſuch money as they receiue be laied out and ſpent with aduiſement and diſcretion. Hee muſt chooſe a Liuetenant of good experience, qualities, and behauiour, that hée maie the better attend on the charge of his owne companie: and beſides, too haue care of all the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18507:11"/>
bands apperteining to the Coronell. Then muſt he chooſe an enſigne bearer, who muſt be a worthy ſouldier, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of noble parentage, as otherwiſe gentle of behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, who of all the reſt of the officers muſt be ſuperior. Alſo he muſt chooſe the Sergeants, the maſters of the ſquares, droms and other officers, who muſt be of honeſt behauior and of great experience in their offices. He muſt appoint to his armed pikes his moſt valiant ſouldiers, who muſt bee gentlie vſed, ſhewing vnto them a chéerfull and good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which to them is moſt acceptable. Then muſt he chuſe a ſergeant maior who muſt bée a tried ſouldier and of great experience, and one who hath executed and profeſſeth the office: There belongeth to his office great aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to alter or remoue the armie, as ſometimes the ſtraightnes of time doth require, ſometimes the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of the place doth inforce, ſometimes the order in which the enimie is placed doth compell, yea and ſomtime ſome practiſe of his owne, or ſome deuiſe of his Coronell doth put into his head, whervpon great aduiſement would be taken, minding not further to ſpeake of it, but to refer it vntill I come vnto his owne office, where I will more amplie ſpeake of it. There muſt by him be appointed, a furrior or harbinger, who ſhall without rewards or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption lodge the whole companie of the Coronell, vſing his office honeſtlie and indifferentlie, without pleaſing of anie particular man. He muſt appoynt a generall Drum, which ſhall take care of the reſt of the Drums, who muſt be authoriſed to command the reſt of the Drums, hauing a care that they vſe obedience: and that euerie one do his part that belongeth to his office, as in ſounding the march, a call, the charge, the batteile, the retrait, &amp;c. Hee ought to prouide himſelf the beſt munition, fit for a coronels charge, as corſelets, pikes, caleuers, murrians, holberds, bils, gon-pouder, lead, match, and of al manner of victuals, the which ſhall be deliuered by the Sergeant maior. He muſt alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin the election y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Captaines haue made, &amp; of al their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18507:11"/>
officers throughout the companies, and if they be ſuch as ought to be, or not much worie, he may allow them and not otherwiſe. And it is to be vnderſtood that theſe and the like aduertiſements do make to appeare the very inſight of the conductor, whereas not being narrowlie looked vnto, the contrarie happens: It ſéemes not out of purpoſe that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery company haue <hi>12.</hi> hargubuſiers too ſerue on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, who being honeſt men, may do great ſeruice both on foot and horſ back, as often hath ben ſéene, as well in care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full following. kéeping or recouering of paſſages, as for the diſcouering the watch word of the enimies, and to caſt downe and leuell places the eaſier to make roods to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in manner of lighthorſmen: and for to conclude, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing theſe precepts by exerciſing thy ſouldiers often, ſhall bring them ſoone to experience the better to bée gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. He muſt procure that his officers diligently performe his commiſſions, and that faithfullie they make relation of euery particular thing that he may be enformed of all, and in eſpeciall that happens in wards, as well by daie as by night: for they going in circuite as apertaines vnto them, may wel perceiue what chanceth of any great importance. He ought carefullie and courteouſlie to exhibite to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Captaine great reuerence to honor him, obey him and faithfully counſel him: and for the performance of this, he muſt refuſe no trauaile, ſith that taking paines in cauſes of ſuch importance is very méet for men of his calling an office: for gaines and delicate pleaſures rather appertein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Subtile enimies approue to corrupt ſouldiers with gifts: but ſith the reward of truth is euerlaſting life, and the vntrue looſeth the fruitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall darkeneſſe, I truſt none of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triemen will learne the one for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: from the which God kéepe all good ſouldiers.

                  <hi>Heere begin the Articles wherevnto</hi> all ſouldiers which ſerue vnder Emperour, or any <hi>other King or Prince, ought to be ſworne vnto, and</hi> them to keepe and maintaine inuiolated at <hi>all times, and in all places, vpon</hi> ſuch paines as follow.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, yée ſhall be ſworne to be true, iuſt, and dutifull to his Lord and ſouereigne, and his graund Generall or chiefe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the field, to be tractable and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient vnto euerie officer placed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to rule ouer him, and to be readie both day and night to ſerue, whether it be by land or by water, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſeruice shall fall out and require. And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer doth repine or ſheweth diſobedience herein, of what degrée or condition ſo euer he be, he muſt be dulie puniſhed by the iudgement of the ſuperiours appointed for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Item, if there be any which ſhall blaſpheme the almightie God or his diuine word: let ſuch a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer be puniſhed with the loſſe of his life openlie, and to the terrour of the reſt let it be executed. For no doubt the plague of the higheſt will not depart from the houſe or tent of the blaſphemer. For how ſhould wée vſe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice indifferently vnto men, when we are content with ſilence to ſuffer ſuch iniurie to be committed againſt God? Therefore firſt ſtraightly puniſh the offences done againſt the liuing God, and hée will ſend thée wiſdome better to iudge the cauſes betwéene man and man.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:18507:25"/>3 Item, whenſoeuer any chieftaine or Captaine of any band, ſhall vpon vrgent cauſes appoint in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence any other whome hée ſhall thinke good, to ſupplie and execute his roome of Captaineſhip, euery man ought to follow and obey the ſaid deputie, with no leſſe care and diligence then they would the Captaine himſelfe, vpon paine of ſuch puniſhment as the Generall or his aſſignes ſhall appoint.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Item, that all ſouldiers muſt content themſelues with their places appointed, béeing ioyned togither in bandes, or ſeuerall without reſiſtance, whether it bée in marching, watching, incamping, or beſieging, béeing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo commaunded therevnto by the Captaine or other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, vpon ſuch paine as ſhall bée thought good by the Captaine.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Item, that euery ſouldier ſhall for his honour ſake, gladly fauour, and mercifully forbeare vnto the vttermoſt of his power, all women lying in childe bed, or béeing with childe, or lately deliuered from childe, to defend and ſuccour them from the rage of the cruell and rude ſouldiers or others, which followe the campe for ſpoile. Alſo it behooueth all Souldiers to defend all Miniſters, Prieſtes of godly calling, and all ſpirituall perſons. But now a daies they be the firſt to whome abuſe is offered, of what opinion or religion ſo euer they bée: but God no doubt, will iuſtly plague all ſuch before they bée aware, and when they leaſt ſuſpect it. Alſo they ſhall defend all aged men and women: neither ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moleſt and hinder them: if otherwiſe, vpon paine of loſſe of his or their liues.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Item, that euery ſouldier ſhall ſerue, and is by the lawe of armes bound by long cuſtome to ſerue thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie daies for euery moneth, and after that rate hée ſhall

               <p n="8">8 Item, if there be any ſouldier or ſouldiers in marching breake his or their raie without iuſt occaſion enforcing them, then the Prouoſt marſhall, Lieuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the band or Sergeant ſhall compell him or them with violence to kéepe his or their rankes in order: and if ſo bée that he or they ſo diſordered, do chaunce in this caſe to be ſlaine, there ſhall no man be blamed by his or their deaths by the law of the field, for by ſuch diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red people the whole armie may be in daunger of ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the enimie.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Item if that by the appointment of the chiefe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the hoaſt there be a battaile fought, and that by the mightie power of God, the victorie be obteined on your ſide, the lawe of armes is ſuch, that if any ſouldier hath receiued his moneths wages afore hand, he ſhall be diſcharged of the ſame, neither ſhall he ſerue any longer for the ſaid wages, after the day of victorie, neither ſhall owe any thing for it, but he ſhall be ſet frée from that moneths ſeruice.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Item, if it chaunce that in time of ſkirmiſh or in any other conflict with the enimie, ſome one do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture to flie and runne away from his fellowes, if in the flying, his Captaine or any other ſouldier by ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at him, or by ſtriking at him chaunce to kill him, they ſhall incurre no daunger for ſo dooing. And if ſuch a flier chaunce to eſcape at that time, and afterwardes bée taken, let him according to the lawe of armes ſuffer
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18507:26"/>
death for the ſame: for one ſuch a recreant may bee the ouerthrowing of a great multitude.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Item, it ſtandeth with the lawe of armes that each common ſouldier ſhall bée ſworne that they wil not haue amongſt themſelues anie priuate counſels, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies or conuenticles, vpon paine of the loſſe of their liues.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Item, there ſhall no ſouldier neither in time of marching, nor during the time of their incamping holde or kéepe anie whiſpering or talke, or ſecretlie conuey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie letters vnto their aduerſaries, without licenſe from the chiefe Captaine vpon paine of the loſſe of his life.</p>

               <p n="14">14 Item, that no ſouldier ſhall bée ſuffered to bée of a ruffinlike behauiour, either to prouoke or to giue anie blowe or thruſt, or otherwiſe wilfullie ſtrike with his daggar, to iniurie anie his fellowe ſouldiers with anie weapon, whereby mutines manie times enſueth, vppon paine of the loſſe of his life.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Item, if anie one beareth hatred or malice, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie euill will for anie occaſion done vnto him, &amp; ſo ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him, he looſeth his hande, if otherwiſe he ſéeketh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, then by lawe he looſeth his life.</p>

It hath lately béene vſed with more fauour of life, as ſuch an offender to looſe his hande, but it is the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord chiefe Generall, in whoſe handes lyeth both life and death of offenders, after their arraignment and iuſt condemnation.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Item, the like lawe is againſt the officer and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of anie band in the campe, if he ſtrike anie ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without ſuch occaſion as is permitted him in the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to doe.</p>

               <p n="21">
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:18507:27"/>21 Item, there ſhall no ſouldiers or other men, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure or ſtirre vp anie quarrell with anie ſtraunger, that is of anie other nation and ſuch as ſerue vnder one head and Lord with them neither in their gaming or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe vpon paine of the loſſe of his life.</p>

               <p n="25">25 Item, if there bée anie founde, that hath entered his name vnder two Captaines, and hath taken wages, armour and weapons before hand, ſuch a perſon ſhall bée taken for a periured man, and ſhall by the law of armes for the ſame looſe his life.</p>
               <p n="26">26 Item, if anie that hath a place appointed him by the harbinger or officers for his tent or lodging, hée
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18507:28"/>
muſt hold himſelfe content withall, neither ſhall he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt anie man lodging within his tent, or other lodging at anie time for anie occaſion vppon paine of the chiefe Captaines diſpleaſure, and ſuch puniſhment as hée ſhall thinke moſt fit for the offence.</p>

a little ſpace, ſo that by the ſtraightneſſe and facilitie of inlarging, thou be not conſtrayned to extend thy ſelfe into too much length, which faſhion of marchings ſeemes to giue power to the enemie to aſſault commoudiouſly their aduerſaries, and according to the occaſion to hurt them, he knowing to bee taken from them the commoditie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues, foraſmuch either with more largeneſſe comming againſt thee, the which is wont to happen both the hornes being compaſſed, it is like that he ſhall eaſilie diſorder and put thee to flight, or els giuing charge on the flanke in the midſt of thy battaile, hauing alreadie broken thine order, ſodeinly ſtop thy men from being able to goe forward, being cloſed in the araies of their enemies: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mynding to retyre in a mayne battaile, and to turne to reſiſt, they ſhall bee able to doe little good, as thoſe that haue vſed ſuch a maine battaile, which for want of thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is nothing ſtrong, but altogether weake. Alſo if the enemie ſhould charge thee on the Rereward, thou ſhalt be brought to the very ſame neceſſitie, becauſe thou ſhalt bee ſo compaſſed as thy fronts ſhall not be able to ſuccour the laſt, or the laſt to ſuccour the firſt. For the which thing it is alwaies better and more ſure and eaſier, to gouerne the bands that march, cloſe and ſquare, then thinne and long, eſpecially, foraſmuch as to an armie that marcheth long, oft tymes happens that of ſome thing ſeene doubtfull and vncertaine, there groweth ſodeinly feare and terrour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſometymes it hath chaunced that men deſcending from high and hillie places, into the plaine, to places expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and open, and the formoſt ſeeing the laſt of the ſame band by a great diſtaunce to come after, ſuppoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bée aſſaulted of ſome Ambuſh of enemies, it hath bene ſeene, they haue ſodeinly turned to fight, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards no otherwiſe then enemies, with their owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyons, gone together by the eares. The victualles, the cariages, and all the reſt of prouiſion, I iudge ſhould bée placed in the midſt of the armie, that without great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18507:70"/>
ſuch things may bee caried and conducted after the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: but if it ſhall be otherwiſe the hindmoſt part would be garded and defended of the moſt valiant Souldiers, as in the fronts, becauſe that at vnwares may happen many things, thy Lighthorſmen going before inueſtigating and ſpying where they may paſſe, hauing occaſion to paſſe by Mountaines, Woods, places cloſed with Hilles and moſt great Deſarts, becauſe the enemie many tymes by opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie will lay an Ambuſh priuely by the paſſage to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault his aduerſarie, which little thereof taking heede, hath eaſily broken and brought them to vtter decay, the which Ambuſhments if the conductor by way of explorators ſhal foreſee with a little paine, hauing preuented the counſaile of the enemie, may get him a moſt great name of prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and likewiſe ſaue his Armie. And as for the Plaines thou with thyne owne eyes maiſt ſee a farre off, foraſmuch as in the day duſt moued and lifted vp into the aire, doth ſhew the mouing and ſtirring of the enemie, and in the night the fires and flames ſignifieth their Camp to be nere. When thy men are to be conducted and not to fight, thou oughteſt to remoue by day, if peraduenture ſome thing do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine thée, for the which thou thinkeſt it good to goe in haſt to come before thyne enemie, where in déede for ſuch occaſion thou mayſt remoue by night; ſo that thou knowe it may ſafely bee done to fight with the enemie. Leade thy men not in haſte but ſoftly, and inforce them not to make too long a iourney, foraſmuch as labour taken before men doe come to fight, is ſeene moſt oftentimes vaynly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and waſt the ſtrength of their bodies. And marching in the Countrey of thy frends, it is néedfull to commaund thy ſouldiers that in no maner of wiſe they touch or marre any thing, but rather altogether to refraine, conſidering that Souldiers hauing weapons and libertie to doe what ſhall pleaſe them, will fauour nothing, eſpecially, for that the ſight of things that pleaſe men, out of doubt is woone moſt daungerouſly to leade ignoraunt and vnwarie men

For in great conflicts, ſeldome is found together both good counſell and ſtoute hearts, minding not too enterpriſe this battell in hope of mans power, for then had you reaſon wee ſhould not giue battell, ſeeing the great multitude in reſpect of vs. For as you ſaie, the waightie affaires, of a publike weale, ſhould not bee vnaduiſedlie committed too the vncerteine of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: the which hath cauſed the King my Maiſter to apoint me in this daungerous and perilous warres. Firſt, truſting that on our part there remaineth Iuſtice, and ſith God is the ſame onelie Iuſtice, I truſt aſſuredlie he will giue mee the victorie in this perillous conflicts, for Iuſtice auaileth princes more that they haue, then the men of Warre doe which they lead. Wherefore ſith our cauſe is iuſt, and that we haue God the onelie Iudge thereof on our ſides, mee thinks no worldlie feare ſhould make vs ceaſe to giue the battell: for I ſhould ſhow my ſelfe to be of ſmall faith, and alſo blaſpheme God, ſaying, hee were of ſmall Iuſtice, for

God ſheweth his power there, where the fraileneſſe of man hath leaſt hope. Then ſince by the King our Maiſter and Gouernour, we are appointed and procured to come to this warre, I haue determined my moſt louing Companions and fellow Souldiers to enter in battell, and valiantlie to aduenture my life with you: and if I periſh therein, I ſhall be ſure it ſhall be for the ſaluation of my ſoule, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of my perſon, for to die through Iuſtice is not to die, but to change death for life: and thus doing, if I looſe my life, yet I looſe not my honour, and all this conſidered, I doe that which to my Prince and the Common-wealth I am bound. For to a Prince it were great infamie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, the quarrell being his owne, ſhould by the bloud of others ſéeke reuenge, minding this daie to trie in battel, whether the pleaſure or will of the liuing God bee to giue vs victorie, the which maie bee a warning to others of the great wrong offered vs: if otherwiſe he ſuffer vs to periſh, the ende of the ſword of the enimie, is but the ſcourge of our offences. The beſt I ſee therefore in this matter to be done, is that we confeſſe our ſelues vnto the celeſtial God, preparing our ſelues to receiue our redéemer, euery man to pardon and forgiue his brother, if hee haue done wrong or iniurie vnto him, for oftentimes though the demaund of the warres be iuſt, yet many miſhaps befal therin, through the offences of thoſe which purſue and follow the ſame.</p>

Wherefore horſemen art to be accompted as ſeconde, and not as ſuperiour or principall of the fielde, becauſe horſemen cannot goe as footemen in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie place, being ſlower then the footemen to obey, when it is requiſite to alter the order: foraſmuch, as if it bée néedefull either going forward, to turne backeward, or turning backwarde, to goe forwarde, or to moue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſtanding ſtill, or going to ſtande ſtill, without doubt, the Horſe can not doo it ſo readelie as the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>The horſemen can not béeing with violence diſorde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, returne in their orders, but with great, difficulty, the which the footemen doo moſt eaſelie and quicklie.</p>
               <p>Beſides this it happeneth manie times that a valiant man ſhall be vpon a vile horſe, and a coward vppon a good, whereby it followeth that theſe euill matching of ſtomakes, makes diſorder.</p>
               <p>Neither is it to be meruailed at, that a bande of footmen ſuſteineth al violence of horſes, for that a horſe is a beaſt, and knoweth the perils, and with an ill will, will enter vpon the Pike: &amp; if you conſider what force maketh them goe forwarde, and what holdeth them backwarde, you ſhall perceiue the ſame to be greater which kéepeth them back, then that which maketh them goe forwards: for that the ſpurre maketh them goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the Pike and Sword kéepeth them backe, ſo that it muſt néedes be, that footemen are moſt inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſuperiour to horſes.</p>

For to make warres to haue peace is Chriſtianitie, and to trouble the peace by making warres vniuſtly, is Tyrannie.
