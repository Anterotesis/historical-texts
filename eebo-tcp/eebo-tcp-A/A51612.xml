         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WHat means this thick ill-ſcent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miſt? What Noiſe is that? Who's there? Ah! Lightning, and at this Cold Seaſon! Confuſion! What's that I ſee? Bleſs me! I ſhall learn to Pray if this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues: Heavens! A Man in my Chamber at this time of Night! I am loſt! undone! 'tis my Executioner! Speak what! what want'ſt thou? Stay, ſure I ſhould know that Face, pale as it is! See! he approaches! he beckons! aſſiſt me this time, Hell and Impudence! I'll ſtand, ſince I am prepar'd for the worſt that Fare can offer! Ha! by that Razor it muſt be he, 'tis <hi>Eſſex</hi>! See! he knows his Name! he comes up! Speak! ſpeak! VVhat wilt thou?</p>

               <p>Yes, 'tis I, the moſt Unfortunate <hi>Eſſex</hi>! VVell, reſtleſs <hi>Syſiphus,</hi> will thy unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Malice ne're have an end? Thou haſt bin the common troubler of Mankind all thy Life; and now thou art contriving a Legacy; which, like <hi>Pandora</hi>'s Box, will leave them all in a freſh confuſion at thy Death,</p>

               <p>Your Ghoſtſhip takes a Liberty which your Lordſhip would have forbore: But why <hi>Syſiphus,</hi> pray <hi>Sir</hi>? have I, like him, roul'd my Stone in vain? Shall one little misfortune blaſt the Glory of all my former Triumphs? Have my Projects been uſeleſs, or my Malice ineffectual? VVhy, this very Minute am I upon a deſign ſhall not only re-purchaſe my loſt Liberty and Honors, but, like the Gordian Knot, ſhall puzzle the wiſeſt of their Heads to unfold it.</p>

               <p>Horror and Confuſion! Thou mak'ſt me, though a Ghoſt, tremble at thy Prodigious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence. Are not thy Eyes then, Curſt wretch, already ſatisfied with thy yet reaking <hi>Weſtern</hi> Cruelties, nor thy Ears tired with the hollow Groans of the Fatherleſs and VViddows? Could not thy boundleſs ſwelling Thoughts of falſe vain Glory, fix in the Enjoyment of Riches and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, without thy Prodigious Contrivances to diſturb the Peace of all the <hi>Chriſtian World</hi>? VVhat would'ſt thou have, or whether would'ſt thou tend? haſt thou no remorſe for thy poor Oppreſſed Country, nor care for thy own future welfare? VVill neither paſt Examples, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Dangers warn thee of the miſerable Eſtate of thoſe who ſerve the ends of wicked Men? Look here wretch, (<hi>ſhewing him his Throat</hi>) and tremble at the Fate of thoſe, who have forſaken <hi>God, Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> to lay the bloody Foundation of an unſtable Glory: Remember <hi>Eſſex,</hi> wretch, remember <hi>Eſſex.</hi>

               <p>This Advice, my Lord, runs very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary at leaſt to all the latter Tranſactions of your Life. Is it poſſible then that the Grave can have ſuch a ſtrong Operation upon a Mans Fancy, and in ſo little a time alter his Opinion? You Dy'd, with Submiſſion to your Lordſhip, in the general Opinion, more apprehenſive of a ſhameful Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, than penitent for your objected Crimes.</p>

Beware thoſe means thou uſeſt for thy Safety, prove not thy utmoſt Danger. I fondly Dreamt, Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Diſcovery would melt the Sword of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice into Mercy: But ah! that Charm that lull'd the wrath of my Offended Maſter, waken'd the Fears and Malice of my more powerful Foes: An <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ruſſian, and a dread Command, ſoon let me know my Error Fear and Repentance are not ſafe to be truſted with a Prince's Secrets: Nor had <hi>Coleman</hi> bin ventur'd to the place of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, but that they found a way to ſend him off between <hi>Jeſt</hi> and <hi>Earneſt.</hi>

               <p>I muſt confeſs, under the <hi>Roſe,</hi> my Lord, 'twas generally whiſper'd, more Hands than your own were employ'd to ſign your Paſs; but as the Circumſtances of Time and Perſons are alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I have reaſon to hope for better ſucceſs. My Crimes are indeed every way Superiour, and my deſigns more Barbarous; I have had Murders, Fellons, and Treaſons as my Boſom Friends: I have Laught and Ridiculed all fear of God; and to my Ambition and Covetouſneſs; have, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt remorſe, Sacrificed the Laws and Liberties of my Native Country; nay, being not content with the preſent fraud and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I encouraged, I have, (oh Prodigie!) endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to entail <hi>Slavery</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> on the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for ever. 'Twas I alone could ſwear the reaking Circumſtances of our Young <hi>Perkin</hi>; 'twas I alone promoted and ſet up that <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Court of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Commiſſion, to Scourge the Clergy and Haraſs the People; 'twas I alone could reſolve all the known Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, fixt and Fundamental Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into the Arbitrary will of the <hi>King</hi>: You may talk of <hi>Iriſh Ruſſians,</hi> and <hi>French Dragoons, Popiſh Conſpiracies,</hi> and <hi>Private Aſſaſſins,</hi> I think I have bid as fair for my Honor and Cauſe as any of them; If that Puny Raſcal that burnt a Heatheniſh Temple at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> could hope to be fam'd to Poſterity, What may not I expect, that have already ſorely ſhaken and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd the final deſtruction of the Church of God!
