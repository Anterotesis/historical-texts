            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Some ſcattered ends of it they find, and by it wet deſires,</l>
            <l>Which ſoone are loſt or elſe doth fall, below thoſe heavenly fires,</l>
            <l>Content, content each man doth cry, but that is it alone</l>
            <l>Which dwelleth in eternity, where joyes are all in one,</l>
            <l>Where all things lovely have their riſe,</l>
            <l>Their fountaine and their ſpring,</l>
            <l>Upon this Mountain there doth ſit, the Potent mighty King,</l>

            <l>His throne alone (ſurrounded) is with honours higheſt praiſe.</l>
            <l>If you will know his name, he is call'd the Ancient of dayes;</l>
            <l>Who is the ſtock &amp; root of good, where ſweetneſſe loſeth meaſure,</l>

            <l>And dwell for ever in this ſight, where myſteries are made known.</l>
            <l>Then whatſoever thou underſtand'ſt doth ſure become thine own:</l>
            <l>If there thou findeſt Wiſdomes ſeat, and ſearcheſt out her ſpring,</l>
            <l>The ſtreames of glory ſhe brings forth, will crowne thee as a king,</l>
            <l>Who knoweth what power, what force ſhe hath?</l>
            <l>None yet withſtood her arme,</l>
            <l>Who ever fled into her bower, and by it purchas'd harme;</l>

            <l>There's roome enough, thy thoughts may play,</l>
            <l>Thy game will ſtill thee pleaſe,</l>
            <l>Allbonds by Law are there cut off, thy work it is thy eaſe,</l>
            <l>The heighth, the depth, the length, the breadth, I am alone can find,</l>
            <l>He knowes it well, and by this light refreſheth ſtill his mind:</l>
            <l>All things in him deſired are, and all maintaine deſires,</l>
            <l>Love ſtill doth reſt within his breſt, and kindles holy fires,</l>
            <l>Who ever ſaw (and loved him not) the beauties of his face,</l>
            <l>And if thoſe beames on them did ſmile,</l>
            <l>They cloathed were with grace:</l>
            <l>And then like Princes they did ſtand, moſt comely in his ſight,</l>
            <l>Their lovely looks doth him perſwade, in them to take delight.</l>
            <l>And if in ſuch he takes content, which are but as a land</l>
            <l>From whence the crop is cut away, and ſome few yeares doth ſtand,</l>
            <l>What reſt, what joy, what high ſolace, hath he in fulneſſe ſtore,</l>

And theſe he ſets before his view, for ever to be ſeene;</l>
            <l>In all his dayes there's no decayes, each thing is new and greene:</l>
            <l>The life he lives is called love, and doth his fill enjoy,</l>
            <l>He walkes along in pathes moſt ſweet, where none can him annoy:</l>
            <l>Security it is the rock upon the which he ſtands,</l>
            <l>And there in triumph doth he reign, and bindes all others hands;</l>
            <l>His crown is this, he knowes his ſtrength, the armies of his power,</l>
            <l>Are quickly gathered into one, and ready at an houre;</l>
            <l>He knows his enemies where they lie, their ſcowts &amp; all their train,</l>
            <l>Their plots do make him melody, by theſe he ſees them ſlain.</l>
            <l>He works and none moleſteth him, but forthwith gives him way,</l>
            <l>His praiſe his enemies brings to light, in heart tho they ſay nay.</l>
            <l>Who would not lie within his breſt, his counſels for to know,</l>
            <l>And ſee how powers do there combine, his foes to overthrow:</l>
            <l>If there thou ſtay, thou ſure ſhalt ſee the Godhead round him flow,</l>

            <l>Himſelf theſe excellencies are to help him at his need;</l>
            <l>Life is the chiefeſt of his ſtrength, love joynes it ſelfe to either,</l>
            <l>There truth and holineſſe are met and mingle both together.</l>
            <l>Light comprehendeth all the ſumme, and for all maketh way,</l>
            <l>That ſo eternity may ſeeme, but as one pleaſant day,</l>
